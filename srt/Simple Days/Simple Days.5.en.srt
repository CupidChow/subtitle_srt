19
00:02:12,456 --> 00:02:13,416
Coming.

20
00:02:18,217 --> 00:02:19,057
Who is it?

21
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:20,896
Hello, Shanya.

22
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:22,296
Why are you here?

23
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:24,937
Is this a nice surprise or what?

24
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,337
I came to Shanghai for Mother's Day.

25
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:32,657
My dear brother-in-law,
you're so energetic.

26
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:35,217
You always look so handsome.

27
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,217
Your sister is here.

28
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:45,617
We need more food.

29
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:46,416
Sure.

30
00:02:48,337 --> 00:02:49,097
Dali.

31
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:51,337
Da...

32
00:02:57,057 --> 00:02:58,777
Wasn't he a manager before?

33
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:01,016
Why is he afraid of talking to people?

34
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:03,497
Let me tell you,

35
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:06,576
nowadays people like him
are called introverts.

36
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:09,896
Dali is not afraid of talking to people.

37
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:11,736
He's afraid of talking to you.

38
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:13,617
Didn't you come for Mother's Day?

39
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:15,937
Why come to our place
instead of Qianniu's?

40
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:19,337
Qianniu only rented a single room.
It's not big enough.

41
00:03:19,337 --> 00:03:21,136
Staying with you guys works fine for me.

42
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:23,217
During the day,
when the young couple goes to work.

43
00:03:23,217 --> 00:03:25,856
I can give you a hand
with house chores, right?

44
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:28,136
Well, look, this place is too small

45
00:03:28,136 --> 00:03:30,777
to house a family of five.

46
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:32,976
Just do what we always do.

47
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:36,736
You and I sleep in the room with Ke.

48
00:03:36,856 --> 00:03:38,217
Moli sleeps on the floor.

49
00:03:38,377 --> 00:03:39,657
As for Jincao,

50
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:42,296
he can bunk up with Dali out here.

51
00:03:43,176 --> 00:03:45,257
You sure have it all figured out,
don't you?

52
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:47,097
As if this is your own home.

53
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:49,337
But, Moli gets upset

54
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:50,896
even sleeping on a bunk bed.

55
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:52,657
And you want her to sleep on the floor?

56
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:54,976
You know what,
I'm calling Qianniu right now

57
00:03:54,976 --> 00:03:56,176
and ask him to come and pick you up.

58
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:58,257
Sis.

59
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:00,576
Since Moli won't sleep on the floor,

60
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:02,337
I will, okay?

61
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,937
No.

62
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:05,097
Zip it.

63
00:04:05,617 --> 00:04:06,537
Sis.

64
00:04:08,257 --> 00:04:10,777
I always know you have a heart of gold.

65
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:13,937
Wouldn't bear to see me end up homeless.

66
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:15,856
Son.

67
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:19,456
I got your gift.

68
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:22,177
I checked and found out it costs a lot.

69
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:23,857
It does for a reason.

70
00:04:24,136 --> 00:04:25,136
Just go ahead and enjoy it.

71
00:04:25,136 --> 00:04:27,057
I'll buy you more once you use them up.

72
00:04:27,497 --> 00:04:29,057
So, you are saying

73
00:04:29,497 --> 00:04:32,696
I'll just wait at home
for you to send me gifts?

74
00:04:32,776 --> 00:04:34,336
No need for me to go to Shanghai, right?

75
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:35,696
That's really not what I meant.

76
00:04:35,696 --> 00:04:37,617
Mom, I've been really busy lately.

77
00:04:37,617 --> 00:04:39,417
I have a very important project.

78
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:41,617
It concerns my KPI next year.

79
00:04:42,377 --> 00:04:44,617
Look, I am really working.

80
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,576
It's true.

81
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:46,417
Right?

82
00:04:46,737 --> 00:04:47,937
Alright.

83
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:50,136
No need to explain.

84
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:52,016
I don't want to come anyway.

85
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:53,297
For what?

86
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:54,456
Embarrassing myself?

87
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:56,977
Among you three,

88
00:04:57,057 --> 00:04:59,257
you have the best opportunities.

89
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,857
And you earn the most.

90
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:02,696
But what do you have now?

91
00:05:02,857 --> 00:05:04,216
No house,

92
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:05,817
and no wife.

93
00:05:06,257 --> 00:05:08,377
You've worked in Shanghai
for over a decade

94
00:05:08,497 --> 00:05:10,977
and I still have to stay in a hotel
when visiting.

95
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:12,937
I could be laughed at.

96
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,336
I should never have

97
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:18,817
sacrificed everything
to send you to study abroad.

98
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:21,776
Now you're doing even worse than Jincao.

99
00:05:25,096 --> 00:05:26,016
Jincao?

100
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:29,937
You have no idea how Jincao suffers.

101
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:41,656
Jincao.

102
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:43,417
Remember this?

103
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:44,456
Spicy lumps.

104
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:46,297
Where did you buy it
in this day and age?

105
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:48,177
Nowhere, actually.

106
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:50,497
I picked the vegetables
from the field myself.

107
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:52,737
Then I washed and pickled them,
so it's clean.

108
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:54,336
Eat with this.

109
00:05:55,977 --> 00:05:58,136
Big pancakes.

110
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,896
To bring back some childhood memory.

111
00:06:01,136 --> 00:06:03,177
I have kept myself busy
these past few days,

112
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:04,776
preparing tasty snacks for you.

113
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:05,737
Thank you, auntie.

114
00:06:05,737 --> 00:06:07,377
You still remember what I like to eat.

115
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,497
Mom, you must be tired
from the train ride.

116
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:10,576
You should rest.

117
00:06:18,456 --> 00:06:19,016
Auntie.

118
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:20,977
How about I book you a hotel nearby?

119
00:06:20,977 --> 00:06:22,417
That way, you can come over anytime.

120
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,016
That's really not necessary.
I hate to cost you money.

121
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,216
Thank you, then.

122
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:30,456
Jincao, listen.

123
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:33,016
Just let Qianniu book the hotel.

124
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:35,216
They can stay wherever they prefer.

125
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:37,617
Well, it's convenient
at my company's contracted hotel.

126
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:39,136
Which hotel?

127
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:40,737
Oriental Vista.

128
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,896
Four stars, with a swimming pool.

129
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:50,297
I should have brought my trunks.
I can go for a swim later.

130
00:06:50,656 --> 00:06:52,696
In that case, I'll go buy a swim suit.

131
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:53,377
Sure.

132
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:55,576
Jincao, we'll buy at the hotel.

133
00:06:55,576 --> 00:06:56,817
Then I'll put it on your tab.

134
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:58,096
It'll make you feel honored.

135
00:06:58,937 --> 00:07:00,576
Mom, let's go to the hotel then.

136
00:07:00,576 --> 00:07:01,857
Come on, let's go.

137
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,216
Auntie, Uncle, we're leaving.

138
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,377
You guys should rest early.

139
00:07:05,377 --> 00:07:06,016
We're out of here.

140
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:06,937
I'll text you the details.

141
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:07,857
Okay.

142
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:08,417
Ke.

143
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:10,177
Say goodbye to
grand-aunt and your uncle.

144
00:07:10,177 --> 00:07:10,617
It's okay.

145
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:11,737
Bye.

146
00:07:11,737 --> 00:07:12,977
- Bye, Moli.
- Goodbye.

147
00:07:12,977 --> 00:07:13,937
Jincao, text me, okay?

148
00:07:13,937 --> 00:07:14,937
Okay.

149
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:20,320
Let's go, shower time.

150
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,336
Daddy.

151
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:23,977
Why did you send my grand-aunt
to a hotel again?

152
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:27,377
Yeah, how many times
have you done this now?

153
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:30,016
She has a son.
Why do you have to book it for her?

154
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:32,776
Qianniu is not doing so well.

155
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:34,216
Then why doesn't he
go to your big brother?

156
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:36,656
He has a better job and more money.

157
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,057
They just like taking advantage of us.

158
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:41,177
Alright, keep your voice down.

159
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:43,417
I heard it.

160
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:46,417
We'll go take a shower.

161
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:53,937
About your aunt.

162
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:56,928
She has done nothing except for
sitting and eating since she got here.

163
00:07:57,497 --> 00:07:58,857
Then, right after you came home,

164
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:00,536
she starts running around,

165
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:01,937
keeping herself busy.

166
00:08:01,937 --> 00:08:04,456
And what about those pancakes
she apparently made for you?

167
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:07,696
She has been stingy
since she was a child.

168
00:08:08,257 --> 00:08:09,177
Now it's great.

169
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:11,977
She cuts herself a big slice

170
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:14,136
while offering you so little.

171
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:16,136
It doesn't cost much.

172
00:08:18,177 --> 00:08:21,016
It's still money, son.

173
00:08:21,257 --> 00:08:23,776
Besides, you shouldn't be
the one paying.

174
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:26,937
Alright.

175
00:08:26,937 --> 00:08:28,857
After all, she is my aunt.

176
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:31,297
And she's always been nice to me.

177
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,697
Plus, even for your sake,

178
00:08:32,697 --> 00:08:34,257
I should show her some respect.

179
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:38,577
You silly child.

180
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:43,457
She is just a free-loader, that's all.

181
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:52,577
There once was a theory.

182
00:08:53,577 --> 00:08:57,337
Anthropologists came to a conclusion
based on evolution theory.

183
00:08:58,056 --> 00:08:59,457
In primitive societies,

184
00:08:59,617 --> 00:09:01,457
men were responsible for hunting,

185
00:09:01,577 --> 00:09:03,776
and women gathered fruits.

186
00:09:03,896 --> 00:09:07,016
The gathered items
needed to be placed in baskets.

187
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:09,056
In modern society,

188
00:09:09,656 --> 00:09:12,737
the baskets are replaced by handbags

189
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:15,857
to hold a woman's harvest and joy.

190
00:09:16,217 --> 00:09:20,457
It fills a woman's heart with pleasure,

191
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:23,416
improving our relationships
and solving our problems.

192
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:25,737
That's why many people say

193
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:26,656
that bags

194
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:28,416
cure all illnesses.

195
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:32,497
For many women,
nothing makes them happier

196
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,857
than shopping for bags.

197
00:09:34,697 --> 00:09:36,176
But sometimes,

198
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:38,737
you buy an expensive bag

199
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,857
only to find that
it brings not happiness

200
00:09:41,936 --> 00:09:43,737
but more conflicts.

201
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:47,416
A bag is just a symbol.

202
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:49,457
Behind it lies the human mind.

203
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,176
Having beautiful visions alone

204
00:09:52,457 --> 00:09:55,016
is not enough for overcoming reality.

205
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:57,257
Bags

206
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:00,064
do not cure all illnesses.

207
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:08,704
=Simple Days=
(Bags Don't Cure All Illnesses)

208
00:10:14,737 --> 00:10:15,896
Hi, this way please.

209
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:22,416
So luxurious.

210
00:10:22,577 --> 00:10:23,577
It's great?

211
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:25,737
Mom, I'm telling you.

212
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:27,377
You should dress like this from now on.

213
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,617
Look how stunning you are.

214
00:10:29,617 --> 00:10:31,896
I dressed up for your sake.

215
00:10:31,936 --> 00:10:34,296
They may look down on me or your dad.

216
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:36,136
But they must never look down on you.

217
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:37,416
It's about face.

218
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,617
Thank you, Mom.

219
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:40,577
Ke, come, let's sit here.

220
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:42,337
Grandma, I want to drink this.

221
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:44,337
- Jincao.
- No, drink this instead.

222
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:46,776
Why pick this place?

223
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:49,097
So pretentious and flashy.

224
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:50,697
How much is this going to cost?

225
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,857
The owner here
is a friend of Lingxiao's.

226
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:54,016
I got a 20% discount.

227
00:10:54,176 --> 00:10:55,217
20% discount?

228
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,737
You should be the one paying.

229
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:00,936
We are the husband's family.

230
00:11:00,936 --> 00:11:02,217
You are the man of the house.

231
00:11:02,217 --> 00:11:03,737
Act like one.

232
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,936
Rest assured,
everything is taken care of.

233
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:06,977
Son.

234
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:09,617
Even with a 20% discount,
this will cost quite a bit, right?

235
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:11,217
You don't understand.

236
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:14,056
Sometimes a little luxury is necessary.

237
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:16,536
Might as well put on a big show
while we're at it.

238
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:19,056
Yes, we will.

239
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:20,617
Have some water.

240
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:26,816
Moli, you have no idea

241
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,577
how happy we were when you called.

242
00:11:28,577 --> 00:11:30,176
That's my girl.

243
00:11:30,217 --> 00:11:32,217
Don't get mad at me, okay?

244
00:11:33,337 --> 00:11:35,136
Jincao is not so bad.

245
00:11:35,136 --> 00:11:36,497
Treating us to a fancy meal.

246
00:11:36,577 --> 00:11:38,257
This makes me so happy.

247
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:39,497
Except when I think of

248
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:41,776
meeting those snobs from his family,

249
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:43,416
I feel like I can't breathe.

250
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,337
Mom, let's get something straight.

251
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:48,896
Today is about having a pleasant meal
with your in-laws.

252
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:50,416
No arguing, no quarreling.

253
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,016
Please, okay?

254
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:52,816
Got it.

255
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:55,136
We'll play nice,
putting on a polite mask.

256
00:11:55,136 --> 00:11:56,617
I can do that.

257
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,816
Just forget about the notarization.

258
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:03,136
Nobody says anything.

259
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:05,056
Moli, don't worry.

260
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:06,097
Before coming here,

261
00:12:06,097 --> 00:12:09,577
your mom and I had prepared ourselves.

262
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,497
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

263
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,296
For being a "good" dad,
as your name suggests.

264
00:12:13,497 --> 00:12:15,136
You should know that

265
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:17,617
your dad lectured me for one hour
before coming here.

266
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:18,656
Was it one hour?

267
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:19,296
Of course it was.

268
00:12:19,296 --> 00:12:20,416
Fifty minutes tops.

269
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,377
What, Mr. Gu?

270
00:12:21,377 --> 00:12:22,257
Okay, this is it.

271
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:23,896
Ke.

272
00:12:24,296 --> 00:12:26,176
Where is Ke?

273
00:12:28,256 --> 00:12:29,457
You're so pretty.

274
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,656
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Hi.

275
00:12:31,136 --> 00:12:31,697
Kiss grandpa.

276
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:32,577
Bring it in.

277
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:34,617
Hello, Dali.

278
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:36,056
Hello, Shanya.

279
00:12:36,577 --> 00:12:37,656
Look at that.

280
00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:41,337
Ke, I see you've fed yourself well.

281
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:43,617
It's not good for a girl to get fat.

282
00:12:43,617 --> 00:12:45,416
But she's growing, isn't she?

283
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,136
You need to eat more, taking it all in.

284
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:49,377
Otherwise, you'll end up a shorty.

285
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:52,617
Girls should stay fit from a young age.

286
00:12:52,617 --> 00:12:53,896
Because once you get too fat,

287
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:55,737
it will be hard to lose weight
as a grownup.

288
00:12:55,737 --> 00:12:56,577
Mom, Dad, table is ready.

289
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:57,697
Why don't you sit down and chat?

290
00:12:57,697 --> 00:12:58,776
Yes, take a seat, Dad.

291
00:12:58,776 --> 00:12:59,977
Come sit with Grandma, come.

292
00:13:00,497 --> 00:13:01,217
Alright.

293
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:02,816
Please.

294
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:03,497
Let's sit.

295
00:13:04,536 --> 00:13:05,257
Okay.

296
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:06,257
Please take the seat.

297
00:13:06,257 --> 00:13:07,257
Jincao.

298
00:13:07,776 --> 00:13:09,217
I have to criticize you.

299
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:11,896
Your father rarely comes to Shanghai.

300
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:13,936
Why didn't you let us know in advance?

301
00:13:14,217 --> 00:13:16,536
I could have shown some hospitality.

302
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:19,416
There's something you should know.

303
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:22,737
Consider this
a welcoming banquet for you.

304
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:24,416
You must let me pay.

305
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,737
No, please.

306
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:27,977
Let me pay.

307
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:30,497
I must fulfill
the responsibility of a host.

308
00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:32,977
After all, I bought the kids

309
00:13:32,977 --> 00:13:34,457
an apartment in Shanghai.

310
00:13:34,457 --> 00:13:35,497
How big is it?

311
00:13:35,497 --> 00:13:36,697
57.2.

312
00:13:36,697 --> 00:13:40,296
Yes, 57.2 square meters,
two bedrooms and one living room.

313
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:43,737
Are you still living

314
00:13:43,737 --> 00:13:45,296
in that empty house of your relative's?

315
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:46,136
That's right.

316
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:49,056
It's a Western-style condo
owned by a relative.

317
00:13:49,056 --> 00:13:51,737
Large, two-bedroom house
with one living room, 130 square meters.

318
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:54,464
It's more than comfortable.

319
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:56,857
Beats the small apartment anyway.

320
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:59,097
So, it's a temporary stay.

321
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:01,776
Alright, let's not talk about it now.

322
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:04,136
Waiter, serve the dishes.

323
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:12,896
Thank you, Moli,
for your thoughtfulness.

324
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,737
Arranging on Mother's Day

325
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:16,377
a gathering of our two families.

326
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:18,936
We'd like to express gratitude
to two moms.

327
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,296
Of course.

328
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,656
The dads deserve some credit too.

329
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:24,992
It is because of your hard work

330
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:27,337
that we are living
a happy and comfy life.

331
00:14:27,457 --> 00:14:29,936
That's why
I should pay for dinner today.

332
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:31,617
Sure.

333
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,960
Also, I prepared

334
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,432
Mother's Day gifts to moms.

335
00:14:34,432 --> 00:14:35,896
Mom, this is for you.

336
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:39,097
I specially selected two identical ones.

337
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:40,697
Hope you like them.

338
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:44,536
I've been coveting this bag
for a long time.

339
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:47,457
Love it so much.

340
00:14:47,457 --> 00:14:48,656
My little girl knows me the best.

341
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:49,816
Open yours too.

342
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:51,337
- So nice.
- I'm glad you like it.

343
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,217
Thank you.

344
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:54,617
Gu, look.

345
00:14:55,097 --> 00:14:56,416
Pretty nice, huh?

346
00:14:57,217 --> 00:14:58,377
It's great.

347
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:01,896
Ke.

348
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:04,697
Tell grandma to open her gift.

349
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:05,936
Tell her,

350
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:07,097
"Grandma, you've worked hard,"

351
00:15:07,097 --> 00:15:09,337
"taking care of me for so long."

352
00:15:10,136 --> 00:15:12,217
Grandma, hurry and open it.

353
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:17,296
Well, I don't think

354
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:18,857
I should take this bag.

355
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:19,904
It's too expensive.

356
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:22,016
I don't really
have an occasion that suits it.

357
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:23,776
Mom.

358
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:27,497
Moli specially chose this gift for you.

359
00:15:28,457 --> 00:15:29,337
Take a look.

360
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:35,977
So beautiful.

361
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:38,536
Come on.

362
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:47,257
So, can I bump this bag

363
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:49,857
for the one in Yulan's hands?

364
00:15:52,257 --> 00:15:54,857
Why? They are the same.

365
00:15:55,056 --> 00:15:57,536
Why not if they are the same?

366
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:01,457
Mom, let me explain.

367
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:04,000
I bought this bag for my mom
a long time ago.

368
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,936
I had her English name embroidered

369
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:07,200
on the inside of the bag.

370
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,472
I didn't have time
to do the same for you yet.

371
00:16:09,472 --> 00:16:12,056
So you guys can't swap
for they're not exactly the same.

372
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,337
I see you've even thought of an excuse.

373
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:25,217
Mom.

374
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:28,977
Mom, what are you doing?

375
00:16:29,097 --> 00:16:30,784
This bag is worth 15,000 yuan.

376
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:31,896
What?

377
00:16:32,176 --> 00:16:33,536
15,000 yuan for a crappy bag?

378
00:16:33,536 --> 00:16:35,536
What a waste.

379
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:38,016
The one for your mom
is worth 15,000 yuan.

380
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,712
This one is just 1,500, right?

381
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:42,217
Do you even have evidence
for your accusation?

382
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:44,608
This bag is indeed worth 15,000.

383
00:16:45,257 --> 00:16:46,776
You want evidence?

384
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:50,592
Fine, then listen carefully.

385
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:56,896
Ke, what are you doing?

386
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:59,097
Playing games again, aren't you?

387
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:00,776
Did I not tell you?

388
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:01,577
You can't play games.

389
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:03,136
Go read your book.

390
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:05,816
Your mom's education method
is always so crude and...

391
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:08,497
(Luxury Brand Vendor)
(I have a replica of the bag you want.)

392
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:10,657
(1500, one tenth of the authentic one.)

393
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:12,296
(Absolutely indistinguishable.)

394
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:13,937
(Your mother-in-law
won't be able to tell.)

395
00:17:28,816 --> 00:17:30,897
Life sure has a sense of humor

396
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:33,296
when it comes to coincidences.

397
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:37,296
It just so happened that
you were taking a shower that day,

398
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:39,616
and Ke has your cell phone.

399
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:41,096
She was playing games.

400
00:17:41,457 --> 00:17:45,016
And I, by chance,
saw that WeChat message.

401
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,697
Moli, it's been six years.

402
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:54,257
I've been washing clothes, cooking
and taking care of the child for you,

403
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,320
without any complaint.

404
00:17:57,096 --> 00:17:59,200
It's okay you look down on me
as a mother-in-law.

405
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:01,816
You don't have to buy me gifts.

406
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:05,497
But buying me a fake bag?
What's that supposed to mean?

407
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:08,856
Are you insulting me?

408
00:18:14,536 --> 00:18:16,776
What's going on? The bag is fake?

409
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:17,984
No, it's real.

410
00:18:17,984 --> 00:18:20,160
T-This bag is absolutely real.

411
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,137
You're still denying.

412
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:24,576
You're still denying.

413
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:26,697
I was going to

414
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:28,672
make my peace with the fake bag.

415
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,144
It's still a nice bag.

416
00:18:30,144 --> 00:18:31,376
Right?

417
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:34,177
No matter what, it shows that you care.

418
00:18:34,257 --> 00:18:35,897
I still have to thank you.

419
00:18:36,697 --> 00:18:37,776
But this is different.

420
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:40,096
Today you got a real one for your mom

421
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:42,336
and a fake one for me.

422
00:18:43,217 --> 00:18:44,217
Moli.

423
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,217
I-I don't think

424
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:48,417
I've ever done anything to hurt you.

425
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:50,592
Why are you treating me like this?

426
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:54,657
Why should we take your word for it?

427
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:56,536
Stop judging people
with your twisted mind.

428
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:57,568
Let me tell you, Zhang Shanya.

429
00:18:57,568 --> 00:19:00,417
My daughter would never
do something like this.

430
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:02,112
How do you know she wouldn't?

431
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:04,096
How do you know?

432
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:06,657
And how is my mind twisted?

433
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:08,800
Wu.

434
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,160
You get to dress up every day

435
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,257
and go dancing,

436
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:17,856
doing yoga, drinking coffee.

437
00:19:18,177 --> 00:19:20,697
I do all the dirty hard work.

438
00:19:20,737 --> 00:19:23,616
Grocery shopping, cooking,
taking care of the kid.

439
00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:25,257
Cleaning the house.

440
00:19:25,657 --> 00:19:27,576
And what has that brought me?

441
00:19:28,816 --> 00:19:31,424
You and your daughter
still look down on me.

442
00:19:32,257 --> 00:19:33,632
I'm more than happy to take care of Ke

443
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:35,977
and my daughter.

444
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:38,657
But I can't do it
in that small apartment of yours.

445
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:39,328
Also,

446
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:41,344
you've always been defensive.

447
00:19:41,344 --> 00:19:44,937
As if we were trying to
snatch that shabby den from you.

448
00:19:44,937 --> 00:19:47,336
You forced my son to sign

449
00:19:48,257 --> 00:19:50,697
the notarization to renounce the house.

450
00:19:50,697 --> 00:19:53,536
Aren't you also afraid that
we might take advantage of you?

451
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:55,417
You think you're superior?

452
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,217
I think you're despicable.

453
00:19:57,217 --> 00:19:58,856
Zhang Shanya, now I get it.

454
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,096
You're the one behind this. I knew it.

455
00:20:01,096 --> 00:20:02,752
It was you who told Moli, right?

456
00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:04,177
Wait a sec.

457
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,657
What notarization?

458
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:09,088
Dad, it's all in the past.
Just let it go.

459
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,176
Don't try to fool me.

460
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,488
What notarization?

461
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:12,657
Well,

462
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:17,056
since things have already
escalated to this point.

463
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:19,217
Let's just lay it all out then.

464
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:21,003
Mr. Zhu Dali,

465
00:20:21,283 --> 00:20:23,682
you were the ones that opposed strongly

466
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,722
the idea of buying
the apartment together.

467
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:27,763
As for the reason,

468
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:29,682
I think you and I both know.

469
00:20:30,402 --> 00:20:31,882
What we are doing now

470
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:33,402
is just following your example.

471
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:34,642
Cut the crap.

472
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:36,642
Just tell me. Did you sign it or not?

473
00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:48,043
Have you gone mute?

474
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:53,202
Did you sign it or not?

475
00:20:58,642 --> 00:20:59,642
Speak.

476
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:02,882
I did.

477
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:11,642
Yulan.

478
00:21:11,642 --> 00:21:12,003
Mom.

479
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:12,523
What's wrong?

480
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:13,682
You're all right, Yulan?

481
00:21:13,682 --> 00:21:14,763
Are you injured?

482
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:17,803
You, this is outrageous.

483
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:18,563
Why did you do that?

484
00:21:18,563 --> 00:21:20,283
Yulan, let's go.

485
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:22,402
You're being totally unreasonable.

486
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:22,922
Let's go.

487
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,803
Zhu Dali, you've gone too far.

488
00:21:28,803 --> 00:21:29,523
Go.

489
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:31,008
Moli.

490
00:21:31,363 --> 00:21:33,123
Why are you still standing here?

491
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:34,482
Let's go.

492
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,162
Come on.

493
00:21:36,323 --> 00:21:37,922
- How is it?
- Look, it's bleeding.

494
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:38,563
Gosh.

495
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:39,523
It's bleeding.

496
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,563
Should we go to the hospital?

497
00:22:04,563 --> 00:22:06,242
What's the point?

498
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:09,363
Gu Moli.

499
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:12,083
Tell us the truth.

500
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:14,402
The bag you bought
for your mother-in-law.

501
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:16,563
Is it fake or not?

502
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,962
I'll say it again.

503
00:22:19,682 --> 00:22:21,283
The bag is real.

504
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:35,402
Does it hurt, Mom?

505
00:22:35,402 --> 00:22:37,482
Easy, it hurts.

506
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,363
I'll slow down.

507
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:42,162
Moli, if this had happened to you or Ke,

508
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:44,242
it'd break my heart.

509
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:48,922
Mom, I'm sorry.

510
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,323
You silly child.

511
00:22:50,323 --> 00:22:52,162
Zhu Dali is the one who should be sorry.

512
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,882
He's the one who did this to me.

513
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,523
Also, sweetheart.

514
00:22:57,563 --> 00:22:59,363
What did I tell you back in the day?

515
00:22:59,363 --> 00:23:01,603
You shouldn't marry into the Zhu family
for they're no good.

516
00:23:01,603 --> 00:23:02,682
But you wouldn't listen.

517
00:23:03,202 --> 00:23:04,922
You insisted on marrying Zhu Jincao.

518
00:23:04,922 --> 00:23:05,682
See what happens now?

519
00:23:05,682 --> 00:23:06,882
Yulan.

520
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:08,442
Cut it out.

521
00:23:08,442 --> 00:23:10,363
Let's not bring up the past.

522
00:23:10,363 --> 00:23:13,162
Okay, I won't mention the past.

523
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:16,242
But we must clarify what happened today.

524
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:19,402
Moli was well-intentioned, right?

525
00:23:19,442 --> 00:23:21,363
Celebrating Mother's Day
for her mother-in-law.

526
00:23:21,363 --> 00:23:24,043
She really treats Shanya
as her own mother.

527
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:26,882
Spending more than 10,000
to buy her a bag.

528
00:23:26,962 --> 00:23:28,642
And what did she get in return?

529
00:23:29,123 --> 00:23:30,563
Gently.

530
00:23:30,603 --> 00:23:31,763
Alright.

531
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,922
Ouch, be gentle.

532
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:36,682
Gu.

533
00:23:37,363 --> 00:23:39,283
Today, even in front of us,

534
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:41,442
the Zhus were so arrogant.

535
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:43,003
When we're not around

536
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:44,323
and out of sight,

537
00:23:44,402 --> 00:23:47,803
how much more will they bully our girl?

538
00:23:48,283 --> 00:23:49,962
I'm not bullied.

539
00:23:50,123 --> 00:23:51,882
You were the one being mistreated today.

540
00:23:52,162 --> 00:23:52,843
How about this?

541
00:23:53,003 --> 00:23:55,722
Tomorrow I'll bring over Jincao
to apologize to you.

542
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:57,323
Him alone is not enough.

543
00:23:57,722 --> 00:24:00,642
His parents must come along
to apologize in person

544
00:24:00,642 --> 00:24:01,242
Yeah.

545
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:03,283
This time,

546
00:24:03,283 --> 00:24:04,843
your father-in-law and mother-in-law

547
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,402
must come in person.

548
00:24:07,123 --> 00:24:08,523
We demand an explanation.

549
00:24:18,763 --> 00:24:19,642
Jincao.

550
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:22,962
What happened today
wasn't entirely your dad's fault.

551
00:24:24,242 --> 00:24:26,003
I didn't know about the notarization

552
00:24:26,003 --> 00:24:28,202
until I found it when cleaning.

553
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:29,843
You're letting them bully you.

554
00:24:31,402 --> 00:24:33,283
Let me tell you something
about your mother.

555
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:35,363
In my whole life,
I've never craved for anything

556
00:24:35,523 --> 00:24:37,323
except for some respect.

557
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,123
It's a slap in the face
when Moli got me that fake bag.

558
00:24:40,123 --> 00:24:41,563
She's insulting me.

559
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,763
And that's just the same
as insulting you.

560
00:24:44,162 --> 00:24:45,482
Zhu Jincao.

561
00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:47,603
I'm telling you.

562
00:24:47,843 --> 00:24:49,722
About what happened today,

563
00:24:50,162 --> 00:24:53,123
if the Gus don't come
to apologize in person,

564
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:56,242
she might as well stop
considering herself part of our family.

565
00:24:57,202 --> 00:24:58,283
I get it.

566
00:24:58,603 --> 00:25:00,242
You just can't let me be happy.

567
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:01,363
What did you say?

568
00:25:01,363 --> 00:25:02,402
I said you were right.

569
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:05,323
Not just right, but also unfinished.

570
00:25:27,763 --> 00:25:28,642
(Dear,)

571
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,763
(how's that vendor I recommended?)

572
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,843
(Did your mother-in-law
notice anything?)

573
00:25:50,442 --> 00:25:52,603
Miss, your zipper is open.

574
00:25:53,242 --> 00:25:54,242
Sorry.

575
00:25:54,563 --> 00:25:55,363
Sir.

576
00:25:56,162 --> 00:25:58,083
Could you pull it up for me?

577
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,482
Miss.

578
00:26:08,763 --> 00:26:10,003
Yes, you.

579
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:12,363
Could you help this lady
with her zipper?

580
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:14,003
Sir, please wait.

581
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,043
Can I have your WeChat?

582
00:26:18,603 --> 00:26:20,482
Sorry, I didn't bring my phone.

583
00:26:29,803 --> 00:26:30,803
Thank you.

584
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:42,843
Thank you, have a nice day.

585
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:48,482
Hello, sir.

586
00:26:48,603 --> 00:26:50,123
We are closing.

587
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,563
Please settle the bill first.

588
00:26:52,563 --> 00:26:53,242
How much is it?

589
00:26:53,843 --> 00:26:55,682
It's 863.

590
00:26:55,722 --> 00:26:57,043
WeChat or Alipay?

591
00:27:04,882 --> 00:27:05,563
Lingxiao.

592
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:07,202
Lingxiao.

593
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:09,922
Check out.

594
00:27:10,603 --> 00:27:12,202
Sure, I'll get it.

595
00:27:32,482 --> 00:27:35,563
Sorry, it's out of battery.

596
00:27:36,603 --> 00:27:38,242
We take cash or card.

597
00:27:39,882 --> 00:27:40,882
Please.

598
00:27:42,363 --> 00:27:43,882
Who carries a wallet nowadays?

599
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:47,922
Qianniu.

600
00:27:48,162 --> 00:27:50,242
Why don't you get it now
and I'll pay you via phone later?

601
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:52,442
Fine, I'll do it.

602
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,442
Hey, I'll take this one.

603
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:55,722
I'll pay.

604
00:27:56,162 --> 00:27:57,162
Let me.

605
00:27:58,682 --> 00:27:59,803
I'm paying.

606
00:28:02,922 --> 00:28:03,882
Lingxiao.

607
00:28:04,523 --> 00:28:05,402
Look.

608
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:08,843
Neither my credit card

609
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:11,882
nor my Alipay account
has enough balance.

610
00:28:13,803 --> 00:28:15,882
Didn't I just lend you 8,000 yuan?

611
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:17,323
Why are you out of money again?

612
00:28:17,922 --> 00:28:18,922
Fine.

613
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,323
I'll keep looking.

614
00:28:23,563 --> 00:28:25,283
Lingxiao, the signal is bad here.

615
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:27,283
I'll go somewhere else.

616
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:29,162
Wait for me here.

617
00:28:29,162 --> 00:28:30,603
I'll be right back.

618
00:28:38,763 --> 00:28:40,682
Jincao, this is an emergency.

619
00:28:40,682 --> 00:28:41,603
The usual place.

620
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,962
Lingxiao is drunk, and I can't leave.

621
00:28:43,962 --> 00:28:45,882
Come and settle the bill.

622
00:28:51,242 --> 00:28:53,242
Sir.

623
00:29:12,162 --> 00:29:14,402
Sir, you haven't paid yet.

624
00:29:15,363 --> 00:29:17,402
I thought my cousin paid.

625
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:18,642
He's already left.

626
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:21,882
That boy.

627
00:29:21,922 --> 00:29:24,083
Sir, you can't leave without paying.

628
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:25,482
Come on.

629
00:29:25,882 --> 00:29:28,123
It's not my first time here.

630
00:29:28,123 --> 00:29:29,843
You recognize me, right?

631
00:29:30,162 --> 00:29:31,962
Do I look like someone
who would dine and dash?

632
00:29:32,803 --> 00:29:33,603
No, you don't.

633
00:29:33,722 --> 00:29:34,962
But your friend

634
00:29:34,962 --> 00:29:36,083
has already dashed.

635
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,123
I'll settle it for him.

636
00:29:37,962 --> 00:29:38,763
How much is it?

637
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,283
863 in total.

638
00:29:42,123 --> 00:29:43,603
Quite a drinker, huh?

639
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:49,642
All set.

640
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:50,523
Okay, thank you.

641
00:29:53,202 --> 00:29:55,843
Thank you. I am very grateful.

642
00:29:55,882 --> 00:29:57,922
Good to know there are still
kind people in the world.

643
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:00,642
Don't worry.
I will definitely pay you back.

644
00:30:00,922 --> 00:30:03,283
Can I have your WeChat?

645
00:30:04,363 --> 00:30:06,202
So, you did bring your phone.

646
00:30:10,043 --> 00:30:12,003
The battery isn't dead, is it?

647
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:16,482
Sorry, in fact it is.

648
00:30:19,123 --> 00:30:20,642
Hand me your phone, will you?

649
00:30:25,722 --> 00:30:27,363
Could you unlock it, please?

650
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:38,722
This is my WeChat ID.

651
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:41,803
I'll accept it when I get back.

652
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:46,722
Wait, hold on.

653
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,843
Could you call me a cab, please?

654
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:55,962
What I mean is,

655
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,242
if I really do forget to pay you back,

656
00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:03,043
you'll know where I live.

657
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:05,363
You can come to my place to find me.

658
00:31:18,402 --> 00:31:19,402
Please pay here.

659
00:31:19,803 --> 00:31:20,882
We'd be glad to serve you again.

660
00:31:22,242 --> 00:31:22,843
Hello.

661
00:31:22,843 --> 00:31:23,962
Hello, Miss Gu.

662
00:31:23,962 --> 00:31:25,323
Is there anything else you need?

663
00:31:25,323 --> 00:31:27,803
I bought a bag here
the other day, remember?

664
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:28,843
Of course I do.

665
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:30,962
The thing is,
I swiped the wrong card that day.

666
00:31:31,003 --> 00:31:32,482
Could I return it now

667
00:31:32,482 --> 00:31:34,563
and pay with another card?

668
00:31:36,763 --> 00:31:38,083
Shanya,

669
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:42,803
you shouldn't worry yourself too much.

670
00:31:43,603 --> 00:31:45,563
Just like Qianniu says,

671
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:48,642
even small matters require wisdom.

672
00:31:50,363 --> 00:31:52,162
What's so great about designer bags?

673
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:53,763
They're just a trap to begin with.

674
00:31:53,763 --> 00:31:56,283
Nothing but synthetic leather
from a sweat shop.

675
00:31:56,283 --> 00:31:58,162
Not even genuine leather.

676
00:31:58,803 --> 00:32:00,803
They put a brand label on it

677
00:32:00,803 --> 00:32:02,922
and sell it for 15,000.

678
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:05,162
When you think of it this way,

679
00:32:05,242 --> 00:32:07,803
you will feel that Moli knows
how to live a frugal life?

680
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:11,882
She lives a frugal life?

681
00:32:12,323 --> 00:32:13,123
If that's so,

682
00:32:13,123 --> 00:32:15,763
why didn't she
get her own mother a fake one?

683
00:32:17,482 --> 00:32:20,722
Let bygones be bygones, please.

684
00:32:21,763 --> 00:32:23,162
Your way of thinking

685
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:26,962
will only make things worse
for your son and daughter-in-law.

686
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,242
I had a great time in Shanghai,

687
00:32:37,763 --> 00:32:40,763
eating out and shopping.

688
00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:42,363
I should head back.

689
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:44,962
This trip really agrees with me.

690
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,123
You don't say.

691
00:32:47,682 --> 00:32:48,843
The accommodation alone

692
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,603
cost my son several thousand.

693
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:53,843
My nephew treats me well

694
00:32:53,882 --> 00:32:56,123
because of you, my big sister.

695
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,682
You're so insensitive.

696
00:32:58,682 --> 00:33:01,408
(Honey)

697
00:33:09,523 --> 00:33:10,283
Moli.

698
00:33:10,603 --> 00:33:13,123
Zhu Jincao, look carefully.

699
00:33:13,682 --> 00:33:16,283
Two receipts, two bags.

700
00:33:17,323 --> 00:33:19,123
The bag I bought your mother is real.

701
00:33:19,242 --> 00:33:22,123
If you don't believe,
come verify it at the counter.

702
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,242
Now it seems pointless

703
00:33:24,242 --> 00:33:27,043
for me to give her a Mother's Day gift.

704
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:29,882
You should buy your mother gift,
and I mine.

705
00:33:30,043 --> 00:33:31,402
To be fair, a wife is not obligated

706
00:33:31,402 --> 00:33:33,283
to buy her husband's mom
a Mother's Day gift.

707
00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:35,722
This is your supplementary card.

708
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,922
I've never used it until today.

709
00:33:37,922 --> 00:33:39,402
And never again.

710
00:33:51,123 --> 00:33:53,202
Son, this...

711
00:33:53,202 --> 00:33:54,763
This bag is real?

712
00:33:54,882 --> 00:33:56,442
You heard it too.

713
00:33:57,962 --> 00:33:59,043
You saw it.

714
00:34:00,242 --> 00:34:01,682
We've wronged her.

715
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:06,162
Where are you going?

716
00:34:08,362 --> 00:34:09,483
To apologize.

717
00:34:09,963 --> 00:34:11,242
To bring her back.

718
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:18,563
No.

719
00:34:19,242 --> 00:34:20,362
It can't be.

720
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,483
If this bag is genuine,

721
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:24,043
then what did she need a WeChat vendor?

722
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,242
I knew what I saw.

723
00:34:25,242 --> 00:34:28,483
That WeChat message
was about a 1,500-yuan replica.

724
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:34,202
Shanya, I-I need to go to the station.

725
00:34:34,202 --> 00:34:35,162
Wait.

726
00:34:35,202 --> 00:34:36,123
We still have time.

727
00:34:36,123 --> 00:34:37,642
Go with me to the hotel.

728
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,083
What are we going to the hotel for?

729
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,842
To retrieve the bag.

730
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,802
It's worth 15,000 yuan.

731
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:54,003
Shanya.

732
00:34:54,523 --> 00:34:57,802
I think you should just let it go.

733
00:34:57,802 --> 00:34:59,762
Moli is a good kid.

734
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:00,722
It's not easy for her.

735
00:35:00,722 --> 00:35:03,083
Don't pursue this matter anymore.

736
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:03,842
Who has it easy?

737
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:05,842
You think it's easy for me?

738
00:35:06,043 --> 00:35:08,603
What happened yesterday still haunts me.

739
00:35:08,642 --> 00:35:09,963
And you're taking her side.

740
00:35:09,963 --> 00:35:10,523
Here.

741
00:35:10,963 --> 00:35:12,722
I will not leave without the bag.

742
00:35:12,722 --> 00:35:13,523
Hurry up.

743
00:35:19,162 --> 00:35:20,202
What are you doing?

744
00:35:21,043 --> 00:35:22,202
I-I, eh...

745
00:35:22,202 --> 00:35:24,242
I dined here yesterday.

746
00:35:24,242 --> 00:35:26,362
I-I lost something very important.

747
00:35:26,362 --> 00:35:28,162
I just want to see
if it's still in the trash can.

748
00:35:28,322 --> 00:35:30,722
The trash was taken away yesterday.

749
00:35:38,282 --> 00:35:39,043
Hello.

750
00:35:39,043 --> 00:35:40,003
Hello.

751
00:35:40,003 --> 00:35:42,883
So you're the ones who lost a bag
in VIP Room 11 yesterday, right?

752
00:35:42,883 --> 00:35:45,322
Yes, an expensive one.

753
00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:47,403
You didn't lose it, did you?

754
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:50,362
You dropped the bag
into the fish head soup.

755
00:35:50,563 --> 00:35:53,123
That was an accident.

756
00:35:53,162 --> 00:35:54,083
Luckily,

757
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,403
one of our waitresses
noticed it while cleaning.

758
00:35:56,403 --> 00:35:57,722
We kept the bag

759
00:35:57,923 --> 00:35:59,483
in case you came back looking for it.

760
00:35:59,923 --> 00:36:01,043
That's great!

761
00:36:01,043 --> 00:36:03,242
Zhao.

762
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:04,443
Coming.

763
00:36:05,642 --> 00:36:06,642
Mr. Zhu, here.

764
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:07,362
Get back to work.

765
00:36:07,362 --> 00:36:08,682
Thank you.

766
00:36:09,282 --> 00:36:10,362
Take a look. Is this the one?

767
00:36:10,362 --> 00:36:11,403
Let me see.

768
00:36:11,762 --> 00:36:12,802
Yes.

769
00:36:12,842 --> 00:36:14,403
I'll take another look.

770
00:36:15,242 --> 00:36:17,682
Yes, thank you.

771
00:36:17,682 --> 00:36:18,322
You're welcome.

772
00:36:19,322 --> 00:36:20,603
Let's go.

773
00:36:22,123 --> 00:36:22,842
Mom.

774
00:36:23,003 --> 00:36:25,563
Don't call me that. I'm not your mom.

775
00:36:26,242 --> 00:36:27,963
It's all because your parents

776
00:36:27,963 --> 00:36:30,162
have no trust in Moli at all.

777
00:36:30,443 --> 00:36:31,563
More importantly,

778
00:36:31,563 --> 00:36:34,242
you didn't even try to defend Moli.

779
00:36:34,282 --> 00:36:36,123
She is very disappointed in you.

780
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,483
So am I.

781
00:36:38,123 --> 00:36:40,603
Mom, I was so confused at the time.

782
00:36:42,043 --> 00:36:44,043
Never mind. I won't explain myself.

783
00:36:44,923 --> 00:36:46,842
Mom, how is your injury?

784
00:36:47,202 --> 00:36:48,282
You want to know?

785
00:36:48,282 --> 00:36:49,762
Like this, see?

786
00:36:50,682 --> 00:36:51,883
Let me ask you this.

787
00:36:51,883 --> 00:36:54,242
If the injury were on Moli or Ke,

788
00:36:54,242 --> 00:36:55,722
would you feel heartbroken?

789
00:36:55,722 --> 00:36:57,003
Of course I would.

790
00:36:57,242 --> 00:36:59,403
That's why I'm here
to apologize to Moli.

791
00:36:59,403 --> 00:37:01,123
Given how terrible the situation was,

792
00:37:01,123 --> 00:37:02,083
do you think an apology

793
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:03,762
would be enough to convince me
to let her go back?

794
00:37:07,123 --> 00:37:09,802
Whatever it takes, I'll do it.

795
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:15,322
Your parents and you

796
00:37:15,682 --> 00:37:18,202
must give Moli and myself

797
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,322
and her dad a sincere apology.

798
00:37:20,762 --> 00:37:21,883
And you promise things as such

799
00:37:21,883 --> 00:37:24,322
will never happen again in the future.

800
00:37:25,362 --> 00:37:27,162
I will base the decision of

801
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,523
sending my daughter back
on your sincerity.

802
00:37:29,883 --> 00:37:30,762
Otherwise,

803
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:33,322
Moli's dad and I would rather
support our daughter for a lifetime

804
00:37:33,322 --> 00:37:35,523
than letting her go home with you
to be mistreated.

805
00:37:36,242 --> 00:37:40,403
Mom, can we not
make things harder than it has to?

806
00:37:40,483 --> 00:37:43,003
You know what my dad is like.

807
00:37:43,842 --> 00:37:45,523
Indeed, they know in their hearts

808
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,802
that they have wronged Moli.

809
00:37:46,802 --> 00:37:48,682
So, no apology then?

810
00:37:48,682 --> 00:37:49,883
They think they did nothing wrong?

811
00:37:49,883 --> 00:37:51,722
If this is your attitude,
you can leave now.

812
00:37:51,722 --> 00:37:53,403
Just go.

813
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:04,483
Mom, I'll leave now.

814
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:22,003
Good, you're here.

815
00:38:23,123 --> 00:38:25,003
Your mom keeps calling me.

816
00:38:25,523 --> 00:38:27,083
I don't want to talk to her now.

817
00:38:27,202 --> 00:38:28,003
You take it.

818
00:38:33,003 --> 00:38:34,802
Mom, what is it?

819
00:38:34,842 --> 00:38:36,362
Tell Gu Moli

820
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:38,762
I've had the bag checked and it's fake.

821
00:38:48,322 --> 00:38:49,242
Ms. Gu.

822
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:50,043
Look,

823
00:38:50,043 --> 00:38:52,282
the needlework on the surface
is fairly even,

824
00:38:52,282 --> 00:38:54,563
but on the inside,

825
00:38:54,563 --> 00:38:56,083
it's not parallel at all.

826
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,523
Also, this logo print

827
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,883
was supposed to be done
with our unique hot stamping process,

828
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:02,802
and yours is obviously a counterfeit.

829
00:39:04,123 --> 00:39:05,403
You see?

830
00:39:05,403 --> 00:39:06,362
Take a good look.

831
00:39:06,523 --> 00:39:09,043
Your mother-in-law wasn't being unfair,
was she?

832
00:39:12,802 --> 00:39:14,403
I accept your conclusion.

833
00:39:15,123 --> 00:39:16,963
However, please explain to me

834
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:19,202
why there are two receipts.

835
00:39:19,722 --> 00:39:21,322
Ms. Gu, all I can say is

836
00:39:21,322 --> 00:39:22,483
that you indeed purchased

837
00:39:22,483 --> 00:39:24,083
two of the same bag from us.

838
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,362
But this one

839
00:39:25,443 --> 00:39:27,282
is definitely a fake one.

840
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:30,403
So, do you think

841
00:39:31,043 --> 00:39:33,403
maybe someone swapped the real bag
my wife bought

842
00:39:33,523 --> 00:39:34,523
with a counterfeit?

843
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:36,963
We wouldn't know about that.

844
00:39:36,963 --> 00:39:39,043
We most certainly did not swap.

845
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,322
There's a surveillance camera here.
Take a look if you want.

846
00:39:41,483 --> 00:39:42,523
Let me see.

847
00:39:42,523 --> 00:39:43,483
Is it the same?

848
00:39:45,362 --> 00:39:46,403
No?

849
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:49,282
Shanya, I must go now.

850
00:39:49,282 --> 00:39:51,043
Or I'm going to miss the train.

851
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:52,923
Jincao bought the ticket for me.

852
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,362
If I miss it, I'll have to pay extra.

853
00:39:54,362 --> 00:39:55,202
Alright. I know.

854
00:39:55,202 --> 00:39:56,443
Just leave. Go.

855
00:39:56,443 --> 00:39:58,603
We're not done here,
so I won't see you off.

856
00:39:58,603 --> 00:39:59,563
Take a taxi yourself.

857
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,563
There's no need to see me off.

858
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:02,282
I'm leaving.

859
00:40:02,282 --> 00:40:03,202
Take care.

860
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:09,722
So, Jincao and Moli,

861
00:40:10,123 --> 00:40:11,883
I have to go now.

862
00:40:12,603 --> 00:40:15,403
You two are made for each other.

863
00:40:15,403 --> 00:40:17,362
Have a good life together. Don't fight.

864
00:40:19,003 --> 00:40:20,682
And, Moli,

865
00:40:21,403 --> 00:40:22,603
I know that

866
00:40:22,603 --> 00:40:24,282
you're having a hard time

867
00:40:24,282 --> 00:40:25,682
adjusting to this family.

868
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,722
Your mother-in-law
is only mean on the outside.

869
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:29,362
Didn't you say

870
00:40:29,362 --> 00:40:31,043
that you're going to miss the train?

871
00:40:31,043 --> 00:40:31,802
You'd better hurry up.

872
00:40:31,802 --> 00:40:32,603
Off you go.

873
00:40:32,603 --> 00:40:33,362
I'm leaving.

874
00:40:33,362 --> 00:40:33,842
I'm leaving.

875
00:40:33,842 --> 00:40:34,483
Goodbye, auntie.

876
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,162
Goodbye.

877
00:40:35,162 --> 00:40:36,123
I'm out of here. Bye.

878
00:40:36,123 --> 00:40:37,202
Till next time.

879
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:38,642
That's enough. Just go.

880
00:40:44,123 --> 00:40:47,202
Moli, now that there are
no outsiders here.

881
00:40:47,202 --> 00:40:49,762
Why don't you tell me
if I was being unfair?

882
00:40:50,003 --> 00:40:51,282
The salesperson said

883
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,682
this bag is a fake.

884
00:40:52,722 --> 00:40:54,883
Yet you insist you bought me a real one.

885
00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:56,123
Where's the real bag then?

886
00:40:56,842 --> 00:40:58,923
I don't know, nor do I care.

887
00:40:59,282 --> 00:41:01,123
Think whatever you like.

888
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:02,883
My conscience is clear anyway.

889
00:41:03,483 --> 00:41:04,963
Your conscience is clear?

890
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,003
So you mean I'm trying to frame you?

891
00:41:07,003 --> 00:41:08,003
- Mom, stop talking.
- No.

892
00:41:08,282 --> 00:41:09,682
Let's get it out in the open.

893
00:41:09,682 --> 00:41:11,003
How am I framing you?

894
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:11,722
Moli.

895
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:12,403
Mom, stop it.

896
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,202
How dare she speaks to me in that tone?

897
00:41:14,202 --> 00:41:14,883
Moli.

898
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:16,202
How could she say that to me?

899
00:41:16,202 --> 00:41:16,883
Sir.

900
00:41:16,883 --> 00:41:19,202
Who's going to pay the 3,000 yuan
for the authentication and cleaning?

901
00:41:19,362 --> 00:41:21,802
3,000? You're out of your mind.

902
00:41:22,043 --> 00:41:24,003
We must pay
to have the bag authenticated?

903
00:41:24,043 --> 00:41:25,403
And 3,000? That's ridiculous.

904
00:41:25,403 --> 00:41:25,963
Mom, stop it.

905
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:27,883
- You're robbing us.
- Please, we'll talk back home.

906
00:41:30,883 --> 00:41:32,682
Sorry, I'll pay.

907
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:37,603
Mom, calm down.

908
00:41:37,603 --> 00:41:39,123
We know what really happened now.

909
00:41:39,443 --> 00:41:41,722
Moli did nothing wrong, neither did you.

910
00:41:43,202 --> 00:41:44,003
You know what?

911
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:45,802
You're so helplessly pathetic and weak.

912
00:41:45,802 --> 00:41:47,963
Even now you're trying to defend her?

913
00:41:48,403 --> 00:41:49,362
Even if she's right,

914
00:41:49,362 --> 00:41:50,362
and this bag costs 15,000,

915
00:41:50,403 --> 00:41:52,603
we just spent 3,000 on authentication.

916
00:41:52,883 --> 00:41:54,123
That's a lot of money, son.

917
00:41:54,123 --> 00:41:55,642
Hard earned money too.

918
00:41:56,963 --> 00:41:58,722
We must get to the bottom of this.

919
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:06,242
Stop following me.

920
00:42:06,322 --> 00:42:07,802
Go do whatever you are supposed to do.

921
00:42:13,403 --> 00:42:14,443
So, do you think

922
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,603
maybe someone swapped
the real bag my wife bought

923
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:18,883
with a counterfeit?

924
00:42:19,963 --> 00:42:21,443
We wouldn't know about that.

925
00:42:21,483 --> 00:42:23,603
We most certainly did not swap.

926
00:42:23,603 --> 00:42:26,003
There's a surveillance camera here.
Take a look if you want.

927
00:42:26,162 --> 00:42:28,682
Shanya, I must go now.

928
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:30,682
Or I'm going to miss the train.

929
00:42:56,896 --> 00:42:58,240
And Moli,

930
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,536
I know that you're having a hard time

931
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:02,976
adjusting to this family.

932
00:43:03,296 --> 00:43:06,464
Your mother-in-law
is only mean on the outside.

933
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,722
Hey.

934
00:43:25,362 --> 00:43:26,842
Go and ask your auntie

935
00:43:27,242 --> 00:43:29,563
where she got that star pendant
on her bag.

936
00:43:29,563 --> 00:43:30,523
What pendant?

937
00:43:30,762 --> 00:43:32,682
Didn't your mom ask for an explanation?

938
00:43:32,923 --> 00:43:34,923
You should get it from your auntie.

939
00:43:35,403 --> 00:43:37,083
She stole the bag,

940
00:43:37,483 --> 00:43:39,722
causing chaos in our family.

941
00:43:39,722 --> 00:43:41,202
And then she ran away.

942
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,282
