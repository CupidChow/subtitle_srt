=Episode 16=

19
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:30,368
What's the matter? Why the silence?

20
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:34,608
I'm a bit tired.

21
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:39,567
Why did you go to Jinshan
all of a sudden last night?

22
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,248
Did something happen?

23
00:02:43,687 --> 00:02:45,447
I just missed you. Is that okay?

24
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:57,648
Did you know you looked
particularly pale last night?

25
00:02:58,727 --> 00:02:59,967
You were in bad shape.

26
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:03,488
If I couldn't see that,

27
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:05,528
then I'd be a lame husband.

28
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,928
Come on, tell me what happened.

29
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:14,808
Even between husband and wife,
there should be some little secrets.

30
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:25,407
Is there something
that's worrying or frightening you?

31
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,528
Jincao, can you not go back to Jinshan?

32
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:37,887
I don't want to be so far from you.
Will you come back?

33
00:03:40,727 --> 00:03:42,048
I need to make money.

34
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:44,328
Money isn't everything in life.

35
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:47,567
I can't bear to waste our best years

36
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,407
with you suffering alone in Jinshan

37
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:51,447
and me living like a widow.

38
00:03:52,488 --> 00:03:55,127
Please. It's not that bad.

39
00:03:56,048 --> 00:03:57,407
I haven't suffered much.

40
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:00,248
What are you talking about?

41
00:04:00,488 --> 00:04:02,847
Look at that tiny, shabby flat
you're living in.

42
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:06,248
With nothing in it
and no one to cook you a meal.

43
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:08,847
It's like you just
graduated from college.

44
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:13,368
And me?
Raising our child alone in Shanghai,

45
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:14,968
not being able to see you every day.

46
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:16,647
I can't have meals with you,

47
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:18,127
share fun stories with you,

48
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:20,288
or sleep in your arm at night.

49
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:26,928
All I want is just
a normal married life with you.

50
00:04:27,887 --> 00:04:29,608
That's more important
than earning money.

51
00:04:35,248 --> 00:04:38,288
I see. Ke suddenly fell ill,

52
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:39,887
so you felt frustrated, right?

53
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:44,447
I'm sorry, honey.

54
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:49,168
I can't give you what you want now.

55
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:51,368
I do want to come back.

56
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:54,207
I want the three of us
to live a good life together.

57
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:55,488
But not now.

58
00:04:57,127 --> 00:05:00,127
The only reason I went to Jinshan
was to make more money.

59
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:02,928
I must get a bigger house for Ke.

60
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:05,608
She is still young.

61
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:09,087
Once she starts school,
the small apartment will be a problem.

62
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:12,647
Besides, I thought we both agreed.

63
00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:15,567
While we are still young,
we should keep up the hard work,

64
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:18,007
and after two years,
we'll get a bigger house for Ke,

65
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:19,728
and then we can be reunited.

66
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:24,887
You're right about everything
except for one.

67
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,687
I'm not young anymore.

68
00:05:30,848 --> 00:05:34,728
Nonsense, to me you'll always be young.

69
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:35,928
And the most beautiful.

70
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:45,567
Incoming.

71
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:46,408
Got it.

72
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:47,127
Got it.

73
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:54,207
Watch out.

74
00:05:57,168 --> 00:05:57,887
Mine.

75
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,808
Come on, concentrate.

76
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:06,527
Come on.

77
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:07,647
Le, come here.

78
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:10,567
What's the matter?
You seem distracted today.

79
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:12,608
Why hasn't Liuliu showed up?

80
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:16,248
She probably won't come today.

81
00:06:16,447 --> 00:06:17,848
She's been in a bad mood lately.

82
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:18,647
What's wrong?

83
00:06:19,527 --> 00:06:21,408
It's that forum of ours.

84
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:23,207
The feedback hasn't been so good.

85
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:25,567
Probably under a lot of pressure.

86
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,368
So, she's not in the mood for sport.

87
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:30,087
You need her for something?

88
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:33,127
No, just asking. Come on, continue.

89
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:34,488
Alright, let's go.

90
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:35,848
Watch it.

91
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,928
Everyone, today,

92
00:06:55,368 --> 00:07:02,327
I would like to proudly present
the works of Ms. Zhang Shanya.

93
00:07:04,647 --> 00:07:07,808
This series of still photos
of the marketplace.

94
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:13,968
It screams originality
from skill to idea.

95
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:19,207
I've never seen anything
so down-to-earth and so lively

96
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:21,488
in this class before.

97
00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:22,968
Everyone, take a look.

98
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:24,767
Personally, I think

99
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:30,248
her works bear a style similar to
that of Cézanne's painting.

100
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:34,207
Teach, that Ce-what's-his-name...

101
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:37,848
Cézanne, the great French artist.

102
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:38,887
Really?

103
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:41,207
Amazing. Ms. Zhang Shanya.

104
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:43,127
Remarkable, truly remarkable.

105
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:45,968
You have a unique eye
for discovering life.

106
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:49,007
Zhang Shanya,
you should speak up more in class.

107
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:50,567
Let everyone get to know you better.

108
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:53,567
This is what they call
a sudden outburst of talent.

109
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:54,728
No, come on.

110
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:57,767
Finally, we have some presentable works
out of this class.

111
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:01,408
Don't people always say that
old people photography is only for fun?

112
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:03,127
But, like our teacher just said,

113
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:05,408
her works are down-to-earth and lively,

114
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:06,848
and similar to Cézanne's style.

115
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:09,808
No, it was just a casual snap, actually.

116
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:11,527
Keep your cool.

117
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:12,127
What?

118
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:13,808
You're the maestro now.

119
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:15,608
What are you talking about?

120
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:18,527
You overdid it.

121
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:24,887
Class, I've told you before

122
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:26,767
that my daughter is an artist herself.

123
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:30,608
And she got her artistic genes from me.

124
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:35,608
You see, I have a knack
for discovering beauty in life.

125
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:38,007
And I discovered Zhang Shanya.

126
00:08:38,007 --> 00:08:38,608
Right.

127
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:40,287
That makes you a talent scout.

128
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,688
Of course.

129
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,047
She came here to learn cooking.

130
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:47,848
We almost missed out on a great artist.

131
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:48,927
That's enough.

132
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:51,927
Thank you.

133
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:56,927
Okay, let's begin our class.

134
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:57,807
Class begins.

135
00:09:00,848 --> 00:09:02,287
Not bad.

136
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:07,927
Here we go.

137
00:09:13,848 --> 00:09:14,608
Nice.

138
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:27,527
Liuliu.

139
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:29,368
Take it.

140
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:33,127
The three of us, let's do this.

141
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:38,608
I thought you weren't coming.

142
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:42,527
Le just said you're in a bad mood.
Is everything okay?

143
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:45,208
Nothing. Just work stuff.

144
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:47,007
Is there anything I can help you with?

145
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,088
No need, thank you.

146
00:09:51,088 --> 00:09:54,407
That day, we...

147
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:57,407
Liuliu is here. Let's get ready then.

148
00:09:58,568 --> 00:10:02,208
Stop chatting.
The match is about to start.

149
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:04,647
Perfect, Liuliu is here too.

150
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,887
The other team is short of a girl.
You can join them.

151
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:09,088
Cancan, will you stop?

152
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:11,568
Liuliu has only played a few times.
How can she compete?

153
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:12,968
Maybe as a substitute.

154
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:17,527
Why should I be a substitute?

155
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:20,767
I can play in the match.

156
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,007
Here, here.

157
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:42,688
Liuliu, Liuliu.

158
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:43,527
Over here.

159
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:55,287
Pick it up.

160
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,248
Take it.

161
00:11:06,728 --> 00:11:07,488
Over here.

162
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,167
Here, pass it to me.

163
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:10,848
Come on, pass the frisbee.

164
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:33,368
Too high.

165
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,208
Down the field. Go.

166
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:07,527
Everyone, take a break and rehydrate.

167
00:12:12,527 --> 00:12:15,848
You lucky dawg.
I can see that Liuliu likes you.

168
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:17,047
Ask her out.

169
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:21,167
Nonsense. I haven't even
known her that long.

170
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:24,767
Here we go again,
always backing off when it gets serious.

171
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,488
True love waits for no one.

172
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:30,848
Time to free yourself from
your "no marriage" philosophy.

173
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:32,927
Without love and marriage,

174
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:34,568
life is incomplete.

175
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:38,688
What, like you're complete now?

176
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,568
I will be soon.

177
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:45,208
My fiance is coming back
from abroad next month.

178
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:46,527
Really?

179
00:12:46,968 --> 00:12:49,248
I'll invite all our classmates
to dinner then.

180
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,287
Remember to bring Liuliu.

181
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:05,208
Mom, I'm all better now.

182
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:06,887
Ke, you're awesome.

183
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,927
I can eat ice cream now
without getting diarrhea.

184
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:14,167
You're just looking for an excuse
to eat ice cream, aren't you?

185
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:14,848
It's true.

186
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:17,887
Aunt Gao gave me
four ice cream mooncakes that day.

187
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:20,167
I didn't get diarrhea, did I?

188
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:25,208
Aunt Gao gave you
four ice cream mooncakes?

189
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,167
When did that happen?

190
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,328
Was it the day you had a fever?

191
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:37,368
Ke, be an honest child

192
00:13:37,488 --> 00:13:41,167
and tell mommy what's the deal
with those four ice cream mooncakes.

193
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:44,728
And how did you end up
soaked in water that day?

194
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:49,248
Tell mommy.

195
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:52,848
Mom, please don't be mad.

196
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:56,608
I won't, but you must tell the truth.

197
00:13:58,368 --> 00:14:02,287
Aunt Gao gave Guo
the ice cream mooncakes.

198
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:03,968
I wanted to eat some too.

199
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,088
So, she gave me four.

200
00:14:07,608 --> 00:14:10,208
She was holding a big kettle.

201
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:14,647
I don't know how it happened.
It just spilled all over me.

202
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:18,848
So, she poured water on you, right?

203
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:24,887
Mom, please don't blame Aunt Gao, okay?

204
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:26,527
I promised her.

205
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:29,848
We are not telling anyone about it.

206
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:32,927
If I tell anyone, I'd be a snitch.

207
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,688
Aunt Gao was nice to me.

208
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:38,728
She took me and Daddy to get burgers,

209
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:41,927
and bought us fried chicken too.

210
00:14:58,368 --> 00:14:59,167
What's up?

211
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:01,848
Come here.

212
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,448
What are you doing? Gu Moli?

213
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,167
Giving you what you deserve.

214
00:15:15,488 --> 00:15:17,728
What kind of person bullies children
behind their parents?

215
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:19,047
What do you mean?

216
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:21,287
You knew my daughter
can't have ice cream.

217
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,647
And you gave her
four ice cream mooncakes.

218
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,448
And you deliberately
spilled water all over her.

219
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:30,328
That's not what happened.

220
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:31,848
It was an accident.

221
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,088
You know very well
whether it was an accident or not.

222
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:38,767
And you told her not to say anything?
Do you have no shame?

223
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:42,767
Nothing to say now, huh?

224
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:46,848
Gao Xiajing,
you should be thankful to Ke.

225
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:49,208
She said she likes Aunt Gao,

226
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,448
and even asked me not to
confront you in person.

227
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:56,728
For Ke's sake,
I won't tell the teacher about this.

228
00:15:57,328 --> 00:15:58,968
And I won't tell the children

229
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:02,328
that there's woman named Gao Xiajing
who specifically preys on children.

230
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:09,807
Remember this.

231
00:16:10,248 --> 00:16:11,807
If you dare to touch my daughter again,

232
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:13,848
it won't be water I'm throwing.

233
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:39,807
Coming.

234
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:49,208
I was wondering...

235
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
Can we talk?

236
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,408
Forget what happened the other day.

237
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:07,968
We're all adults here.
No need to beat around the bush.

238
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,968
Wang Lingxiao, relax.

239
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:13,728
I still think that
I might have left too hastily that day,

240
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:15,128
causing you to misunderstand.

241
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:16,807
It looked like I was running away.

242
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,928
But, I really had
a phone meeting with a client.

243
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:21,408
It's not an excuse. It's true.

244
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:23,208
Now, there's plenty of time.

245
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:25,488
What do you want to say? Apologize?

246
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,968
It was consensual.
You did nothing wrong.

247
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,208
No need to apologize.

248
00:17:30,408 --> 00:17:33,007
Or somehow you feel
that you're responsible for me?

249
00:17:34,168 --> 00:17:35,968
I'd be thankful
it's not the other way around.

250
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:39,527
I don't want to settle for less
when it comes to relationships.

251
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:43,367
Nor do I want to change your views
on marriage because of what happened.

252
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:50,607
Say something.

253
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:54,047
You've said everything I wanted to say.

254
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:57,607
But if you're really that relaxed,

255
00:17:57,607 --> 00:17:59,087
why did you delete me on WeChat?

256
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:03,248
No hesitation.
It only shows I'm calm and relaxed.

257
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:12,968
Liuliu, I feel quite comfortable
when I'm with you.

258
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,128
I know you don't dislike me.

259
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,847
But you don't ever want a marriage.

260
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:19,488
I like you a lot too.

261
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:21,607
But I haven't lost my senses.

262
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:23,488
I want this to go to somewhere.

263
00:18:24,648 --> 00:18:25,648
Can you give me what I want?

264
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:27,807
But,

265
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:31,607
must we talk about the end
when something has just begun?

266
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:35,327
Stop talking.
You'll start to sound like a scumbag.

267
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:37,607
I'm not as bad as you think.

268
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,648
Well, what you said just now
did sound like

269
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:45,448
I want to keep the relationship
without taking responsibility.

270
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:48,287
Actually, what I meant was....

271
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:50,208
Alright, I was joking.

272
00:18:51,248 --> 00:18:52,527
I know you're not.

273
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:55,728
Let's turn the page on this matter.

274
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:59,408
And end things on good terms.

275
00:19:15,728 --> 00:19:17,408
In intimate relationships,

276
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:21,607
whenever lies are discovered,
suspicion arises.

277
00:19:22,888 --> 00:19:24,688
Perhaps you can make up at the time.

278
00:19:25,408 --> 00:19:27,287
But the problem doesn't end there.

279
00:19:28,087 --> 00:19:31,527
Because, unconsciously,
your brain will start to overanalyze.

280
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:35,527
Every word he has said,
every action he has taken,

281
00:19:35,928 --> 00:19:37,527
even every single gesture,

282
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:39,767
and expression is being scrutinized.

283
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:43,488
You will become suspicious,

284
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:46,488
wondering if it's sincere or an act,

285
00:19:46,488 --> 00:19:49,648
and whether it's heartfelt or a lie.

286
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:55,168
It makes all caring
seem ill-intentioned.

287
00:19:56,888 --> 00:19:58,087
Over time,

288
00:19:58,888 --> 00:20:02,527
the suspicion turns
into a splinter in your heart.

289
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,087
Until it is removed,

290
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:08,168
no matter how you disguise it, it hurts.

291
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:12,488
So, when suspicion occurs,

292
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,607
you should make up your mind
to remove the splinter immediately.

293
00:20:19,047 --> 00:20:22,408
Of course,
it's always easier said than done.

294
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:24,607
Since it's just a guess,

295
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:28,847
how many people have the courage
to confront it face-to-face?

296
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:35,808
(The Heart Suspects)

297
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:40,607
Alright, class.

298
00:20:40,728 --> 00:20:43,448
That's all we have to learn today.

299
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:46,168
So, as per tradition,

300
00:20:46,168 --> 00:20:48,527
at this point in our course,

301
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:52,287
we should hold a review exhibition.

302
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:56,128
The time is set for this weekend.

303
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:58,168
Everyone is welcome to

304
00:20:58,168 --> 00:21:01,527
bring along their family

305
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:02,847
to the exhibition.

306
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,047
So that they will see for themselves

307
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:07,688
the fruits of our recent learning.

308
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:10,928
To be frank, it's just a big party.

309
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:14,128
To quote General Han Xin,
the more the merrier.

310
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:15,567
Bring as more people as you can.

311
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:16,688
Let's make a big party, shall we?

312
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:17,367
Yeah.

313
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,287
I hope that everyone in my class

314
00:21:21,728 --> 00:21:27,168
can really boost the hype
for this exhibition, alright?

315
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,928
Will do.

316
00:21:28,928 --> 00:21:30,007
No problem.

317
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:30,888
Class dismissed.

318
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:32,007
- Great.
- Great.

319
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,728
What photography exhibition?

320
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:45,488
It's just a bunch of retirees

321
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:49,208
getting together
and talking each other up.

322
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,208
So childish.

323
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:54,448
What am I doing every day?

324
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:58,767
Reading, calligraphy, exercising.

325
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:01,007
I'm so busy that
my feet hardly touch the ground.

326
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:03,327
Let alone I have no time,

327
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:06,567
even if I do,
I wouldn't attend such a boring event.

328
00:22:12,928 --> 00:22:13,648
Liuliu,

329
00:22:14,007 --> 00:22:16,047
HR is in your office with the new guy.

330
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:16,688
I see.

331
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:17,367
Okay.

332
00:22:22,728 --> 00:22:25,767
Ms. Shen, the new marketing specialist
is here for the interview.

333
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:27,248
Just finished the due procedure.

334
00:22:29,928 --> 00:22:30,968
Hello, Ms. Shen.

335
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:37,128
Son.

336
00:22:37,448 --> 00:22:40,087
Your dad can't go.

337
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:42,287
I think it's great.

338
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:44,847
I don't want him to meet Moli's family.

339
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:46,287
They might start arguing again.

340
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,128
Now that he's not going. You should.

341
00:22:48,928 --> 00:22:50,728
Come to support your mother.

342
00:22:50,728 --> 00:22:54,047
Mom, I have a meeting this weekend
and won't be back until the evening.

343
00:22:54,047 --> 00:22:55,807
I can't make it to your exhibition.

344
00:22:56,847 --> 00:22:58,847
Well, guess what?

345
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:01,488
My works will be the star of the show.

346
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,767
Plus, Moli's family will be there.

347
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:06,888
I can't afford to lose face this time.

348
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:10,327
Your former mother-in-law

349
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:14,087
is acting all cocky
because they bought a house.

350
00:23:14,648 --> 00:23:15,928
You must come.

351
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,968
You're the only thing
I can brag about now.

352
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:20,128
Anyway, I don't care

353
00:23:20,248 --> 00:23:22,928
if you have to crawl your way back.
You will be there.

354
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,208
Is your meeting really that important?

355
00:23:39,728 --> 00:23:41,287
Think about when you were a child.

356
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:43,248
Whenever you got a bump or a scrape

357
00:23:43,248 --> 00:23:44,648
or got into a fight with other kids,

358
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:47,168
didn't your mom always take a leave
to pick you up from school?

359
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:49,888
And the parent-teacher meetings.

360
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,208
She never missed one.

361
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:54,488
Whenever you received a reward in school

362
00:23:54,488 --> 00:23:56,688
and wanted to share
with your parents at home,

363
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:59,367
what would you have thought
if your mom weren't there for you?

364
00:23:59,928 --> 00:24:02,287
It's your turn to be there for her now.

365
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:05,607
How can you be
so indifferent and not care?

366
00:24:06,688 --> 00:24:09,367
What's wrong? Why aren't you speaking?

367
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,527
You're upset because
I scolded you a little?

368
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:15,128
Well, I just feel that me, her son

369
00:24:15,248 --> 00:24:18,527
doesn't even care as much as
a former daughter-in-law.

370
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:19,847
It's my fault.

371
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:22,007
This photography exhibition,

372
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,847
I'll be there even if it means
I have to quit my job.

373
00:24:25,488 --> 00:24:26,807
That's more like it.

374
00:24:29,488 --> 00:24:31,928
Turn the camera around
and let me see your room.

375
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,047
What? Are you checking up on me?

376
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:34,807
Yes, I am.

377
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:36,567
No. Forget it.

378
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:37,968
Why not?

379
00:24:38,168 --> 00:24:40,128
Do you have someone in your room?

380
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:41,888
What are you talking about?

381
00:24:42,488 --> 00:24:43,607
Enough with the jokes.

382
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,688
Then why won't you show me?
Something must be off.

383
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:47,488
Fine, take a look.

384
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:12,448
Nothing.

385
00:25:14,128 --> 00:25:18,767
Moli, you seem rather skeptical lately.

386
00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:21,408
That's because you are
too far away from me.

387
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:25,624
(Mr. Bai)

388
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:29,408
Whose call is it?

389
00:25:29,968 --> 00:25:31,248
It's from Mr. Bai.

390
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:33,087
How about I answer his call first?

391
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,367
It's the middle of the night.
What could he possibly want?

392
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,448
Are you a slave to him?

393
00:25:36,527 --> 00:25:38,087
Worse than that.

394
00:25:38,968 --> 00:25:39,728
Goodnight.

395
00:25:39,928 --> 00:25:40,767
Goodnight.

396
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:59,128
- Busy, huh?
- Morning.

397
00:26:00,807 --> 00:26:01,567
Morning.

398
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:14,847
Come in.

399
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:24,087
Already busy so early in the morning?

400
00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:31,287
I made you lunch. Filled with love.

401
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:38,367
The chopsticks are here.

402
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:43,128
Carbs, protein, vitamins.

403
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:45,527
Plus a little surprise.

404
00:26:49,047 --> 00:26:50,327
Yogurt.

405
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:52,767
I've already eaten, thank you.

406
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:56,527
We've already gone over
the forum proposal once.

407
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,367
Hand over the slides to me
as soon as they're ready.

408
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,648
I'll bring them right now.

409
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,367
Wait, take this with you.

410
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:15,728
Aren't you gonna take a bite at least?

411
00:27:29,327 --> 00:27:32,007
I'll leave the yogurt.
Don't forget to drink it.

412
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:39,168
Try to take a break from work.

413
00:27:48,888 --> 00:27:50,087
Who hasn't had breakfast?

414
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:51,648
- Me.
- Me, me.

415
00:27:55,248 --> 00:27:56,607
I only have one.

416
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:09,327
Welcome.

417
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:12,287
Everyone, thank you for
joining Li Rui and me

418
00:28:12,327 --> 00:28:14,087
for our 20th anniversary.

419
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:16,728
Twenty years, the Porcelain Marriage.

420
00:28:17,408 --> 00:28:19,567
The porcelain here doesn't mean fragile,

421
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:21,888
but a symbol of preciousness.

422
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:25,007
In the West,
even if the porcelain is shattered,

423
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:27,847
the fragments would be used as ornament,

424
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:29,847
cherishingly inlaid in jewelry.

425
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:31,567
As you all know me.

426
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:34,168
I have more flaws than virtues.

427
00:28:35,168 --> 00:28:36,527
Except I do have the best luck,

428
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:40,767
to be able to marry
such a wonderful woman.

429
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:46,208
Without my wife's care and help
managing things back home,

430
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:47,928
I wouldn't be where I am today.

431
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:50,807
So today, in front of everyone,

432
00:28:50,968 --> 00:28:52,208
I'd like to say,

433
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:54,767
thank you, honey.

434
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:56,888
I love you.

435
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,408
I love you too.

436
00:29:06,128 --> 00:29:07,767
You gave me a scare.

437
00:29:09,847 --> 00:29:12,807
Today, I'd like to thank
one person especially.

438
00:29:12,807 --> 00:29:14,688
That is Miss Gu Moli.

439
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:18,728
Because she helped us
find this quiet little yard.

440
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:22,888
Now Yan Li can finally settle down
to do his creative work.

441
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,847
The city is bustling with activities,

442
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,448
but it's also exhausting and turbulent.

443
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,408
We still prefer this serene haven.

444
00:29:31,287 --> 00:29:33,128
Thank you, Moli, thanks.

445
00:29:33,168 --> 00:29:35,607
Are there any more
courtyards like this around here?

446
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,448
I would also like to
come here for some tranquility.

447
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:39,087
Yes, of course there are.

448
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:41,087
Everyone is welcome
to move into this neighborhood.

449
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:43,488
Just ask Moli to hook you up.

450
00:29:43,488 --> 00:29:44,527
Yes, ask me.

451
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:45,488
Alright.

452
00:29:57,767 --> 00:29:58,648
Liuliu.

453
00:29:58,648 --> 00:29:59,928
Coffee or tea?

454
00:29:59,968 --> 00:30:01,648
The milk tea is homemade.

455
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:03,087
No tea essence or non-dairy creamer.

456
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:04,888
I'm on a diet. No sweet drinks for me.

457
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:06,408
This contains zero-calorie. Have some.

458
00:30:06,408 --> 00:30:07,928
Zero-calorie sugar is even less healthy.

459
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:08,847
None of this then.

460
00:30:10,128 --> 00:30:11,128
Black coffee.

461
00:30:11,607 --> 00:30:13,287
I ground it myself. Try some.

462
00:30:13,488 --> 00:30:15,047
I am also cutting back on caffeine.

463
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,168
But you must drink something, right?

464
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:19,527
I have it here.

465
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:23,367
Herbal tea. How could I forget?

466
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:26,047
Huang Qianniu, are you here to work
or to kiss my butt?

467
00:30:26,448 --> 00:30:27,928
Enough with this circus.

468
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:29,248
Is the proposal ready?

469
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:30,448
There you go.

470
00:30:34,448 --> 00:30:37,248
Well formatted with clear ideas.

471
00:30:37,248 --> 00:30:38,248
Rest assured.

472
00:30:38,287 --> 00:30:42,087
I never drop the ball
with tasks assigned to me.

473
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:45,128
Oh, I have a new task for you.

474
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:47,208
Contact these people on the list.

475
00:30:47,248 --> 00:30:48,208
Alright.

476
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,248
Try to secure at least one of them.

477
00:30:53,327 --> 00:30:57,087
Liuliu, these are all big shots
in the industry.

478
00:30:57,968 --> 00:31:00,408
I can't do this alone.

479
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:02,208
Whatever. You still have to try.

480
00:31:03,448 --> 00:31:05,248
After you finish the work at hand,

481
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,968
you need to find something else to do.

482
00:31:07,047 --> 00:31:08,888
It's the only way to improve yourself.

483
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:09,807
Do you understand?

484
00:31:09,807 --> 00:31:10,448
I understand.

485
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:15,367
I'll keep myself busy.

486
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:18,248
Liuliu, that...

487
00:31:18,287 --> 00:31:21,527
I will add some goji berries
to that herbal tea later.

488
00:31:24,287 --> 00:31:25,367
- Coffee.
- Milk tea.

489
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:26,248
- Coffee.
- Milk tea.

490
00:31:26,248 --> 00:31:27,128
- Milk tea.
- Milk tea.

491
00:31:27,128 --> 00:31:28,007
Milk tea.

492
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:43,408
What's wrong, Rui?

493
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:46,888
That lawyer guy, Jiang Haitao,
seems quite concerned about you.

494
00:31:48,527 --> 00:31:49,408
What about him?

495
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:52,607
He called Yan Li several times
to ask about you.

496
00:31:52,648 --> 00:31:54,367
He just did it again.

497
00:31:54,888 --> 00:31:56,327
What's the deal with you two?

498
00:31:58,087 --> 00:31:59,807
There's nothing going on between us.

499
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:01,527
How is that possible?

500
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:04,888
Moli, you're divorced now.

501
00:32:04,968 --> 00:32:07,448
So is Jiang.

502
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:09,847
You two are a perfect match,
both talented and good-looking.

503
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:11,367
Don't be shy.

504
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:14,248
Sometimes, missing a good man

505
00:32:14,248 --> 00:32:16,168
means missing a lifetime of happiness.

506
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:19,128
Please, Rui. Don't play matchmaker.

507
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:21,448
It's absolutely impossible
between Jiang Haitao and me.

508
00:32:21,847 --> 00:32:23,248
Let me explain.

509
00:32:23,287 --> 00:32:26,047
Although I got a divorce certificate
with my husband Zhu Jincao,

510
00:32:26,047 --> 00:32:28,087
we have made commitments to each other.

511
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:30,168
In fact, it's just a nominal divorce.

512
00:32:30,968 --> 00:32:32,648
What do you mean by nominal divorce?

513
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:35,248
It means a fake divorce.

514
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:37,287
Shen Liuliu is so unfair.

515
00:32:37,648 --> 00:32:39,007
She can't find any guests for the forum,

516
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:40,488
but she wouldn't let me take over.

517
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:44,168
At her age, instead of getting married
or having children,

518
00:32:44,728 --> 00:32:47,047
she works overtime every day
to stay in the game. What for?

519
00:32:47,047 --> 00:32:48,248
You're right.

520
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:58,527
Absolutely, Yang.

521
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:01,287
I joined her department
right after I came to the company.

522
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:03,248
And it is a freaking nightmare.

523
00:33:03,327 --> 00:33:05,688
After I finish the slides,
I have to fix the network cables.

524
00:33:05,688 --> 00:33:08,007
At the end of the day,
I must work over time with her too.

525
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,688
Having a boss whose entire life is work

526
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:12,968
is just terrible. Isn't it, Yang?

527
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:14,367
You bet.

528
00:33:14,928 --> 00:33:16,408
Unlike you,

529
00:33:17,448 --> 00:33:18,928
coming in late, leaving early,

530
00:33:19,168 --> 00:33:20,888
reading e-books at work,

531
00:33:20,968 --> 00:33:23,327
slacking off when there's nothing to do.

532
00:33:23,928 --> 00:33:25,607
The company even pays for your meals

533
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:26,928
and gasoline.

534
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:29,087
Could there be a better job?

535
00:33:30,047 --> 00:33:34,047
Yang, you are my career goal
in this company.

536
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:53,888
What's there to see?

537
00:33:56,488 --> 00:33:57,648
Is that her?

538
00:33:58,567 --> 00:33:59,208
Yes, that's right.

539
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:02,888
Overflowing with talent,
unique aesthetic taste.

540
00:34:04,047 --> 00:34:06,688
What, don't you trust my judgment?

541
00:34:06,688 --> 00:34:09,008
Please, I'm already here.

542
00:34:09,008 --> 00:34:11,168
Why didn't you
introduce Yan Li to me directly?

543
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:13,967
I only talk business
with those who call the shots.

544
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:17,248
That was so condescending.

545
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,287
I know you have
just returned from abroad.

546
00:34:19,327 --> 00:34:21,088
You definitely shouldn't believe

547
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:23,608
that the wicked ways of capitalism
are all-powerful.

548
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:25,728
Talking about money all the time.

549
00:34:25,728 --> 00:34:28,967
True artists won't bother
to talk money with you.

550
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:29,967
How vulgar.

551
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,608
If you want to buy
a really great painting,

552
00:34:32,807 --> 00:34:34,168
you should talk to her.

553
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:36,088
Even Yan Li listens to her.

554
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:44,847
Fine, then arrange a meeting
with her ASAP.

555
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:45,887
Bye.

556
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:57,367
Excuse me.

557
00:35:01,887 --> 00:35:02,807
What's this about?

558
00:35:03,287 --> 00:35:05,847
Here's the thing.
As a favor to a friend,

559
00:35:06,048 --> 00:35:08,128
I'd like to introduce you to a client.

560
00:35:08,528 --> 00:35:11,208
But you need to negotiate yourself
to make it happen.

561
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:14,168
Okay, thanks.

562
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:19,847
This will teach you to insult Liuliu.

563
00:35:19,847 --> 00:35:22,367
Go on, insult her.

564
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:25,287
I'll show you who's the real man.

565
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,568
One more. Let's go.

566
00:35:30,568 --> 00:35:32,407
Just one more.

567
00:35:32,608 --> 00:35:33,927
One more, come on.

568
00:35:34,447 --> 00:35:35,648
Come on.

569
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:38,648
Don't move.
I've recorded the whole thing.

570
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:40,287
Everyone, come and have a look.

571
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:42,088
Huang Qianniu from our company

572
00:35:42,088 --> 00:35:43,407
is deflating my tires on purpose.

573
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,128
He has done with two

574
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:45,528
and is now going for the third.

575
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:47,528
Come on, keep going.

576
00:35:47,528 --> 00:35:48,728
Do your thing.

577
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,688
You were up to no good
and I've caught you, haven't I?

578
00:35:54,168 --> 00:35:56,008
Go on, why did you stop?

579
00:35:58,927 --> 00:36:02,608
(There you have it.)

580
00:36:03,807 --> 00:36:05,447
(This will teach you to insult Liuliu.)

581
00:36:06,048 --> 00:36:07,327
(This will teach you to insult Liuliu.)

582
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:08,447
Liuliu.

583
00:36:08,447 --> 00:36:09,327
(Go on, insult her.)

584
00:36:09,327 --> 00:36:09,887
Check this out.

585
00:36:09,887 --> 00:36:12,528
(I'll show you who's the real man.)

586
00:36:16,128 --> 00:36:18,927
Huang Qianniu, did you do this?

587
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:23,168
Yes.

588
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:25,048
This is a first for our company.

589
00:36:25,048 --> 00:36:27,327
The number one requirement
for employees here,

590
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:28,887
besides being competent at their jobs,

591
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:30,887
is to be a decent person.

592
00:36:31,048 --> 00:36:32,728
Look what you've done.

593
00:36:33,008 --> 00:36:34,447
Your probation period isn't over yet.

594
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:36,648
And you're already threatening
the safety of colleagues.

595
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,887
For such disgraceful behavior,

596
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:40,048
there is nothing to discuss.

597
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:42,807
Go to HR later
and get your resignation process done.

598
00:36:44,088 --> 00:36:46,407
What do you have to say for yourself?
Go on.

599
00:36:46,608 --> 00:36:48,688
I did wrong and I accept my punishment.

600
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:51,528
But I can't stand
Yang slacking off at work

601
00:36:51,528 --> 00:36:53,648
or bad-mouthing my superior
behind her back.

602
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:55,407
That's why I lost control.

603
00:36:55,407 --> 00:36:57,088
I'm responsible for my own actions.

604
00:36:57,168 --> 00:36:58,648
I'll bear all the consequences.

605
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,927
Shen Liuliu, you are his supervisor.

606
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:04,088
What's your take on this matter?

607
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:06,168
According to the company's
rules and regulations,

608
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:08,927
Huang Qianniu must be fired.

609
00:37:10,887 --> 00:37:14,128
However, in regards to
inviting forum guests,

610
00:37:14,128 --> 00:37:15,847
he has done quite an impressive job.

611
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:19,008
Maybe his pros can balance out the cons?

612
00:37:21,008 --> 00:37:23,767
After all, he is Wang Lingxiao's cousin.

613
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:30,088
Fine, considering that Ms. Shen
is pleading on your behalf,

614
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:31,847
I will give you one last chance.

615
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:35,407
But you must make
a formal apology to Yang.

616
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:38,287
We'll see your performance in probation
and this will never happen again.

617
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:43,208
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

618
00:37:55,327 --> 00:37:59,327
Liuliu, I'm sorry.

619
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:01,887
Take a seat first.

620
00:38:11,008 --> 00:38:13,528
How many jobs have you got in Shanghai?

621
00:38:16,008 --> 00:38:17,048
About a dozen.

622
00:38:17,048 --> 00:38:18,728
Was it always easy to find a job?

623
00:38:19,608 --> 00:38:21,728
Have you ever thought about
why you got fired each time?

624
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,447
Huang Qianniu,
you're not getting any younger.

625
00:38:24,648 --> 00:38:26,887
You can't always get by on being clever.

626
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,048
Because of Moli and Zhu Jincao,

627
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:32,128
we are not just colleagues
but also friends.

628
00:38:32,568 --> 00:38:35,367
I don't care what your purpose was
coming to this company.

629
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:37,528
Now that you've gone to
such effort to be here,

630
00:38:37,688 --> 00:38:41,008
you must work hard
and abide by the rules.

631
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:44,528
You must adapt to the survival rules
of this kind of workplace.

632
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:48,688
Here, compassion doesn't matter.
Only performance is recognized.

633
00:38:48,847 --> 00:38:51,447
If you don't want to hear criticism,

634
00:38:51,447 --> 00:38:55,128
you must shut them up with achievements.

635
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:57,887
If you want to survive here,

636
00:38:57,927 --> 00:39:00,927
you need to mature up
and be more reliable.

637
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:07,407
I'm sorry.

638
00:39:07,487 --> 00:39:09,367
I don't want to hear "I'm sorry" again.

639
00:39:09,528 --> 00:39:12,728
I want to hear "I got this".

640
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:14,648
Anyway,

641
00:39:14,807 --> 00:39:16,487
you are a member of my team.

642
00:39:16,608 --> 00:39:18,608
Our top priority now

643
00:39:19,367 --> 00:39:21,447
is to make this forum work.

644
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:23,407
And it'd better outdo the last one.

645
00:39:27,528 --> 00:39:31,927
Liuliu, I know what to do now.

646
00:39:35,008 --> 00:39:35,927
I got this.

647
00:39:49,528 --> 00:39:50,327
This way, please.

648
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:55,048
Such a remote location.

649
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,327
It's a private club owned by Mr. Zhou.

650
00:39:57,327 --> 00:39:59,407
He conducts his business here.
Outsiders can't get in.

651
00:39:59,487 --> 00:40:00,927
The place is huge for sure.

652
00:40:01,048 --> 00:40:02,887
Mr. Zhou is young and successful.

653
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:06,208
His motto is "be second to none
in the industry". Please.

654
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:15,568
Hi, I am Gu Moli.

655
00:40:16,608 --> 00:40:17,287
Hello.

656
00:40:19,048 --> 00:40:20,887
I'm a broker of Flying Bird Gallery.

657
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,367
This is my business card.

658
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:27,088
Flying Bird Gallery.

659
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,208
It has quite a presence.

660
00:40:29,487 --> 00:40:32,967
By the way,
how much does your boss earn?

661
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:34,327
Is it enough to pay the rent?

662
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:38,608
I'm Yan Li's broker.

663
00:40:38,887 --> 00:40:40,608
Yan Li, I know.

664
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,248
Not worthy of his status,
and has a bad temper.

665
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:47,728
His works are just so-so.

666
00:40:48,008 --> 00:40:51,367
The prices are inflated,
obviously hyped up.

667
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:54,168
Mr. Yan Li is an artist
I respect deeply.

668
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,327
And you keep slandering him.

669
00:40:56,608 --> 00:40:59,648
It seems I've come
to the wrong place. Goodbye.

670
00:40:59,927 --> 00:41:01,367
Sorry, sorry.

671
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,487
You both have arrived.

672
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:05,608
There was an ugly argument
at the board meeting.

673
00:41:05,608 --> 00:41:07,208
It gave me a terrible headache.

674
00:41:07,728 --> 00:41:08,887
Sorry for the delay.

675
00:41:08,887 --> 00:41:09,807
It's alright.

676
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,327
You are Zhou Yu.

677
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:14,887
Yes, I am.

678
00:41:18,048 --> 00:41:19,287
My family name is Ai.

679
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:21,767
Everyone in the circle calls me Big Ai.

680
00:41:22,168 --> 00:41:25,568
Mr. Zhou, my pleasure.
You truly are a young entrepreneur.

681
00:41:25,927 --> 00:41:26,608
Please.

682
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:28,287
Please.

683
00:41:43,648 --> 00:41:45,128
Let's skip the formalities.

684
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,128
I don't have much time,
so let's get straight to the point.

685
00:41:47,248 --> 00:41:48,887
I invited both of you here

686
00:41:48,887 --> 00:41:50,887
to hear your opinions

687
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,608
to see whose ideas I agree on more.

688
00:41:55,568 --> 00:41:57,128
So this is an open bidding?

689
00:41:57,128 --> 00:41:58,407
That's one way to understand it.

690
00:41:59,008 --> 00:42:01,048
Sorry, I'm too busy

691
00:42:01,168 --> 00:42:02,927
to talk with you one by one.

692
00:42:03,008 --> 00:42:03,528
Right.

693
00:42:04,287 --> 00:42:06,008
I've taken an interest
in Gu Xi's works recently.

694
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,927
I was wondering which one of you
can help me with that.

695
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:12,648
This Gu Xi, he's...

696
00:42:14,008 --> 00:42:17,487
Gu Xi's old works
are frequently seen at auctions.

697
00:42:17,487 --> 00:42:20,208
It depends on
your qualifications and budget.

698
00:42:20,327 --> 00:42:22,608
Even if you are qualified,
you might not be able to get it.

699
00:42:22,648 --> 00:42:25,327
For new works, there's a waiting list
for at least two years.

700
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:28,608
Young lady, what you just said

701
00:42:28,608 --> 00:42:30,807
clearly shows a lack of experience.

702
00:42:31,847 --> 00:42:33,967
If everything had to be done
by the book,

703
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:35,528
what do people need us brokers for?

704
00:42:36,248 --> 00:42:38,608
Mr. Zhou, I happen to be

705
00:42:38,648 --> 00:42:40,927
quite familiar with Gu Xi's works
and I know my way in.

706
00:42:41,608 --> 00:42:43,447
Just tell me which one you like,

707
00:42:43,688 --> 00:42:45,487
and I'll get it for you
within six months.

708
00:42:50,048 --> 00:42:51,208
Let me know your commission.

709
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,168
Flying Bird is an established gallery.
Everything is out in the open.

710
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:03,967
Two percent.

711
00:43:04,008 --> 00:43:07,248
As for me, I'm a freelance broker.

712
00:43:07,327 --> 00:43:10,008
With no family to support whatsoever.

713
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:13,168
One percent, Mr. Zhou.

714
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:16,128
Consider this a friendly offer
exclusively for you.
