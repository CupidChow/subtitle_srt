00:01:50,604 --> 00:01:52,485
Why don't you just answer the question?

20
00:01:52,804 --> 00:01:55,085
You just said your temper
hasn't changed at all.

21
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:56,205
What now?

22
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:59,285
The divorce crisis
has turned you into a coward?

Zhou Yu.

24
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:03,684
Have you read
too many romantic fictions?

25
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:05,365
You bought the gallery,

26
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:06,725
collected my works,

27
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:08,445
and wanted to hold an exhibition for me.

28
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:11,044
Do you realize
these tricks are outdated?

29
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,604
What do you want to do?

30
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:13,884
Yes.

31
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:16,285
I admit I like you.

32
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:17,644
And I want to pursue you.

33
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:19,845
But,

34
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:23,245
I'm more interested in your work.

35
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:24,845
Don't forget I'm a businessman.

36
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:27,005
I wouldn't joke about my own business.

37
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:28,764
I'm investing in you,

38
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:30,764
because you have investment value.

39
00:02:32,604 --> 00:02:33,845
Just because of this painting,

40
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:35,484
you think I have investment value?

41
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,525
I have an important friend who told me

42
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:42,044
that Gu Moli is very talented.

43
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:45,044
She has a dream to be an artistic.

44
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:46,565
Sooner or later,

45
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:49,324
she will become a great painter.

46
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,084
Who told you so?

47
00:02:53,364 --> 00:02:54,245
Jiang Haitao.

48
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:58,685
Remember.

49
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:00,805
A person's talent

50
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:02,364
does not belong to his own.

51
00:03:03,204 --> 00:03:04,405
So you have to learn to share.

52
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:10,965
Would you like to take a risk with me?

53
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:16,525
Do you dare

54
00:03:17,484 --> 00:03:19,685
to restart your new life?

55
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,285
Life

56
00:03:28,924 --> 00:03:30,525
is like a train,

57
00:03:31,084 --> 00:03:33,484
constantly stopping and starting,

58
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,685
with people getting on

59
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,445
and people getting off.

60
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:41,044
Some people

61
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:43,764
can see some scenery with you.

62
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:46,204
While others,

63
00:03:46,924 --> 00:03:48,525
even though they travel with you,

64
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:50,644
they always remain silent.

65
00:03:52,324 --> 00:03:54,044
In fact, many problems

66
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:56,044
between people happen

67
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,924
when it is time to get off,

68
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,604
they don't want to get off,

69
00:04:00,884 --> 00:04:02,764
or get off early

70
00:04:03,364 --> 00:04:04,805
when they shouldn't have.

71
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:08,685
In fact, life

72
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:11,525
is to take and give.

73
00:04:12,405 --> 00:04:13,364
Ever since

74
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:16,445
we got strategically divorced,

75
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:19,045
I thought my life with Moli

76
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:20,805
would get better and better.

77
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:23,404
But over time,

78
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:25,644
I found that the distance
between the two of us

79
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:27,605
starts to grow further apart.

80
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:30,245
Perhaps,

81
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:33,245
it's time for me to get off.

82
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:36,324
I have imagined countless

83
00:04:36,324 --> 00:04:37,844
scenes of parting.

84
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:40,925
But in reality, the parting

85
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:44,045
doesn't happen like

86
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:47,165
those beautiful and touching scenes

87
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:48,884
described in the poems.

88
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:51,324
It might

89
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:53,844
just happen

90
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:55,565
on an ordinary afternoon.

91
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:58,204
I say goodbye to her.

92
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:00,565
And the car

93
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:02,724
then drives away.

94
00:05:05,084 --> 00:05:06,084
But Moli,

95
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:08,724
I want to tell you

96
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:11,925
no matter how the world changes,

97
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,084
my heart

98
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,805
will always be with you.

99
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:26,360
=Simple Days=
(The Parting)

100
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:37,125
Okay, thank you.

101
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:44,884
Come on, have some noodles.

102
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:47,764
Stop.

103
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:50,125
Once I sent your CV to them,

104
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,165
many big companies
are scrambling for you.

105
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:54,045
I said, "Don't expect
to meet the expert that easily."

106
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:55,565
"Show your project to Mr. Zhu"

107
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:56,565
"to see if it's reliable,"

108
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,125
"to avoid wasting our time, right?"

109
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,005
Keep your voice down.

110
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:01,925
Tell me the truth.

111
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:04,245
There is no big company
that wants me, right?

112
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,324
How is that possible?
Of course there are many.

113
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:09,404
I just came out today in a hurry

114
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:10,844
and didn't bring information.

115
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:12,445
I'll have that sorted out
in a couple of days,

116
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:13,365
and I'll send it to you.

117
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:15,005
Just tell me

118
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:17,284
what companies want me now.

119
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:19,605
Some small companies.

120
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:20,524
What are they?

121
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:21,884
Outsourcing companies.

122
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:23,045
Bring me the information.

123
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:24,605
There's no need.

124
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:25,404
Information.

125
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:36,764
This is all.

126
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,685
(Bank Smart Counter Project)
Location is Wuxi.

127
00:06:44,685 --> 00:06:46,445
For six months.
With food and accommodation.

128
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:48,964
Two to three years
of programming experience is required.

129
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:50,925
Willing to work overtime.
Monthly salary of 15,000 yuan.

130
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:51,844
Bro.

131
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:55,045
I don't think
you need to be in that rush.

132
00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:57,245
Just think of it as a vacation.

133
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:00,605
Why go to such an outsourcing company?

134
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:01,644
It's pretty good.

135
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:03,125
Who should I contact?

136
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:05,724
Do you really want to go?

137
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:08,764
If you want to go,

138
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:10,045
I can hook you up.

139
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:12,365
That's the one. Thank you.

140
00:07:32,204 --> 00:07:33,724
What are you doing standing here?

141
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,125
I'm admiring the scenery.

142
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:45,284
Did you have a breakup too?

143
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:51,365
How did you know?

144
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:54,485
People of our age in Shanghai

145
00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:57,245
should be so busy at work.

146
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,445
No one would have time
to come here and admire the scenery.

147
00:08:01,324 --> 00:08:02,925
Do you see that windmill over there?

148
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:07,884
Do you know how many times
it turns in a minute?

149
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:09,565
How would I know?

150
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,724
Then you count it.

151
00:08:20,764 --> 00:08:22,685
Liulian Education Consultancy.

152
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:24,245
Nice.

153
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:26,324
When did you change it into an office?

154
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:27,644
How is it?

155
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:30,404
No offense.

156
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:32,604
You got fat.

157
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,765
I ate much.

158
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:37,045
I start a business

159
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:38,204
and work from home,

160
00:08:38,204 --> 00:08:39,165
so I get fat from overwork.

161
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:41,844
What are you doing here?

162
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:47,084
What's wrong?

163
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:49,844
Annoyed.

164
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:52,285
Zhu Jincao has caused trouble again?

165
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:53,604
Not Zhu Jincao.

166
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:56,405
I recently had an opportunity.

167
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,084
Maybe I can stop being an agent.

168
00:08:59,324 --> 00:09:01,405
Someone wants to hire me
as a professional painter.

169
00:09:01,484 --> 00:09:03,484
Congratulations.

170
00:09:03,724 --> 00:09:04,885
Well.

171
00:09:05,324 --> 00:09:07,445
The point is that the guy
who wants to hire me

172
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:09,204
is kind of into me,

173
00:09:09,405 --> 00:09:11,084
and he is younger than me.

174
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:13,124
If I say yes,

175
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:14,565
what if he tries

176
00:09:14,565 --> 00:09:15,565
to pursue me?

177
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:16,925
Good.

178
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,285
A double harvest in career and life.

179
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:21,244
Don't be kidding.

180
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:23,964
My dream is about to come true.

181
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:25,724
I still feel a little uneasy.

182
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:28,204
To be honest,

183
00:09:28,565 --> 00:09:29,445
why do I have a feeling

184
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:31,565
about betraying Zhu Jincao?

185
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,604
Do you think I am being coward?

186
00:09:33,604 --> 00:09:34,484
Wait.

187
00:09:34,565 --> 00:09:37,724
This person who wants to hire you
is pursuing you.

188
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:38,844
I'm not sure.

189
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:41,364
But I'm not going to date him.

190
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:43,124
Put that aside.

191
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:45,604
First of all,

192
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:47,445
your career

193
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:48,964
has nothing to do with Zhu Jincao.

194
00:09:49,124 --> 00:09:50,765
Even though you're not into the guy

195
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:51,964
who wants to hire you,

196
00:09:52,084 --> 00:09:54,484
you still feel uneasy.

197
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:56,165
What a good woman.

198
00:09:57,525 --> 00:09:58,324
Moli.

199
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:00,445
You should drop everything

200
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:02,364
and become a painter.

201
00:10:03,324 --> 00:10:05,285
Nothing is more important than a dream.

202
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:06,445
Do you really think so?

203
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:07,204
Of course.

204
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:08,484
If you don't become a painter,

205
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:10,805
will that solve your problem
with Zhu Jincao?

206
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:12,244
If you become a painter,

207
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:15,364
do you have to date
the guy who hires you?

208
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:17,964
Becoming a painter

209
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:20,084
has nothing to do with love.

210
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:22,484
It's entirely up to you.

211
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:26,765
Tell me,

212
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:29,364
do you want to be a painter?

213
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,484
Sometimes life
is about seizing an opportunity.

214
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:35,364
If you seize it, you succeed.

215
00:10:36,204 --> 00:10:37,844
At least if you try,

216
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:39,565
you won't have regrets.

217
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:42,765
So you started your own business?

218
00:10:42,765 --> 00:10:43,445
Yes.

219
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:46,244
I don't want to have regrets.

220
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:51,324
You really are my bestie.

221
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:53,805
It makes me happy to talk to you.

222
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:55,844
I'd like to have a drink.

223
00:10:56,004 --> 00:10:56,844
Wait for me.

224
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:07,844
Why don't you drink?

225
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:09,004
I can't

226
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:11,165
I've been allergic recently.

227
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:12,844
Did you see a doctor?

228
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:13,645
I took medicine.

229
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:16,525
Tell me more.

230
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:19,045
Is the guy
who wants to hire you handsome?

231
00:11:30,604 --> 00:11:31,805
Did you count it clearly?

232
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:34,484
It's about 12 laps a minute.

233
00:11:34,604 --> 00:11:35,484
I'm not sure.

234
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:37,285
Well, then you should leave.

235
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:38,685
Why?

236
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:41,364
Bro, do you want me to be that frank?

237
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:44,844
If a heartbreak show is done
by two people together,

238
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:46,165
would it be a bit strange?

239
00:11:48,565 --> 00:11:49,525
Take your time.

240
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:50,885
Thank you.

241
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:52,165
I really didn't mean it.

242
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:55,844
She and I started right here.

243
00:11:56,805 --> 00:11:58,724
I promised her
that every year on this day,

244
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:01,565
I would bring her here
to relive the old memories.

245
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:03,525
But now I'm left alone.

246
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:07,004
Let's just say I'm completing
the heartbreak process.

247
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:08,484
I won't come next year.

248
00:12:08,805 --> 00:12:10,285
You give up the place to me.

249
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:11,765
Where are you going?

250
00:12:13,604 --> 00:12:15,124
Do what I should do today.

251
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:17,805
I don't want to wait until next year.

252
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:32,084
Have you made your mind?

253
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:34,525
I've opened the champagne.

254
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:37,724
If you'd like to take a risk with me,

255
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:39,565
we'll drink to celebrate.

256
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:42,484
Your artistic career from now on

257
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:43,805
and my love life will just

258
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:44,885
take their courses.

259
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:47,484
I won't back down or force you.

260
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:48,885
I'll always have your back.

261
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,565
I can take a step back.

262
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,084
If you don't want to take a risk,

263
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:08,324
then let's still have a drink

264
00:13:08,324 --> 00:13:09,204
politely.

265
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:13,324
You continue to be the best agent.

266
00:13:15,844 --> 00:13:17,045
But I ask you

267
00:13:18,285 --> 00:13:20,324
to discover a new talent every year,

268
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:24,124
like Yan Li.

269
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:27,805
Don't forget I'm a businessman.

270
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:31,244
I thought I told you this morning

271
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,484
that I was quitting.

272
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:34,525
No such option.

273
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,565
I want to take a risk.

274
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:51,445
Are you sure?

275
00:13:52,885 --> 00:13:53,925
I want to paint.

276
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:56,805
I want to restart my life.

277
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:00,925
Very good.

278
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:03,445
Come on.

279
00:14:06,285 --> 00:14:07,045
Trust me.

280
00:14:08,204 --> 00:14:10,285
You will have a brand new life.

281
00:14:14,484 --> 00:14:15,484
Mr. Zhu?

282
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:16,964
Want to get a drink together?

283
00:14:26,004 --> 00:14:28,084
Let's get acquainted.
My name is Zhou Yu.

284
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:31,805
I was Moli's client,

285
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,045
and now her new boss.

286
00:14:34,204 --> 00:14:35,244
This is my business card.

287
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:37,645
Zhu Jincao.

288
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:39,525
You may have heard

289
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:42,405
that I'm the one
that got bitten on the ass by the dog.

290
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:46,124
I'd like to talk to Moli.

291
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:54,964
Please step out for a moment.

292
00:14:57,525 --> 00:14:58,964
Why?

293
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:01,604
It's working hours,
and we are in a workplace.

294
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:03,165
In my office,

295
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:04,405
I am the boss.

296
00:15:04,885 --> 00:15:06,004
Why should I step out?

297
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:09,045
Come on, say what you want.

298
00:15:12,685 --> 00:15:13,685
I'm sorry.

299
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:16,204
Moli.

300
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:18,724
I came here today

301
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:20,604
just to ask you

302
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:23,045
if we could just start over.

303
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:28,445
I know our relationship

304
00:15:29,124 --> 00:15:30,565
is ruined.

305
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:34,445
I have no right to ask you to turn back.

306
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:38,045
Nor can I offer any guarantees.

307
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:41,405
But I don't want to give up.

308
00:15:43,604 --> 00:15:45,165
I want us to restart.

309
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:03,724
I also want to restart,

310
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:07,964
but not with you,

311
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:10,724
nor with him.

312
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:21,124
I just want to paint now.

313
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:25,484
I want to restart alone.

314
00:16:34,685 --> 00:16:35,484
I see.

315
00:16:36,925 --> 00:16:37,805
Mr. Zhu.

316
00:16:37,844 --> 00:16:38,844
Have a drink.

317
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:43,004
Moli.

318
00:16:46,244 --> 00:16:46,964
Where are you going?

319
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:49,004
It's working hours.

320
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:50,124
To paint, of course.

321
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:55,098

328

On the way back,

329
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:38,004
I've been thinking a lot.

330
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:42,724
I have so much to tell Moli.

331
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:44,605
I want to tell her,

332
00:17:46,284 --> 00:17:47,605
I'll send my dad

333
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:49,564
back to his hometown.

334
00:17:51,325 --> 00:17:53,605
I'll go to her parents and make amends.

335
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:55,685
I'll rent a big house

336
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:58,284
for our family.

337
00:17:58,964 --> 00:18:00,964
I'll try to find a new job

338
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:03,685
for our family.

339
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:05,165
I don't think Moli

340
00:18:05,645 --> 00:18:07,724
needs these things.

341
00:18:08,284 --> 00:18:10,165
No, more than that.

342
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:12,685
She wants to restart.

343
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:17,004
Restart...

344
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:22,365
I have nothing.

345
00:18:23,165 --> 00:18:25,204
What can I give her to restart?

346
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:27,645
I can only give her

347
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:32,325
is just a dull me,

348
00:18:33,004 --> 00:18:34,925
a dull life,

349
00:18:35,645 --> 00:18:36,645
and...

350
00:18:42,804 --> 00:18:44,004
Any wine?

351
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:45,764
Yes.

352
00:18:47,484 --> 00:18:48,365
Alright.

353
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,204
Drink less.

354
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:52,165
You've drunk so much.

355
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,125
Stop drinking.

356
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:57,004
Lingxiao, do you know?

357
00:18:57,284 --> 00:18:58,685
I remember I've told you.

358
00:18:58,685 --> 00:18:59,685
When I was in college,

359
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:00,564
the first time I saw her,

360
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:01,764
I was completely drenched in her.

361
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:06,445
I really liked her.

362
00:19:09,244 --> 00:19:10,405
I felt at the time...

363
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:13,524
I felt that my life

364
00:19:14,284 --> 00:19:16,325
was like a long

365
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:19,524
tunnel with no end in sight,

366
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:22,925
and it's so dark.

367
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:27,125
Until I met Moli,

368
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,764
she was like the light
at the end of the tunnel,

369
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:34,564
and illuminated my whole being.

370
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:36,925
I felt so happy every day

371
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,845
she was with me.

372
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:42,204
As long as she was with me,

373
00:19:42,204 --> 00:19:43,244
I could do anything.

374
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:44,804
No matter how hard I work,

375
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:46,764
I felt it was worth it.

376
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:00,044
But look at me now.

377
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:03,645
I don't deserve to love her anymore.

378
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:07,044
I am selfish.

379
00:20:07,044 --> 00:20:07,964
I am good for nothing.

380
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:09,564
I am full of bad habits.

381
00:20:11,564 --> 00:20:12,365
Even though I know

382
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:13,685
I am not worthy of her at all,

383
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:14,845
I still...

384
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:18,004
I still hope she can come back,

385
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,964
back to me.

386
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:25,925
I can't live without her.

387
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:30,405
But just now,

388
00:20:33,605 --> 00:20:35,125
I looked into her eyes,

389
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:41,964
yet I could say nothing.

390
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:11,044
Okay, okay.

391
00:21:25,004 --> 00:21:25,925
Jincao.

392
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:27,645
Drink.

393
00:21:57,365 --> 00:21:58,885
Jincao, wake up.

394
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:00,284
Your dad called

395
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:01,564
and asked you to go back.

396
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:03,685
Go wash your face to sober up.

397
00:22:08,645 --> 00:22:10,804
Lingxiao, have some honey water.

398
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,405
Feeling better? Have some water.

399
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:18,044
You're a grown-up now,

400
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:19,445
but still acting like a child.

401
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:21,325
Last night was special.

402
00:22:21,845 --> 00:22:23,484
You can't drink like that anymore.

403
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,925
After you got drunk yesterday,

404
00:22:27,244 --> 00:22:29,125
Lingxiao also

405
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:30,365
drank much.

406
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:32,165
I've been up all night cleaning up

407
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:33,284
and taking care of you.

408
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:36,004
You ate the most.

409
00:22:36,004 --> 00:22:37,125
You should clean up.

410
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,885
I hate to waste.

411
00:22:40,244 --> 00:22:41,804
You're all people

412
00:22:41,804 --> 00:22:43,284
with families and responsibilities.

413
00:22:43,284 --> 00:22:44,564
You can't do that anymore.

414
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:45,885
You need to take care of yourself.

415
00:22:48,524 --> 00:22:49,645
Why did he ask me back?

416
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:52,044
Why should I go back when he asks me to?

417
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,645
Because he's your dad.

418
00:22:54,004 --> 00:22:54,925
Not only you,

419
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:56,284
the two of us have to go.

420
00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:24,325
Open the door.

421
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:33,764
Dali.

422
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,125
All the kids are here now.

423
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:39,484
Just say what you want to.

424
00:23:41,405 --> 00:23:42,804
We're still one short.

425
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:45,125
Just wait.

426
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:50,605
Moli is no longer one of our family.

427
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:51,645
Don't harass her.

428
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:53,964
Look at him.

429
00:23:54,484 --> 00:23:56,764
This is the good son I've raised.

430
00:23:57,605 --> 00:23:59,764
Aren't you afraid they'll laugh at you?

431
00:24:01,244 --> 00:24:02,445
Sorry, I'm late.

432
00:24:02,445 --> 00:24:03,564
Moli, you are here.

433
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:04,845
Come on, sit down.

434
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,925
Give it to me.

435
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:13,405
Water.

436
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:21,004
Don't keep making eye contact.

437
00:24:21,445 --> 00:24:24,685
This is not allowed in the Zhu family.

438
00:24:29,085 --> 00:24:30,125
Ke's grandpa.

439
00:24:30,724 --> 00:24:32,764
You said there is something
important to announce

440
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,085
and I have to be here.

441
00:24:34,204 --> 00:24:35,044
Go ahead.

442
00:24:35,445 --> 00:24:36,605
Zhu Jincao.

443
00:24:36,804 --> 00:24:38,125
I hereby announce,

444
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:41,244
due to your many acts of defiance,

445
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:43,605
I'm severing all ties with you.

446
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:48,004
Severing all ties...

447
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,405
Letter to sever all ties.

448
00:24:53,964 --> 00:24:55,365
Effective from today,

449
00:24:55,605 --> 00:24:57,405
in the witness of my wife, Zhang Shanya,

450
00:24:57,564 --> 00:25:00,284
Zhu Jincao aunt's son, Wang Lingxiao,

451
00:25:00,484 --> 00:25:02,564
third aunt's son, Huang Qianniu

452
00:25:02,564 --> 00:25:06,165
and Zhu Jincao's ex-wife Gu Moli,

453
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:07,605
I, Zhu Dali,

454
00:25:07,845 --> 00:25:12,365
hereby sever any and all
legal and financial

455
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:15,405
and personal father-son ties
with Zhu Jincao.

456
00:25:15,445 --> 00:25:16,804
Let it be known to all.

457
00:25:17,004 --> 00:25:18,405
Wait. Dali, this...

458
00:25:18,925 --> 00:25:20,325
Do not interrupt.

459
00:25:27,284 --> 00:25:28,685
The following matters

460
00:25:28,685 --> 00:25:30,925
must be settled in one go.

461
00:25:31,004 --> 00:25:33,845
First, the property registered
to Zhu Jincao's name

462
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:36,405
is his marital home

463
00:25:36,484 --> 00:25:38,804
I purchased with my savings.

464
00:25:40,564 --> 00:25:43,044
Since our tie has been severed,

465
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:46,564
it shall not remain as his property.

466
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:50,044
Either Zhu Jincao within this month

467
00:25:50,044 --> 00:25:52,524
repays me at the market price

468
00:25:52,645 --> 00:25:55,004
for the amount paid for the property,

469
00:25:55,564 --> 00:25:59,085
or Zhu Jincao transfers the property

470
00:25:59,085 --> 00:26:00,445
back to me.

471
00:26:00,564 --> 00:26:02,925
All mortgage payments made
by Zhu Jincao and his ex-wife

472
00:26:02,925 --> 00:26:05,564
after their marriage,

473
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:10,284
will be calculated and reimbursed
to Zhu Jincao at the market price by me,

474
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:14,004
to demonstrate fairness.

475
00:26:14,204 --> 00:26:15,165
Go for the second point.

476
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:17,964
Second,

477
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:23,284
Zhu Jincao must move out
of this house within three days.

478
00:26:23,564 --> 00:26:24,244
Third,

479
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:26,325
the only daughter, Zhu Yike,

480
00:26:26,325 --> 00:26:28,284
between Zhu Jincao
and his ex-wife Gu Moli,

481
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:30,325
is one of the Zhu family,

482
00:26:30,365 --> 00:26:32,845
so she should be raised
by the Zhu family.

483
00:26:32,845 --> 00:26:33,685
No way.

484
00:26:33,685 --> 00:26:34,925
I have already said,

485
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:36,524
"Do not interrupt."

486
00:26:38,645 --> 00:26:39,685
Considering

487
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,764
the affection
between Ms. Gu and her daughter Ke.

488
00:26:42,764 --> 00:26:45,244
Thus, from Monday to Friday,

489
00:26:45,244 --> 00:26:47,724
Ke will live with the Zhu family.

490
00:26:48,284 --> 00:26:52,204
On weekends, Ke will live with her mom.

491
00:26:54,645 --> 00:26:56,085
That's settled then.

492
00:26:56,284 --> 00:26:57,244
Gu Moli.

493
00:26:57,524 --> 00:26:59,564
If you disagree with anything,

494
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:01,204
you can appeal

495
00:27:01,284 --> 00:27:02,925
and let the court judge.

496
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:04,484
I'm right here.

497
00:27:04,484 --> 00:27:05,484
I will.

498
00:27:06,804 --> 00:27:08,365
Even if Ke does not belong to me,

499
00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:10,405
she belongs to her dad, Zhu Jincao.

500
00:27:10,724 --> 00:27:13,484
And your severance letter

501
00:27:13,484 --> 00:27:14,925
has no legal effect.

502
00:27:15,645 --> 00:27:17,764
You don't have a say to this house.

503
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,044
Neither does the custody

504
00:27:19,044 --> 00:27:20,244
of my daughter.

505
00:27:28,284 --> 00:27:29,365
Are you done?

506
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:30,204
Yes.

507
00:27:30,204 --> 00:27:31,085
Gu Moli.

508
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:33,845
Don't think that I am senile.

509
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:36,325
This letter

510
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:38,445
is to tell you and Zhu Jincao

511
00:27:38,564 --> 00:27:40,724
that since you no longer
wish to live a good life,

512
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,165
this house has nothing to do with you.

513
00:27:43,365 --> 00:27:45,244
If you want to split the assets

514
00:27:45,244 --> 00:27:47,004
after the divorce,

515
00:27:47,004 --> 00:27:48,204
it's impossible.

516
00:27:48,204 --> 00:27:49,445
You're no longer one of us.

517
00:27:49,445 --> 00:27:50,925
Why would I care about you?

518
00:27:51,204 --> 00:27:52,204
Ridiculous.

519
00:27:52,284 --> 00:27:53,685
How dare you!

520
00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:06,885
Since I'm no longer
one of the Zhu family,

521
00:28:07,044 --> 00:28:08,724
I don't need to stay here.

522
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:10,405
Moli, Moli.

523
00:28:11,484 --> 00:28:14,004
Moli, we just found out
about this matter.

524
00:28:14,004 --> 00:28:15,804
Don't go and stay to talk it out.

525
00:28:15,804 --> 00:28:16,724
Okay?

526
00:28:18,004 --> 00:28:18,724
Moli.

527
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,764
It's none of your business.

528
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:23,044
You may go.

529
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,044
Wait, Moli.

530
00:28:30,284 --> 00:28:30,925
What's all these?

531
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:31,685
Uncle.

532
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:34,204
This is a big deal.

533
00:28:34,484 --> 00:28:35,964
I'm not qualified,

534
00:28:36,325 --> 00:28:39,125
nor obliged to bear witness.

535
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:41,445
I have things to do.
I'll take my leave first.

536
00:28:43,964 --> 00:28:44,845
Uncle.

537
00:28:45,204 --> 00:28:47,524
Indeed, this is a big deal.

538
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:49,925
If Jincao did anything wrong,

539
00:28:49,964 --> 00:28:51,284
you should just criticize him,

540
00:28:51,284 --> 00:28:52,284
or even scolding will do.

541
00:28:52,804 --> 00:28:53,204
Right.

542
00:28:53,204 --> 00:28:55,885
How can you sever all ties with him?

543
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:58,484
Since the two of you are leaving,

544
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,284
I won't see you out.

545
00:29:00,845 --> 00:29:02,204
Come by when you have time.

546
00:29:04,964 --> 00:29:05,845
Lingxiao.

547
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:08,244
Lingxiao.

548
00:29:09,685 --> 00:29:11,524
Take care, you two.

549
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:16,085
What do you mean?

550
00:29:16,484 --> 00:29:17,405
It's your own son.

551
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:18,845
How can you do so?

552
00:29:18,845 --> 00:29:19,804
What about me?

553
00:29:19,804 --> 00:29:20,845
You sever ties with him too.

554
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:21,925
No way.

555
00:29:21,964 --> 00:29:24,085
I gave birth to him.

556
00:29:24,085 --> 00:29:25,445
I can't be as ruthless as you.

557
00:29:25,445 --> 00:29:26,764
Shut up.

558
00:29:32,964 --> 00:29:34,085
Zhu Jincao.

559
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:36,804
When buying the house,

560
00:29:36,845 --> 00:29:38,284
I paid the down payment.

561
00:29:38,524 --> 00:29:40,405
The loan note is here.

562
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:42,804
Rest assured.

563
00:29:43,804 --> 00:29:45,564
I will repay every penny

564
00:29:45,925 --> 00:29:46,885
I owe you.

565
00:29:48,885 --> 00:29:49,685
Okay.

566
00:29:51,885 --> 00:29:53,804
Starting today,

567
00:29:54,524 --> 00:29:56,325
you and I go

568
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:58,925
separate ways.

569
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,044
But remember,

570
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:05,804
I'm always in charge of the Zhu family.

571
00:30:37,325 --> 00:30:38,004
Mom.

572
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:41,085
Son.

573
00:30:42,165 --> 00:30:44,484
Your dad is just like that.

574
00:30:44,764 --> 00:30:47,165
He'll probably be fine
in a couple of days.

575
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:48,645
Don't take this seriously.

576
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:50,004
Don't be mad.

577
00:30:52,044 --> 00:30:53,405
Mom. Let me tell you.

578
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:55,964
I found an outsourcing job in Wuxi,

579
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:57,605
with a nice salary.

580
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,724
Do you want to come with me?

581
00:30:59,764 --> 00:31:00,804
I'll take care of you.

582
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:07,405
I can't go.

583
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:09,605
I have to take care of Ke for Moli.

584
00:31:09,605 --> 00:31:11,645
Moli is so busy with work.

585
00:31:15,484 --> 00:31:16,165
Son.

586
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:18,645
Don't care about your dad.

587
00:31:19,764 --> 00:31:22,125
Where I am, that's where home is.

588
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:37,125
That's harsh.

589
00:31:38,365 --> 00:31:39,524
Can he even do like this?

590
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:41,885
He really is harsh.

591
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:43,044
That's harsh.

592
00:31:46,524 --> 00:31:48,085
I said Uncle is so harsh.

593
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:50,764
Let's put that aside.

594
00:31:51,445 --> 00:31:53,724
This morning you said I am a man
with a family and responsibilities.

595
00:31:53,804 --> 00:31:54,724
What do you mean?

596
00:31:55,645 --> 00:31:56,405
Did I say so?

597
00:31:56,405 --> 00:31:57,445
Yes.

598
00:31:58,325 --> 00:32:00,044
You're too sensitive. I was just saying.

599
00:32:02,284 --> 00:32:03,764
Is Shen Liuliu pregnant?

600
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:07,325
You've noticed?

601
00:32:07,764 --> 00:32:09,564
I can't tell when a woman is pregnant?

602
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:10,605
Am I that stupid?

603
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:11,405
What's more,

604
00:32:11,925 --> 00:32:14,004
you've been yelling at me a lot lately.

605
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,724
There must be a reason.

606
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:17,484
You are not that ruthless.

607
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:19,125
I've thought about it.

608
00:32:19,685 --> 00:32:21,564
If you're fooled by me and Liuliu,

609
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,964
then you can forget about this kid.

610
00:32:22,964 --> 00:32:24,204
I'll raise him all my life.

611
00:32:25,325 --> 00:32:28,484
So this baby is really mine?

612
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:30,605
Listen.

613
00:32:30,605 --> 00:32:31,964
You'd better pretend you don't know.

614
00:32:31,964 --> 00:32:34,004
You have to give Liuliu some time.

615
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:35,605
She might not accept you.

616
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:36,885
Do you understand?

617
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:39,405
You and Jincao

618
00:32:39,405 --> 00:32:40,204
are both making me

619
00:32:40,204 --> 00:32:41,764
so worried.

620
00:32:43,484 --> 00:32:44,204
Zhu Dali.

621
00:32:44,724 --> 00:32:46,484
You don't have a say for this.

622
00:32:47,484 --> 00:32:48,925
Can't you just accept it?

623
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:51,764
Are you going
to stand up for Zhu Jincao?

624
00:32:51,764 --> 00:32:54,804
Yes, I do want to stand up for my son.

625
00:32:55,004 --> 00:32:56,925
Just keep causing me troubles.

626
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:58,524
I'll be pissed off to death.

627
00:32:58,524 --> 00:32:59,405
Before it,

628
00:32:59,405 --> 00:33:00,804
you'd beat us to death first.

629
00:33:02,004 --> 00:33:04,524
You mention your family rules every day.

630
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,724
How many have you followed yourself?

631
00:33:05,724 --> 00:33:06,645
Tell me.

632
00:33:07,605 --> 00:33:08,885
Our in-laws

633
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:11,165
have higher status
and better conditions than you.

634
00:33:11,165 --> 00:33:13,284
Yet you're putting on airs around them.

635
00:33:13,564 --> 00:33:14,524
You have offended them,

636
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:15,365
yet you don't go to apologize.

637
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:16,685
It's in one of your family rules?

638
00:33:19,724 --> 00:33:20,925
Zhang Shanya.

639
00:33:21,204 --> 00:33:23,365
Don't you dare say one more word,

640
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:25,085
I sever all ties with you too.

641
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:27,685
Go ahead.

642
00:33:28,165 --> 00:33:29,484
I want to divorce you.

643
00:33:29,484 --> 00:33:30,365
How dare you!

644
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:31,244
Just hit!

645
00:33:32,204 --> 00:33:33,284
Beat me to death.

646
00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:35,685
I will divorce you even I die.

647
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:55,445
You said you were leaving.

648
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,204
Where are you going?

649
00:33:59,365 --> 00:34:02,244
Thank you for meeting me.

650
00:34:03,645 --> 00:34:04,885
Your dad is going crazy,

651
00:34:05,004 --> 00:34:06,405
but it has nothing to do with you.

652
00:34:09,124 --> 00:34:12,164
I'm always accountable
for what my dad did.

653
00:34:12,405 --> 00:34:14,044
I'm going to work out of town.

654
00:34:14,604 --> 00:34:15,964
There's an outsourced project in Wuxi.

655
00:34:15,964 --> 00:34:17,445
The terms offered are quite good.

656
00:34:20,365 --> 00:34:21,644
It seems

657
00:34:22,925 --> 00:34:26,164
the distance between us
is getting bigger.

658
00:34:30,044 --> 00:34:31,885
It's time to break up.

659
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:41,805
What do you mean?

660
00:34:43,684 --> 00:34:44,845
Get to the point.

661
00:34:48,084 --> 00:34:49,684
I called you out here

662
00:34:49,684 --> 00:34:51,604
to talk about our divorce.

663
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:54,245
When we got divorced,
it wasn't even a divorce.

664
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:56,405
The matter of property division,

665
00:34:57,405 --> 00:34:59,285
the custody of the child
and fees for child support,

666
00:34:59,805 --> 00:35:01,325
none of them have been settled.

667
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:04,285
It's not fair to you or to Ke.

668
00:35:12,205 --> 00:35:13,805
You want to divide property?

669
00:35:15,124 --> 00:35:16,084
What?

670
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:19,285
Were you inspired by your dad?

671
00:35:20,124 --> 00:35:21,885
My dad said the house
doesn't belong to you.

672
00:35:22,044 --> 00:35:23,524
That's just him talking to himself.

673
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:26,245
Whether I repay him the down payment,

674
00:35:26,684 --> 00:35:28,644
or he repays me back
the mortgage we paid,

675
00:35:29,325 --> 00:35:30,644
you have a share.

676
00:35:41,564 --> 00:35:44,044
Are you really
dividing property with me?

677
00:35:45,484 --> 00:35:46,604
And the custody.

678
00:35:49,004 --> 00:35:49,885
I agree

679
00:35:50,765 --> 00:35:51,885
Ke lives with you.

680
00:35:54,964 --> 00:35:56,564
This is the divorce settlement addendum.

681
00:35:56,885 --> 00:35:59,164
I'm done writing it and signing it.

682
00:36:14,245 --> 00:36:15,684
This is your guarantee to me?

683
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:17,325
You can think it in this way.

684
00:36:17,684 --> 00:36:18,644
I don't think it's enough.

685
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:19,725
What else do you want?

686
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:21,725
I don't care
how you divide it with your dad.

687
00:36:22,684 --> 00:36:23,644
About that house,

688
00:36:23,644 --> 00:36:26,205
in your share, there is half of mine.

689
00:36:26,325 --> 00:36:27,285
In that half of yours,

690
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,644
there is also half for Ke.

691
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:30,684
Do you understand what I mean?

692
00:36:30,765 --> 00:36:31,885
All mine goes to you.

693
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:33,445
I don't care how much you earn,

694
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:35,684
but every month you must
take out at least half for Ke.

695
00:36:35,684 --> 00:36:36,684
I agree.

696
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:38,644
I want you to not
have any children in the future.

697
00:36:38,644 --> 00:36:39,725
Ke is

698
00:36:39,725 --> 00:36:41,725
the only daughter you'll ever have.

699
00:36:42,365 --> 00:36:44,124
I want all these to be written in.

700
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:45,004
Okay.

701
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:51,845
You may go.

702
00:36:58,524 --> 00:36:59,245
Moli.

703
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,285
Don't be impulsive.

704
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:02,885
We must face...

705
00:37:02,885 --> 00:37:03,564
You leave now.

706
00:37:03,564 --> 00:37:05,325
I don't want to see you anymore.

Hello.

00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:37,205
Hello, what can I do for you?

746
00:39:37,684 --> 00:39:38,524
I am looking for

747
00:39:38,524 --> 00:39:40,925
Mr. Jiang Haitao who works here.

748
00:39:43,765 --> 00:39:44,564
Auntie.

749
00:39:45,445 --> 00:39:46,604
I see.

750
00:39:47,765 --> 00:39:48,925
You want to divorce.

751
00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:51,564
Yes.

752
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:53,124
Listen.

753
00:39:53,445 --> 00:39:55,205
There are two ways to get a divorce.

754
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:57,044
One is divorce by agreement.

755
00:39:57,845 --> 00:39:59,405
But divorce by agreement requires

756
00:39:59,405 --> 00:40:01,964
both parties to agree.

757
00:40:02,325 --> 00:40:03,885
However, from what you said,

758
00:40:04,325 --> 00:40:05,885
your husband, Zhu Dali,

759
00:40:05,885 --> 00:40:07,885
has clearly refused

760
00:40:08,044 --> 00:40:09,644
and has aggressive behavior.

761
00:40:10,084 --> 00:40:11,925
Therefore, I don't think

762
00:40:11,925 --> 00:40:12,925
it will work.

763
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,925
The other option is
divorce by litigation.

764
00:40:15,925 --> 00:40:18,644
This requires going back
to the defendant's place of origin

765
00:40:18,644 --> 00:40:20,044
to file for divorce.

766
00:40:20,604 --> 00:40:22,044
That means,

767
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,564
I-I have to go back to my hometown

768
00:40:24,564 --> 00:40:26,524
to file for divorce, right?

769
00:40:26,564 --> 00:40:27,365
Exactly.

770
00:40:27,644 --> 00:40:28,845
Mr. Jiang.

771
00:40:29,124 --> 00:40:32,084
I wonder if I could
ask you to represent me

772
00:40:32,084 --> 00:40:34,765
in this divorce case back home.

773
00:40:34,805 --> 00:40:36,805
Auntie, I usually...

774
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:38,044
Wait. Mr. Jiang.

775
00:40:39,084 --> 00:40:41,725
D-Don't reject me now.

776
00:40:43,124 --> 00:40:43,805
I...

777
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,004
my coming here

778
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:48,725
takes me a lot of courage.

779
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:51,124
To be honest,

780
00:40:51,124 --> 00:40:53,564
it's kind of shameful

781
00:40:54,524 --> 00:40:56,604
to talk about divorce at my age.

782
00:40:56,845 --> 00:40:59,205
And I don't want
Jincao and others to know.

783
00:41:00,644 --> 00:41:02,044
But around me,

784
00:41:02,245 --> 00:41:03,445
apart from you,

785
00:41:03,765 --> 00:41:06,164
I don't know any other lawyers.

786
00:41:06,684 --> 00:41:07,964
Well,

787
00:41:09,044 --> 00:41:10,084
why don't you listen to

788
00:41:10,084 --> 00:41:12,524
what I've been through all these years,

789
00:41:13,164 --> 00:41:15,205
and then you can decide
whether to help me,

790
00:41:15,484 --> 00:41:16,445
okay?

791
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:22,644
I've been painting

792
00:41:23,004 --> 00:41:24,684
because I want to be a painter.

793
00:41:25,325 --> 00:41:26,964
Zhu Jincao has been studying hard,

794
00:41:27,044 --> 00:41:30,164
just to break free
from his dad's control

795
00:41:30,564 --> 00:41:33,004
and achieve financial freedom.

796
00:41:33,245 --> 00:41:34,805
He's always wanting to get rich,

797
00:41:35,644 --> 00:41:37,684
yet he is still poor now.

798
00:41:38,885 --> 00:41:40,084
We were young and reckless,

799
00:41:40,084 --> 00:41:41,564
with full of ambition,

800
00:41:41,845 --> 00:41:43,644
thinking that after we grow up,

801
00:41:43,644 --> 00:41:45,604
we will surely become
someone remarkable.

802
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:48,725
When we grow up, we still work hard.

803
00:41:49,124 --> 00:41:50,564
But the harder we try,

804
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:53,004
the further we may get
from our original dream.

805
00:41:53,604 --> 00:41:54,604
Ultimately,

806
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:56,484
in the mediocre life,

807
00:41:56,885 --> 00:41:59,124
we become someone ordinary.

808
00:41:59,845 --> 00:42:01,405
But who would be content with that?

809
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:04,044
Is there a possibility

810
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:05,925
that we can start over,

811
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:07,405
take a reset with one click,

812
00:42:07,805 --> 00:42:09,164
and restart our life?

813
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,040
=Simple Days=

814
00:42:46,124 --> 00:42:48,405
You're not familiar with Python.

815
00:42:48,885 --> 00:42:51,845
Your use of C language
can be dated back to a decade ago.

816
00:42:52,684 --> 00:42:54,445
Coming out from a big company,

817
00:42:54,725 --> 00:42:56,604
do you know what our company does?

818
00:42:56,604 --> 00:42:57,445
Here's the thing.

819
00:42:57,445 --> 00:42:59,564
I studied programming in college.

820
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:01,964
Later, due to work, I changed focus.

821
00:43:02,285 --> 00:43:03,644
But I know the basics.

822
00:43:03,644 --> 00:43:04,725
Teach me more.

823
00:43:04,725 --> 00:43:05,885
I'm a fast learner.

824
00:43:05,925 --> 00:43:09,765
You are a bit old in age.

825
00:43:09,765 --> 00:43:11,725
Do you have enough energy to keep up?

826
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:12,604
Although we're

827
00:43:12,604 --> 00:43:15,205
a small outsourcing company,

828
00:43:15,245 --> 00:43:16,725
we're not a place for slacking off.

829
00:43:16,725 --> 00:43:18,084
At my previous company,

830
00:43:18,084 --> 00:43:19,604
I was very stressful.

831
00:43:19,604 --> 00:43:21,964
We were often required
to work overtime and stay up late.

832
00:43:21,964 --> 00:43:22,604
I'm used to it.
