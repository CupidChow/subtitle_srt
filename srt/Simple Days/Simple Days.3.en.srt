19
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:06,347
I didn't want to call you.

20
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:09,467
But it's a serious matter.

21
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:11,872
I don't want you to blame me
for not telling you.

22
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:13,472
You did well.

23
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:16,800
Call Zhu Jincao.

24
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:18,668
Tell him I'm here.

25
00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:20,828
Ask him and his wife to come back now.

26
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:23,307
Grandpa.

27
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:26,496
This is fun.

28
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:31,808
It took me a month
to build this ship for you.

29
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:33,467
Do you like it?

30
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:34,747
I love it.

31
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:36,027
Did you miss Grandpa?

32
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:36,867
Yeah.

33
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:38,268
I bet you forgot about me.

34
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:39,072
No.

35
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:45,068
And another kiss. Alright, I'll make you
a smaller one when I'm back.

36
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:19,108
Let's cut to the chase.

37
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:25,568
Your mom said you wanted to
sell this house and get a bigger one.

38
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:29,664
I'm telling you, no way.

39
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:32,448
It won't happen.

40
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:41,088
Dad, I've been married for seven years.

41
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:43,296
Mom has been living here.

42
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:45,467
Ke is growing up.

43
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:47,456
We need a bigger house.

44
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:49,984
Why are you so against it?

45
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:53,600
Let me explain to you.

46
00:03:54,307 --> 00:03:57,792
First of all, I covered
the down payment on this house

47
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:01,307
as your wedding gift.

48
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:03,456
You have no right to sell it.

49
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:09,792
Second, as Shanghainese say,
"Make the most out of the least."

50
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:14,304
It's big enough with two bedrooms.

51
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:19,808
Two? Are you counting
the closed balcony as a bedroom?

52
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:21,984
Woman, be silent.

53
00:04:24,787 --> 00:04:27,552
Do what you're capable of.

54
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:30,688
Don't dream of something
beyond your reach.

55
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:34,467
I won't stop you
if you're able to get a bigger house

56
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:35,776
on your own.

57
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:43,776
You just can't
sell this one, understand?

58
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:47,072
You know how pricy the houses are.

59
00:04:48,547 --> 00:04:50,667
We could have gotten
a big house with Moli's parents' help,

60
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,672
but you were strongly against it

61
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,328
and got this place on your own.

62
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:59,840
Now that the price has skyrocketed,
we can't afford a big house anymore.

63
00:05:00,388 --> 00:05:01,920
You're telling me to get my own house

64
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:03,776
to give me a hard time?

65
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:09,664
Son, talk things through with your dad.

66
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:24,064
I paid for your tuition and your house.

67
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:29,948
I think I've done my job as your father.

68
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:33,568
Naturally, I have the right
to make requests.

69
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:37,728
Jincao, we must be independent.

70
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:41,472
Give me my down payment back

71
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:44,448
or forget about it

72
00:05:45,268 --> 00:05:47,392
and just live here.

73
00:05:54,508 --> 00:05:55,360
Do you have money?

74
00:05:59,748 --> 00:06:00,707
No?

75
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:07,200
Well, then give the deed to your mom.

76
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:20,192
Zhu Jincao, I'm talking to you.
Didn't you hear me?

77
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:23,072
Do I have to do it myself?

78
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:44,068
Dad, here is the deed.

79
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:46,720
(Premises Permit)
Rest assured. We don't want your house.

80
00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:56,896
Jincao, the food is ready.
Where are you going?

81
00:06:58,268 --> 00:07:01,107
Moli, your dad just came.
Let's eat together.

82
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:02,027
Get him back here.

83
00:07:02,027 --> 00:07:03,776
He's not going to starve yet.

84
00:07:04,347 --> 00:07:05,984
Let him reflect on himself.

85
00:07:07,988 --> 00:07:09,268
I'll check on him.

86
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:16,576
Zhu Jincao had always been
a good kid before he got married.

87
00:07:17,748 --> 00:07:20,192
How come he's talking back at me now?

88
00:07:21,388 --> 00:07:22,368
Who taught him that?

89
00:08:11,488 --> 00:08:12,224
I'm so useless.

90
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,416
I've been working for years
but still can't get you a bigger house.

91
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:21,536
You're the best, the smartest,
and the most amazing.

92
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:26,208
Me? Stop making fun of me.

93
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:30,400
You spoke up in the face of power

94
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,960
and fought back. Isn't that amazing?

95
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:37,760
My dad is right. I don't have money.

96
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:51,008
Jincao, look.

I'm angry and worried.

102

We don't want your parents' house

103
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,544
or my parents' money anymore.

104
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:14,176
I value my dignity.

105
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:17,056
I will not suffer any humiliation
from your parents.

106
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:20,576

to feel inferior in front of my parents.

143
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:07,776
I told Lingxiao and Qianniu

144
00:12:08,288 --> 00:12:10,176
that I had come to Shanghai.

145
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:13,504
They'll come and visit me.

146
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,936
Make dinner for us.

147
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:20,128
Among the three of them,

148
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:23,040
only Jincao has a house in Shanghai.

149
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:26,336
That means he has settled here.

150
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:31,200
It's your chance to impress them
as their sister-in-law

151
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:35,456
and be a role model
for your future sisters-in-law.

152
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:38,368
I never knew I was so distinguished.

153
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:40,748
I can be a role model?

154
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:44,667
Dad, let me take care of it.

155
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,104
Let's get a table in a restaurant.

156
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,464
What for? It's a family gathering.

157
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:53,547
Let's just stay home like a family.

158
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:55,872
And it's more economic.

159
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:59,680
Sure, what do you need, Mom?
I'll get the ingredients online.

160
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:03,488
Jincao, it's pricy to order online.

161
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:06,592
I'll go to the market and make dinner.

162
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:08,896
Let Moli do it.

163
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,648
She's busy. She's going to work.

164
00:13:12,228 --> 00:13:13,067
I'll do it.

165
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:13,984
She will do it.

166
00:13:23,027 --> 00:13:25,472
Dad, I can't.

167
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,588
I don't even know when I'll be off work.

168
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,536
I don't have time
to cook for six people.

169
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,280
Your mom had a one-hour noon break

170
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:35,584
before she retired.

171
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:37,547
She'd ride a bike

172
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:41,888
to make a decent lunch for Jincao.

173
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:46,588
You want to run the household
but you're incapable.

174
00:13:46,588 --> 00:13:48,147
I-Isn't that inappropriate?

175
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:50,628
You're Jincao's wife.

176
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:51,744
Wouldn't it be nice

177
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:54,816
if you could make dinner
for his relatives or friends at home?

178
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:57,088
If you can't do it,

179
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:01,536
aren't you a grown-up baby
as they say online?

180
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:05,280
Fine, it's just dinner. I'll do it.

181
00:14:09,907 --> 00:14:10,848
Jincao, breakfast.

182
00:14:16,827 --> 00:14:20,896
Do you like the soy milk made from
the soybeans Grandpa brought?

183
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:21,952
Is it nice?

184
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,468
Yeah.

185
00:14:30,388 --> 00:14:31,808
You should nod.

186
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:33,728
Dig in.

187
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:55,008
Honey, don't be mad.

188
00:14:55,968 --> 00:14:57,632
My dad rarely visits.

189
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:01,312
He only wants
to treat our relatives to dinner.

190
00:15:02,307 --> 00:15:05,440
He's going to be happy after dinner
and get ready to go home.

191
00:15:06,912 --> 00:15:08,864
He'd better not do it again.

192
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:11,200
Or I won't make it.

193
00:15:11,904 --> 00:15:13,536
I don't even know how to cook.

194
00:15:14,468 --> 00:15:18,187
I know. He's not going to ask for more.

195
00:15:19,427 --> 00:15:21,708
I know it's tough for you.

196
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:25,568
Don't worry. I'll come home
right after work and help you.

197
00:15:26,228 --> 00:15:27,904
I won't let you do it alone.

198
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:31,296
Don't try to fool me
with what you tell your team.

199
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:50,816
Ms. Kang, this is quite different
from the original piece.

200
00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:52,608
I told you.

201
00:15:53,988 --> 00:15:55,424
It was painted a year ago.

202
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,128
My mindset has changed,
so I may not be able to restore it.

203
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:05,056
You shouldn't have
damaged my painting to begin with.

204
00:16:05,952 --> 00:16:09,024
Art is not from an assembly line.
It needs inspiration.

205
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,744
It's not like copy and paste.

206
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,872
But you can't change the basics
like the theme and style.

207
00:16:16,544 --> 00:16:18,912
Or it's not the painting
our customer has bought.

208
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,216
Well, it is not.

209
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,128
I could have raised the price.

210
00:16:24,128 --> 00:16:26,368
Don't you know how much I charge now?

211
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:29,216
He's buying my painting
at last year's price.

212
00:16:29,216 --> 00:16:30,612
He's profiting.

213
00:16:31,307 --> 00:16:33,147
But you promised you'd fix it.

214
00:16:33,147 --> 00:16:35,936
How am I going
to give it to our customer?

215
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:37,216
That's your problem.

216
00:16:37,827 --> 00:16:39,648
Alright, Ms. Kang.

217
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:42,688
You've done enough.
You even brought the painting yourself.

218
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:48,667
Who cares if Mr. Tang doesn't want it?

219
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:50,388
It's not your fault.

220
00:16:51,348 --> 00:16:52,544
I'm so happy to see you.

221
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,232
My friends brought me
some shawls from Nepal.

222
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:58,388
There is a red one
that is perfect for you.

223
00:16:58,388 --> 00:17:01,067
Let's go try it on.

224
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:23,867
I'll keep it down.

225
00:17:44,827 --> 00:17:47,827
You haven't had any water
the entire morning.

226
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:49,952
I made you some tea with goji berries.

227
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:53,984
Leave it there. Can you just be quiet?

228
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:58,112
I told you not to disturb me today.

229
00:18:00,448 --> 00:18:04,192
I'll take a walk
in the neighborhood. Take your time.

230
00:18:25,748 --> 00:18:29,408
Rice with crab roe! Oh my!
What did I do right?

231
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,840
My bestie got me
the most luxurious takeout in Shanghai.

232
00:18:32,704 --> 00:18:34,272
It must be pricy.

233
00:18:34,272 --> 00:18:36,704
Not me, Ms. Wu got it for you.

234
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:39,808
She placed the order and called me

235
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:42,787
so that I join you for lunch.

236
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:46,432
She said you were mad and wouldn't
answer her calls. She was so upset.

237
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:49,280
She got me wrong.
I was occupied the whole morning.

238
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,948
Gu Moli, I've known you
for almost 20 years.

239
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:52,948
So don't give me that.

240
00:18:52,948 --> 00:18:55,424
Why are you holding a grudge
against your mom?

241
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:57,024
So ungrateful.

242
00:18:57,024 --> 00:18:59,072
You have no idea. It's not my fault.

243
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,416
I know everything.

244
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,944
She's your mom, after all.

245
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:05,216
Just do as she says even if she's wrong.

246
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,816
Listen.

247
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:09,312
You'll regret it if she falls ill
because of your caprice.

248
00:19:09,312 --> 00:19:10,688
No one will look after you.

249
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:12,960
Are you going to
dine with me or lecture me?

250
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,272
Will you let me eat?

251
00:19:14,272 --> 00:19:16,576
All you care about is food.

252
00:19:19,428 --> 00:19:20,608
Well, it's really good.

253
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:26,144
Which restaurant is it?

254
00:19:37,948 --> 00:19:39,072
Hello, Moli.

255
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:44,160
Mom, I'm going to make dinner today.

256
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:49,152
Can you pick up Ke with Dad

257
00:19:49,152 --> 00:19:51,680
and take her to Mr. Wu
for the painting class?

258
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:54,976
Isn't the painting class tomorrow?

259
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:58,976
Yeah, he's going on a business trip.
So we rescheduled it.

260
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:00,768
Also, since Dad is here,

261
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:04,352
I'd like him to take a look
at Mr. Wu's calligraphy

262
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:06,432
and give some instructions.

263
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:10,496
Alright, don't worry. We'll go.

264
00:20:11,228 --> 00:20:12,384
Thank you, Mom.

265
00:20:12,384 --> 00:20:13,664
No problem.

266
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,288
Why are you doing everything?

267
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:24,768
Why can't she pick up the kid
because she's making dinner?

268
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,560
She hasn't run the household before.
Let her take it slow.

269
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,360
Besides, it shows how much
she values what you say.

270
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:38,041
I'll go alone if you're bored.

271
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,472
No, I'll pick up my granddaughter.

272
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,672
And I can check on the art teacher

273
00:20:44,672 --> 00:20:46,528
just in case he's no good.

274
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,880
Alright.

275
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:52,512
When should we pick her up?

276
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,416
In an hour.

277
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,824
Alright, I'll hurry up.

278
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,880
A takeout?

279
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,400
Yeah, classic Shanghai cuisine.

280
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,136
A set for six people is 1888.
It's going to be amazing.

281
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,992
Can you handle semi-finished food?

282
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,200
Do not doubt me.

283
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,928
Here's the plan.

284
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:20,288
I told your parents
to take Ke to the art teacher.

285
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:22,600
Dinner will be ready once they're home.

286
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,481
Nobody will suspect anything.
Perfect, huh?

287
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:29,801
You're the smartest.

288
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:32,440
Alright, send me the address.

289
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,680
I'll pick up the takeout.

290
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,120
Moli, you're off work early.

291
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,840
I have work to do at home. Bye.

292
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:50,240
Mr. Zhu, the server is down.

293
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,032
Boss told us to stay on standby

294
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:53,568
and wait for IT to fix it.

295
00:21:54,561 --> 00:21:55,488
Are you kidding me?

296
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,112
Mr. Zhu, we're so unlucky.

297
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
They sent a newbie here for maintenance.

298
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,528
He messed up and the server was down.

299
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,536
The administration staff
is getting dinner for everyone.

300
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,128
I think we'll have to stay overnight.

301
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:18,208
Honey, where are you?

302
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:19,968
I don't think I'll make it.

303
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:22,920
The server is down. They're fixing it.

304
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,384
I have to stay.

305
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,521
Zhu Jincao, are you doing it on purpose?

306
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:30,241
No, it's a top emergency.

307
00:22:30,241 --> 00:22:31,680
I have to stay and fix it.

308
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,464
Are we having dinner or not?

309
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,481
Calm down. Listen.

310
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,848
Tell Mr. Wu
to extend the lesson for an hour.

311
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:41,824
We can double the fee. Stall my parents.

312
00:22:42,368 --> 00:22:44,416
I'll get a delivery man
to pick up the meal.

313
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,081
No need. I'll go.

314
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,521
Lingxiao, where are you and Qianniu?

315
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:52,761
Something came up.

316
00:22:52,761 --> 00:22:54,961
Don't get in yet.
Wait for my parents outside.

317
00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:56,680
Stall them once you see them.

318
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,640
Yeah, stall them.
Don't let them go upstairs.

319
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,440
Let's go home.

320
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,081
Ke, have some water.

321
00:23:04,081 --> 00:23:05,440
- Have some water.
- Here.

322
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,561
Grandpa, there is no water.

323
00:23:09,561 --> 00:23:10,721
Give it to him.

324
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:11,961
There is no water?

325
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:13,761
It's my fault.

326
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:20,360
Uncle, what's the address again?

327
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,680
You forgot again?

328
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:27,680
Listen, it's Room 802,
Unit 1, Building No. 7.

329
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,360
I know it's 802.
But I can't find the building.

330
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,832
You can't? Listen.

331
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,640
It's right...

332
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,680
Alright, listen. We're at the entrance.
There's a pool here.

333
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,904
We'll wait for you there.

334
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:46,272
Is that Qianniu?

335
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,216
Who else can it be?
Let's wait at the entrance.

336
00:23:49,801 --> 00:23:54,801
No way.
He and his mom visit all the time.

337
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,281
How can he forget which building it is?

338
00:23:57,281 --> 00:23:58,840
What's so weird about it?

339
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,152
All the buildings look the same here.

340
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,616
I don't believe it.

341
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,384
I'm done with the call.

342
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,808
I heard you. Do you remember the lines?

343
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:18,912
Yeah. Can I improvise?

344
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:21,721
Don't. Stick to the script.

345
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:26,961
Okay, look after me.

346
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:28,961
Take over once I can't handle it.

347
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:30,080
Got it. Go.

348
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,160
You're spoiling her.

349
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,360
- Let her play on her own.
- Hello, Uncle, Auntie.

350
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,081
Ke.

351
00:24:37,081 --> 00:24:38,640
Hello, Uncle.

352
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,961
How come you still
can't find the building?

353
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:43,400
It's not his fault.

354
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,408
The neighborhood looks so different now.

355
00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:47,440
How can he remember everything by heart?

356
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,088
Alright, let's go.

357
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:53,376
Wait, I was running around
and my shoelaces got loose.

358
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:54,400
Just a second.

359
00:24:55,321 --> 00:24:57,120
What a great environment.

360
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:00,521
This neighborhood is huge indeed.

361
00:25:03,721 --> 00:25:05,001
Uncle.

362
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:09,440
I always feel refreshed when I'm here.

363
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,840
What's wrong with him?

364
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,400
Right?

365
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,008
Yeah, your residence sits here

366
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:20,120
among the trees and winding paths,

367
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,816
with birds chirping
and flowers blooming.

368
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,624
Seeing that, I feel like making a poem.

369
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,241
This is such a fine neighborhood.

370
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:34,880
Alright.

371
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:39,241
Whoever lives here is carefree.

372
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:42,160
A positive person doesn't age.

373
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,761
It's so nice here I'd like to shower.

374
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:47,680
Get into the pool.

375
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,856
- Come on, Auntie.
- Silly boy, how's that a poem?

376
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:53,521
You'd like to "shower"? Let's go home.

377
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:54,200
Let's go.

378
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,192
Wait, Uncle, Auntie.

379
00:25:56,192 --> 00:25:58,752
I-It came out naturally.

380
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:03,648
Uncle, I have a question.

381
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,241
Yes?

382
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:09,952
Who picked this amazing neighborhood?

383
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:13,281
Who? Me.

384
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,761
Look at the priciest building.

385
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:19,552
These apartments may be the priciest
because they're the biggest.

386
00:26:19,552 --> 00:26:22,912
But they don't have
the great sunshine we have.

387
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:27,872
Look, our building
is having great Feng Shui.

388
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:29,680
With great Feng Shui...

389
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,041
Enough with Feng Shui.

390
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:32,961
Don't get him started.

391
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:34,944
Wait, Auntie,
I've been studying Feng Shui.

392
00:26:35,521 --> 00:26:37,521
Tell me more about it.

393
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,896
Hurry up. Qianniu and Lingxiao
are stalling my dad.

394
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:46,720
They may not be able to hold out.

395
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,481
Stop nagging me.

396
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,521
I can't take those boxes up.

397
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:52,256
What if your dad finds out?

398
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,680
You're so thoughtful. What do we do?

399
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,920
I'll throw away the boxes. Park the car.

400
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,961
Feng Shui is highly sophisticated.

401
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:18,761
It's not something
I can explain so easily.

402
00:27:18,761 --> 00:27:22,440
If you're really interested,
we can talk all about it later.

403
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,008
Uncle, I have another question.

404
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:31,041
Ke is thirsty. There is no water.

405
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:33,728
There is no water.

406
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:36,128
Hello, Auntie.

407
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,600
Hello, Lingxiao.

408
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,440
Lingxiao.

409
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:43,120
Hello, Uncle.

410
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:44,521
Hello, Ke.

411
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:45,400
Hello, Uncle.

412
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,961
Everybody's here. Let's go.

413
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:48,600
Let's go.

414
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,680
Wait. Let me tie my shoelaces. Hold it.

415
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,640
Uncle.

416
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,136
I always feel refreshed when I'm here.

417
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,721
Your residence sits here
among the trees and winding paths...

418
00:28:13,721 --> 00:28:17,041
With birds chirping
and flowers blooming.

419
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:20,576
Are you going to write a poem too?

420
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,616
Actually, I did make a poem.

421
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:28,001
What's with you?
It's like you share the scripts.

422
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:28,768
What's going on?

423
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,400
Ke needs water.

424
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,440
Okay.

425
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:40,992
Come on, you said my line.

426
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,992
You said my line!

427
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,640
I ran out of lines, okay?
I had to use yours.

428
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:01,920
So many boxes.

429
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,680
A box for a few slices of carrots.
This is not eco-friendly.

430
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,880
Stop complaining. Hurry up.

431
00:29:12,521 --> 00:29:13,481
What's wrong?

432
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:21,568
Mom, are we having takeout today?

433
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,024
Heard it? Takeout.

434
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,504
What a disgrace.

435
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:22,720
Lingxiao and I brought this as a gift.

436
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,481
I hope you like it.

437
00:30:26,481 --> 00:30:27,761
Thank you, Qianniu.

438
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:33,281
I bought it.

439
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:35,281
It's the same.

440
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,224
Grandma, when are we having dinner?

441
00:30:42,481 --> 00:30:45,961
Should I make some noodles?
It will only take ten minutes.

442
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:46,912
Sit there.

443
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,232
Dinner can wait.

444
00:30:57,721 --> 00:30:59,648
Dad, we have to eat.

445
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,528
The food is ready.
They just need a bit of cooking.

446
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,056
Besides, Lingxiao and Qianniu
must be hungry.

447
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:10,624
Dinner can wait.
We have to make things clear first.

448
00:31:11,241 --> 00:31:12,896
They're grown men.

449
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:14,961
They can starve for a while.

450
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,952
Why don't you get something?

451
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,880
Don't let Ke starve.

452
00:31:29,281 --> 00:31:30,481
Okay.

453
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:35,241
Let's go. Granny is going to
get you something to eat.

454
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,281
According to the plan...

455
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:40,200
Go to the sofa.

456
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,784
We should be gathering as a family,

457
00:31:43,561 --> 00:31:46,016
raising our glasses in joy.

458
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:51,136
But Zhu Jincao's wife
is immature, irresponsible,

459
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,112
sneaky, and lazy.

460
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:59,680
That's why we're sitting here, starving.

461
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,801
Dad, it's my fault.

462
00:32:04,801 --> 00:32:06,048
Something happened at work.

463
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:09,248
Protecting your wife
won't bring harmony.

464
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,528
We see what's going on in this family.

465
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,760
I suggest we put everything in order.

466
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,081
I worked on it the whole day

467
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:27,456
and wrote Zhu's family teachings

468
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,880
(Zhu's family teachings)
for your reference.

469
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,544
You're not our direct family.

470
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:39,012
But it won't hurt to learn it.

471
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,600
So outdated.

472
00:32:45,728 --> 00:32:47,040
Stop!

473
00:32:53,761 --> 00:32:56,544
Inspired by the spirit of our ancestors,

474
00:32:57,721 --> 00:33:02,528
the 63rd generation of the Zhu family
has formulated these family rules.

475
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,961
All descendants of the Zhu family

476
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,961
should reflect on themselves daily
and follow the teachings.

477
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,128
First, the nation thrives
when it's on the right track.

478
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,000
The family thrives
when its members are regulated.

479
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:24,192
All family members should be diligent
and follow four precepts.

480
00:33:25,241 --> 00:33:28,288
Work hard, study hard, and think hard.

481
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,440
Abstain from oversleeping,
laziness, luxury, and pride.

482
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,184
People in Zhu's family
should be diligent and thrifty.

483
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:40,992
Be grateful for the food we have
because it's hard-earned.

484
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,400
Be grateful for the clothes we have
because it's hard-earned.

485
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,408
A member will be expelled
if they lead an extravagant life.

486
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,801
Second, all daughters-in-law
who marry into my family

487
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:09,441
must treat everyone with sincerity
and know their places.

488
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:12,240
Do not upset the elders.

489
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,561
Do not doubt
the family members and grow distant.

490
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:19,640
Do not do things
that hurt the family bond.

491
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,800
Be filial and show respect.

492
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,024
Work hard and do what's right.

493
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:29,472
(Third, do not speak
during meals or before bed.)

494
00:34:30,144 --> 00:34:32,361
(Dress properly at home.)

495
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:35,280
(Take the initiative
to greet the elders.)

496
00:34:37,921 --> 00:34:40,672
Twenty-fourth,
whoever violates the teachings

497
00:34:40,672 --> 00:34:45,444
shall reflect on themselves
and accept any punishment.

498
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,112
Uncle, it's a great pleasure
to hear the teachings. I'm inspired.

499
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,320
I have an appointment. I have to go.

500
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,441
I'll visit you again.

501
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,320
Your teachings value
way more than a dinner.

502
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:14,912
I'll starve tonight. Bye, Uncle.

503
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:18,496
Go ahead. I won't walk you out.
Come and visit us.

504
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,361
See you, sis.

505
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,921
Take care.

506
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:29,720
Take care.

507
00:35:30,401 --> 00:35:31,320
Take care.

508
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,041
See you.

509
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,001
Dad, do you have to do it?

510
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,408
Make Lingxiao and Qianniu stay

511
00:35:57,921 --> 00:35:59,104
and watch us get humiliated?

512
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,904
You feel humiliated?

513
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:11,680
Was I trying to humiliate you?

514
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,608
You did it to yourself.

515
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,712
I didn't ask too much.

516
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:22,112
I just wanted a dinner.

517
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,928
And how did it go? You ruined it.

518
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,240
You can't even prepare a meal.
Don't you need some family teachings?

519
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,328
You're making a fuss.

520
00:36:33,921 --> 00:36:34,921
What?

521
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:36,720
Now I get it.

522
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,600
It's not about the dinner.

523
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,280
You're just looking
to announce the teachings.

524
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,000
Dad, let me remind you of the teachings.

525
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:52,760
Wake up early to greet you.
Wash up after you.

526
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,040
Be well-dressed outside the bedroom.

527
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:59,441
Drink water ten times,

528
00:36:59,441 --> 00:37:01,921
one-fourth of a cup every time.

529
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:03,680
Do not play on the phones before bed.

530
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,504
And our farts have to be silent.

531
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,160
Jincao, you made a sound.
It's against the rules.

532
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,224
You're regulating us in all aspects.

533
00:37:16,224 --> 00:37:17,664
Are you treating us like babies

534
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,760
or trying to set up some rules?

535
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,016
Nobody can make it without rules.

536
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:28,288
I will help you
learn the teachings one by one by heart

537
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:31,008
instead of memorizing them.

538
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:35,584
You must learn to be our family member.

539
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,688
Jincao, we'll clean up the place,
starting next week.

540
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,720
I'll teach you how to
live decently and casually

541
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,344
in a small apartment.

542
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,001
You're going to stay here?

543
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:54,720
Now you know why I did that.

544
00:37:55,361 --> 00:37:59,328
I bought you the house
and I'll teach you how to live here.

545
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,481
It's already...

546
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:23,616
According to the family teachings,
take Ke to wash up.

547
00:38:24,441 --> 00:38:28,064
She's sound asleep.
Why should I wake her up?

548
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:09,568
Honey, I'm sorry. It's been hard on you.

549
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,504
Family teaching No. 3.
Do not speak during meals or before bed.

550
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,160
Good night.

551
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,072
Why are you up so early?

552
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:44,800
Where are you going?

553
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:49,001
Zhu's family teaching No. 8.

554
00:39:49,001 --> 00:39:51,872
Do not make loud noises
before the elders get up.

555
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:54,200
Our boss texted me to go to Jingdezhen

556
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,392
on a business trip.

557
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,200
Really?

558
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,792
You think?

559
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,200
I left the egg pudding in the fridge.

560
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,720
Take it out once Ke wakes up
for breakfast. It should be just right.

561
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,424
I know you're upset.

562
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:09,664
Give me some time. I'll handle it.

563
00:40:12,561 --> 00:40:15,264
Our elders are home.
Watch your behavior.

564
00:40:16,521 --> 00:40:17,800
Let me take you to the station.

565
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,992
No need. It's in the opposite direction
from your office.

566
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:23,296
You'd be late for work.

567
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:26,912
Just stay home
and study the family teachings.

568
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,240
Your dad may want
a 5000-word essay on it.

569
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,328
See you.

570
00:40:42,532 --> 00:40:43,616
(Zhu's family teaching)

571
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:56,736
Liu, get ready.
I'll crash at your place tonight.

572
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,760
Don't post anything about me
on WeChat Moments these days.

573
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,720
Nothing.

574
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,608
Again? You fought with Zhu Jincao?

575
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,640
It wasn't him. His dad was unbelievable.

576
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,640
Talk later.

577
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,961
I don't want to ruin my mood.

578
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:19,160
I have something important to do.

579
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,800
I must not fail.

580
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,200
Good luck. Let's have a feast tonight.

581
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,361
Ke.

582
00:41:33,401 --> 00:41:34,600
Morning, Grandpa.

583
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,224
Morning, enjoy your breakfast.

584
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:44,672
She has to go on a business trip

585
00:41:45,361 --> 00:41:48,200
right after
I announce the family teachings.

586
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,160
Is she shunning me?

587
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,680
Why would she do that?

588
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,720
That's our line of work.

589
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,040
It's the same for me.

590
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:57,561
Even if you have work,

591
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:59,881
you should take some days off

592
00:41:59,881 --> 00:42:03,104
to serve your father-in-law
who rarely visits you.

593
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:06,921
What are you talking about?

594
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:09,280
We can get fired at any time.

595
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,760
Will you take responsibility for that?

596
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,841
Ke, are you done?

597
00:42:13,841 --> 00:42:14,561
Yeah.

598
00:42:14,561 --> 00:42:17,680
Let's go to kindergarten. Let's go.

599
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,361
Bye, Grandpa.

600
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:19,640
Bye.

601
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,081
Bye, Dad.

602
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:21,600
Bye.

603
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,464
Bye.

604
00:42:27,001 --> 00:42:29,120
Jincao, come out.

605
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,568
I couldn't say it
in front of your daughter.

606
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:50,560
I don't mean to turn you against Moli.

607
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,424
All parents
want the best for their children.

608
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:59,840
But she's not taking you seriously.

609
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:06,912
Do you find my teachings
outdated and ridiculous?

610
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,160
Think about it.
Gu Moli is full of herself.

611
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,040
And you keep compromising.

612
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:18,912
How are you going to
make it work in the long run?

613
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,176
I don't think I need to prove anything.

614
00:43:24,064 --> 00:43:26,481
Are you feeling insecure
and trying to prove something?

615
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:30,720
Zhu Jincao, mind your attitude.
Read the teachings three times.

616
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,096
You can't avoid it.
