Zhou Yu.

20
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:57,290
What's so urgent?

21
00:01:57,691 --> 00:01:59,810
It's such an informal place.

22
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:02,930
This place is mine.

23
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,331
It's just the two of us.

24
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,090
I think it's quite formal.

25
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:08,771
What's the matter? Go ahead.

26
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,771
If you can't remarry your ex-husband,

27
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:17,771
will you marry someone else?

28
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:19,451
What did you say?

29
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,771
I said,

30
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:22,930
will you marry someone else?

31
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:25,090
This is so urgent.

32
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,930
This is my privacy.

33
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,210
It has nothing to do with you.

34
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:30,051
Wait.

35
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,771
It concerns our business.

36
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:34,650
You have to tell me.

37
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:36,571
Fine.

38
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,771
Listen.

39
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,690
I'm not getting married again.

40
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,331
I'll just raise my daughter

41
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:43,210
and be a happy single mom.

42
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:44,171
Okay.

43
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,051
Ms. Gu Moli,

44
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:48,731
I respect your choice
not to get married.

45
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:51,051
But you didn't refuse to date someone.

46
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,011
So, you and I,

47
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,650
we can just date each other.

48
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,291
I told you I like older ones.

49
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,731
I'd be happier with a child.

50
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:01,771
What's wrong with you?

51
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,250
I am serious.

52
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,370
Let me tell you.

53
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:07,611
There's no chance between us.

54
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:08,970
Moli.

55
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,331
I'm young,

56
00:03:11,331 --> 00:03:12,491
but I'm not impulsive.

57
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,090
I always look for value for money.

58
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,130
Of course.

59
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:18,410
Except for that time
I was fooled by Big Ai.

60
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:20,530
Last time

61
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,970
I asked you to get rid of Xin.

62
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:22,970
Actually,

63
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,731
I was looking for a chance
to get close to you.

64
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,771
Your maturity and wit

65
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,530
really fascinate me.

66
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:33,331
You should at least give me a chance,

67
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,410
right?

68
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:36,810
You stay away from me.

69
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,210
Run as far as you can.

70
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:41,250
Moli, think it over.

71
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,690
I'm young, handsome,

72
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,051
healthy and long-lived.

73
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:47,611
And I'm pretty rich.

74
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,051
As for my career,

75
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,090
you've seen it.

76
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:52,130
Though it's not yet big,

77
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,891
it's sure to thrive in the future.

78
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:55,171
Once again,

79
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:57,491
there's absolutely no chance between us.

80
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,930
Jokes should have limits.

81
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:02,370
If you ever mention this to me again,

82
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,291
I'll cut ties with you.

83
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:12,930
I'll get you sooner or later.

84
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,570
You want to do the ride-hailing?

85
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:21,330
Just treat it as a transition.

86
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:22,651
It's time

87
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:23,731
to pay the mortgage after all.

88
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:25,051
If you're short of money,

89
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:26,091
just tell me.

90
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:27,971
No, I'm not.

91
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:29,611
Lingxiao.

92
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,411
Men can't stop at my age.

93
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:34,010
To stop means

94
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,411
to start again.

95
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,731
Then you should
think of other solutions.

96
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:40,930
You've been in a big company,

97
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,930
so you must have plenty of connections.

98
00:04:43,531 --> 00:04:45,291
Don't count on those people

99
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:47,130
to offer any help.

100
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:49,130
They run faster than anyone else.

101
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:53,370
Look at you.

102
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,890
Your mom and dad
don't know it yet, right?

103
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,091
If my mom knew about this,

104
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,411
she'd be mad.

105
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:03,570
If my dad knew about this,

106
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,330
he would cut me out of the family.

107
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:06,450
I agree.

108
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,930
He can do such things.

109
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:11,010
I now understand more and more

110
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,611
why so many middle-aged men

111
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:14,851
dare not leave their jobs

112
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:16,250
even if they got scolded.

113
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:18,491
In reality,

114
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,570
your emotions

115
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,010
or attitudes

116
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,411
don't matter at all.

117
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,531
And no one cares.

118
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,130
Many people tell me to take it easy.

119
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:30,930
I can take it easy.

120
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:32,770
Can my family take it easy?

121
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:36,091
Middle-aged men are like ships.

122
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,291
Ship can sink.

123
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,570
But what about the people on them?

124
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,770
Don't be anxious.

125
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,130
I'll figure it out

126
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,450
for your work.

127
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:48,690
No, no. Lingxiao.

128
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,570
Don't bother.

129
00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:51,491
I didn't mean that.

130
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,291
I am here today

131
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,211
just to have a chat with you.

132
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,051
I don't think it's a good time

133
00:05:58,411 --> 00:06:00,611
to rush into a choice.

134
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,291
I should just calm myself down.

135
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:07,211
With your situation now,

136
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,611
you can't stay in a deadlock with Moli.

137
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:14,291
Now,

138
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,250
I don't want to bother her anymore.

139
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,091
I don't

140
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:22,330
want to be a burden to her.

141
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,851
It is said that,

142
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:30,010
now pick a random person on the street,

143
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,491
he can tell you

144
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,171
he's under a lot of pressure.

145
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:35,531
But each of us

146
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,890
has a way to deal with pressure.

147
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,411
Like me.

148
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,770
I just paint.

149
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:42,450
How about Jincao?

150
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,851
He never seems under pressure.

151
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,491
No way.

152
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,291
I should put it this way.

153
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,570
He has pressure,

154
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:56,491
but he doesn't resist it,

155
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,010
or vent,

156
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,411
or go crazy.

157
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,851
He always carries it through

158
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:03,890
quietly.

159
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,051
But life

160
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:09,690
always has its exceptions.

161
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,851
This time,

162
00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:13,450
he has pressure.

163
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:16,770
His pressure isn't coming from work,

164
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,370
but me.

165
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,051
I'd like to see

166
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:22,570
how he will

167
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,010
carry it through

168
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:26,770
quietly this time.

Son, I'm packing buns.

171
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,611
Wait for me.

172
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:40,171
Son.

173
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,370
You haven't had breakfast yet.

174
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,611
Experts have said,

175
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:45,330
"Skipping breakfast
can easily lead to gallstones."

176
00:07:48,211 --> 00:07:49,770
This child...

177
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,570
Where is he?

178
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,770
Right here.

179
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,531
Can't get his face.

180
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,491
Look.

181
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:04,330
Mr. Zhu.

182
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,411
Please fill out
the health information form.

183
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,450
How many

184
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,731
more forms I should fill out?

185
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:14,651
Coming in again and again.

186
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:16,731
Filling forms again and again.

187
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:18,930
Are you going to hire me?

188
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,810
Be patient.

189
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,091
This is the company process,
not that fast.

190
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:33,331
What are they doing?

191
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:37,571
Sorry.

192
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:39,010
A small company like us

193
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,331
didn't expect a technologist like you
to send in a resume.

194
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:42,731
And you're so famous.

195
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,170
Everyone knows you in the industry.

196
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,491
They are just curious

197
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,650
what you look like.

198
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:07,931
It's so big.

199
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:10,971
Can it be done?

200
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:12,370
Just go for it.

201
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:15,130
But this record doesn't come close

202
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,290
to his.

203
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,331
Just go for it.

204
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:23,211
Auntie, who are you looking for?

205
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:25,890
I'm looking for Zhu Jincao.

206
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:27,931
Mr. Zhu has already resigned.

207
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,370
Who are you?

208
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,130
I am his mom.

209
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:34,091
He said to go to work

210
00:09:34,091 --> 00:09:35,650
in the morning.

211
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,650
Why has he resigned?

212
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,170
A-Auntie.

213
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,370
(Jinying Culture Media)
Mr. Zhu has resigned last Tuesday.

214
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,170
He hasn't been in the office
in over a week.

215
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:52,851
Auntie.

216
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,811
Are you okay?

217
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,370
I'm fine.

218
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,451
I have seen the profiles of your hosts.

219
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:15,890
I think

220
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,731
the biggest problem in your company
is that your strategy is not clear

221
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,250
and your resources are scattered.

222
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,370
You want to grab everything,

223
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,050
but there is no core profit point

224
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,451
or central figure.

225
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:27,331
If I were to run this operation,

226
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:30,451
first, I'll cut half the hosts here.

227
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,010
That's clear.

228
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:35,971
Look.

229
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:39,331
What if you were the central figure?

230
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:40,931
What do you mean?

231
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:43,211
Tell your story.

232
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,611
We have made a conservative estimate.

233
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,931
If you were to be the host,

234
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,290
with our help,

235
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,370
there should be no problem

236
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,770
selling over 100 million in six months.

237
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,770
Are you kidding me?

238
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,211
Not at all.

239
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,971
What a mess.

240
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,050
Hypocrite.

241
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,851
If he doesn't do it, someone else will.

242
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,451
Contact that woman.

243
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:19,091
Okay, Mr. An.
I'll contact her right away.

244
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:21,811
This way, please.

245
00:11:23,571 --> 00:11:24,811
These are two works

246
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:26,410
by the young painter Zhao Lifei.

247
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:28,731
He has integrated

248
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:31,770
traditional Chinese ink painting
techniques in his modern style.

249
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,451
In realism, he emphasized
freehand and blank space.

250
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:39,050
In the collision of diverse cultures,

251
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,571
he showed

252
00:11:40,571 --> 00:11:42,770
the theme of vanguard and avant-garde.

253
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,611
Sir,

254
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:51,530
what are you filming?

255
00:11:54,451 --> 00:11:56,211
Can't get enough gossiping online?

256
00:11:56,491 --> 00:11:58,211
And now you're even bothering me?

257
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,691
Don't you get bored?

258
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:00,611
Beauty,

259
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:02,170
are you overthinking it?

260
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,691
Do you think you're pretty

261
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,211
that everyone wants to film you?

262
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,650
Let me check your phone.

263
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:10,451
What are you doing?

264
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:11,331
Give me back my phone.

265
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:11,971
I want to complain.

266
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:12,731
I'll just check.

267
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,370
Give it back to me.

268
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:15,971
What are you doing?

269
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,611
Go complain.

270
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,811
We have a sign on our wall.

271
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:22,491
(No Photos)
Can't you see that, "No Photos"?

272
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:23,451
Can't read English.

273
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,571
Can't you read Chinese?

274
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,571
All of our paintings here

275
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:28,050
are copyrighted.

276
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:30,410
Impressive.

277
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,691
I don't take photos.

278
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:32,691
On your official account,

279
00:12:32,691 --> 00:12:34,010
don't you show HD pictures?

280
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,211
That's the official account.

281
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:36,571
You are not allowed to take photos here.

282
00:12:36,691 --> 00:12:37,611
Just you keep doing so,

283
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:38,530
I'll call security.

284
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:41,731
Give me the phone.

285
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:46,770
Sir, please leave.

286
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:50,851
I will never visit

287
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,370
your gallery again.

288
00:12:56,971 --> 00:12:58,211
My apologies.

289
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,050
We will continue later.

290
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,211
This way, please.

291
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:04,290
Sorry.

292
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,530
Don't mention it.

293
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:16,091
The boss said you had too many chores.

294
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:17,770
I'm in charge of gallery general now.

295
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:18,731
I don't want

296
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,091
the gallery to be a mess all day,

297
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,971
like your private life.

298
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,170
Thank you for using our service.

299
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:45,731
Take care.

300
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:46,331
Thank you.

301
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:00,408
(Mom)

302
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:17,290
(I'm in a meeting.)

303
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,010
Be careful. Mr. Gu.

304
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,370
Watch the steps.

305
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,010
Take it easy, Mr. Gu.

306
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,331
Don't be that polite.

307
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:30,491
I've been retired so long.

308
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:32,091
You don't need to
be that polite anymore.

309
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:33,770
You are not right.

310
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,851
Let me tell you, Mr. Gu.

311
00:14:35,211 --> 00:14:36,290
No matter what,

312
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,971
you are still my leader,

313
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:38,971
my great benefactor.

314
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:40,611
I assure you,
whenever I come to Shanghai,

315
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:41,571
we will meet.

316
00:14:41,571 --> 00:14:42,731
Okay, okay.

317
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:44,370
Zhang. Has the car you called arrived?

318
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,410
It's here.

319
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:46,770
Come on.

320
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,010
Mr. Gu, please get in the car.

321
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,170
Okay, okay.

322
00:14:50,211 --> 00:14:51,731
Come on.

323
00:14:51,731 --> 00:14:52,491
Take it easy.

324
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,211
Sir, do you know the address?

325
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:55,571
Be careful on the drive.

326
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,571
Mr. Gu, take care.

327
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:00,851
Let's drive.

328
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,130
When did you start doing this?

329
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,130
Just a few days.

330
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,130
I'm looking for a job right now.

331
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,170
I'm free anyway,

332
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:24,091
just hoping to make some money.

333
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:26,211
You're a tough kid.

334
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:28,370
But no matter how,

335
00:15:28,691 --> 00:15:30,211
you can't do

336
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,971
the ride-hailing service, right?

337
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,811
I understand.

338
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:34,130
You don't.

339
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:37,091
A man

340
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:38,731
should take responsibility

341
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:40,811
as a father and as a husband.

342
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,410
Let's get this straight.

343
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,130
A steamed bun breaks in half,

344
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,050
half for Moli and half for Ke,

345
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,010
and you starve yourself.

346
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:47,851
Can you do that?

347
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:48,971
Yes.

348
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:51,811
Well, you can't just feed
these two steamed buns.

349
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:53,331
I understand what you mean.

350
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,971
I just want to feel

351
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,851
what I'm worth right now.

352
00:15:57,931 --> 00:16:00,130
You are adaptable.

353
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,211
Rest assured.

354
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,370
I promise I won't
let Moli and Ke suffer.

355
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,530
I will take your words to heart.

356
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,370
Moli.

357
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,770
Your family is looking for you.

358
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,530
Ke's Grandma.

359
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,611
Moli.

360
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:33,410
Please have a seat.

361
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,250
I'll get you some water.

362
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,211
No, no need.

363
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:36,250
You take a seat.

364
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,851
I want to ask you something.

365
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,170
Well,

366
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:44,770
Jincao got fired by their company.

367
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,691
Do you know it?

368
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,571
I don't know.

369
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:51,530
This morning,

370
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:52,811
I just felt

371
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,250
he just didn't seem right.

372
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:55,491
So after he left,

373
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:57,010
I went to his company.

374
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,130
I only found out then.

375
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,050
Hasn't he contacted you?

376
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,330
We haven't been contacted recently.

377
00:17:08,371 --> 00:17:09,090
What to do?

378
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,131
He won't get into any trouble, right?

379
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:13,770
No.

380
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,651
He can take care of his own problems.

381
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:19,850
Don't worry.

382
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,050
How can I not worry?

383
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,050
I'm his mom.

384
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,891
I've been calling him
since this morning,

385
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:25,491
and he hasn't answered at all.

386
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:26,131
Well...

387
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,891
He's not answering your calls

388
00:17:28,691 --> 00:17:30,371
because he doesn't want you to find him.

389
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:32,610
The more you call him,
the more annoying he gets.

390
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:37,290
Then...

391
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,651
just don't bother him?

392
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,770
What do you want to do?

393
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,090
I...

394
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:49,610
I mean...

395
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:51,931
In the past,

396
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:54,171
Jincao gave up

397
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,371
the graduate recommendation spot

398
00:17:55,371 --> 00:17:57,131
for you.

399
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,171
At that time,

400
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:02,330
you were so good together, right?

401
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,770
That was in the past.

402
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:08,290
Why did he lose his job now?

403
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,570
Because of Gao Xiajing.

404
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:13,810
Forget it.

405
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:16,131
Let's not talk about these.

406
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,770
Losing a job is not a big deal.

407
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,691
He can always find another one.

408
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,211
He has to solve his own problem himself.

409
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,570
No one can help.

410
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,090
Moli.

411
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,891
I think our family
doesn't treat you well.

412
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,411
Ever since you married into our family,

413
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:56,050
you've never enjoyed anything.

414
00:18:56,651 --> 00:18:58,171
And you've suffered

415
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,810
and endured so much pain.

416
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,451
I-I feel quite guilty about it.

417
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:09,131
But in my opinion,

418
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:11,131
you and Jincao really

419
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:13,290
love each other.

420
00:19:13,691 --> 00:19:15,610
You are the happiest couple.

421
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,931
Y-You must cherish it.

422
00:19:21,891 --> 00:19:23,731
Don't let that saying come true.

423
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,371
Spouses separate

424
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,610
when disaster strikes.

425
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:31,411
How disheartening that is.

426
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,850
Right, Moli?

427
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,330
I know.

428
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:45,330
I have a client appointment later.

429
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,330
Why don't you go back now?

430
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,770
I'm leaving then.

431
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,810
Are you Zhu Jincao? I'm the landlord.

432
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:12,451
You wanted to terminate the lease?

433
00:20:12,451 --> 00:20:13,891
Come and move your stuff.

434
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:19,371
I won't charge you
for the wear and tear of the furniture.

435
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:21,610
Your early termination of the lease
has caused me a great loss.

436
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:23,211
Among 5,000 yuan deposit,

437
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,171
I'll take 3,000 and give you 2,000 back.

438
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:26,211
I'm being fair.

439
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,570
I won't take advantage of you.

440
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:29,850
Alright, make the transfer.

441
00:20:30,971 --> 00:20:32,411
Then you should move out today.

442
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:34,211
I need to find someone to clean up,

443
00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:35,691
replace the furniture

444
00:20:35,691 --> 00:20:36,971
and find a new tenant.

445
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:37,850
It's quite troublesome.

446
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,491
It's two days
until the lease is canceled.

447
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:41,491
And you're not returning the rent
for these two days.

448
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,211
Maybe you could come back in two days.

449
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:48,451
What?

450
00:20:48,451 --> 00:20:50,090
So petty.

451
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,731
He even needs
to use up the rent for two days.

457
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:25,971
That's a beautiful drawing.

458
00:21:25,971 --> 00:21:26,651
Thank you.

I like it, but I can't do it.

464
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,451
The ones I draw
are usually engineering drawings.

465
00:21:41,451 --> 00:21:43,371
It's a lot harder than painting.

466
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,850
If you like painting,

467
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:46,731
you can come to our college

469
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,731
Of course.

470
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:49,651
Painters paint

471
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:51,250

472
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,491

Painter.

476
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,290
I am not a painter,

477
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,411
but just a student.

478
00:21:57,411 --> 00:21:59,171
You will be a painter.

479
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,330
I hope your words come true.

480
00:22:02,371 --> 00:22:03,090

Wu.

488
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,530
Well...

489
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,211
About Jincao and Moli,

490
00:22:39,211 --> 00:22:40,570
let's talk it out.

491
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,931
There's nothing to talk.

492
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,530
They just made a temporary mistake,

493
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,171
and got confused.

494
00:22:46,171 --> 00:22:46,891
We are adults.

495
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:48,371
We should help them.

496
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:49,651
What?

497
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:51,691
It's all your son's fault.

498
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:54,010
What exactly is his relationship
with Gao Xiajing?

499
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,491
Explain it.

(Your mom can't find you
and is very anxious.)

501
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,971
(Please call her back if you see this.)

502
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:20,491
Stop filming.

503
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:21,250
Film later.

504
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,090
It's okay. I need you.

505
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,570
What's going on?

506
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,971
No. Zhang Shanya.

507
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,250
Why are you so rude?

508
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,810
You don't listen to me.

509
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,290
You don't.

510
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,090
What do you want to say?

511
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:32,570
Wu, listen.

512
00:23:32,731 --> 00:23:34,050
The two of us must

513
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,131
resolve Jincao and Moli's issue.

514
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:37,090
How?

515
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,171
Why?

516
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,731
Because your son had an affair?

517
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:42,131
My son did not have an affair.

518
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:42,971
Where is the evidence?

519
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,411
Bring out the evidence.

520
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:46,131
What's his relationship

521
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:47,090
with that woman?

522
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,050
Can you explain it?

523
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,691
If you can't, then he had an affair.

524
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,691
At the very least,
it's an emotional affair.

525
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:52,651
Wait, you...

526
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,810
You...

527
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:56,211
Why can't you understand?

528
00:23:56,891 --> 00:23:58,731
There's a minor misunderstanding
among Jincao and Moli.

529
00:23:58,731 --> 00:24:01,171
Don't add fuel to the fire.

530
00:24:01,211 --> 00:24:02,411
To say the least,

531
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:03,570
you don't feel sorry for my son.

532
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,010
Fine. But you should
feel sorry for your daughter.

533
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,371
What about my daughter?

534
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:13,770
I went to the gallery today.

535
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,451
Anyway,

536
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:17,010
I don't think Moli's good.

537
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,891
She seemed deeply troubled,

538
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,770
not energetic at all.

539
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,691
It hurts me when I look at her.

540
00:24:22,691 --> 00:24:24,850
As her mother, don't you care about her?

541
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,891
Why did you go to the gallery again?

542
00:24:26,891 --> 00:24:28,290
I don't think you did anything good

543
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,850
the last time you went to the gallery.

544
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,250
Wait.

545
00:24:31,411 --> 00:24:34,211
Jincao has lost his job,
and I can't contact him.

546
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:36,290
So I had to look for Moli.

547
00:24:37,931 --> 00:24:39,451
Jincao has lost his job?

548
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,451
What did my daughter say then?

549
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,451
She didn't say much.

550
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,610
But I could tell she was upset.

551
00:24:56,131 --> 00:24:57,850
You really want to find your son?

552
00:24:57,971 --> 00:24:59,610
Of course.

553
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,810
Will it work?

554
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:08,810
I've already told you.

555
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,610
Or think of another way yourself.

556
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,290
Zhang Shanya.

557
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:13,770
Wu Yulan.

558
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,651
Here.

559
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:16,570
Everyone else is doing homework.

560
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,850
What are you chatting here?

561
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,810
A practice class is also a class.

562
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,330
You've paid for this.

563
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,691
Cherish it.

564
00:25:22,691 --> 00:25:23,691
No, Mr. Dong.

565
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:24,651
I have some emergency.

566
00:25:24,651 --> 00:25:25,451
I have to take a leave.

567
00:25:25,451 --> 00:25:26,371
I'll go first.

568
00:25:29,731 --> 00:25:32,530
Mr. Dong, I'm off to class.

569
00:27:17,931 --> 00:27:18,731
Sir.

570
00:27:18,731 --> 00:27:20,610
Anyway, follow the car

571
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,451
in front.

572
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:22,491
Rest assured.

573
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:01,731
How come you're here?

574
00:28:02,171 --> 00:28:03,330
Why didn't you respond?

575
00:28:03,371 --> 00:28:04,931
You have the recording.

576
00:28:04,931 --> 00:28:07,090
You could have brought Gao Xiajing down.

577
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,371
They fired you.

578
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:11,451
Why didn't you explain or refute?

579
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,891
Speak up, Zhu Jincao.

580
00:28:16,931 --> 00:28:18,971
The company already
made me leave voluntarily.

581
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:20,770
What's the point of me making any fuss?

582
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,731
They don't care who's right or wrong,

583
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,810
but only care about the impact.

584
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,651
No one cares what the truth is.

585
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:30,651
As for Gao Xiajing,

586
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,290
I have already explained

587
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:33,770
what I have to explain.

588
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,090
So you're just here
to be an ostrich, huh?

589
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:36,931
To escape.

590
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:38,931
You think the world
has nothing to do with you.

591
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,131
You don't answer your mom's calls,

592
00:28:40,131 --> 00:28:41,731
making your mom so worried.

593
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,570
She already knows you've resigned.

594
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,691
Have you thought about
how worried she is?

595
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:49,971
I didn't want to care about you.

596
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:52,371
But I don't know
if you're dead or alive,

597
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:53,570
so I can't do anything

598
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,010
or think of anything.

599
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,810
Thank you for still caring about me.

600
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,330
I'm not caring about you.

601
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,050
You're now a father, and a son.

602
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,250
You have no right to be dispirited.

603
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,651
I'm here for my daughter.

604
00:29:09,651 --> 00:29:10,610
Have you drunk?

605
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:12,290
Yes.

606
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,810
I'm done talking.

607
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,610
Seeing that you're still alive,

608
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:17,691
I'm leaving.

609
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,491
Moli.

610
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:21,290
Please don't go missing again,

611
00:29:21,371 --> 00:29:22,171
or let your mom

612
00:29:22,171 --> 00:29:24,090
come find me at the gallery.

613
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:25,570
Please.

614
00:29:31,931 --> 00:29:32,451
Mo...

615
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,530
Mom.

616
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:34,770
Why are you here?

617
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,010
Don't care about it.

618
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,330
Hurry up and go chase her.

619
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,171
I've heard

620
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:39,530
what you two just said.

621
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,891
What are you still doing standing here?

622
00:29:40,891 --> 00:29:42,050
Moli still cares about you.

623
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,290
Such a good wife, you...

624
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,850
I don't need to chase her.

625
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,570
Chasing is useless.

626
00:29:49,491 --> 00:29:50,651
Son.

627
00:29:52,131 --> 00:29:53,090
No matter what happens,

628
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,971
don't carry it alone.

629
00:29:55,731 --> 00:29:57,211
I've told you,

630
00:29:57,211 --> 00:29:58,250
you have me.

631
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:01,810
There's no hurdle we can't get over.

632
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,931
Son.

633
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,731
Come home with me.

634
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:25,211
This is wine, not water.

635
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,810
I want to chop up Zhu Jincao.

636
00:30:27,171 --> 00:30:28,330
Then I'll get you a knife.

637
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,451
I know

638
00:30:29,451 --> 00:30:31,691
there's nothing between
Zhu Jincao and Gao Xiajing.

639
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:33,530
I know he is innocent.

640
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,691
But I just can't stand it.

641
00:30:35,691 --> 00:30:38,290
Why did he show mercy to Gao Xiajing?

642
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:39,931
He has evidence.

643
00:30:39,931 --> 00:30:41,891
Why doesn't he just use it?

644
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,810
Zhu Jincao is a nice guy.

645
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,290
A kind man

646
00:30:47,371 --> 00:30:49,090
can't harm a woman.

647
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,651
He doesn't want to fight evil with evil.

648
00:30:50,731 --> 00:30:52,330
Are you my bestie or his?

649
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,330
Why do you defend him?

650
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,050
I'm trying to help you be objective.

651
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,891
Zhu Jincao is a decent guy.

652
00:30:58,971 --> 00:31:01,891
But sometimes
he's too decent and too tolerant.

653
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:03,371
He thinks

654
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:05,090
he could solve the problem
by enduring it.

655
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:06,770
Yes.

656
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:10,411
As a result,
he got solved by the problem.

657
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,570
He got divorce and unemployed
at middle age, and lost reputation.

658
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,131
Now he has nothing.

659
00:31:15,411 --> 00:31:16,211
Let me tell you.

660
00:31:16,211 --> 00:31:17,530
This is also your fault.

661
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,250
You have the recording.

662
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,211
If you want to make it public,

663
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,330
you don't have to ask him.

664
00:31:22,411 --> 00:31:24,371
But why didn't you do so?

665
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:26,371
Wait. He said he could solve it himself.

666
00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:27,610
What do you want me to do?

667
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,691
I can only respect him.

668
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:30,931
Dear.

669
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,250
You have to give Zhu Jincao time.

670
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,931
I have!

671
00:31:34,931 --> 00:31:36,411
I'm freaking out.

672
00:31:36,411 --> 00:31:37,211
Look at him,

673
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:39,050
like he's been wronged.

674
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,810
Get me another bottle.

675
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:43,090
Stop.

676
00:31:43,131 --> 00:31:44,570
Go home.

677
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,371
Ke is still waiting for you.

678
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:49,651
Such a big thing happened,

679
00:31:50,211 --> 00:31:52,530
so your parents
must be worried about you.

680
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,411
Even you are asking me to leave.

681
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:55,931
I really have nowhere to go.

682
00:32:02,491 --> 00:32:04,371
Why are you going to the toilet again?

683
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,530
If you don't want
to talk to me, just say it.

684
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:28,971
Hello.

685
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:30,810
Wu.

686
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,451
Has Moli gone back?

687
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,610
No.

688
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:34,651
What's wrong?

689
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,290
I heard Moli talking to Jincao today

690
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,010
about a recording.

691
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,371
As soon as that recording is played,

692
00:32:42,371 --> 00:32:43,891
it could take down Gao Xiajing.

693
00:32:43,891 --> 00:32:45,171
Do you know about this?

694
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,610
I'm right.

695
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,211
My daughter has a soft heart.

696
00:32:48,211 --> 00:32:50,451
If you follow her, you'll find your son.

697
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:52,610
Wait. Zhang Shanya.

698
00:32:53,131 --> 00:32:55,451
Why were you eavesdropping
on my daughter?

699
00:32:55,931 --> 00:32:57,330
Can you not interrupt?

700
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,931
I'm just asking
if you know about the recording.

701
00:33:00,491 --> 00:33:02,131
How would I know?

702
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:03,371
Ask your son.

703
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,371
Aren't you all worried?

704
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:13,371
Only I am worried?

705
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,691
Well played.

706
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,411
Yulan.

707
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,770
Go to our daughter's room,

708
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:22,770
under that big wardrobe,

709
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,451
inside that shoe box,

710
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:26,250
and take a look.

711
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,731
Ke, we're about done.

712
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:30,731
It's time to sleep.

713
00:33:30,731 --> 00:33:32,371
Tomorrow you have to go to kindergarten.

714
00:33:32,371 --> 00:33:33,131
Right?

715
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:33,810
Let's go.

716
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,171
Mr. Zhu, what do you want?

717
00:33:36,211 --> 00:33:37,850
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

718
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:39,290
Just say it.

719
00:33:39,411 --> 00:33:40,491
Here's the thing.

720
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:43,530
My daughter had an accident
at kindergarten.

721
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:45,250
I wanted to know the truth.

722
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,491
So I thought I'd need
the kindergarten surveillance.

723
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,050
But they said I must obtain
a certificate from the police station.

724
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,891
After I get the certificate
from the police station,

725
00:33:53,971 --> 00:33:55,731
I found the disk data is too large,

726
00:33:55,731 --> 00:33:57,290
and it's tough to search through it.

727
00:33:57,891 --> 00:33:59,931
So I thought of you,
the computer expert,

728
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:01,371
to see if you could help me out.

729
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,250
As long as the paperwork
is complete and legal,

730
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,090
I can handle it.

731
00:34:06,451 --> 00:34:07,811
I've finished the paperwork.

732
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,251
I need you to check this time period.

733
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,491
Leave it to me.

734
00:34:26,251 --> 00:34:27,730
KPI for next quarter,

735
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,931
I hope you can all be bold.

736
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:30,931
Don't be scared.

737
00:34:30,931 --> 00:34:32,690
From this slide that you've submitted

738
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,771
shows the courage you possess.

739
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:35,730
Your slide

740
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:37,530
isn't made just for me.

741
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,971
Liuliu, what's wrong?

742
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,530
I'm feeling a bit unwell.

743
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,010
Just try to overcome it.

744
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,610
What I'm talking about now
is very important.

745
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,411
I can't overcome it.

746
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:50,730
Mr. Wang.

747
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,650
I really can't make it.

748
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,170
Can I take a day off?

749
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,130
Alright.

750
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,050
Go ahead.

751
00:34:59,771 --> 00:35:00,811
Thank you.

752
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,251
Women are so troublesome.

753
00:35:05,251 --> 00:35:05,971
Exactly.

754
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:06,811
Let's continue.

755
00:35:06,811 --> 00:35:08,331
What do you mean?

756
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,331
What does it have to do with women?

757
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,570
When I worked all night,

758
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,690
why didn't you praise me

759
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,170
women are just amazing?

760
00:35:15,451 --> 00:35:17,771
I didn't say
you couldn't go back and rest.

761
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,971
We don't discriminate against women.

762
00:35:20,811 --> 00:35:23,130
Please go back and rest now.

763
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,210
Go back.

764
00:35:24,851 --> 00:35:25,891
Your slides...

765
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,371
Liuliu.

766
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:29,851
Liuliu.

767
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,451
Liuliu, you were so cool.

768
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:33,690
You did the right thing.

769
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,690
I support you.

770
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,690
Wherever you go, I'll follow.

771
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,891
You'll follow me to go home?

772
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,090
You go home...

773
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,170
Are you really feeling unwell?

774
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,530
What else?

775
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,931
I thought you just took the chance

776
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:46,650
to fire the boss.

777
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,331
I've been looking forward to this day.

778
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:49,530
Do you want me to lose my job?

779
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,730
How is that possible?

780
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:51,851
I want you to start a business.

781
00:35:51,851 --> 00:35:53,050
You're so capable.

782
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,130
You should set up your company.

783
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,491
You'll be the boss,
and I'll work for you.

784
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:11,931
Open the door.

785
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,650
You are bold to set someone up!

786
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,570
Open the door.

787
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,210
Auntie!

788
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,491
Stop knocking.

789
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:21,570
Who are you looking for?

790
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,010
I'm looking for Gao Xiajing.

791
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:26,291
She moved out yesterday.

792
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:27,610
She's moved out?

793
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:28,931
Where has she moved to?

794
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:30,650
She found a new job

795
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,411
and moved to live near the company.

796
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,411
Is there a company
that would want someone like her?

797
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,570
She is an internet celebrity.

798
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,610
Many MCN companies are vying for her.

799
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,730
Once she signed a contract,

800
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,730
she has her own apartment
and an assistant.

801
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,331
What M?

802
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:45,931
MCN.

803
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:47,570
It's a company
that creates short videos.

804
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,690
I don't think you understand.

805
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,291
Please stop.

806
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:49,690
Wait.

807
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,010
Wait. Wait a moment.

808
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,251
Let me ask you.

809
00:36:52,371 --> 00:36:53,771
You said she is an internet celebrity,

810
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,971
so I can certainly
find her online, right?

811
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:03,730
(Cheering for you!)

812
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,931
(You're a victim of corporate hegemony.)

813
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:07,090
(Down with the capitalists!)

814
00:37:07,371 --> 00:37:09,491
(What happened to your first marriage?
I want to hear about it.)

815
00:37:09,491 --> 00:37:11,371
(I heard the ex-husband
was a real scumbag.)

816
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,451
(That Mr. Zhu really demanded
his female subordinates)

817
00:37:13,451 --> 00:37:14,811
(to trade their bodies for support?)

818
00:37:14,811 --> 00:37:15,771
(It's so cruel.)

819
00:37:15,771 --> 00:37:17,971
Wait. Where can I deny them?

820
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,891
Lower your voice.

821
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:21,291
Keep watching.

822
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:22,931
(It's impossible for a man
not to be a scumbag.)

823
00:37:22,931 --> 00:37:24,971
(We women can be a scumbag too.)

824
00:37:24,971 --> 00:37:26,650
(Is it exclusive to men?)

825
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:28,411
(Flies don't land on a seamless egg.)

826
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:30,010
(Gao Xiajing, are you a scumbag?)

827
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:30,730
Yes.

828
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,010
(I saw the comments.)

829
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:34,451
(Sorry.)

830
00:37:34,931 --> 00:37:37,451
(I apologize for causing you
concern over my private matter.)

831
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,251
(Thank you for the concern.)

832
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,411
(Regarding those doubts,)

833
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,891
(I can understand.)

834
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:45,411
(But, I cannot accept)

835
00:37:45,411 --> 00:37:47,371
(curses and personal attacks.)

836
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:49,931
(You don't know the truth,)

837
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,650
(so you have no right to blame me.)

838
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:56,971
No way.

839
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,451
No matter where she is,

840
00:37:58,451 --> 00:37:59,851
I must find her.

841
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:01,811
Sit down. No need to find her.

842
00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:02,530
Wait.

843
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,771
Then let her talk nonsense?

844
00:38:04,771 --> 00:38:05,931
A tooth for a tooth.

845
00:38:05,931 --> 00:38:07,530
We can talk back too.

846
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,931
But how?

847
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:11,010
You have observed very carefully.

848
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,570
I found the recorder.

849
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,371
Well...

850
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:16,811
The key to taking down
Gao Xiajing is right here.

851
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:18,771
Listen carefully.

852
00:38:18,771 --> 00:38:19,971
I will train you.

853
00:38:19,971 --> 00:38:21,451
For what?

854
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:23,251
To fight on the Internet.

855
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,411
This Gao Xiajing,

856
00:38:24,411 --> 00:38:25,891
we must take her down.

857
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,010
Mr. Yan,

858
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,331
you can stand right here.

859
00:38:52,891 --> 00:38:55,170
Mr. Yan, please say something.

860
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,130
I'm not quite used
to this kind of setup.

861
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:08,371
The retrospective
is relatively small in scale.

862
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:09,730
I don't like any of these paintings,

863
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,251
or I would have
brought them out earlier.

864
00:39:12,491 --> 00:39:15,010
My agent said they are valuable,

865
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:18,570
as it can show people
my failed explorations.

866
00:39:19,851 --> 00:39:21,170
So I followed her advice.

867
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,050
I have finished.

868
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,530
Thank you all for coming today.

869
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,771
If Mr. Yan doesn't speak,

870
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:34,251
I dare not speak even more.

871
00:39:34,491 --> 00:39:37,210
Painters use their works
to communicate with the world.

872
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,971
So please enjoy

873
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:40,411
Mr. Yan's works.

874
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,971
Any questions?

875
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:45,570
Ms. Gu, may I ask you a question?

876
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:48,650
Go ahead.

877
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,170
Your ex-husband
is embroiled in a scandal.

878
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,210
Interestingly, it's no longer Mistress

879
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,170
who gets the most criticism online,

880
00:39:54,371 --> 00:39:55,811
but rather the man involved.

881
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,570
Has this matter

882
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,331
affected your view of the gender order

883
00:39:59,331 --> 00:40:00,730
in the current Internet ecosystem?

884
00:40:01,491 --> 00:40:02,570
Sorry.

885
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,411
Your question has nothing
to do with this exhibition.

886
00:40:05,411 --> 00:40:06,090
Thank you.

887
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,331
Gender order is a very serious topic.

888
00:40:08,331 --> 00:40:09,530
I hope you can respond.

889
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,610
You're not welcome at my exhibition.
Please leave.

890
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,411
Yan Li.

891
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:12,891
Mr. Yan.

892
00:40:12,891 --> 00:40:14,650
It's okay.

893
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:16,530
It's okay. I'll handle it.

894
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,130
(I agree with what you said.)

895
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,050
(Gender order is a very serious topic.)

896
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:26,730
(But I have long been divorced
from Mr. Zhu, the person involved.)

897
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:28,331
(I am not in a position)

898
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,371
(to comment his current life.)

899
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,291
Bro.

900
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:33,411
(Next question.)

901
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,730
How's it going?

902
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,090
It's done.

903
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:42,371
Here you are.

904
00:40:42,411 --> 00:40:43,371
Help me out.

905
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:52,771
Too much information.

906
00:40:52,771 --> 00:40:54,170
But I've already sorted it out for you.

907
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:56,130
You can just pick the time
and date you want.

908
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,931
I've ordered you the noodles.
You can eat.

909
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:58,931
Thank you.

910
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,610
(Guo, what are you eating?)

911
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,811
(Ice cream mooncake.)

912
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,491
(Ke, do you want some?)

913
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:19,210
(My mom said
I shouldn't eat food from strangers.)

914
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,530
Is it useful?

915
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:24,851
(Well, I'm not a stranger.)

916
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,690
(Thank you.)

917
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:29,090
(You're welcome.)

918
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,090
(Is it good?)

919
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,010
(Yeah.)

920
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:34,610
(Then have another one.)

921
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,331
(Hey, watch it!)

922
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:40,291
(I'm sorry.)

923
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:41,130
(Auntie, water.)

924
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:41,931
(I'm sorry.)

925
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:43,090
(Ke, are you okay?)

926
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,331
(I'm really sorry.)

927
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:48,690
Goddess, Green Tea, Phony, Attacker.

928
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:49,891
Well, slower.

929
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:50,610
I didn't get it.

930
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,971
Goddess, Green...

931
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:55,371
Green Tea, Phony, Attacker.

932
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:57,530
I don't understand any of this.

933
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,411
What are they?

934
00:41:59,411 --> 00:42:00,010
How?

935
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:01,811
This is so simple.

936
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,411
Just take it literally.

937
00:42:04,411 --> 00:42:04,891
Well...

938
00:42:04,891 --> 00:42:05,291
Wait.

939
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:06,971
Look, Gao Xiajing

940
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:10,050
pretends to be Goddess,
but is actually Green Tea.

941
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,730
And she pretends to be Phony,
but is actually Attacker.

942
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,690
How simple!

943
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,931
I still don't get it.

944
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:15,931
Explain it one more time.

945
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:16,971
Green Tea. What does it mean?

946
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:17,811
Memorize the words first.

947
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,291
Goddess,

948
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:24,530
Green Tea, Phony, Attacker.

949
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,491
Two of you,

950
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,411
what are you chatting here?

951
00:42:28,411 --> 00:42:29,331
Mr. Dong.

952
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:30,730
We...

953
00:42:32,331 --> 00:42:35,170
We want to shoot photos in themes.

954
00:42:35,371 --> 00:42:36,371
Right.

955
00:42:36,811 --> 00:42:39,451
This idea is so nice.

956
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:42,331
But what's Attacker?

957
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:49,090
It is a kind of metaphor,

958
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,730
an effect
under a special light and shadow.

959
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,371
It's

960
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:57,331
like a flower blossoming.

961
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:57,931
Right.

962
00:42:57,931 --> 00:43:00,291
This is her idea.

963
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:01,610
Well...

964
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,130
It's good.

965
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,010
Then go shoot it.

966
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,090
After you finish,

967
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,210
I'll get our whole class

968
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,570
to learn together.

969
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,331
Okay, thank you.

970
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:10,451
- Bye, Mr. Dong.
- Bye, Mr. Dong.

971
00:43:14,411 --> 00:43:15,371
Keep it.

972
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,570
Keep this
nonsense-talking state of yours.

973
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:20,730
Stop laughing.

974
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,811
Like a flower blossoming.

975
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,130
