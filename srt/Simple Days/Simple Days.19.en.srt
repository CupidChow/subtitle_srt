19
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,661
What's wrong?

20
00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:57,580
I'm looking for someone.

21
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,381
Me.

22
00:01:58,381 --> 00:01:59,741
I'm looking for Zhang Shanya.

23
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:05,181
- Then I'll be out.
- Go ahead.

24
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,061
What's wrong, Moli?

25
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,700
I bought you a new phone.

26
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,061
No need.

27
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:15,580
Jincao just gave this to me.

28
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,700
It works pretty well.

29
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,101
Don't worry about it. Just use this one.

30
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,661
Take it easy.

31
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:27,781
Let's start with

32
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:28,941
the best time for shooting.

33
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,261
Alright, it's all set.

34
00:02:30,261 --> 00:02:32,020
You'd use this. I'm leaving then.

35
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,941
No, wait.

36
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:33,541
You...

37
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:35,420
I have lots of pictures here.

38
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,300
I know.

39
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,341
You attend your class now.

40
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:38,621
I'll transfer them to you later.

41
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:39,061
Okay.

42
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:39,580
I'm leaving.

43
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,580
During the golden hour,

44
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,980
the light is relatively soft.

45
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,180
So you can also see beautiful glows.

46
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:48,700
The most beautiful night view

47
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,221
is when the sun is about to set.

48
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:55,621
The second best time to shoot

49
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:59,821
is 18 to 40 minutes after sunset.

50
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,860
Your daughter gave me a new phone.

51
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,221
Don't be mad.

52
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,541
Don't get too happy too soon.

53
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:12,180
Think carefully.

54
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,460
When would a woman

55
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,541
want her ex-husband's old phone?

56
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,020
What do you mean?

57
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:25,180
Think about it.

58
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,928
(Insomniac Gale:
I'm Gale in the game, enjoy the game.)

59
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:37,420
(Enjoy.)

60
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,980
(I never talked to strangers.)

61
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:41,261
(But we made a good team.)

62
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,396
(We won some games,
so I want to chat with you.)

63
00:03:47,396 --> 00:03:48,066
(Gale and Jincao,)

64
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:50,546
(sound like we can make a perfect team.)
[*It's an idiom in Chinese]

65
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:53,706
(You have played all night.
Doesn't your family)

66
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:56,856
(come to stop you?)

67
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:00,700
(Luckily, no.)

68
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,781
(Currently on a business trip,)

69
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:04,821
(I have pressure working outside.)

70
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:06,420
(It's quite lonely alone,)

71
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,941
(I have to relax a bit.)

72
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:11,906
(Insomniac Gale: A man is out of town
with his wife and kids away.)

73
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:12,967
(It's the most free and carefree state.)

74
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:17,700
(Buddy,)

75
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,741
(not at all.)

76
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:20,340
(It's not a good feeling to be alone.)

77
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,381
(Still, the warmth of being
with a wife and kid is best.)

78
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,821
Mid-Autumn Festival.

79
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:48,821
(I know the midnight snacks
at Tianxi Hotel are pretty good.)

80
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:51,181
(See you there in an hour.)

81
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,621
I'll leave you two alone.

82
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:21,100
Moli.

83
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:25,100
You came to my law firm today,

84
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:27,460
but I could see
you're really not in a good state.

85
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,220
I know what the problem is.

86
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:32,181
So I feel it's necessary

87
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:33,780
to come here and talk to you.

88
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,700
I am a lawyer.

89
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,540
I see too much

90
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,540
of those negative stuff.

91
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,261
Hiring someone to follow,
investigating the other party,

92
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,780
or even installing
a tracking system on them.

93
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,900
None of these are surprising.

94
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,660
Of course.

95
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:52,460
It often may not

96
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:55,340
have much to do
with the person's character,

97
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,340
but entirely because

98
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,140
this person is too suspicious,

99
00:05:58,301 --> 00:06:01,340
or cares too much about the other party.

100
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,621
It's all out of concern.

101
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:04,821
Moli.

102
00:06:06,061 --> 00:06:07,941
In fact, everything has two sides.

103
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,381
You might as well think about it
from another angle.

104
00:06:10,741 --> 00:06:12,340
Whatever is Zhu Jincao's purpose

105
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,261
for installing

106
00:06:13,261 --> 00:06:14,981
the tracking system on you,

107
00:06:14,981 --> 00:06:16,100
this time,

108
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,540
he did save your life.

109
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,981
Did you drive here?

110
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,981
My car was sent
to the 4S shop for maintenance.

111
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:23,861
Can you take me to Jinshan?

112
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:28,340
Moli.

113
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,061
Moli.

114
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,261
Mom, Ke's Grandma.

115
00:06:31,261 --> 00:06:31,780
Moli.

116
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,981
How come you're here?

117
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,020
Well, I think...

118
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,261
Jiang Haitao?

119
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:40,421
Are you Jiang Haitao?

120
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:41,821
Yes, Auntie.

121
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:43,020
Long time no see.

122
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,580
Aren't you abroad?

123
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,621
I've been back for a long time.

124
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:48,540
Now I run a law firm

125
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,700
with a friend.

126
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,821
Being the boss?

127
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:52,020
No, no.

128
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,660
A partner.

129
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,220
A partner is the boss.

130
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,700
I know it.

131
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:02,941
How old is your child?

132
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:07,861
Actually, I don't have any kids yet.

133
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,140
Aren't you already married?

134
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:11,460
To be honest,

135
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,700
I've divorced for a long while.

136
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,780
Divorced?

137
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:14,821
Mom, stop.

138
00:07:14,821 --> 00:07:15,460
He's divorced...

139
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:17,741
We have things to do.

140
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:19,501
No, no. Wait a moment.

141
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,020
This is...

142
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:23,900
Let me introduce you.

143
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,580
His name is Jiang Haitao,

144
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,421
Moli's ex-boyfriend, a lawyer.

145
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,941
You heard it, right? He's a partner.

146
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:32,460
A partner is the boss.

147
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,501
Understand?

148
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,780
How long have you two been in touch?

149
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,220
Right, you...

150
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,780
We really have things to do.

151
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,741
Let's go, Jiang Haitao.

152
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:42,181
Excuse me.

153
00:07:42,181 --> 00:07:44,100
Moli, where are you going?

154
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,261
I'm going to Jinshan.

155
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,780
I'm going too.

156
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,501
I'm going too.

157
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,020
Wait. Why are you two going?

158
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,660
We...

159
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,381
M-M-Moli.

160
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,220
Sit in the back.

161
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:00,540
It's too crowded.

162
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,861
I'm fine sitting in the front.

163
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,861
It's safe.

164
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:04,621
Come on. Sitting in the back is safer.

165
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:05,621
Come, sit in the back.

166
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:06,301
Come on.

167
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:11,100
Auntie, get in the car.

168
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:13,340
You!

169
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,460
The front is empty.

170
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,261
Why do you make us squeeze
in the back like this?

171
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:17,340
Why?

172
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,621
Hello, Kai.

173
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,821
Hello.

174
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:28,140
Navigate to Jinshan.

175
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,140
The shortest route
has been mapped out for you.

176
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:18,261
Son.

177
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,060
Mom, call Moli right now.

178
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,420
She's on her way to Jinshan.

179
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,621
I don't care what excuse you use,

180
00:09:23,621 --> 00:09:24,660
saying you are sick,

181
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,101
or saying Ke is sick.

182
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:26,581
Anyway,

183
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:27,741
make sure you hold her off.

184
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:28,981
You can't let her come to Jinshan.

185
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,501
Well, what happened?

186
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:32,140
Do as I say.

187
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,501
Don't tip off.

188
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:46,900
I want to see

189
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,261
what secret

190
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:49,660
your son has hidden today.

191
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,341
Haitao.

192
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:57,940
Faster.

193
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,101
Okay.

194
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,940
That's it.

195
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:13,501
Apart from normal communication
in the neighborhood

196
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:15,381
and contact at the working level,

197
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,420
there is no ambiguous relationship

198
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:19,540
between Gao Xiajing and me.

199
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:22,660
Gao Xiajing.

200
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,261
Do you have anything to say?

201
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:27,381
As an individual host,

202
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:29,020
I don't buy traffic or fake it.

203
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:30,420
I fight alone.

204
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,621
It's difficult
to produce quality content.

205
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:33,741
I am deeply grateful

206
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:35,140
for the guidance and suggestions

207
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,341
from your platform and Mr. Zhu.

208
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,461
I wish

209
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,341
more individual hosts like me

210
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:41,900
could get this kind of help.

211
00:10:42,981 --> 00:10:45,940
Because it's a chance
for them to survive.

212
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,940
It's even more difficult
for female hosts.

213
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,780
I hope slander could stop.

214
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,060
I don't want to be misunderstood

215
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,540
just by getting a bit help.

216
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:57,420
To be honest,

217
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,261
why is it getting more difficult

218
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:01,981
for individual hosts
to achieve something?

219
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,701
As a livestreaming platform,

220
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,381
our company has
both guilds and individual hosts,

221
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:09,940
two major groups.

222
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:12,140
And the guilds often use

223
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,701
the advantage of their own size

224
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:16,060
to put pressure on the hosts

225
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:18,940
and exploit various interest chains

226
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,540
to tie up with livestreaming platforms.

227
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,221
Today is to investigate you,

228
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:23,861
or to investigate
the livestreaming guild?

229
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:25,820
Do not attempt to prove your innocence

230
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,300
by shifting the target, okay?

231
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,861
Every injustice has its perpetrator.

232
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:30,820
Why would someone slander me

233
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,701
and spread rumors?

234
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,060
Because I told the truth,

235
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:36,101
touching someone's interests.

236
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,861
And Gao Xiajing
is only implicated by me.

237
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,621
Who planned this matter?

238
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:43,180
What exactly is he up to?

239
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:45,820
I don't think this guy's
just trying to take me down.

240
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,660
He also hopes

241
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:49,780
to continue to use these fake data

242
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,020
for his own interests,

243
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:54,221
and then control
the entire livestreaming community.

244
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,261
Therefore, today, all leaders,

245
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:01,981
I report Liu Zhi.

246
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:08,780
Liu Zhi took bribes,
illegally signed contracts,

247
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,701
used unfair means to compete

248
00:12:10,861 --> 00:12:14,140
and incited his subordinates
to post on the Intranet.

249
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:15,501
I request an investigation.

250
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,221
You need the evidence to say so.

251
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:19,621
You can't just slander me.

252
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:20,820
I have evidence.

253
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,140
As a full-time host,

254
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:25,501
I joined the WeChat group
of hosts on your platform.

255
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,381
Everyone in the group knows

256
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:29,060
that to get good recommendation spots,

257
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,780
we must pay money to Liu Zhi.

258
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:32,861
I have already contacted

259
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:34,940
Tian Li, Zhang Heng, and Fang Kefei.

260
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,900
The three of them

261
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,461
transferred 30,000
to 100,000 thousand yuan

262
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:38,741
to Liu Zhi respectively

263
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:40,261
within six months.

264
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:41,540
For specific details,

265
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,741
you can ask
these three people for details.

266
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:45,900
I have WeChat screenshots.

267
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:47,741
Liu Zhi, explain this.

268
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:48,660
Venomously slander.

269
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660
I am going to sue you.

270
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,780
Just do it.

271
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,741
I now have evidence,

272
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:55,381
but I won't be like you,

273
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,660
ordering subordinates
to post and create public opinion.

274
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:01,381
Because I cherish
the reputation of the company.

275
00:13:03,621 --> 00:13:04,420
Furthermore,

276
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,940
thank you

277
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,741
for concerning my marriage.

278
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:12,461
But my wife and I
have a great relationship.

279
00:13:12,621 --> 00:13:14,221
Although we've divorced,

280
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,020
we still have a good relationship.

281
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,221
I don't think you would understand.

282
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
But let me tell you,

283
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
sooner or later,

284
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:21,940
I will remarry her.

285
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,180
He's wrong.

286
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:26,300
We have no plans to remarry.

287
00:14:00,621 --> 00:14:01,861
If you need evidence,

288
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:03,060
feel free to contact me.

289
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:07,660
What are you doing here?

290
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,060
What are you doing

291
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,221
in my son's conference room?

292
00:14:10,221 --> 00:14:11,621
Mom, let her leave.

293
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:12,501
Stop making a scene here.

294
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:13,101
No, she...

295
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:14,020
I'll explain it later.

296
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,300
Is there anything we can't say here?

297
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:18,981
No, Moli.

298
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:21,341
You must have some misunderstanding.

299
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:22,341
Just talk it out.

300
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:23,861
Please go out now.

301
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,701
We'll wait outside.

302
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,701
Didn't I tell you

303
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:28,461
they make their own decisions?

304
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:30,780
No, there's some misunderstanding.

305
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:33,581
Don't worry. My daughter won't eat him.

306
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,261
Moli, talk it out properly.

307
00:14:37,261 --> 00:14:39,501
Auntie, give them space.

308
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,861
Okay, okay.

309
00:14:43,861 --> 00:14:44,820
Zhang Shanya.

310
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:46,020
Hurry up.

311
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,861
Hurry.

312
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:07,501
Say it.

313
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,900
Who is that woman?

314
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:12,060
She is

315
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,940
a neighbor of ours,

316
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,621
named Gao Xiajing.

317
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:18,741
I-I have already asked Jincao about it.

318
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:19,701
Don't get the wrong idea.

319
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:21,741
H-He has no thoughts about her.

320
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,660
You have already asked?

321
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:24,741
If he has no thoughts,

322
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:25,660
why did you ask?

323
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,501
Please apologize to the client for me.

324
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:28,820
No thoughts mean no thoughts.

325
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,741
Don't get it wrong.

326
00:15:29,741 --> 00:15:31,261
Don't add fuel to the fire.

327
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:32,140
If he's clean...

328
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,940
I have to go now. Bye.

329
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,660
he fears nothing.

330
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:34,861
Let me tell you.

331
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:36,261
It's a matter of principle.

332
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:36,780
Zhang Shanya.

333
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,420
You must explain it clearly to me today.

334
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,261
No, Jincao is innocent.

335
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:40,780
Innocent?

336
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,140
He's innocent.

337
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,581
Gao Xiajing is even here in the company.

338
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,780
Innocent? How?

339
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,581
Stop lying.

340
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:45,981
It's not clear yet.

341
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:46,461
What?

342
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:47,180
Two aunties.

343
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,981
How?

344
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,221
Two aunties, listen.

345
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:51,341
We're still at the company.

346
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:53,261
It's so bad for people to hear.

347
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,741
And it's even worse for them to hear.

348
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:57,221
Listen.

349
00:15:57,221 --> 00:15:58,140
Let's talk outside.

350
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,741
Let's talk it out, okay? Come on.

351
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:00,341
Let me tell you.

352
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:02,180
You have to make it clear to me.

353
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,780
You must make this matter clear.

354
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,300
When I was young,

355
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:11,381
I thought black and white

356
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,501
are so different,

357
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,900
until I read a sentence in a book.

358
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:21,101
Youth is like a river.

359
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:25,020
It flows and becomes muddy.

360
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:26,940
At first, I didn't believe it.

361
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,621
Until I had my own experiences.

362
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,180
My life

363
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:34,461
has become muddy with indistinct colors.

364
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,140
Only then did I realize,

365
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,780
between black and white,

366
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,461
there are really so many

367
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,221
exhausting

368
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:46,101
indistinct gray things.

369
00:16:51,088 --> 00:16:55,190
=Simple Days=
(Black, White and Gray)

370
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,941
Zhu Jincao.

371
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:06,661
Explain it.

372
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,501
How did you know

373
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:10,580
I would come to Jinshan
on the night of Mid-Autumn Festival?

374
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:15,221
How did you know

375
00:17:15,221 --> 00:17:16,981
Big Ai held me in Qifeng?

376
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:20,741
And today,

377
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,461
how did you know
I was coming to your company?

378
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,261
Keeping silence?

379
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,300
This is your old phone.

380
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:47,941
I've seen all the chat history

381
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,221
from the game.

382
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,380
Who were you chatting with
in the middle of the night?

383
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,380
Still keeping silence?

384
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,100
Alright then.

385
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:13,620
Let me lay it out for you.

386
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,780
To make it convenient for your affair,

387
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:22,181
you installed
a tracking app on my phone.

388
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:24,780
On the Mid-Autumn Festival,

389
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:27,221
because Ke had a fever,
we couldn't make it to Jinshan.

390
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,380
You quickly arranged
to meet Insomniac Gale.

391
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,780
Later, through the tracker,
you found out that I was on my way.

392
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:36,020
So you got away with canceling

393
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,060
on short notice.

394
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,820
You still used the tracking app

395
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,380
to get Jiang Haitao to rescue me.

396
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:47,941
It was the same today.

397
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,501
You knew I was coming to your company,

398
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,941
so you had your mother hold me up,

399
00:18:52,941 --> 00:18:54,981
in order to prevent me
from meeting your lover.

400
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,380
Am I right?

401
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,020
(There's no physical gap,)

402
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,141
(but there is a mental gap.)

403
00:19:08,261 --> 00:19:11,540
(This is still the first time we've been
apart since we got married,)

404
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,820
(and it's such a long time.)

405
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:15,981
(I'm missing you already.)

406
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,261
(I didn't mean to hide it from you.)

407
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,901
(I wasn't planning on
accepting Jiang Haitao's help.)

408
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:25,661
(I went there today)

409
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:27,701
(just to repay him the money
for the painting.)

410
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,300
(Was it necessary to book a room then?)

411
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,340
(I personally confirmed it
at the front desk.)

412
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,741
(Don't tell me it didn't happen.)

413
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:34,901
(As a couple, if we lack of trust,)

414
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:36,060
(what's the point?)

415
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,300
(I also think it's pointless.)

416
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,741
(Zhu Jincao, let's get a divorce.)

417
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,100
Yes.

418
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:46,141
I admit it.

419
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:48,580
Before coming to Jinshan,

420
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:50,380
the last time we got a room.

421
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,340
Do you remember?

422
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,501
It was that day I installed it.

423
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:57,901
But I...

424
00:19:58,181 --> 00:19:59,941
I wasn't doing it to have an affair.

425
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,501
Then you were doing it

426
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,181
to protect me?

427
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:06,620
From Jiang Haitao.

428
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,261
You cheat on me,

429
00:20:11,261 --> 00:20:12,501
yet you suspect me?

430
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,941
You really impressed me.

431
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:16,181
Aren't you the same?

432
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:18,780
How did you know I was going out

433
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,020
on Mid-Autumn Festival?

434
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,860
How did you track on me precisely?

435
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,181
It's because

436
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:29,340
you pretended to be Insomniac Gale,

437
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:31,380
tempting me, testing me,

438
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:32,661
and even spying on me.

439
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:39,780
You think I'm Insomniac Gale?

440
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
It's me testing you with a burner?

441
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,181
What else?

442
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,421
Then,

443
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:46,540
you also installed

444
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,380
a tracking app on my phone.

445
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,461
I knew about your date,

446
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,020
because someone wanted me to know.

447
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,540
See it for yourself.

448
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:13,510
(Jincao, Tianxi Hotel, see you there.
Spend the night together!)

449
00:21:23,306 --> 00:21:25,558
(Conference Room)

450
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,461
Who sent you this anonymous message?

451
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,580
What do you think?

452
00:21:31,981 --> 00:21:33,981
Who else could it be but Gao Xiajing?

453
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,741
I've given you many chances.

454
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:39,141
You helped her pick up the kid.

455
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,901
Fine, I support you.

456
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:44,780
You gave Gao Xiajing a fitness voucher.

457
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,300
The next day, there was a story

458
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,820
about me and Yan Li on the Internet.

459
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,141
Fine. She did all this.
It's not related to you.

460
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,741
She declared war on me
about pursuing you.

461
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,580
I think that's her business,

462
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,981
so I choose to trust you.

463
00:22:00,141 --> 00:22:01,421
You said you came here

464
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,661
to fight for our family.

465
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,540
And the result?

466
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:07,701
You chat with her and date with her.

467
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:09,901
You did all this, right?

468
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:10,620
After all happened,

469
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,261
why have you never told me?

470
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:13,860
Do you know why Ke had a fever

471
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,661
on Mid-Autumn Festival?

472
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:17,141
Because Gao Xiajing

473
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:18,901
gave her four ice cream mooncakes

474
00:22:18,901 --> 00:22:20,540
and spilled water all over her.

475
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,461
Such a big thing happened,

476
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:22,741
but why didn't you tell me sooner?

477
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,300
Because I'm foolish.

478
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,780
My family is under threat,

479
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,141
yet I still choose to trust you.

480
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:32,020
I choose to deal with it myself.

481
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:37,261
Gale and Jincao.

482
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,701
Her ID aims at you.

483
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:44,380
From now on,

484
00:22:45,141 --> 00:22:46,901
Gao Xiajing is no longer my problem,

485
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,620
but yours.

486
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:54,741
Come with me.

487
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,141
I thought

488
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,580
Zhu Jincao had offered much to you.

489
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:12,901
Unexpectedly, what you care about

490
00:23:13,181 --> 00:23:14,820
is him.

491
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,221
You did it for love.

492
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,060
It's rare.

493
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:22,701
What do you want?

494
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:25,060
Gao Xiajing.

495
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,860
I came to settle the score with you.

496
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,661
But just now,

497
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,501
their parents came because of you.

498
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:34,100
Yet, you remain so calm.

499
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,780
Women like you are pretty rare.

500
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:39,981
There's no guarantee,

501
00:23:39,981 --> 00:23:42,701
yet you join Zhu Jincao to deal with me.

502
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,941
Impressive.

503
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,380
Listen.

504
00:23:50,941 --> 00:23:52,780
There are more reliable things than men.

505
00:23:54,461 --> 00:23:57,741
If you need anything, come to me.

506
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,261
(I installed the tracking app
on your phone.)

507
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,060
(It was a moment of confusion.)

508
00:24:17,261 --> 00:24:18,501
(I regret it very much.)

509
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,100
(If you want to sue me,)

510
00:24:20,701 --> 00:24:22,340
(I'm willing to accept
the legal consequences.)

511
00:24:22,501 --> 00:24:25,261
(I've also checked your dashcam.)

512
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,580
(Are you going to sue me too?)

513
00:24:26,941 --> 00:24:28,181
(I won't sue you.)

514
00:24:28,181 --> 00:24:30,141
(I know why you did that.)

515
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,380
(I hope you to forgive me.)

516
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,141
Moli.

517
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,261
I'm sorry.

518
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,141
I lied to you.

519
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:44,340
In fact, my life in Jinshan

520
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,860
is not at all

521
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,461
what I usually describe to you.

522
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:53,421
I'm having a hard time working here.

523
00:24:55,501 --> 00:24:57,221
People at work
are giving me a hard time.

524
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,300
They're targeting and rejecting me.

525
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,340
I've tried to change things,

526
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,221
but failed.

527
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,261
Sometimes,

528
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,620
I really feel lonely.

529
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,540
So I downloaded the game

530
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:19,300
and played the game in the late night.

531
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,380
Think of it

532
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,100
as relaxation

533
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,901
and relief.

534
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:31,709
♪Through the curtains♪

535
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:35,745
♪Quietly admiring
the arc light in the filter♪

536
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:37,020
Today,

537
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:40,461
I had to get you here.

538
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:42,380
Just to tell you

539
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,580
I'm here all the time except for work.

540
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,461
Right in this small room,

541
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:49,300
to be honest, I didn't feel like

542
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,141
I was working hard.

543
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,340
Because I'm also very clear

544
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,941
about why I came to Jinshan.

545
00:25:55,741 --> 00:25:57,661
My goal is very clear.

546
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,580
So I really don't

547
00:26:04,901 --> 00:26:07,060
have time to find a lover.

548
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,020
After I suffer

549
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,100
and I feel wronged every day,

550
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,501
I'd tell myself

551
00:26:11,941 --> 00:26:13,060
that all this effort

552
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,620
is for our family

553
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,020
and worth it.

554
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,501
Believe it or not,

555
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,380
I can assure you

556
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:23,620
I haven't changed.

557
00:26:23,941 --> 00:26:25,540
And I understand you checked the dashcam

558
00:26:26,141 --> 00:26:27,221
because you're afraid
I'm having an affair.

559
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,661
Whether Gao Xiajing
is Insomniac Gale or not,

560
00:26:34,181 --> 00:26:35,860
it's a problem I caused.

561
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:38,780
Give me some time.

562
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:41,261
I'll resolve it myself.

563
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:51,125
♪We'll travel far together♪

564
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:16,981
The pot.

565
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,380
Don't think that you got wronged

566
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,860
at the photography exhibition,

567
00:27:21,981 --> 00:27:24,820
so you can spend all day in a daze.

568
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:27,540
Ke's Grandpa.

569
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,820
I-I really have to tell you something.

570
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:33,620
I heard

571
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,701
Jincao got reported by the company
over some ambiguous relationship

572
00:27:36,701 --> 00:27:39,701
with one of their hosts.

573
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,340
Now the company is going
to hold him accountable.

574
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,340
You're his Dad.

575
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,380
Ask him

576
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,820
if this matter is true or not.

577
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,580
If it's true,

578
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,741
you'll need to talk to him.

579
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:50,141
W-Wait.

580
00:27:50,661 --> 00:27:52,221
What do you mean
by hold him accountable?

581
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,380
The company is going to fire Jincao?

582
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:58,380
No. They'd conduct
an investigation anyway.

583
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:00,100
I'm telling you, I don't believe

584
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,820
that our son could do such a thing.

585
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:03,701
But Moli can't take it.

586
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,380
Now they are

587
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,661
fighting over this matter.

588
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:08,020
What's her point?

589
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,901
They've divorced.

590
00:28:10,181 --> 00:28:10,860
Wait.

591
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:14,461
Yes, they've divorced,

592
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:17,340
but they were good for a while.

593
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,141
So I think they could...

594
00:28:18,141 --> 00:28:19,461
I don't care.

595
00:28:19,461 --> 00:28:21,701
As long as Zhu Jincao
has the divorce certificate,

596
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,100
he's a free man.

597
00:28:23,261 --> 00:28:24,860
What's wrong with that Gu Moli?

598
00:28:24,941 --> 00:28:27,461
She's the one who forced him
to find a woman outside.

599
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:29,300
Doesn't she have any responsibility?

600
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,941
Okay, you're right.

601
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,060
Let me tell you.

602
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,780
If your son gets fired,

603
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,860
then he deserves it.

604
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,221
Right?

605
00:28:39,221 --> 00:28:40,380
Nonsense.

606
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,901
Company leaders are open-minded now,

607
00:28:43,981 --> 00:28:46,380
so they won't interfere with
employees' private lives.

608
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,981
Just tell Gu Moli.

609
00:28:49,221 --> 00:28:51,661
If she's smart, she'd better shut up.

610
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:54,661
With Jincao's capability,

611
00:28:54,661 --> 00:28:57,780
he won't stumble over such a trifle.

612
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,020
How do you know he won't?

613
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,221
What?

614
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,661
Have you been in frequent contact
with Gu Moli lately?

615
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,380
You tell her.

616
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,100
If she wants to remarry,

617
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,780
then stop making a fuss.

618
00:29:12,261 --> 00:29:13,860
In the face of major issues,

619
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,141
women of the Zhu family must
understand the great cause.

620
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:18,620
Otherwise, don't think about remarrying.

621
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,780
Right, everything you say is right.

622
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:33,540
Mom, what's the matter?

623
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,501
Son, listen.

624
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:38,580
A good man

625
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,261
has to keep your wife
and kids in your mind.

626
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:42,221
Right?

627
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:44,100
No matter how good you do your job,

628
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,941
but if your wife doesn't support you,

629
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:47,340
it's of no use.

630
00:29:47,741 --> 00:29:49,741
Just talk it out to Moli

631
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:51,501
and win her back.

632
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:54,901
Well, are you listening?

633
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:56,340
I'm listening.

634
00:29:58,261 --> 00:29:59,181
Jincao.

635
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:00,941
Don't listen to your mom.

636
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:02,020
She's just a woman.

637
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,860
She knows nothing.

638
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,060
Alright, stop talking.

639
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,181
I know what you're going to say.

640
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:06,020
I know what I'm doing.

641
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,941
I'm afraid you don't.

642
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:09,860
The most important thing
for a man is his career.

643
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,941
You can't be sentimental.

644
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,941
If you marry a wife,

645
00:30:13,941 --> 00:30:14,780
you should choose someone

646
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,580
who can help you in all aspects,

647
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,380
not ruin you.

648
00:30:18,421 --> 00:30:19,501
Yes.

649
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,221
Just like my mom.

650
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,340
Knowing you had an affair,

651
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,261
you cut it off
for the promotion to chief,

652
00:30:25,261 --> 00:30:26,340
yet, she dared not say anything.

653
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,221
Nonsense.

654
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:28,100
What did you say?

655
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,340
What are you saying?

656
00:30:33,261 --> 00:30:35,941
Jincao, Jincao.

657
00:30:36,741 --> 00:30:39,060
You've spoiled him.
How dare he hung up on me!

658
00:30:49,701 --> 00:30:50,501
Gu Moli.

659
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:52,780
Listen to me.

660
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,221
Never go back to the Zhu family.

661
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,461
That Zhu Jincao...

662
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,661
I couldn't tell at all.

663
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,300
He is being

664
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,221
honest and with an innocent look.

665
00:31:08,181 --> 00:31:10,221
Turns out he's a playboy.

666
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,661
Moli.

667
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:13,421
What do you think?

668
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,580
What's the matter?

669
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:21,100
I've called you so many times.

670
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,580
Why didn't you answer?

671
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,901
You have a very bad attitude
towards your clients.

672
00:31:25,181 --> 00:31:26,340
I'll send you a location.

673
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,661
Come to me right now,
immediately, at once.

674
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:29,741
What do you want?

675
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:31,421
Save my life.

676
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,620
Can you stop talking nonsense?

677
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,340
Annoying.

678
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:36,261
Back then, I didn't ask anything

679
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,540
and came to rescue you immediately.

680
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,820
You owe me a favor.

681
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:39,941
Come here.

682
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,701
Okay, I'm coming.

683
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:45,820
Dad, Mom, I'm going out.

684
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,860
What are you going to do?

685
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,580
The dishes are all on the table.
Didn't you see?

686
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,501
I'm so unlucky.

687
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:52,340
I have to serve the client.

688
00:31:52,941 --> 00:31:54,620
What?

689
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,941
I'm your dad.

690
00:31:55,941 --> 00:31:57,100
You haven't answered me yet.

691
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,141
Moli, Moli.

692
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,421
Zhou Yu.

693
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,501
Let's talk about something.

694
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,540
Come on.

695
00:32:10,701 --> 00:32:11,340
Go ahead.

696
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,141
What's wrong?

697
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,100
Did you see her?

698
00:32:19,221 --> 00:32:21,300
She keeps crying and just won't leave.

699
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,421
What does that have to do with me?

700
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,181
You get her out of here and you're done.

701
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:27,701
I...

702
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,020
You promised you'd save my life.

703
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,501
Then what's your relationship with her?

704
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,941
She goes around saying
she's my girlfriend.

705
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:44,221
This is having a bad effect on me.

706
00:32:44,221 --> 00:32:45,421
I care about my reputation.

707
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,901
Is she your girlfriend or not?

708
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:47,741
No.

709
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:48,941
Please.

710
00:32:49,981 --> 00:32:50,780
Xin.

711
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,300
My stepmom wants to talk to you.

712
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,720
(Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, Fitness,
Boxing, Muay Thai)

713
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,100
Don't listen to him.

714
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,741
I'm not his stepmom.

715
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,580
I've seen the chat history
between you two.

716
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,941
Zhou Yu is just an unreliable person.

717
00:33:14,941 --> 00:33:16,501
He just wants to play.

718
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:18,501
And you aren't serious, either.

719
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,181
I assume you sent
those messages in groups.

720
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,941
I've seen these templates online.

721
00:33:24,221 --> 00:33:25,300
I'm young and beautiful.

722
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,540
What's wrong with wanting
to marry a rich, handsome man?

723
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,901
Even if he was drunk

724
00:33:28,901 --> 00:33:30,020
or didn't take off his clothes,

725
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,540
but he laid beside me all night.

726
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,701
Then that counts.

727
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:41,181
Xin, this move of yours

728
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,780
might have worked 30 years ago.

729
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:46,060
Men nowadays are more astute.

730
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,701
Nothing has happened
between you two now.

731
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:50,340
But even if something had happened,

732
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,020
he may not be responsible for you.

733
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,741
He can't even touch you,

734
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:55,661
just afraid you'll cling to him.

735
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,421
What a coward.

736
00:33:57,421 --> 00:33:59,340
What's the benefit of dating him?

737
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:01,860
Maybe the jewelry
he gives you is rented.

738
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:03,580
You'll have to return it then.

739
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,100
And you expect him to marry you?

740
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,661
Stepmom.

741
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,340
Stepmom.

742
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,541
You can help,
but don't make personal attacks.

743
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,181
If you can, then you'd do it.

744
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:28,900
So, about men,

745
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,820
whether they are rich or not,

746
00:34:31,141 --> 00:34:33,300
what's most important is to be sincere.

747
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:35,541
Look, you didn't treat him sincerely.

748
00:34:35,661 --> 00:34:37,420
And yet, you expect him

749
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,900
to take responsibility for you?

750
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,101
How is that possible?

751
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,820
Listen.

752
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,860
Run as far as you can.

753
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,380
Stay away from him. He's not worth it.

754
00:34:49,661 --> 00:34:51,380
So there's really no hope for me?

755
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,900
You old woman,

756
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,021
you can be his mom.

757
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,900
Laughing? Just wait.

758
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,460
Impressive, Gu Moli.

759
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,661
You are really something.

760
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:15,860
You really drove her away.

761
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,340
I played your mom.

762
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,900
Now, we are even.

763
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,900
Let me tell you.

764
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,181
Don't come to me
with this kind of crap again.

765
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:23,980
Wait.

766
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,940
What now?

767
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,820
I remember all your help.

768
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:28,621
But let me tell you a little secret.

769
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,860
I only like those who are older than me.

770
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:31,860
I want to pursue you.

771
00:35:32,101 --> 00:35:32,940
Get lost.

772
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,621
(Are you there?)

773
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,221
(A lot has happened recently.)

774
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,021
(I'm quite confused.)

775
00:36:15,021 --> 00:36:16,661
(I really want to talk to someone.)

776
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,061
(Can we meet?)

777
00:36:41,261 --> 00:36:42,420
Come and sit.

778
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,221
I have something to tell you.

779
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:46,340
Just five minutes.

780
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,261
Moli.

781
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,181
I have thought about it carefully.

782
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,141
Remarriage is not that impossible.

783
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,261
As long as Zhu Jincao proves

784
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,061
with practical actions in two years

785
00:37:12,221 --> 00:37:14,340
that he is reliable
that I can entrust my daughter to him.

786
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:15,701
Mr. Gu, you are quite wise.

787
00:37:16,021 --> 00:37:16,780
However,

788
00:37:17,661 --> 00:37:18,701
judging people,

789
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:20,541
you can't just listen what they say,

790
00:37:21,141 --> 00:37:23,980
but see what they have done.

791
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,541
Zhu Jincao has proven
with practical actions

792
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:28,061
that he is unreliable.

793
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:30,181
So, your mom and I ask you

794
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,581
to make a clean break.

795
00:37:31,701 --> 00:37:34,380
You can't have illusions about him

796
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,460
just because of your past love.

797
00:37:39,581 --> 00:37:40,621
Moli.

798
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:43,340
Did you understand what Dad said?

799
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,900
Mom, you've told me before

800
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,300
that in marriage,

801
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,980
there is no absolute
right or wrong, black or white.

802
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,340
Don't be too willful.

803
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,780
Do you remember that?

804
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,741
When did I ever say that?

805
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,940
You did say it.

806
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,500
Dad.

807
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,500
I understood what you said.

808
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,701
I'll go first.

809
00:38:11,701 --> 00:38:12,940
Concise and to the point.

810
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:15,181
I'll go make breakfast.

811
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:31,621
Uncle, Auntie.

812
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,340
I'm here to see you too.

813
00:38:34,264 --> 00:38:36,120
(Shen Jinde)

814
00:38:37,021 --> 00:38:38,940
Sorry, I've arrived late today.

815
00:38:39,021 --> 00:38:40,701
There's been a lot going on lately.

816
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,101
I almost forgot something

817
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:43,460
this important.

818
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,661
I am so ruthless.

819
00:38:46,261 --> 00:38:48,661
I turn to you to vent when I'm upset.

820
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,061
Once I'm fine,
I'll go home and be happy.

821
00:38:51,141 --> 00:38:53,380
You're almost like a trash can
for my bad emotions.

822
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,900
Yet I care less and less about you.

823
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:57,541
How come I don't know

824
00:38:57,541 --> 00:38:58,500
you have many besties?

825
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,221
Only you.

826
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,661
So, who else would you go to
when you are upset?

827
00:39:05,061 --> 00:39:05,980
Remember.

828
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,061
Whenever you need me,

829
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:08,021
just let me know.

830
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:10,860
I'll always be there for you.

831
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,021
(I have an appointment
to meet Insomniac Gale.)

832
00:39:21,021 --> 00:39:21,820
(Would you come along?)

833
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,661
What's wrong?

834
00:39:24,741 --> 00:39:25,661
Zhu Jincao?

835
00:39:33,141 --> 00:39:33,940
Are you going?

836
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:35,701
I'll think it over.

837
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:40,741
Dear, have you ever thought

838
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,980
that Zhu Jincao's affair

839
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:44,980
is only his responsibility?

840
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,380
If I don't tell you this,

841
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,141
then nobody will.

842
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,500
Do you still think

843
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,340
it was a wise decision

844
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,860
to divorce for freedom?

845
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:57,500
After the divorce,

846
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,261
from a legal perspective,

847
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:00,780
Zhu Jincao is single.

848
00:40:01,141 --> 00:40:02,900
It's normal for someone to pursue him.

849
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,780
Zhu Jincao doesn't know

850
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,380
Gao Xiajing likes him.

851
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,261
But you know.

852
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:09,541
Yet you don't remind him,

853
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:12,221
still secretly waiting
to see his reaction,

854
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:14,980
even hoping to test him.

855
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:16,581
Am I wrong?

856
00:40:16,621 --> 00:40:17,741
Of course.

857
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:21,940
What a couple needs
is not to test each other,

858
00:40:22,261 --> 00:40:25,141
but to help and support each other.

859
00:40:26,101 --> 00:40:27,661
But he tracked me,

860
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:29,980
chatted with net friends,
and even wanted to meet them.

861
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,541
Is this all my fault?

862
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:33,101
You're so foolish.

863
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,780
Brothers should defend
against the outside enemy.

864
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,581
It's the same with couples.

865
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,820
Simply put,

866
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,780
whatever's going on between you two,

867
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,860
facing external temptations
and provocations,

868
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,940
you should kick off the mistress.

869
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,541
What's the matter?
You wanted to meet me?

870
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,500
I want to go with you to meet that

871
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,820
Insomniac Gale.

872
00:41:32,101 --> 00:41:33,581
(Are you there yet?)

873
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:39,181
(Yes, at table 7 by the window.)

874
00:42:06,261 --> 00:42:07,701
Hello, welcome.

875
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:17,420
Here.

876

(Where are you?)

877
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,701
(I'm sitting at table 7.)

878
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:48,261
(I'm wearing an army green shirt.)

879
00:42:56,261 --> 00:42:57,741
