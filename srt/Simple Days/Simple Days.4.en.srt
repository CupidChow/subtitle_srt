In marriage,
both the husband and the wife

will face difficult times.

21
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:01,568
You must learn to hit the pause button.

Take a breather, and it'll pass.

Although avoidance
is shameful, it works.

00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:12,995
It brings happiness.

As long as you broaden your perspective,
life will go smoothly.

Easier said than done.

00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:49,632
OK. I think it's very good.

00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,115
You don't have to force yourself.

31
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:57,280
No forcing.
I think the repair is very good.

32
00:02:57,888 --> 00:02:59,872
Send the painting
to my company tomorrow.

33
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:03,232
Mr. Tang, do you really think it's good?

34
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,354
I hope you will tell me the truth.

35
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:06,688
Otherwise, I will feel uneasy.

36
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:15,712
Ms. Gu, your charm is great.

37
00:03:16,474 --> 00:03:18,474
Someone wants to help you
without telling you.

38
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:21,856
If you really care,
you should not let that person down.

39
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:24,794
Good men like that
are now few and far between.

40
00:03:26,555 --> 00:03:27,648
Is it Jiang Haitao?

41
00:03:30,754 --> 00:03:33,344
Mr. Tang, I'm sorry
but I can't sell you this painting.

42
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:35,136
I'll give you back the money.

43
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:41,760
Just give the money back to him.

44
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:46,555
I take my leave.

00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:49,824
(Jiang Haitao)

46
00:03:50,474 --> 00:03:52,288
Jiang Haitao, I am Gu Moli.

47
00:03:52,954 --> 00:03:54,688
Where are you now? I want to see you.

48
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:00,288
Jiang Haitao?

49
00:04:41,635 --> 00:04:43,136
Choose what you like to eat. You order.

50
00:04:43,136 --> 00:04:45,314
There's no need for us
to have a meal and catch up.

51
00:04:45,314 --> 00:04:47,680
Give me your card number.
I'll transfer the money to you.

52
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,832
Moli, I know you still hate me.

53
00:04:57,354 --> 00:05:00,384
In the past, I was too young
to truly appreciate what I had.

54
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:02,755
And I especially wanted
to stand out from the rest.

55
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:05,440
I made choices
for quick success and hurt you.

56
00:05:08,554 --> 00:05:09,952
Today, I sincerely apologize to you.

57
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:13,632
The past is in the past.
Give me your card number.

59
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:46,835
Tao.

60
00:05:46,835 --> 00:05:48,515
- What are you doing?
- Who are you?

61
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:52,096
You're cozying up to
a rich girl while being with Moli.

62
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,808
If you don't apologize to her today,
forget about having this wedding.

63
00:05:57,474 --> 00:05:59,755
Moli, I am sorry.

64
00:07:17,474 --> 00:07:19,680
We ran into each other
at the gallery that day.

65
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:23,075
I saw you working there with your child,

66
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:25,568
stressing out about a painting
worth tens of thousands.

67
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:31,008
Later, I also heard
that you took your child

68
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:33,984
and went to the artist
and the client to apologize.

69
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:39,040
To be honest,
I was very upset when I heard it.

70
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:46,368
It seems Zhu Jincao has not been able
to provide you with a decent life.

71
00:07:47,195 --> 00:07:49,275
What right do you have
to inquire about my private life

72
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:51,674
and blame Zhu Jincao?

73
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:54,592
No, I didn't mean that.
I had no ill intention.

74
00:07:55,114 --> 00:07:58,592
I just saw you were
in a difficult position.

75
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:02,752
As an old friend,
I'd like to help you out.

76
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:06,400
I appreciate your sentiment.
Give me your card number.

77
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:11,360
May I have your WeChat ID?
You can transfer it to me that way.

78
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:13,312
If you don't give me your card number,

79
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:16,354
I will return the money to Mr. Tang.

80
00:08:18,354 --> 00:08:19,434
I'm sorry.

81
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:23,395
(Honey)
(What are you doing?)

82
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:37,440
(Honey)
(In a meeting. I'll contact you later.)

83
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,834
Hello, Li, can I ask you a question?

84
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:12,395
The lady who comes to book a room
with me every Friday.

85
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:13,074
Do you remember her?

86
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:13,674
Yes, I do.

87
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:16,794
Did she just have
a meal here with a man?

88
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:18,112
Yes, they just left.

89
00:09:18,995 --> 00:09:21,275
Right, the waiter called me to say

90
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:23,275
that the lady left
something in the room.

91
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:25,115
Do you need to take it back to her?

92
00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:27,776
Room? Which room?

93
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,424
The one you used
to stay in often, room 1010.

94
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,040
You can contact me whenever you need me.

95
00:09:43,648 --> 00:09:44,314
Okay.

96
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:45,074
- Take care.
- Bye.

97
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:45,696
Bye.

98
00:09:48,515 --> 00:09:49,434
You're here, Mr. Zhu.

99
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:50,355
Mi Na.

100
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:51,072
You came to see Moli?

101
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:53,952
Hasn't she come home yet?
She left work early.

102
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:56,554
She came to work at the gallery today?

103
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:02,400
Of course. Today she was on cloud nine.

104
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:03,995
What happened?

105
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:10,432
Do you know your daughter damaged
an expensive painting in the gallery?

106
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:11,914
Yes.

107
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:15,155
It was botched badly.

108
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:17,856
A weird white dove
in a painting representing desire.

109
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:21,248
It's neither realistic
nor impressionistic.

110
00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:24,320
And yet, Gu Moli managed to sell it.

111
00:10:26,434 --> 00:10:27,552
Let me tell you.

112
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:32,032
It was an old acquaintance of hers
who stepped in to help.

113
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:38,355
Moli is truly charming. I'm envious.

114
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:41,194
Wait. Who's the one you mentioned?

115
00:10:41,194 --> 00:10:46,048
Jiang Haitao. Don't say
you don't know him.

116
00:10:58,395 --> 00:11:00,674
I already got out of the bus,
and you asked me to buy red wine.

117
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:03,235
The wine is bought.
Have the crayfish arrived?

118
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:06,355
Tonight, there's no father-in-law,
no mother-in-law, no kids.

119
00:11:06,355 --> 00:11:08,928
Let's have our girls' night.

120
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:14,794
Honey.

121
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:16,995
Where did you go?

122
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:24,155
Holding red wine
downstairs at Liu's place.

123
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:26,594
You said you were
going on a business trip.

124
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:32,194
Sorry, honey, I just wanted to avoid
the conflict and hide away for a bit.

125
00:11:32,194 --> 00:11:33,632
Wasn't it to see Jiang Haitao?

126
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:06,784
Honey, don't be angry.
I shouldn't have lied to you.

127
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:09,035
I wasn't intentionally
hiding it from you.

128
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:11,875
Oh, we're home.

129
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:14,944
You just didn't want
to confront my dad directly,

130
00:12:15,475 --> 00:12:17,194
so you lied to me to go hide away.

131
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,834
Yes, and so coincidentally,
Jiang Haitao invited you out.

132
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:21,635
Yes.

133
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:23,834
So you went to the hotel.

134
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:25,554
The one we often go to.

135
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:27,914
It was chosen by Jiang Haitao.

136
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,475
I went there just
to make things clear with him.

137
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:32,875
If you told me, would I stop you
from going to Liu's place?

138
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,515
Why do you have to make
simple things so complicated?

139
00:12:35,515 --> 00:12:38,074
Yes, it was wrong of me
to fake a business trip.

140
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:40,594
I just wanted to simplify things.

141
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,314
My emotions had escalated to that point.

142
00:12:42,314 --> 00:12:43,904
One more second
and I would have lost it.

143
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,194
Is this home that unbearable for you?

144
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:55,074
Yes, I tried my best,
but I really can't stand it anymore.

145
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,875
I don't want to sleep
in bunk beds anymore.

146
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,794
I also don't want to be bossed around.

147
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:01,275
Do you see this place as my home?

148
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:02,944
It's just your family's home.

149
00:13:03,674 --> 00:13:05,184
I really hate this place.

150
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:07,275
You hate this place,

151
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:10,400
my family and also me, right?

152
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:14,976
I'm sorry. I wasn't good.
I made you suffer.

153
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,995
So you had to see
Jiang Haitao behind my back.

154
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:20,834
I heard he played the hero today,

155
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,434
and he bought a painting for you, right?

156
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:23,434
How did you know?

157
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:24,594
I just know.

158
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:26,834
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

159
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,355
I wasn't planning on
accepting Jiang Haitao's help.

160
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:30,208
You weren't?

161
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:33,395
What I heard
was that your old lover was generous.

162
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,360
He helped you out of trouble,
and then took you to the hotel.

163
00:13:36,074 --> 00:13:37,120
I want to think positively.

164
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,256
But if you put yourself in my shoes,
what would you think?

165
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:44,275
Look at this.

166
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:47,296
You secretly filmed me?

167
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:49,155
I'll say it again.

168
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:51,995
I went there today just
to repay him for the painting.

169
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:53,674
Was it necessary to book a room then?

170
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,395
I personally confirmed it
at the front desk.

171
00:13:56,395 --> 00:13:57,856
Don't tell me it didn't happen.

172
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:01,216
You investigated me?

173
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:06,304
What's the point if there is
such distrust between us?

174
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,275
I also think it's pointless.

175
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:11,872
Jincao, you two?

Aren't you going to discipline her?

Why? What right does he have to do it?

181
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,875
I heard it all at the door.

182
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,275
Why did you lie about
going on a business trip?

183
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:40,755
Yes, I did.

184
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,008
Because this home
is too suffocating. I can't stay.

I haven't finished talking.

- Zhu Jincao.

00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:46,720
Don't go.

188
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,314

of stopping her?

of the divorce agreement, right?

No.

Don't we still have
a one-month cooling-off period?

330
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:18,955
That's why we need to stay calm
and keep our distance.

340
00:27:13,475 --> 00:27:15,104
Seems like it.
A lot of people come to see her.

341
00:27:16,955 --> 00:27:18,624
Was she at the gallery
yesterday at noon?

342
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:21,600
Yes, she was receiving
two clients yesterday at noon.

343
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:23,394
Are you sure?

344
00:27:23,394 --> 00:27:24,794
Yes, I remember it very clearly.

cannot be accessed at will.

00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:41,984
(1 message)

351
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:43,794
No need. Thank you.

352
00:27:43,794 --> 00:27:45,354
You're welcome. Take care.

353
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:50,394
(Honey)
(She has an alibi.)

354
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,088
(That doesn't rule out suspicion).

355
00:27:57,915 --> 00:28:00,064
(Perhaps someone else
took the photo for her).

356
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:02,112
(Look at these people).

357
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:24,640
(Wish everyone a happy dream.
Good night.)

358
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,184
(A day with my bestie)

359
00:28:25,184 --> 00:28:25,600
(Happy holiday.)

360
00:28:53,235 --> 00:28:55,776
(Honey)
(She knows the receptionist.)

361
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:57,834
(Honey)
(I'm going to her now.)

362
00:29:19,554 --> 00:29:23,834
(Don't act rashly. A photo
on Moments doesn't prove much.)

363
00:29:24,354 --> 00:29:25,248
(Not enough evidence.)

364
00:29:26,035 --> 00:29:28,394
(What can you do
if she absolutely refuses to admit it?)

365
00:29:29,114 --> 00:29:30,112
(The problem now is)

366
00:29:30,848 --> 00:29:33,408
(how she knew about
the hotel we frequented.)

367
00:29:36,995 --> 00:29:40,192
Take a look at
this thick stack of hotel invoices.

368
00:29:40,794 --> 00:29:42,235
Would you like to explain this?

369
00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:46,794
This is my privacy.
How could you rummage through my things?

370
00:29:46,794 --> 00:29:48,634
(Huarui Hotel)
Who did you go to a hotel room with?

371
00:29:48,634 --> 00:29:49,995
How could you say that?

372
00:29:49,995 --> 00:29:52,554
You are my son's wife
and my granddaughter's mother.

373
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:54,435
You went to a hotel
with someone behind my son's back.

374
00:30:01,755 --> 00:30:03,354
(She found out through the invoices.)

375
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:05,920
(Last time your mom
came to the gallery,)

376
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:08,554
(Mi Na saw one of them.)

377
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:31,968
It was you, wasn't it?

378
00:30:33,995 --> 00:30:34,915
What did I do?

379
00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:36,035
The anonymous text message.

380
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:37,154
What text message?

381
00:30:37,154 --> 00:30:40,384
Huarui Hotel front desk, Lisa.

382
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:44,256
Do I need to spell it out further?

383
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:46,995
Why did you secretly photograph me?

384
00:30:48,114 --> 00:30:50,314
Why did you send
an anonymous text to my husband,

385
00:30:50,944 --> 00:30:52,515
slander me and spread rumors about me?

386
00:30:55,195 --> 00:30:57,504
Get your facts straight.
Don't frame me, okay?

387
00:30:58,154 --> 00:31:00,832
Did I spread rumors about you?
There's a photo as evidence.

388
00:31:01,515 --> 00:31:03,456
So, you're admitting
that you secretly photographed me?

389
00:31:06,435 --> 00:31:09,275
Yes, I just don't like you.

390
00:31:09,275 --> 00:31:10,592
I did it, so what?

391
00:31:11,794 --> 00:31:14,195
I'm younger and I work harder than you.

392
00:31:14,195 --> 00:31:15,995
For my job, I work overtime every day

393
00:31:15,995 --> 00:31:17,248
and I don't even date.

394
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,955
Why do you get to have
an apartment and a family?

395
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:23,074
And you have got a wealthy client. Why?

396
00:31:23,074 --> 00:31:24,114
I guess I'm just lucky.

397
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:27,840
I dine with clients openly and honestly,

398
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,104
and it's reasonable and legal
for me to get a room with my husband.

399
00:31:31,794 --> 00:31:36,864
But you spied on my privacy,
slandered me and backstabbed.

400
00:31:38,475 --> 00:31:41,760
Mi Na, I'm warning you.
You'd better toe the line from now on.

401
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:44,416
Don't use these dirty tricks
on me again.

402
00:31:45,634 --> 00:31:47,584
Otherwise, I'll settle
all old and new scores with you.

403
00:31:57,955 --> 00:32:01,024
You didn't see the look on Mi Na's face.
Serves her right.

404
00:32:01,874 --> 00:32:03,675
I was really cool just now.

405
00:32:04,314 --> 00:32:06,080
Honey, come back home tonight.

406
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:10,592
I don't want to go home.
Let's go to a hotel instead.

407
00:32:11,314 --> 00:32:14,314
I-I-I now have a stress reaction
whenever I hear it.

408
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:15,995
Really, I feel uncomfortable all over.

409
00:32:15,995 --> 00:32:17,755
I'm even having
difficulty breathing now.

410
00:32:18,955 --> 00:32:22,554
Oh, right, we are divorced.
I can't go home.

411
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:24,672
Don't talk nonsense.
It hasn't been approved.

412
00:32:25,515 --> 00:32:27,114
The government worker told us

413
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:29,280
after the one-month cooling-off period,
they'd proceed with it.

414
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:30,912
We'll cancel it in a month.

415
00:32:32,235 --> 00:32:35,475
Besides,
you're not even afraid of Mi Na.

416
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:38,304
No matter what, my parents are family
and they won't harm you.

417
00:32:39,354 --> 00:32:41,600
Sometimes, it's harder to deal with
family than with strangers.

418
00:32:47,035 --> 00:32:50,752
Don't be afraid.
I started the trouble. Let me handle it.

419
00:32:52,594 --> 00:32:53,792
After all, that is your home.

420
00:32:54,755 --> 00:32:56,160
Go back there with your head held high.

421
00:32:56,794 --> 00:32:57,792
Reclaim what you've lost.

422
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:03,456
Right, reclaim my lost right.

423
00:33:20,235 --> 00:33:26,272
Dad, we had a misunderstanding earlier.
We shouldn't have argued.

424
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,000
That's in the past now.

425
00:33:31,394 --> 00:33:34,496
The argument was so bad
that you were about to divorce.

426
00:33:36,675 --> 00:33:39,074
She was out for a whole day and night.

427
00:33:41,314 --> 00:33:42,880
And now, you let it go so easily?

428
00:33:44,874 --> 00:33:48,000
Ke's Grandpa, I have
my personal freedom, right?

429
00:33:49,074 --> 00:33:52,416
No matter who's at fault,
it's a matter between us.

430
00:33:53,475 --> 00:33:55,154
Right, we've already been over this.

431
00:33:55,154 --> 00:33:58,496
Don't speak yet.
I haven't been over that.

432
00:33:59,634 --> 00:34:03,616
Gu Moli, do you know
where you went wrong?

433
00:34:05,915 --> 00:34:11,035
As a wife, you should not put yourself
in a compromising situation.

434
00:34:14,395 --> 00:34:18,754
You live at our apartment,
with us taking care of your child,

435
00:34:18,754 --> 00:34:23,554
but you harbor dissatisfaction with us,
which is disrespectful.

436
00:34:27,395 --> 00:34:28,594
What are you laughing at?

437
00:34:30,515 --> 00:34:33,475
I haven't finished speaking,
and you interrupt me.

438
00:34:33,475 --> 00:34:34,784
What's with the attitude?

439
00:34:35,395 --> 00:34:37,440
No, Dad, please don't say any more.

440
00:34:38,154 --> 00:34:39,714
What century is this?

441
00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:42,432
Moli doesn't need to tell me
who she's meeting or dining with.

442
00:34:43,355 --> 00:34:45,274
Spouses should trust each other.

443
00:34:45,274 --> 00:34:47,264
I was suspicious of her this time.
It's my fault.

444
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:52,896
Yes, I'm still living
in the apartment you two bought me.

445
00:34:53,995 --> 00:34:57,152
Mom has to take care of Ke every day.
I am very grateful to you.

446
00:34:57,915 --> 00:35:00,768
I'm useless,
not able to get you a bigger place.

447
00:35:01,355 --> 00:35:04,274
And now our family of five
has to be cramped in this small one.

448
00:35:04,274 --> 00:35:07,328
It's also my fault
that things have turned out this way.

449
00:35:07,328 --> 00:35:12,288
Zhu Jincao, are you still a man?

450
00:35:13,915 --> 00:35:15,875
I'm embarrassed for you.

451
00:35:16,475 --> 00:35:19,114
You spoil her too much.
Now she's disrespectful and arrogant!

452
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:21,856
What are you doing?
She's my wife. Shouldn't I do that?

453
00:35:22,435 --> 00:35:24,736
Now you're talking back
to me for your wife?

454
00:35:25,594 --> 00:35:26,915
I'm going to teach you a lesson today.

455
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:28,554
See if I'm still your father!

456
00:35:29,114 --> 00:35:30,754
I'm your father.

457
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:34,754
Stop it! Can't we deal with
it in a calmer way?

458
00:35:34,754 --> 00:35:36,035
I'm telling you, move aside.

459
00:35:36,035 --> 00:35:38,752
If you don't,
I'll beat you up too. Move!

460
00:35:38,752 --> 00:35:39,795
Mom.

461
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:43,936
Grandpa, what are you doing?

462
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:55,872
I-I-I am playing with t-t-this...

463
00:35:55,872 --> 00:35:56,795
Magic wand.

464
00:35:56,795 --> 00:35:57,754
Magic wand.

465
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,224
Do you know how to play with it?

466
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:14,754
No.

467
00:36:14,754 --> 00:36:17,088
Let me teach you. Give me.

468
00:36:30,594 --> 00:36:32,355
Is it fun, Grandpa?

469
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:33,995
Yes.

470
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:34,592
Mom, how are you?

471
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:37,728
I'm fine. Take Moli and go now.

472
00:36:38,435 --> 00:36:40,074
Be good. Hurry up!

473
00:36:41,194 --> 00:36:43,395
Let's leave.

474
00:37:06,194 --> 00:37:07,072
Thank you, honey.

475
00:37:07,754 --> 00:37:08,416
For what?

476
00:37:09,114 --> 00:37:11,008
Today you stood up to your dad for me.

477
00:37:13,194 --> 00:37:14,112
I want to thank you.

478
00:37:15,035 --> 00:37:16,064
Who knew you were so brave?

479
00:37:16,674 --> 00:37:18,848
When my dad was going to hit me,
you still stood in front.

480
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,424
(Father's Day)
We should thank your mom.

481
00:37:24,234 --> 00:37:27,392
If she hadn't rushed out, I don't know
what it would be like today.

482
00:37:28,154 --> 00:37:30,208
Your dad is fierce,
but he still loves his granddaughter.

483
00:37:34,048 --> 00:37:36,224
Actually, I feel quite bad inside.

484
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:41,952
My dad cares a lot about his pride,
especially in front of you.

485
00:37:43,114 --> 00:37:45,248
Up until now, I still don't know

486
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:47,475
how to get along with him.

487
00:37:54,714 --> 00:37:56,288
You just need to know
how to get along with me.

488
00:38:15,234 --> 00:38:18,720
Lingxiao, you just eat this for lunch?

489
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:22,496
This veggie burger
doesn't whet the appetite at all.

490
00:38:25,674 --> 00:38:28,320
This dry bread is so crumbly.

491
00:38:29,234 --> 00:38:30,784
Swallowing this might scratch my throat.

492
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,688
T-T-This won't fill me up.

493
00:38:35,475 --> 00:38:36,832
I have to lecture this afternoon.

494
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:38,944
Don't be picky
when you're eating for free.

495
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41,536
You shouldn't eat too much at noon.

496
00:38:42,594 --> 00:38:46,355
Light meal with quality carbs, slow rise
in blood sugar and no drowsiness.

497
00:38:46,355 --> 00:38:48,192
You'll have more energy
for your work in the afternoon.

498
00:38:48,714 --> 00:38:51,035
If I'm not full,
I'll have no energy to work.

499
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:53,760
Jincao also doesn't like to eat.
He looks worn.

500
00:38:54,955 --> 00:38:58,976
Jincao, this tuna sandwich
is the specialty. Try it.

501
00:39:01,194 --> 00:39:02,304
Look at this sandwich.

502
00:39:03,754 --> 00:39:06,154
This slice of bread
represents my parents.

503
00:39:07,234 --> 00:39:10,080
And this bottom slice is Moli's parents.

504
00:39:11,274 --> 00:39:14,848
I'm just the tuna
in the middle that's gone bad.

505
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:18,720
That's vivid.

506
00:39:21,074 --> 00:39:22,048
Lately, I've been clueless.

507
00:39:22,754 --> 00:39:25,600
I'm caught in the middle now.
It's a mess.

508
00:39:27,154 --> 00:39:29,395
Are you going to divorce your wife?

509
00:39:29,395 --> 00:39:30,560
Who told you that?

510
00:39:31,194 --> 00:39:33,568
No divorce.
May your marriage last forever.

511
00:39:34,795 --> 00:39:37,664
If you really offend someone,
placate them.

512
00:39:38,915 --> 00:39:40,384
Isn't Mother's Day coming up soon?

513
00:39:40,955 --> 00:39:43,936
Get both your parents
together for a meal.

514
00:39:45,795 --> 00:39:48,274
Our moms quarrel
every time they see each other.

515
00:39:48,274 --> 00:39:49,714
Better to avoid extra trouble.

516
00:39:50,995 --> 00:39:52,955
See, your idea isn't right.

517
00:39:53,915 --> 00:39:55,424
Connection requires communication.

518
00:39:55,955 --> 00:39:58,714
The more you talk, the closer you are.
Escaping only brings coldness.

519
00:39:58,714 --> 00:39:59,714
Right.

520
00:39:59,714 --> 00:40:01,344
Everyone gathers for a meal.

521
00:40:02,074 --> 00:40:03,936
If everyone's close,
won't the problem be solved?

522
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:07,035
That's true. We can't always avoid it.

523
00:40:07,754 --> 00:40:11,104
It is settled. As long as we
stick together, we can solve anything.

524
00:40:11,795 --> 00:40:12,768
Let's take a picture.

525
00:40:13,634 --> 00:40:15,168
I still need one more photo
for the Moments.

526
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,456
Lingxiao, move over a bit.
My face looks huge. Hurry!

527
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:22,435
Pretty good.

528
00:40:24,395 --> 00:40:26,080
Then let's order a steak to celebrate.

529
00:40:28,435 --> 00:40:29,274
Jincao.

530
00:40:30,114 --> 00:40:31,194
Waitress.

531
00:40:32,435 --> 00:40:34,035
Sir, may I help you?

532
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:35,234
What kind of steaks do you have?

533
00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:37,234
We have filet mignon,
sirloin and tomahawk.

534
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,274
Tomahawk. I think

535
00:40:39,274 --> 00:40:41,594
only it can quell the resentment
brought on by this salad.

536
00:40:41,594 --> 00:40:42,114
Alright.

537
00:40:42,114 --> 00:40:44,704
Wait a moment. Which is cheaper,
the filet mignon or the sirloin?

538
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,915
Sirloin.

539
00:40:45,915 --> 00:40:46,915
Then we'll have the sirloin.

540
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:48,035
Okay.

541
00:40:48,035 --> 00:40:49,355
Filet mignon would be okay too.

542
00:40:53,674 --> 00:40:55,168
Give that shrimp to me
if you don't want it.

543
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,652
(I've heard Jincao will
celebrate Mother's Day)

544
00:41:00,652 --> 00:41:02,080
(with his mom and mother-in-law,
and so does Qianniu.)

545
00:41:02,355 --> 00:41:06,795
Huang Qianniu, you told my aunt
that Jincao was going to invite

546
00:41:06,795 --> 00:41:08,995
his parents and parents-in-law
to celebrate Mother's Day?

547
00:41:08,995 --> 00:41:10,144
I mentioned it to my mom.

548
00:41:10,754 --> 00:41:11,616
So fast?

549
00:41:14,395 --> 00:41:17,632
Your mom told mine right away.
This is how she conveyed it.

550
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:20,224
Jincao invites his mom and mother-in-law
to celebrate Mother's Day,

551
00:41:21,114 --> 00:41:23,554
and you're also bringing my aunt
to Shanghai for Mother's Day.

552
00:41:23,554 --> 00:41:24,512
Now it's all up to me.

553
00:41:24,512 --> 00:41:27,194
I didn't invite my mom
to Shanghai for Mother's Day.

554
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:29,594
My tiny place only has a foldable bed.
Where will she stay if she comes?

555
00:41:29,594 --> 00:41:32,754
Enough. No need to explain.
You really know how to cause trouble.

556
00:41:33,475 --> 00:41:35,232
Waiter, cancel the sirloin
I ordered just now.

557
00:41:37,634 --> 00:41:42,368
Hurry up and cancel the gathering.
Don't ask for trouble.

558
00:41:42,995 --> 00:41:45,594
The two moms and Zhu Jincao's dad.

559
00:41:45,594 --> 00:41:48,448
Which one of them is easy to deal with?
Don't you have any clue?

560
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:52,672
You think I want to?
But Zhu Jincao is so enthusiastic.

561
00:41:53,395 --> 00:41:55,872
He booked the restaurant
and notified both families.

562
00:41:56,395 --> 00:41:58,315
I don't want to spoil the mood.

563
00:41:59,234 --> 00:42:02,554
Besides, Ke's Grandma
helped me out a while ago.

564
00:42:02,554 --> 00:42:03,872
I still want to thank her.

565
00:42:04,395 --> 00:42:07,315
I just don't know what would be
an appropriate gift for her.

566
00:42:07,315 --> 00:42:09,984
That's easy.
Give her whatever you give your mom.

567
00:42:10,674 --> 00:42:13,120
Treat them equally
so that neither will feel bad.

568
00:42:13,915 --> 00:42:17,344
I've already bought
a 15,000 yuan big-name bag for my mom.

569
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:18,784
15,000?

570
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:22,634
Giving the same to your mother-in-law
would be too extravagant.

571
00:42:22,634 --> 00:42:24,355
It's not that I am unwilling to spend.

572
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:27,616
But after buying that for my mom,
I have no much money left.

573
00:42:28,515 --> 00:42:29,674
Then I'll lend you some.

574
00:42:29,674 --> 00:42:32,320
Don't play the hero.
I can't bear to exploit you.

575
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:35,355
Ask Zhu Jincao for it.

576
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:36,448
But his is not mine.

577
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:39,680
This won't do. That won't do.
What exactly do you want to do?

578
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,504
It's not just about the money.

579
00:42:42,234 --> 00:42:45,088
Even if I give my mother-in-law a bag,
she might not even like it.

580
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:48,835
I don't want to be blamed for
being a spender.

581
00:42:48,835 --> 00:42:49,984
Then I would be wrongly accused.

582
00:42:50,554 --> 00:42:52,234
Then there's only one solution left.

583
00:42:53,194 --> 00:42:53,915
Say it.

584
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,035
Say it louder.

585
00:42:58,035 --> 00:42:58,594
No.

586
00:43:05,114 --> 00:43:06,114
