Where is your editor-in-chief?

22
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,331
He's out for business.

23
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:14,651
Who are you?

24
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:17,452
I'm their IT engineer. I fix their PCs.

25
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:21,132
When will they come back?

26
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:22,692
No idea.

27
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:24,572
The editors don't have
regular office hours.

28
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:27,832
Try contacting him
via the official account.

29
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:02,412
You fixed it already?

30
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:05,572
I need to check on something else.

31
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:13,532
That was fast.
You're the editor, aren't you?

32
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:16,292
No, you've got it wrong.
I'm an IT engineer.

33
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:18,211
Yeah, go on pretending.

34
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:24,692
You seem quite skilled at this.

35
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:27,452
I'm not the first one
who has come knocking, huh?

36
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:33,532
Tell me, did you write that article
"Young Woman Lures Married Painter"?

37
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:37,852
Do you know what you've
put those innocent people through?

38
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:43,051
What do you mean? I don't get it.
I didn't mention any names.

39
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:44,572
You think the readers are fools?

40
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:47,412
You were referring to
Yan Li and his agent.

41
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:50,812
That's what you said.
We didn't say anything like that.

42
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:53,371
We were just exposing
the ugly truth about society.

43
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:57,771
What?

44
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:58,292
Wait.

45
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,732
Ugly truth? How dare you?

46
00:04:00,732 --> 00:04:02,211
Calm down.

47
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:03,736
Prove that I wrote it

48
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:05,532
and that it was about them first, okay?

49
00:04:05,532 --> 00:04:06,771
We need evidence.

50
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:10,611
How can you blame everything on me?
Aren't there any laws?

51
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:14,331
Leave me alone or I'll call the police.

52
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:37,252
Moli.

53
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:39,692
Why did you come?

54
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,971
I just happened to
pass by here after work.

55
00:04:43,572 --> 00:04:44,411
Can I help you?

56
00:04:49,132 --> 00:04:52,291
I saw that article insinuating that
you're having an affair

57
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,731
with Yan Li on the Jungle of Art.

58
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:56,651
Do you need my help?

59
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:04,932
Don't get me wrong.
Yan Li is a good friend of mine.

60
00:05:04,932 --> 00:05:08,760
I will help him
even if you're not involved.

61
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:14,136
No, thank you. Yan Li is
a signed artist of our gallery.

62
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:17,560
Our legal department will handle it.

63
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,856
To be honest,
that's exactly why I'm here.

64
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:27,531
Let me give you a heads-up.

65
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:29,432
My experience tells me

66
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:32,568
that your legal department
is unlikely to take legal action

67
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,088
due to concerns over the implications.

68
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,252
But I will.

69
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:43,452
Thanks for the reminder.
As Yan Li's agent,

70
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:45,572
I may encounter
similar issues frequently.

71
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:48,291
I must learn to deal with them.

72
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:26,531
Moli, look. I got your new clothes.

73
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:28,971
Pretty, huh? Do you like them?

74
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:30,731
Not bad.

75
00:06:32,932 --> 00:06:35,851
Is there something
troubling you at work?

76
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:46,040
Listen, do you still remember
Mr. Zhang from Ningbo?

77
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:49,891
His son is also in Shanghai.

78
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:52,172
He called your dad this morning.

79
00:06:52,172 --> 00:06:54,851
And he's coming for dinner tonight.

80
00:06:54,851 --> 00:06:58,132
Hurry up and take a shower.
Put on a face mask.

81
00:06:58,132 --> 00:07:00,091
And change into the new clothes.

82
00:07:01,531 --> 00:07:03,971
Mom, it's been a long day.

83
00:07:03,971 --> 00:07:05,656
Do I have to dress up even after work?

84
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:19,704
Mr. Zhang's son is still single, huh?

85
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:25,651
What a coincidence. He's never married.
He has a PhD degree in medicine.

86
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:27,992
Mom, please don't
set up dates for me, okay?

87
00:07:28,651 --> 00:07:31,891
That matchmaking site
keeps sending me ads every day.

88
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:35,492
It's so annoying.
Did I say I want to get remarried?

89
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:37,291
I know you don't for now.

90
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,172
But it may be too late
when you change your mind.

91
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:43,960
Are you really going to
waste your prime years just like that?

92
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,252
I'm so worried about you.

93
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:48,531
You wanted to intervene
when I got married.

94
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:50,264
And it's the same when I'm divorced.

95
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:55,132
And why did you post that
in the WeChat Moments

96
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:56,600
and tag Ke's Grandma?

97
00:07:57,372 --> 00:08:00,536
Mom, can you stop causing me trouble?

98
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:06,296
I'm causing you trouble?
Ungrateful child!

99
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:11,012
You think you can make it this far
without my support?

100
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:14,052
Why am I doing this? I'm trying to help.

101
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:16,172
Fine! I am an idiot.

102
00:08:16,172 --> 00:08:17,932
I'm unable to do anything on my own.

103
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:19,091
You did everything for me.

104
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:21,812
Please, stop meddling
in my affairs, okay?

105
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:24,504
Moli, how can you
talk to your mom like that?

106
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:29,091
Well, I just did. I'm a grown woman.

107
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,736
I'm free to marry,
divorce, or date anyone.

108
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:34,812
Listen to yourself.

109
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:39,131
Where are you going?

110
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:40,172
Liu's place.

111
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:51,692
Don't be mad. She's just upset
because of the divorce.

112
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:52,824
Well, I'm also upset.

Alright, let me do it. Tie this for me.

A divorced man.

121
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:01,011

That's not what I mean.

Are you sure?

that a kid's father was very close

Both families were destroyed.

Grandma, who killed whom?

138
00:10:43,412 --> 00:10:44,892

Why don't you tell Zhu Jincao
about what Gao Xiajing has done?

141
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:07,371
It would be pointless.

142
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:10,872
Besides, Jincao is single now.

Can I handle them all?

146
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:23,371
I can't stay around him

147
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:25,892
and watch him 24 hours a day.

148
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:31,032
Besides, I'm his ex-wife.
I'm not in a position to say anything.

149
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:37,848
So, you want to test him
with this incident?

150
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:40,952
I have faith in our relationship.

151
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,544
You watched the dashcam recording.

But Gao Xiajing
keeps calling me the "ex-wife".

153
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:50,616
It bothers me a lot.

154
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:52,792
She's doing it on purpose.

155
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:58,776
A persistent pursuer
imposes a serious threat.

156
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:01,251
You better be careful.

157
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:03,192
What do you mean?

158
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:05,784

159
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:08,971
what if Zhu Jincao fails the test?

160
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:12,888
Ptui, doomsayer.
Jincao is still fond of me.

161
00:12:13,652 --> 00:12:14,731
He won't change.

162
00:12:14,731 --> 00:12:17,331
Ptui, I hope so.

163
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:22,040
Anyway, call me
if she ever comes knocking.

164
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:24,120
I can't do much.

165
00:12:24,652 --> 00:12:28,532
But I can at least
beat her up for my bestie.

166
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:29,812
Alright, I know you're fierce.

167
00:12:29,812 --> 00:12:31,896
Enough about me. What about you?

168
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:35,704
Who did you meet
after I picked the outfit for you?

169
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:41,464
Nobody, just a very difficult
and picky business partner.

170
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:44,652
I handled it well.

171
00:12:44,652 --> 00:12:46,011
I don't buy it.

172
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:12,412
Mom?

173
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,292
Why did you come back?

174
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,932
Why are you drinking alone?

175
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:22,008
I'm drowning my sorrows with wine.

176
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,371
Are you still mad at me?

177
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:38,851
I dare not. I'm just an old witch.

178
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,264
I cross the line.
I meddle in my daughter's life.

179
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:45,371
It's you who should be mad.

180
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:50,412
Mom, please don't be
so passive-aggressive, okay?

181
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,736
Am I?

182
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:07,211
I'm sorry.

183
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,131
I'll punish myself with a drink.

184
00:14:22,264 --> 00:14:23,576
Mom, let me tell you something.

185
00:14:26,572 --> 00:14:29,331
I had a cat when I was in college.

186
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:33,688
It was one of those virus-infected cats
that'd die within a week.

187
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:37,944
It stopped eating and drinking
and got sick within a few days.

188
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:41,052
My first reaction was to go to Liu.

189
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,944
Liu took the cat
to the pet hospital for treatment.

190
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,360
I was like, "She's so capable.
Thank goodness, I have her."

191
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,491
Of course, Liu is capable.

192
00:14:54,331 --> 00:14:57,016
I'd be relieved
if you could be half as capable.

193
00:14:57,692 --> 00:14:59,256
That cat still died.

194
00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:02,932
I asked Liu what to do.

195
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:06,131
But she lashed out at me.

196
00:15:06,692 --> 00:15:11,172
She said,
"You are an adult. This is your cat."

197
00:15:11,172 --> 00:15:13,112
"You didn't take care of it. It's dead."

198
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:17,611
"Bury it, cremate it, or throw it
in the trash. It's up to you."

199
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:19,224
"To put it bluntly,"

200
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:22,251
"there will be things
much more serious in your life."

201
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:24,371
"Are you going to
rely on others forever?"

202
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:35,544
(I'm a lazy man, and everything's
about being economical.)

203
00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:38,052
(I'm too bored
to invest time and energy)

204
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:39,892
(in those meaningless
people and things.)

205
00:15:39,892 --> 00:15:42,251
(My brother is definitely
top-tier in this regard.)

206
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:45,052
(No savings. No properties.
No marriage. No kids.)

207
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:47,371
(He's going to live
with any strings attached.)

208
00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:48,812
That's his ideology.

209
00:15:49,812 --> 00:15:53,572
Hello everyone.
I'm the keynote speaker Wang Lingxiao.

210
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:58,104
I later found out

211
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,908
that it was the commemoration day
of her mother's death.

212
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:08,331
I bought tools and buried the cat
in the woods of the school.

213
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:10,292
Then I apologized to Liu.

214
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:16,251
Mom, you see, I've always been a willful

215
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:19,052
and irresponsible girl
who only wants to be taken care of.

216
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:25,052
You're lucky because you have me.

217
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:33,464
Mom, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have yelled at you today.

218
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:38,371
I still haven't grown up
after all these years.

219
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:41,371
I rely on you when there's a problem
and complain that

220
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:43,692
you're smothering when I don't need you.

221
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:49,731
I'm not filial, sorry.

222
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:52,851
Don't. Don't be like this.

223
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:56,692
I can't cope with it.
I'm not used to it at all.

224
00:16:57,292 --> 00:17:00,052
We are a family.
Don't speak as if we're strangers.

225
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:06,328
It's more than natural
for your dad and me to love you.

226
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,952
So will you meet
Mr. Zhang's son tomorrow?

227
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:14,771
No.

228
00:17:15,372 --> 00:17:18,211
Willful. Ungrateful.

229
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:21,816
Yulan, Moli has made her point clear.

230
00:17:22,452 --> 00:17:25,771
I think we should respect that.

231
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:30,132
Let go. Just let go.

232
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:35,224
Fine, I'll let go and shut up, okay?

233
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:39,452
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

234
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:44,771
Have the white fungus
and lotus seed soup and rest early.

235
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:48,412
Yulan, come on. Cheers.

236
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:56,132
"Cheers?"
Gu, you're going all Western-style.

237
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:05,211
So the moment
I read the article you wrote,

238
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:07,480
I knew that the Young Woman was Gu Moli.

239
00:18:08,332 --> 00:18:10,971
She is my ex-girlfriend.
I know her very well.

240
00:18:10,971 --> 00:18:15,672
Hold on, handsome. Who's Gu Moli?

241
00:18:16,372 --> 00:18:19,452
I don't know her.
Let's talk about the Young Woman.

242
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:22,932
No real names here, huh?

243
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:23,992
To avoid risks.

244
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:28,984
Chief Editor Fan Fan, why are you
so secretive about the informant?

245
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:31,652
It's between us. Is it necessary?

246
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,776
You have no idea. Safety comes first.

247
00:18:35,372 --> 00:18:37,496
That's why we have to use codenames.

248
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,132
Between you and me,

249
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:43,452
I was referring to Yan Li
and your ex-girlfriend Gu Moli.

250
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:45,496
The readers recognize them at a glance.

251
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:48,792
That's enough.
Otherwise, there's trouble.

252
00:18:50,051 --> 00:18:51,452
I don't know who gave me the tips

253
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:54,808
on the two articles I wrote before.
Neither do I want to verify the tips.

254
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:58,296
What if I look into it
and it turns out to be false?

255
00:18:58,932 --> 00:19:00,771
It's just some anecdotes.

256
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:03,000
The readers love it, so let's write it.

257
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:05,132
Understood.

258
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:11,491
By the way, Chief Editor Fan Fan,
do those informants

259
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:14,200
get a fee for the tips?

260
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:20,932
Yeah, we listed the prices.
But as you can see,

261
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:23,544
our public account makes little income.

262
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:26,491
But this article

263
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:29,240
gained some attention
because Yan Li was quite known.

264
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:33,208
Listen, I'll give you a 10% kickback

265
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:37,172
on the advertising fee,
which is at least five grand.

266
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:39,412
It's more than that.

267
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:43,832
You put three or four
advertising links per article

268
00:19:44,612 --> 00:19:46,692
and make millions with your account.

269
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:48,664
The informants should get
100 to 200 grands.

270
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:52,132
Lawyer Jiang,
did you manage to gather evidence?

271
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:52,892
Absolutely.

272
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:55,692
Oh right, I forgot to introduce myself.

273
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:59,132
I'm Jiang Haitao,
a partner at Zhiheng Law Firm.

274
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,692
Chief Editor Fan Fan, you just admitted

275
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:05,971
that the "Young Woman"

276
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,932
in the article you wrote
was referring to Gu Moli.

277
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:11,971
And YL in the article refers to Yan Li.

278
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:16,491
The article is slander based on
anonymous and unverified tips.

279
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:21,336
Moreover, this article helped you
profit from advertising fees.

280
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:24,172
Do you confirm?

281
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:28,132
Well...

282
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:31,531
Of course, just in case
you forget what you've said,

283
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:34,904
I've recorded our conversation.

284
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:42,692
Let me introduce myself as well.

285
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:45,612
I am Gu Moli's husband.
My name is Zhu Jincao.

286
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,824
Can you tell us who tipped you off now?

287
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,652
You know the consequences. So tell us.

288
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:06,456
Lawyer Jiang, it's a waste of time.
Let's call the police.

289
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:07,971
Okay.

290
00:21:07,971 --> 00:21:08,531
What?

291
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:10,932
Oh right, judging from the traffic

292
00:21:10,932 --> 00:21:13,132
of your public account

293
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:14,892
and the advertising fees
you've collected,

294
00:21:14,892 --> 00:21:17,112
we can claim
at least a million as compensation.

295
00:21:17,731 --> 00:21:20,760
I'm... I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

296
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:23,172
I'm running

297
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:26,132
this public account all by myself.

298
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:28,571
I can't afford
that amount of compensation.

299
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,448
I'm wearing cheap clothes.

300
00:21:32,372 --> 00:21:33,560
I'm using old laptops.

301
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,984
I rent someone else's
storage room for my office.

302
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:41,496
Can we settle this privately?
Let's reconcile.

303
00:21:42,488 --> 00:21:44,664
Tell me. Who tipped you off?

304
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:54,328
Jincao, Moli doesn't know
that I'd come here.

305
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:56,536
Yan Li is also my friend.

306
00:21:57,332 --> 00:21:59,864
I would do this for him, anyway.

307
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:04,696
I understand. Thank you, anyway.

308
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:11,571
Right, the evidence is in the watch.

309
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:12,811
Give it to Moli.

310
00:22:13,892 --> 00:22:16,184
Their legal department
should handle it well.

311
00:22:17,132 --> 00:22:19,192
Okay, thank you.
I'll give it back to you.

312
00:22:19,892 --> 00:22:21,771
No worries. Don't get me wrong.

313
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:25,080
Moli is nothing
but a precious old friend to me now.

314
00:22:27,692 --> 00:22:29,560
I just didn't expect that

315
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,372
she'd still be so sincere
after all these years. This is rare.

316
00:22:35,892 --> 00:22:37,656
You don't need to explain. I trust her.

317
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,491
I was young and reckless.

318
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:44,856
I still regret
making a scene at your wedding.

319
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:48,491
It's been so many years.

320
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:50,412
Just forget it. See you around.

I'm really sorry about the harm

I've done to you
and Mr. Yan with my article.

Please be magnanimous and forgive me.

333
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:16,692
I've deleted the article.

If you and Mr. Yan think it's necessary,

335
00:24:19,531 --> 00:24:22,372
I can post my apology
on my public account.

But based on my experience,

337
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:28,536
that may trigger
another round of heated discussion.

I don't think you'd want to see that.

As for a lawsuit...

00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:38,808
Honestly, the public account
has less than ten thousand in cash.

342

What a sincere apology.

344
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:49,932
You ruled out all the possibilities.

345
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:53,720
So I have no other choice but to
accept your verbal apology, right?

346
00:24:54,731 --> 00:24:58,692
I can offer you all my money,

00:25:09,251 --> 00:25:10,648
could get you sentenced

351
00:25:11,652 --> 00:25:14,360
to three years in prison
in addition to a financial penalty.

352
00:25:14,892 --> 00:25:16,344
I'll be put in prison?

353
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:20,760
I'm just a poor writer
who makes a living by writing articles.

354
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:22,840
Mr. Yan is a known painter.

355
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,540
Does he have to corner me?

356
00:25:25,372 --> 00:25:31,992
You know, I've been a self-media writer
ever since I graduated from college.

357
00:25:33,211 --> 00:25:34,731
I hardly made any money.

358
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:37,211
I'm still sharing
a semi-basement with others.

359
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:40,152
I beg you. Please let me off this time.

360
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:43,928
I've read your articles.

361
00:25:45,452 --> 00:25:49,971
To be honest, the art reviews
you wrote in the first place

362
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:51,372
were quite good.

363
00:25:52,571 --> 00:25:56,760
Clear viewpoints. Witty expression.
Easy to understand.

364
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:00,531
But why did you suddenly give up

365
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:04,892
and start writing
those sensational gossip articles?

366
00:26:06,852 --> 00:26:09,592
You've read those articles of mine?

367
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:13,240
And you liked them?

368
00:26:17,372 --> 00:26:20,092
But I can't make a living like that.

369
00:26:20,731 --> 00:26:24,571
At my hardest times,
I had instant noodles for a month.

370
00:26:24,571 --> 00:26:26,328
One pack would be my daily ration.

371
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,011
I began to write

372
00:26:29,692 --> 00:26:33,144
eye-catching gossip
about the art world to survive.

373
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,771
Those shameless articles.

374
00:26:36,811 --> 00:26:38,232
I also felt ashamed

375
00:26:38,232 --> 00:26:39,932
and struggled at first.

376
00:26:42,211 --> 00:26:45,720
But then I gave in to reality.

377
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:49,372
Enough, stop playing the victim.

378
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:53,816
You shouldn't have
broken the law no matter what.

379
00:26:59,092 --> 00:27:02,904
I can give you a chance
if you're honestly repenting.

380
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:06,011
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

381
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:15,412
Sis, let's go play frisbee this weekend.

382
00:27:15,412 --> 00:27:17,656
No way, you know I hate sports.

383
00:27:18,412 --> 00:27:20,211
Frisbee is for kids.

384
00:27:21,491 --> 00:27:23,892
Did you train the Border Collie...

385
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,971
Miss Shen Liuliu.

386
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:38,452
Please allow a handsome gentleman, me,
to dedicate a famous tune to you

387
00:27:38,452 --> 00:27:41,496
to express my admiration for you
at this very moment.

388
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:44,172

402

Liu... Wait...

403
00:28:48,051 --> 00:28:49,211
I'm not done.

404
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,092
Go back. They're rehearsing
for the team-building show.

405
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:57,304
Get going. It's over.

406
00:28:57,304 --> 00:28:58,616
Can you turn it off?

407
00:28:58,616 --> 00:29:00,412
Hurry up, let's go.

408
00:29:00,412 --> 00:29:01,912
It's for the vibe.

409
00:29:01,912 --> 00:29:02,520
Get going.

410
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:13,432
Liu, I'm not asking you
to say yes right now.

411
00:29:14,332 --> 00:29:16,952
I just want your permission
for me to pursue you.

412
00:29:18,852 --> 00:29:24,088
Huang Qianniu, stop making a scene.
Aren't you ashamed?

413
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:29,464
Love is sacred,
and I'm serious about it.

414
00:29:30,132 --> 00:29:31,452
Why should I feel ashamed?

415
00:29:31,452 --> 00:29:35,544
I'm also serious when I say
that I don't like you.

416
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:39,051
If you keep doing this,

417
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:43,032
I assure you
we won't meet again. Understand?

418
00:29:55,051 --> 00:29:57,132
What did I do wrong?

419
00:30:06,092 --> 00:30:10,328
Moli, I read the first review
Fan Fan wrote for Yan Li.

420
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:13,144
It's high quality. People love it.

421
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:17,971
What's the point of injuring the enemy
if you also suffer damage?

422
00:30:18,612 --> 00:30:21,412
Making good use
of resources for a win-win

423
00:30:21,412 --> 00:30:23,320
is what a good agent should do.

424
00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:27,288
Mi Na, this is how you
look at the big picture.

425
00:30:28,971 --> 00:30:30,811
It's all about interest.

426
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:33,560
She acted like
she'd seek justice at all costs.

427
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,531
But she chose profit
over justice in the end.

428
00:30:36,531 --> 00:30:37,932
Mi Na, watch your attitude.

429
00:30:39,692 --> 00:30:41,432
Mi Na, let's talk about you.

430
00:30:42,172 --> 00:30:45,016
I let Fan Fan off
but I'm getting even with you.

431
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:53,251
Mr. Chen, check it out.

432
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,811
(There's been a huge gossip)

433
00:30:57,811 --> 00:31:00,251
(in our industry these days.)

434
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:02,251
(I don't know if you've heard of it.)

435
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:06,051
(A divorced female agent surnamed G
is said to be having an affair)

436
00:31:06,051 --> 00:31:09,211
(with a well-known
male painter surnamed Y.)

437
00:31:09,211 --> 00:31:10,652
(This scandal...)

438
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:11,852
What is this?

439
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:14,571
(stirred up heated discussion.)

440
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:18,452
(Coincidentally, this female agent
got involved with)

441
00:31:18,452 --> 00:31:21,332
(this male painter
right after her divorce.)

442
00:31:21,332 --> 00:31:24,172
(They even displayed intimate behavior)

443
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:25,932
(in public.)

444
00:31:25,932 --> 00:31:30,132
(Such a coincidence
makes people speculate)

445
00:31:30,132 --> 00:31:31,971
(whether this female agent)

446
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:36,132
(got divorced due to
some inappropriate behavior.)

447
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:39,932
(She is also known as
a goal-driven agent)

448
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:42,332
(with low moral standards
within the circle.)

449
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:44,811
Mr. Chen, I am Yan Li's agent.

450
00:31:45,332 --> 00:31:50,531
From now on, no one shall intervene
in matters concerning him.

451
00:31:53,132 --> 00:31:56,491
Did you hear that? I agree with Moli.

452
00:31:56,491 --> 00:31:57,811
Enough with your tricks.

453
00:32:02,852 --> 00:32:04,892
Let's keep it to ourselves.

454
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,692
You know, unity matters the most.

455
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:13,811
Take care. See you tomorrow.

456
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:25,144
You made a video and showed your face.

457
00:32:25,692 --> 00:32:27,736
I've never seen someone
as stupid as you.

458
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,211
A lowly mistake.

459
00:32:45,612 --> 00:32:47,092
Miss Shen, please wait.

460
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,996
(Certificate of Honor)

461
00:33:08,892 --> 00:33:11,811
Miss Shen, sorry I kept you waiting.

462
00:33:11,811 --> 00:33:13,092
Want a cup of coffee?

463
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:13,811
Thank you.

464
00:33:13,811 --> 00:33:14,968
Just a second.

465
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:17,208
Let's talk outside.

466
00:33:17,656 --> 00:33:18,652
Okay.

467
00:33:23,892 --> 00:33:24,824
It's about business?

468
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,832
Yeah, the forum went
exceptionally well last time.

469
00:33:28,652 --> 00:33:31,992
Our boss would like you
to be a regular guest speaker.

470
00:33:36,251 --> 00:33:39,800
Sorry, I'm more of a writer
and I don't enjoy

471
00:33:40,412 --> 00:33:41,652
showing up in public.

472
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,092
Please don't rush to say no.

473
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:49,016
Take a look at what we're offering.
The payment is quite handsome.

474
00:33:50,011 --> 00:33:53,092
Miss Shen, we are like friends now.

475
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:56,376
You know I didn't plan to
give that speech last time.

476
00:33:57,251 --> 00:34:01,144
I'm very awkward and I can be
very stubborn about certain things.

477
00:34:02,412 --> 00:34:03,652
Unfortunately, I have to

478
00:34:03,652 --> 00:34:06,520
flaunt my knowledge to make a living.

479
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,584
Too much exposure will damage my image.

480
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:14,520
To put it plainly,
I like money, but I'm not greedy.

481
00:34:16,412 --> 00:34:18,812
The most important thing about investing

482
00:34:18,812 --> 00:34:22,812
is to delay one's gratification
to achieve the highest benefit.

483
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:25,912
So you're just not interested
in our company.

484
00:34:26,491 --> 00:34:31,491
No, that's not what I mean.
Maybe it's not the right time.

485
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:35,131
Maybe we can
work together some other time.

486
00:34:35,131 --> 00:34:39,611
Time waits for no one.
You said that we were friends.

487
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:43,812
Could you please consider it
for the sake of our friendship?

488
00:34:43,812 --> 00:34:47,032
A friend certainly wouldn't
put me in a difficult position.

489
00:34:48,732 --> 00:34:54,104
Okay, I really appreciate
your help last time.

490
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,611
I got you a gift. Here you are.

491
00:35:00,611 --> 00:35:01,531
Well...

492
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:03,971
Open it.

493
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,544
That's so kind of you.

494
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:12,312
(Year of the Rabbit
Commemorative Coin Set)

495
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:18,840
Is there a story behind this?

496
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:21,272
As you said in your speech,

497
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:24,664
one must make the right choices in life.

498
00:35:26,611 --> 00:35:28,088
A coin has its heads and tails,

499
00:35:28,651 --> 00:35:31,704
just as life has its A side and B side.

500
00:35:32,412 --> 00:35:36,696
Life is never as simple as
choosing from A and B.

501
00:35:38,412 --> 00:35:41,212
I believe we must strive for

502
00:35:41,212 --> 00:35:44,611
what we want while going with the flow.

503
00:35:45,131 --> 00:35:48,892
Delaying one's gratification
is definitely the right choice.

504
00:35:48,892 --> 00:35:52,824
But it may cost us
much happiness if we overdo it.

505
00:35:57,691 --> 00:35:58,452
Thank you.

506
00:36:02,651 --> 00:36:06,171
We're off work early today.
Get some rest. Don't stay up late.

507
00:36:06,171 --> 00:36:09,011
We'll have to work overtime
for a week straight.

508
00:36:09,011 --> 00:36:10,252
Be prepared.

509
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:12,051
Okay, Mr. Zhu.

510
00:36:14,776 --> 00:36:15,352
Hello, Mrs. Zhu.

511
00:36:15,352 --> 00:36:16,011
Hello, Mrs. Zhu.

512
00:36:16,011 --> 00:36:16,772
Bye.

513
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:24,892
How come you're here?

514
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:28,171
You've worked hard.
I'm picking you up from work.

515
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,792
Thank you for securing the evidence

516
00:36:37,332 --> 00:36:39,128
and finding the informant.

517
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:44,051
Mi Na is such a fool. She had no idea

518
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:47,491
that the game promotion board
in the background gave her away.

519
00:36:47,491 --> 00:36:50,372
There is only one internet cafe
for game release

520
00:36:50,372 --> 00:36:51,452
and role-playing.

521
00:36:52,091 --> 00:36:53,691
I checked the surveillance,

522
00:36:53,691 --> 00:36:55,932
checked the visitors,

523
00:36:55,932 --> 00:36:58,051
and confirmed that it was her.

524
00:36:58,971 --> 00:37:00,504
She's both foolish and persistent.

525
00:37:01,412 --> 00:37:04,131
She made a video and showed her face

526
00:37:04,131 --> 00:37:06,168
to make people buy her story.

527
00:37:06,812 --> 00:37:07,971
She had no idea

528
00:37:07,971 --> 00:37:11,064
that Fan Fan didn't care about
the authenticity of the video.

529
00:37:11,852 --> 00:37:13,336
But it was good for us.

530
00:37:13,336 --> 00:37:15,332
If it was just textual tip-offs,

531
00:37:15,332 --> 00:37:17,491
we couldn't have pinpointed her.

532
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:20,892
I was almost sure it was her

533
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,448
before we gathered any evidence.

534
00:37:24,171 --> 00:37:26,712
Actually, Jiang Haitao
helped me with that.

535
00:37:33,691 --> 00:37:36,312
He said he did it to help Yan Li,

536
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:40,051
but I know he did it mainly for you.

537
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:43,772
I'm not jealous.

538
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,812
Alright, I am. I confess.

539
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:53,571
Honey, I do trust you, but

540
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,736
every time I think about your history...

541
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:59,372
He's still so cool. He's still single.

542
00:37:59,372 --> 00:38:01,091
He's willing to stand up for you.

543
00:38:02,091 --> 00:38:03,491
And we're divorced now.

544
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:06,571
I'm worried every time
I think about these things.

545
00:38:07,812 --> 00:38:09,372
And I've been contemplating

546
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:13,272
if our divorce was the right choice.

547
00:38:19,452 --> 00:38:21,051
You're so cute.

548
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:25,491
We will adhere to the vow we made
at the time of our divorce.

549
00:38:25,491 --> 00:38:26,971
We will love each other forever.

550
00:38:27,491 --> 00:38:28,452
Forever.

551
00:38:38,852 --> 00:38:44,011
Divorce brings out all the good,
the evil, the beauty, and the ugliness

552
00:38:44,011 --> 00:38:45,971
of human nature.

553
00:38:46,852 --> 00:38:48,651
Fortunately, I was prepared.

554
00:38:49,212 --> 00:38:51,971
When there's a challenge, overcome it.

555
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:54,776
When there's a problem, solve it.

556
00:38:55,491 --> 00:38:58,168
Take it as a pleasant surprise in life.

557
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,576
But there's something that scares me.

558
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:07,611
We solved one problem after another.

559
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,011
And I suddenly realized

560
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:13,091
that we were deviating
more and more from the designed path.

561
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:15,292
Our goal became
increasingly hard to obtain.

562
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:20,120
We had to brace ourselves
and fight hard to level up,

563
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:26,008
striving to turn the plot twists
into a happy ending.

(Small Town Breakfast Shop)

566
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:54,932
Brother-in-law,
why are you ignoring my calls?

567
00:39:54,932 --> 00:39:56,691
And you blocked me on WeChat.

568
00:39:57,651 --> 00:40:00,491
Why are you holding
such a grudge against me

569
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:02,328
because of a purse?

570
00:40:04,408 --> 00:40:08,011
You were our guest and you disgraced us.

571
00:40:09,336 --> 00:40:12,408
I shouldn't have taken the purse.

572
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:16,184
But they can't just divorce over that.

573
00:40:17,892 --> 00:40:22,691
Brother-in-law, what kind of woman
would divorce her husband

574
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:24,372
for a purse?

575
00:40:24,372 --> 00:40:26,651
Who got divorced?

576
00:40:26,651 --> 00:40:28,491
Moli and Jincao.

577
00:40:30,852 --> 00:40:34,772
You haven't heard?
My sister hasn't told you?

578
00:40:34,772 --> 00:40:36,452
Even Qianniu knows.

579
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:42,611
They just got divorced,
and Moli's mother posted a photo

580
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:46,372
of Moli and another man in the Moments,

581
00:40:46,372 --> 00:40:49,531
calling them a perfect match.

582
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:52,252
I heard he's a known artist.

583
00:40:52,252 --> 00:40:56,292
His wife is ill in bed, and Moli
is just waiting to take her place.

584
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:59,171
It even made it on a public account.

585
00:40:59,932 --> 00:41:04,691
Do you really believe that
they got divorced because of a purse?

586
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:16,600
Jiang Haitao helped me out.
I should go and thank him.

587
00:41:17,592 --> 00:41:19,960
Copy that. Any specific plans?

588
00:41:20,952 --> 00:41:23,960
Phone call, WeChat, coffee, or dinner?

589
00:41:25,971 --> 00:41:29,432
I don't know. I'm just telling you
in case you get jealous.

590
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,256
Approved.

591
00:41:34,571 --> 00:41:38,936
Aren't you jealous?
Aren't you worried? Want to join us?

592
00:41:42,104 --> 00:41:44,344
I will give you
all the trust and freedom.

593
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,672
After all, you are mine, for sure.

594
00:41:56,856 --> 00:41:57,944
What are you doing?

595
00:41:59,608 --> 00:42:00,812
Nothing much.

596
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:02,412
I saw everything.

597
00:42:02,412 --> 00:42:04,440
Kiddo, there's nothing to see. Go play.

598
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,608
I want a kiss, too.

599
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,528
Alright. Kisses.

600
00:42:12,091 --> 00:42:15,608
Mom, I forgot to tell you something.

601
00:42:15,608 --> 00:42:16,691
What is it?

602
00:42:16,691 --> 00:42:19,032
I want you to perform a show with me.

603
00:42:19,608 --> 00:42:20,440
What show?

604
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:22,392
Sleeping Beauty.

Hello, Ke.

Hello, meet my wife, Gu Moli.

This is Gao Xiajing.

612
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:07,011
Hello.

613
00:43:07,011 --> 00:43:07,928
Nice to meet you again.

614
00:43:08,812 --> 00:43:09,732
Do you know each other?

615
00:43:10,732 --> 00:43:12,332
We live in the same neighborhood

616
00:43:12,332 --> 00:43:15,384
and both our kids come here.
We're bound to run into each other.

617
00:43:16,184 --> 00:43:18,392
Yeah, we see each other all the time.

618
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:22,808
But I haven't seen you around
for quite a while.

00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:26,584
