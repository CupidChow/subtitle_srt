Good work, everyone.

21
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,287
Jie, stay with me on duty.

22
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:57,487
The others can go out to eat.

23
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:59,246
Be sure to get a receipt
for reimbursement.

24
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:03,207
- Thank you, Mr. Zhu.
- Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

25
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:07,127
Remember.

26
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,407
You and Kang will be here
at 9 PM to replace me.

27
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:10,407
No problem, Mr. Zhu.

28
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:15,086
(Honey)

29
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:16,606
Hello, where are you?

30
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:18,727
We may not make it to Jinshan.

31
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:20,127
Ke has a fever.

32
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:21,247
Why?

33
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:22,486
I don't know why.

34
00:02:22,486 --> 00:02:25,046
She was drenched in water
at kindergarten today, then got a fever.

35
00:02:25,886 --> 00:02:26,967
Is it a high fever?

36
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:28,766
39.8 degrees Celsius.

37
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:33,046
Take her to the hospital.

38
00:02:33,046 --> 00:02:34,247
I'm taking time off now.

39
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:36,646
No, don't bother.

40
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:38,886
There are three adults here
to take care of her.

41
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:41,086
If you come back,
you just keep her company.

42
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:43,366
Just focus on your work.

43
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:48,046
It's a pity that the three of us can't
get together on Mid-Autumn Festival.

44
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:51,127
Honey, you've worked hard.

45
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:54,086
You too.

46
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:04,407
Mr. Zhu, your child is sick?
Maybe you should go back.

47
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:07,007
None of your business.
Keep an eye on the data now.

48
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:34,486
Let me tell you.
It's the same every year.

49
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:35,926
We usually go to the bars.

50
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:38,086
Now, friends want to gather
during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

51
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:40,086
You are here too. Tonight must be great.

52
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:43,366
Hello, is this seat taken?

53
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:45,127
Okay, thank you.

54
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:49,127
- Hello, make me a "Dreamy Eighteen".
- Sure.

55
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:52,166
Long time no see. How have you been?

56
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,206
Very well, how about you?

57
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:54,287
I'm pretty good.

58
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:56,007
How have you been lately?

59
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:59,407
Not bad. I've been busy at work lately.

60
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:03,967
Liuliu.

61
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:06,766
Long time no see.

62
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:09,086
Long time no see.

63
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:14,646
I saw on Moments
that you have a burst pipe.

64
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:16,646
I was going to help.

65
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:20,086
I didn't expect you fixed it.
Is everything okay now?

66
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:22,367
Thank you for your concern.

67
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:31,007
I haven't done anything.

68
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:33,567
I consider myself as someone grateful.

69
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:35,167
Don't say so.

70
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:38,047
I took care of you because I wanted to.

71
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:40,047
It is not some favor.

72
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,286
And you don't need to be grateful.

73
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:44,607
You keep mentioning it,
which makes me feel like

74
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:47,286
I'm losing my right of free expression.

75
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:51,167
I-I didn't mean that.

76
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:54,167
It doesn't matter.
I don't care what you mean.

77
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:55,726
Goodbye.

78
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,567
Where are you going?

79
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:58,927
Going home.

80
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,807
Today is Mid-Autumn Festival
and I have no friends in Shanghai.

81
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:05,326
Let's celebrate together.

82
00:05:05,326 --> 00:05:07,646
I'm sorry. I'm not in the mood.

83
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:09,687
Since you are here, just cheer up.

84
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:11,406
Let's have a drink together.

85
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:12,286
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:15,886
If I had known today
is Mid-Autumn Festival,

87
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:18,526
I wouldn't have come.

88
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:19,567
What's wrong?

89
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:23,646
Nothing. I don't particularly
like Mid-Autumn Festival.

90
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:27,487
Go inside.
Your friends are waiting for you.

91
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,646
Hope you have fun tonight.

92
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:34,086
My friend is right here.

93
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:37,526
You have to be happy tonight.

94
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:40,886
I'll accompany you
to admire the moon if you don't mind.

95
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,726
(Honey: The fever has gone down.
Don't worry.)

96
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:22,406
(Insomniac Gale: Are you having a feast
with your wife and child now?)

97
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:24,007
(Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!)

98
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:31,406
(Jincao: No, an accident happened.
They can't make it.)

99
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:49,447
(That means there's no reunion dinner.)

100
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:52,886
(Does it feel like missing a step
when going downstairs?)

101
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,086
(This is life.)

102
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:14,927
(I happen to be near
your residential area.)

103
00:07:15,646 --> 00:07:19,447
(If it is convenient,
I invite you to admire the moon.)

104
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:32,687
(I know the midnight snacks
at Tianxi Hotel are pretty good.)

105
00:07:33,247 --> 00:07:36,927
(How about we meet there in an hour?)

106
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:45,286
(See you there.)

107
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:48,687
Sir, to Tianxi Hotel please.

108
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:49,646
Okay.

109
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:01,567
Make yourself comfortable
with a pair of slippers.

110
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,927
I can go without them, in case
the host comes back and minds it.

111
00:08:08,646 --> 00:08:10,127
There's no host.

112
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:13,447
Don't you know
that every woman who lives alone

113
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:15,286
has a pair of men's shoes
on her doorstep?

114
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:19,167
To create an illusion for safety.

115
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:21,367
I've learned something new.

116
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:22,646
What do you want to drink?

117
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:23,927
Anything will do.

118
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,567
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

119
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:34,047
I'll open the curtains
and let's admire the moon.

120
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:34,927
Don't move.

121
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:38,287
If you want to accompany me,
just sit quietly.

122
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:52,407
When I was young,
during the Mid-Autumn Festival,

123
00:08:54,206 --> 00:08:58,527
my family would gather around the table,

124
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:01,447
cracking crabs,

125
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:03,407
eating mooncakes,

126
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:05,567
drinking red wine,

127
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:07,606
and admiring the moon.

128
00:09:09,687 --> 00:09:13,966
Dad and Mom were smiling.

129
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:18,486
My Dad said, "Girl,

130
00:09:20,086 --> 00:09:25,447
you'll forget all the worries
after getting drunk.

131
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:31,846
Whenever you encounter
something bad, just have a drink.

132
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:37,606
Once you wake up the next day,
everything will be gotten over."

133
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:43,927
But my dad lied to me.

134
00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:51,206
No matter how much I drink,
something can't be gotten over.

135
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:55,287
Ever since my parents passed away,

136
00:10:00,206 --> 00:10:01,846
I dream whenever I drink.

137
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:05,567
I dream about them all the time.

138
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:20,527
I want to soak in wine.

139
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:26,407
Sorry, it's been many years

140
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:30,927
I haven't seen a round moon.

141
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:39,287
Thank you for telling me so much.

142
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:43,887
Now I finally know

143
00:10:44,966 --> 00:10:47,767
why you don't like Mid-Autumn Festival.

144
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:59,687
There's an old movie called

145
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:03,287
Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears.

146
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:09,086
In fact, no one believes in tears,

147
00:12:10,086 --> 00:12:11,726
no matter where you are.

148
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:16,687
Crying doesn't solve anything.

149
00:12:16,846 --> 00:12:18,086
I'm a little better than you.

150
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:20,326
Both my parents are alive,

151
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,606
and they love me a lot.

152
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:30,606
I am working in a western-style building

153
00:12:30,927 --> 00:12:32,167
with a high salary.

154
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:35,726
Looks like I have everything.

155
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:39,807
But I have one thing in common with you.

156
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,447
You are an orphan.

157
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:44,846
I am an orphan in mind.

158
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:47,807
An orphan in mind.

159
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:01,447
Your parents have gone,

160
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:05,206
but their love is always with you.

161
00:13:05,726 --> 00:13:07,206
So you feel the love.

162
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:11,486
But I feel empty.

163
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:14,206
No one could understand me.

164
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:19,567
Many people think of me as an egoist,

165
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:20,927
an outsider.

166
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:25,447
But I wasn't born that way.

167
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:28,086
In big cities,

168
00:13:28,086 --> 00:13:33,687
it's hard
for non-locals like us to fit in.

169
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:37,807
You can't always get a reward
for what you pay.

170
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:42,287
People often give us strange looks,

171
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:44,807
which seem to be

172
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:48,287
courteous and polite,

173
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:51,887
but actually disdainful.

174
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:54,326
They just don't like you.

175
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:57,927
You want to start a family
and hide away.

176
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,326
Can you afford a house?

177
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:05,126
Can you stand
your girlfriend's pickiness?

178
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:09,047
The girl's parents constantly
compare you to others.

179
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,326
Just like my cousin.

180
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:18,167
He has no way to run away,
and he's in a mess.

181

(I can't make it
because of an emergency. Sorry.)

182
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:24,086
So, you've become a celibatarian?

183
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:27,927
Am I being selfish?

184
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:31,687
But at least
I'm not causing any trouble to anyone,

185
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:34,567
including me.

186
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:37,606

I thought I'd take a chance,
but I didn't realize you are here.

275

I made some braised pork and eggs.

276

286
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,566
I shared that gossip article
on Moments earlier.

287
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:49,447

I mistook about your ex-wife.

293
00:23:10,486 --> 00:23:13,766
The registration at the matchmaking
agency was done by our moms.

294
00:23:14,087 --> 00:23:15,407
Neither of us knew.

295
00:23:16,566 --> 00:23:21,167
The reason for my divorce
is quite special.

296
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,407
Although we are divorced,
she's still my wife,

297
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:24,647
not my ex-wife.

298
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:26,887
Do you understand?

299
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:33,407
I don't quite understand.

00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:40,447

310

Liuliu needed me.

311
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,927
Liuliu? The child is more important.

312
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:46,966
Alright, mom. Go to sleep.

313
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:48,607

seems to be just a prank.)

317
00:25:22,806 --> 00:25:24,806

318
00:25:24,887 --> 00:25:26,566

00:26:09,887 --> 00:26:10,526
Morning.

322
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:15,127
I made some breakfast.
I don't know if it suits your taste.

323
00:26:15,526 --> 00:26:16,367

325
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:30,687
I didn't plan it last night.

326
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:32,367
Neither did I.

327
00:26:32,607 --> 00:26:35,127
Don't get me wrong.
I didn't mean anything.

328
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,847
I drank some wine last night,

329
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:38,526
but I remember everything I've done.

330
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,127
What do you mean?

331
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,367
If you want,

332
00:26:42,766 --> 00:26:45,206
we can try a long-term relationship.

333
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:48,847
You're a celibatarian.

334
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:53,927
Would you change your life philosophy
over a one-night stand?

335
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:56,046
You are straightforward.

336
00:26:56,447 --> 00:26:57,367
Answer me.

337
00:26:57,966 --> 00:27:01,367
I really can't answer you, unless I lie.

338
00:27:06,806 --> 00:27:07,486

339
00:27:12,286 --> 00:27:16,407
Please forgive what happened last night.

340
00:27:19,407 --> 00:27:20,647
Don't say so.

341
00:27:23,687 --> 00:27:25,687
It's a little treat I give myself.

342
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:28,087
I was happy.

343
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:33,407
Let's have breakfast.

344
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:38,647
No, I will have a conference call
with a client at the office.

345
00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:40,167
I have to go now.

346
00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:43,966
Got it, bye.

347
00:27:49,246 --> 00:27:50,087

for a long time.

349
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:13,046

How are you feeling, Ke?
Do you still have a fever?

351
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,966
I'm already better.

352
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:20,486
Really? Let me check.

353
00:28:23,806 --> 00:28:26,246
See, no fever anymore.

354
00:28:26,847 --> 00:28:28,206
Come on, Ke. Drink some water.

355
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:36,566
Alright, you've seen your daughter.
You can go back to catch up on sleep.

356
00:28:36,566 --> 00:28:37,447
Take another sip.

357
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:38,647
What sleep to catch up on?

358
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:40,447
I'll do some things during the day,

359
00:28:40,447 --> 00:28:42,726
and come back in the evening
to pick you up for a reunion.

360
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,046
What's wrong?

361
00:28:51,486 --> 00:28:53,167
Your parents
are still sitting on the doorstep.

362
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,647
They didn't look happy when I arrived,

363
00:28:56,046 --> 00:28:58,887
like two cats waiting for a mouse.

364
00:28:59,286 --> 00:29:00,407
Just see me out.

365
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:01,927
Whom do you fear?

366
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:06,726
Mom, just see Dad out.

367
00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:11,087
Dad has come see me from afar.

368
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:13,006
You are on his side.

369
00:29:15,966 --> 00:29:18,726
Be good, Ke. I have to go now.

370
00:29:18,726 --> 00:29:20,246
Bye, Dad.

371
00:29:24,407 --> 00:29:25,046
Dad.

372
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:27,687
Stay for breakfast before you go.

373
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:29,087
Gu.

374
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:32,206
I'm off to class.

375
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:35,087
Make sure to lock the door at home.

376
00:29:35,246 --> 00:29:36,806
Be careful of fire and theft.

377
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:41,087
I know. You haven't had breakfast yet.

378
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:42,206
No, I'm full.

379
00:29:42,206 --> 00:29:43,966
Mom, I'll drive you.

380
00:29:44,327 --> 00:29:47,046
No need, I've called
a ride-hailing service.

381
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:49,246
I'm leaving.

382
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:50,006
Okay.

383
00:29:55,726 --> 00:29:56,647
Wait a moment.

384
00:29:56,766 --> 00:29:59,046
Isn't it awkward for you
to take the same elevator as my mom?

385
00:30:04,087 --> 00:30:05,367
Then have a bite.

386
00:30:05,726 --> 00:30:07,006
No need.

387
00:30:53,246 --> 00:30:55,167
- Mom.
- Son, why are you back?

388
00:30:57,726 --> 00:30:58,726
Be careful, Mom.

389
00:31:05,486 --> 00:31:06,407
I'm leaving.

390
00:31:09,726 --> 00:31:10,806
What's going on?

391
00:31:10,806 --> 00:31:12,046
I drove her here.

392
00:31:12,927 --> 00:31:14,966
We didn't gather
for the Mid-Autumn Festival yesterday,

393
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:16,167
so I've booked a place.

394
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,526
Let's have a reunion.

395
00:31:17,726 --> 00:31:19,766
Alright, I understand.

396
00:31:19,766 --> 00:31:20,966
Drive slowly, okay?

397
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:21,486
Okay.

398
00:31:23,847 --> 00:31:24,887
Wu.

399
00:31:26,327 --> 00:31:27,206
Wu.

400
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,806
Wu, you...

401
00:31:31,127 --> 00:31:33,526
Let me tell you.
Your son offered to drive me here.

402
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:34,687
I didn't ask him to drive me.

403
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:37,806
I've ordered a ride-hailing service
and he kept asking me to drive me.

404
00:31:38,486 --> 00:31:40,246
Ke had a fever last night.

405
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:42,006
Moli stayed up all night.

406
00:31:42,006 --> 00:31:43,367
Where was your son?

407
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:47,286
At least he came back
and checked on the child today.

408
00:31:47,286 --> 00:31:48,367
No. Wait.

409
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:49,127
What did you say?

410
00:31:49,687 --> 00:31:51,167
What's wrong with Ke? She had a fever?

411
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,806
Yes, she had a fever
of 39.8 degrees Celsius.

412
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:55,647
Why didn't you call
to tell me last night?

413
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,647
Why should I have to call you?

414
00:31:57,726 --> 00:32:00,206
It's normal for a child to have a fever.

415
00:32:00,206 --> 00:32:02,167
The fever fluctuates rapidly.

416
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:03,687
She's all right now.

417
00:32:03,687 --> 00:32:07,206
Her parents are with her today,
so you can go to class with ease.

418
00:32:07,246 --> 00:32:09,607
Wu. Why are you being like this?

419
00:32:09,607 --> 00:32:11,006
What?

420
00:32:11,006 --> 00:32:12,447
Don't you know what's important?

421
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:14,766
What's more important,
Ke or attending class?

422
00:32:15,087 --> 00:32:16,206
Ke.

423
00:32:16,206 --> 00:32:17,006
It's okay then.

424
00:32:17,006 --> 00:32:18,806
Attending class is also important.

425
00:32:20,486 --> 00:32:22,526
So how exactly is Ke doing now?

426
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:25,607
I'll tell you again. She's fine now.

427
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:38,887
Hello.

428
00:32:42,286 --> 00:32:43,206
Come in.

429
00:32:47,927 --> 00:32:49,206
You are asleep?

430
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:51,526
Jincao.

431
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:56,206
A client meeting in the morning
left me with headache.

432
00:32:56,847 --> 00:32:57,726
What's up?

433
00:32:58,966 --> 00:33:00,766
I remember that last time when

434
00:33:01,127 --> 00:33:03,246
you financed the large gaming company,

435
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:04,607
you got to know their Mr. Huo.

436
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:07,647
Could you look something up for me?

437
00:33:08,647 --> 00:33:09,687
What do you want?

438
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:13,046
A gamer.
I want to know who he really is.

439
00:33:13,046 --> 00:33:13,847
Why?

440
00:33:13,927 --> 00:33:16,447
He asked me to team up for a game.

441
00:33:16,647 --> 00:33:18,087
It's normal at the beginning.

442
00:33:18,087 --> 00:33:19,486
But gradually, I started to feel

443
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,806
that this person seems to aim at me

444
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:24,486
and is well-prepared.

445
00:33:24,526 --> 00:33:25,766
Were you scammed?

446
00:33:25,766 --> 00:33:27,167
I'm not Qianniu.

447
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:28,447
Tricked into a romantic scam?

448
00:33:28,447 --> 00:33:29,167
No.

449
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:31,607
I didn't give it much thought.

450
00:33:31,607 --> 00:33:34,367
I just subconsciously
thought it must be a man.

451
00:33:39,206 --> 00:33:40,327
But it's a woman.

452
00:33:41,927 --> 00:33:43,687
I just don't know,

453
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:45,647
so I'm asking you to help me check.

454
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:47,486
No scam or romantic scam.

455
00:33:47,766 --> 00:33:49,327
How did this person threaten you?

456
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:52,367
You can't check on her based on a hunch?

457
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:55,447
I suspect this person
is sending Moli anonymous messages.

458
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:57,687
She intends to ruin
our marital relationship.

459
00:33:57,687 --> 00:34:01,647
That means you have some secrets.

460
00:34:01,647 --> 00:34:02,607
No.

461
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:04,407
Really, nothing.

462
00:34:04,566 --> 00:34:06,327
Just give up on that.

463
00:34:06,447 --> 00:34:08,086
You can't check someone's
background information.

464
00:34:08,086 --> 00:34:10,486
It's illegal and against the rules.

465
00:34:12,086 --> 00:34:14,927
Jincao, no matter who aims at you,

466
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:18,086
as long as you are determined,
you'll be fine.

467
00:34:19,486 --> 00:34:22,566
I know. I was pissed off.

468
00:34:24,126 --> 00:34:26,646
Please don't tell Moli about this.

469
00:34:27,046 --> 00:34:28,407
I'm not Qianniu.

470
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:30,166
This is the assignment.

471
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:33,686
I've made the size, requirements,
and format very clear.

472
00:34:33,686 --> 00:34:35,566
Once you've finished,

473
00:34:35,566 --> 00:34:37,327
just email it to me.

474
00:34:37,526 --> 00:34:38,887
That's it for today's class.

475
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:49,407
Do you know
how to import files and send emails?

476
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:51,166
If you don't know, I can teach you.

477
00:34:51,646 --> 00:34:54,126
No need. I have a son.

478
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:13,207
Stop. Why do you take photos of a dish?

479
00:35:14,927 --> 00:35:16,486
Put it down.

480
00:35:16,847 --> 00:35:18,287
All the dishes are reday, please enjoy.

481
00:35:20,447 --> 00:35:23,447
Son, it's just the three of us.

482
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:25,727
You ordered so much,
and we can't finish them.

483
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:28,887
Why bother ordering
those exquisite dishes?

484
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:31,046
A plate of dumplings will do.

485
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,767
I've ordered dumplings.
They'll come last.

486
00:35:33,486 --> 00:35:35,486
We have mooncakes.
Why do we need dumplings?

487
00:35:35,486 --> 00:35:36,807
Shut up.

488
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,447
I didn't come back
for the Mid-Autumn Festival last time.

489
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:42,847
So this time I'll make up with you two.

490
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:45,447
If you're busy, then don't come back.

491
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:47,207
There's also some good news.

492
00:35:47,287 --> 00:35:50,727
On the day of the Mid-Autumn Festival,
my new product was launched,

493
00:35:50,727 --> 00:35:52,447
so I wanted to celebrate with you.

494
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:54,207
That's great.
That's what I want to hear.

495
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:55,006
Come on.

496
00:35:55,407 --> 00:35:56,247
Congratulations.

497
00:35:56,247 --> 00:35:58,247
-Cheers.
-Congratulations to my son.

498
00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:03,327
That's what I want to hear.

499
00:36:04,646 --> 00:36:07,456
You're always busy and tired.

500
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,086
- Mom, eat.
- Eat more.

501
00:36:08,686 --> 00:36:09,887
Then I'll take a bit.

502
00:36:15,327 --> 00:36:18,727
Now is the time for you
to focus on your career.

503
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:20,807
It's right to be busy.

504
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:24,086
Some young people have a bad attitude,

505
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:29,486
always thinking of slacking off
and work-life balance.

506
00:36:30,006 --> 00:36:33,807
They say men should spend time
with his family.

507
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:36,686
Stay with each other

508
00:36:36,686 --> 00:36:38,166
and look at each other every day.

509
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:39,486
How can they earn the money?

510
00:36:39,486 --> 00:36:41,606
Isn't that all nonsense?

511
00:36:41,606 --> 00:36:43,166
Right, everything you say is right.

512
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,927
Yes, you are right.

513
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:46,327
You can't speak properly.

514
00:36:46,327 --> 00:36:47,767
Mom, you eat more.

515
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:49,566
You don't have to cook today.

516
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:52,447
You have to go back to school
after the meal, right?

517
00:36:52,526 --> 00:36:53,526
I'll drive you there.

518
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:54,367
Okay.

519
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:56,686
No need. Let her go there on her own.

520
00:36:56,887 --> 00:36:58,327
There's a bus station.

521
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:18,447
I had a really good drink today.

522
00:37:19,407 --> 00:37:22,606
See. This is the first time

523
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:29,006
the three of us got together like this
since you left hometown.

524
00:37:29,006 --> 00:37:31,126
But Ke isn't here.

525
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:36,807
Also, after hearing about
your new product launch,

526
00:37:36,847 --> 00:37:38,606
I'm even happier.

527
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:41,407
As long as I see some progress from you,

528
00:37:41,407 --> 00:37:43,847
I just feel happy.

529
00:37:44,646 --> 00:37:49,046
Jincao, you're on your own in Jinshan.

530
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:53,646
Be sure to take good care of yourself.

531
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,566
I see.

532
00:37:54,686 --> 00:37:56,407
I am not being naggy.

533
00:37:56,447 --> 00:38:00,166
Be strict with yourself in all aspects.

534
00:38:00,807 --> 00:38:04,166
A gentleman is cautious when alone.
Do you forget it?

535
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:06,247
The Book of Rites, Doctrine of the Mean.

536
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:14,954
(Nanpu Bridge)

537
00:38:19,606 --> 00:38:22,006
Be careful. Off you go.

538
00:38:33,287 --> 00:38:35,927
(I want to ask you something.
Are you male or female?)

539
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,526
(Long time no see.
We've teamed up for so long,)

540
00:38:44,807 --> 00:38:46,606
(why do you suddenly ask this?)

541
00:38:46,686 --> 00:38:49,606
(Do we need to know that details
to play games now?)

542
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,566
(Who are you?
Why do you team up with me?)

543
00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:01,646
(The system recommended you to me.)

544
00:39:05,207 --> 00:39:07,606
(Judging by your ID, I doubt it.)

545
00:39:07,686 --> 00:39:10,526
(You must know me
and understand me quite well.)

546
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:14,486
(You approached me
and pandered to my topic.)

547
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:16,086
(What do you want?)

548
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,126
(I don't know you.)

549
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:22,166
(It's just that we get along well.
Don't be too sensitive.)

550
00:39:23,966 --> 00:39:25,566
(Who are you?)

551
00:39:47,727 --> 00:39:49,046
Zhang Shanya.

552
00:39:49,207 --> 00:39:50,126
Teacher.

553
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:52,166
All the students have already
handed in their homework.

554
00:39:52,287 --> 00:39:55,407
But you have not submitted it twice.

555
00:39:55,566 --> 00:39:57,287
What is the reason?

556
00:39:57,447 --> 00:39:59,287
Nothing particular.

557
00:39:59,287 --> 00:40:02,126
I've just been too busy at home,
so I-I didn't take the pictures.

558
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:04,247
Teacher. She did take them.

559
00:40:04,247 --> 00:40:06,526
She thinks her work
is not good enough to show.

560
00:40:06,927 --> 00:40:08,447
She took many in her phone.

561
00:40:08,646 --> 00:40:09,447
Wait, Wu. Don't...

562
00:40:09,447 --> 00:40:10,646
Teacher. It's right here.

563
00:40:10,646 --> 00:40:13,006
Give it back. What are you doing?

564
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:15,367
Zhang Shanya.

565
00:40:15,727 --> 00:40:19,407
Since you've taken pictures,
why don't you show them to me?

566
00:40:22,927 --> 00:40:24,447
Okay.

567
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:41,126
Who is it?

568
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:53,166
Mr. Zhu.

569
00:40:54,086 --> 00:40:55,767
What's wrong? Come in and talk.

570
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:58,287
No need. Sorry for disturbing you.

571
00:40:58,287 --> 00:40:59,512
I want to ask you something.

572
00:40:59,966 --> 00:41:03,086
Why did you go to Jinshan last night?

573
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:05,086
I went to pick Guo up.

574
00:41:09,327 --> 00:41:12,526
My ex-husband lives
in Fengjing Town, Jinshan.

575
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:14,526
Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival.

576
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:16,367
Guo's grandparents wanted to see Guo,

577
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:18,086
so they asked him to go over for a meal.

578
00:41:18,327 --> 00:41:21,566
I picked up Guo in the evening.

579
00:41:23,126 --> 00:41:25,407
Then why did you show up
at the residential area?

580
00:41:27,847 --> 00:41:29,646
I just dropped by

581
00:41:30,046 --> 00:41:31,686
to try my luck.

582
00:41:31,847 --> 00:41:34,526
You've been helping me
and I'm very grateful.

583
00:41:34,767 --> 00:41:37,247
But I don't know how to thank you.

584
00:41:38,606 --> 00:41:41,847
So I made some braised pork
before I went to Jinshan.

585
00:41:42,407 --> 00:41:44,367
I thought you might be working overtime.

586
00:41:45,046 --> 00:41:48,407
If I see you there,
then I'll give it to you.

587
00:41:48,407 --> 00:41:50,606
If not, then never mind.

588
00:41:53,927 --> 00:41:54,847
What's wrong?

589
00:41:55,966 --> 00:42:00,287
You came to me out of the blue.
Is it I...

590
00:42:00,966 --> 00:42:02,126
Nothing.

591
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:06,686
I thought you went to Jinshan
to tell me something important.

592
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:09,046
No.

593
00:42:09,086 --> 00:42:11,407
Okay, then it's good.

594
00:42:56,606 --> 00:42:57,407
Well,

595
00:42:57,646 --> 00:43:00,086
the mooncake with ice cream filling
is really delicious.

596
00:43:00,207 --> 00:43:02,126
I think it's delicious too.

597
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:03,407
Your opinion doesn't matter.

598
00:43:03,407 --> 00:43:05,526
Do you forget how painful you are
when you have a fever?

599
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:09,646
And you.

600
00:43:09,646 --> 00:43:11,327
Don't you know she can't have ice cream?

601
00:43:11,384 --> 00:43:13,046
She will get diarrhea and fever
once she eats it.

602
00:43:13,046 --> 00:43:14,006
I forgot it.

603
00:43:14,447 --> 00:43:16,407
Look, Ke didn't eat
the ice cream filling either.

604
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:19,046
Mom, I don't have ice cream.

605
00:43:19,086 --> 00:43:20,367
Look how well-behaved our Ke is.

606
00:43:20,407 --> 00:43:23,367
Mom, can I go watch some cartoons?

607
00:43:25,526 --> 00:43:26,247
