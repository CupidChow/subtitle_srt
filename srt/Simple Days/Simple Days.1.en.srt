Mr. Tang, there's something
I'm not sure if I should say.

76
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:07,008
The painting Gu Moli
sold to you is overvalued.

77
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:10,884
The price of the paintings
by Chen Qirong from last year

78
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:12,928
is about 32 percent lower than
the current market price.

79
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:15,995
Apart from speculation, what else
could increase its value so quickly?

and my granddaughter's mother.

is Zhu Jincao, your precious son

and my lawful husband.
Are you satisfied now?

140
00:10:08,364 --> 00:10:12,323
Is that possible?
You went to a hotel instead of home?

141
00:10:12,323 --> 00:10:15,872
And 800 yuan every time.
Who would believe that?

We haven't finished talking. Come back.

You must make it clear.

146

Go back and ask your son.

147

Mr. Tang, sorry. Please don't be angry.

Gu Moli absolutely cannot
represent the gallery.

149

Please don't stop buying
our paintings because of her.

150
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:49,443
Besides, the living room
in your new villa is so big.

151
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:51,904
How could it be
without a painting to match it?

152
00:10:53,124 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll buy that painting "Desire".
Prepare the contract.

to Group Two starting today.

157

Ms. Du from Group Two
will be transferred over.

158
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:30,364
Bai, as you're young and smart,
you can come up with many ideas.

159
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:32,160
I hope you continue
to make an effort there.

160
00:11:32,704 --> 00:11:35,488

161
00:11:36,244 --> 00:11:37,163

162
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,043
Mom.

163
00:11:46,043 --> 00:11:48,203

164
00:11:48,203 --> 00:11:49,563
I'm in a meeting.

165

Still focused on these things
and making money?

166
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:55,360
How much do you have to earn
to please your wife? Come back.

167
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:03,843
Jincao, check them out.

168
00:12:03,843 --> 00:12:05,563
Are we some kind of wealthy family?

169
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:09,632
Your father and I scrimped
and saved to buy you this house.

170
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:12,544
But you two went
to get a room at a hotel.

171
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:17,203
800 yuan for two hours.
You two are really extravagant.

172
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,264
I paid for the hotel room.

173
00:12:19,843 --> 00:12:21,524
No one's money should be wasted.

174
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:22,803
Aren't you wasting money?

175
00:12:22,803 --> 00:12:25,724
If you hadn't made a scene there today,
I wouldn't have lost my deal.

176
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:29,083
You blame me, right?
I wanted to drag you out at first.

177
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,104
Didn't you ask me to say it
in front of your colleagues?

178
00:12:31,104 --> 00:12:31,604
I...

179
00:12:31,604 --> 00:12:34,528
In the final analysis, it's just
because you two go to a hotel.

180
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:37,664
From now on,
every Friday, I'll take Ke out.

181
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:39,872
You two can enjoy yourselves
in this house.

182
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:42,644
I still want to have a grandson.
You guys can have a second child.

183
00:12:42,644 --> 00:12:45,088
Another child? Are you serious?

184
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:47,584
Two hours should be enough, right?

185
00:12:48,683 --> 00:12:50,484
Is this a matter of time?

186
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:52,244
I won't do things in secret.

187
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:54,004
I'm uncomfortable doing that
with others at home.

188
00:12:54,004 --> 00:12:56,928
What do you mean by others? Me?

189
00:12:57,724 --> 00:12:59,284
It's been six years, Gu Moli.

190
00:12:59,284 --> 00:13:02,004
For six years, I've washed clothes,
cooked, and taken care of your kid.

191
00:13:02,004 --> 00:13:03,040
I've acted as your nanny.

192
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:05,323
Now I'm others?

193
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:06,816
Don't you treat me that way too?

194
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:10,496
You saw these hotel invoices
and suspected me of having an affair.

195
00:13:11,284 --> 00:13:15,203
You keep talking about how you scrimped
and saved to buy this small house.

196
00:13:15,203 --> 00:13:17,043
Back then, my parents said

197
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:19,520
they were willing
to give us money to buy a bigger house.

198
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,928
But you just didn't agree.

199
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:23,840
Why? Because you didn't want
to add my name to the property deed.

200
00:13:24,443 --> 00:13:27,360
Now, we live in such a small house.

201
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:29,963
We can't even guarantee
a normal marital life.

202
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:32,043
What an awful life!

203
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:33,043
Let me tell you.

204
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:36,004
Stop bringing up the fact
your name is not on the property deed.

205
00:13:36,004 --> 00:13:37,404
It has nothing to do with

206
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:39,963
you two going to a hotel.

207
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:43,803
You're too pompous.

208
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:46,884
You made Jincao lose the chance
for postgraduate recommendation

209
00:13:46,884 --> 00:13:47,803
and a Shanghai hukou.

210
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:48,864
You mean I'm pompous?

211
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:49,443
Isn't it you?

212
00:13:49,443 --> 00:13:51,884
Alright, stop quarreling. Mom.

213
00:13:51,884 --> 00:13:54,176
Didn't we agree
not to dredge up the past?

214
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:55,884
Let's just stick to the facts.

215
00:13:55,884 --> 00:13:58,752
No matter what, you shouldn't have made
a scene at the gallery today.

216
00:13:58,752 --> 00:14:00,404
I didn't make a scene. I went there...

217
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:02,976
You went there
with these hotel receipts.

218
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:03,744
What were you doing?

219
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:05,604
How did you expect
her colleagues to see her?

220
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:07,163
What would they think of me
as her husband?

221
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:08,224
You make me so embarrassed!

222
00:14:10,803 --> 00:14:12,284
She hasn't even done anything yet.

223
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,843
Even if she really did do something,

224
00:14:13,843 --> 00:14:17,043
you should wait for her to come back
and explain it to you, right?

225
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:19,923
Isn't there an old saying?
"Don't wash your dirty linen in public."

226
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:21,323
What do you mean?

227
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:23,443
I was just making an analogy, honey.

228
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:27,004
With my mom going there today
and your absence now,

229
00:14:27,004 --> 00:14:29,244
Mr. Chen will surely lose
his temper with you.

230
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,724
He'll have complaints about you.

231
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:33,884
You should rush back now
and explain things clearly to him.

232
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:35,803
Try to get that order back.

233
00:14:36,323 --> 00:14:37,963
It wasn't my decision to come back.

234
00:14:38,683 --> 00:14:40,364
Pull your clothes up a bit.

235
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:41,203
I just won't.

236
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:45,280
I... Jincao. You...

237
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,803
Mom.

238
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:46,443
Look at your wife.

239
00:14:46,443 --> 00:14:47,043
Stop talking.

240
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:49,004
I understand. Calm down.

241
00:15:08,043 --> 00:15:09,203
Mom.

242
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:10,524
Go away.

243
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:13,604
The old saying is so true.

244
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:16,320
After the man got married,
he will ignore his mother.

245
00:15:17,364 --> 00:15:18,688
You've been biased towards your wife.

246
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,096
Mom, try to put yourself
in her shoes for a moment,

247
00:15:25,404 --> 00:15:27,072
if Moli

248
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:29,632
were your pampered daughter.

249
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:32,736
Her quality of life drastically
dropped after getting married,

250
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:36,032
and she had to live in a smaller house
and raise a kid for me.

251
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:39,968
We're crammed into
this one-bedroom apartment

252
00:15:40,884 --> 00:15:42,432
and even have to sleep in bunk beds.

253
00:15:43,004 --> 00:15:46,240
Isn't it normal for us
to occasionally go to a hotel?

254
00:15:48,484 --> 00:15:51,296
Zhu Jincao,
this is just our family's situation.

255
00:15:51,803 --> 00:15:53,632
Who insisted on marrying you
in the first place?

256
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,976
Is she acting like a daughter-in-law?

257
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:00,928
She doesn't show any gratitude at all.

258
00:16:01,724 --> 00:16:03,040
She leaves early and returns late.

259
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,004
Does she help me
with the household chores? No.

260
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:08,928
I say one thing to her,
and she talks back tenfold.

261
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:14,080
Mom, Moli often tells me that deep down,
she is very grateful for your help.

262
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:19,008
Zhu Jincao,
you're still siding with her.

263
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:21,152
Why do you always listen to her?

264
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,640
You do whatever she says,
including getting a hotel room.

265
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:26,176
800 yuan for two hours.

266
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:29,568
If your dad knows about this,
he'll break your leg.

267
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,963
You're such a wimp!

268
00:16:32,963 --> 00:16:34,048
My help to you is pointless.

269
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:38,043
Alright, Mom, don't be angry anymore.

270
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:39,604
How come I have the time to be angry?

271
00:16:39,604 --> 00:16:42,048
Look at the time.
I haven't even bought the groceries yet.

272
00:16:44,364 --> 00:16:45,724
Let me tell you, Zhu Jincao.

273
00:16:45,724 --> 00:16:48,096
You call Moli later and have her
pick up the child.

274
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,124
I'm not acting as the nanny for you.

275
00:16:57,056 --> 00:16:59,936
If it hadn't been for my quick thinking

276
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,950
to recommend a painting to Mr. Tang,

277
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,000
we would have lost a big client.

278
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,069
You make snatching orders
sound so righteous.

279
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,229
You really deserve
the title of top sales.

280
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,989
Do I still need to snatch it?

281
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:11,670
Alright.

282
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,029
You turned the gallery into a mess,

283
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:16,590
bringing your personal matters here.

284
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,469
All of our clients would run away.

285
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:21,709
Mr. Chen, although snatching orders
isn't explicitly forbidden,

286
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:24,509
it is an unwritten agreement

287
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:27,069
among our agents not to poach clients.

288
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,432
Mi Na has broken the rules.
Please decide what to do.

289
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:41,229
Moli, you didn't handle
your personal matters well

290
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:43,989
and turned the gallery into a mess.
That's your fault.

291
00:17:43,989 --> 00:17:45,630
Mi Na was just trying
to keep the client.

292
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:47,680
Business is tough these days.

293
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,630
Millions in rent every year.

294
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,190
Can you stop the infighting?

295
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:53,350
So we don't need to follow the rules?

296
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,376
Don't matter to me how you do it.

297
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,749
What I want are clients.
Then we can talk about the rules.

298
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,344
Jinying Live is our new business
and needs support.

299
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,568
Which of the team leaders present
would like to sign up to go to Jinshan?

300
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,120
Jinshan is so far away.
Who would want to go?

301
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,800
Exactly, starting from scratch
is the hardest.

302
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,840
Even if you manage to do a good job,
any failure will be blamed on you.

303
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,360
Venturing into new territory
is no easy task,

304
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,920
but when you make it,
your hard work won't go unnoticed.

305
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,432
If no one volunteers,
I'll have to appoint someone.

306
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,241
Jincao, how about you go to Jinshan?

307
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:49,152
Mr. Jiang, I gotta take leave
to pick up my child today.

308
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,640
Go ahead.

309
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,241
What special day is it today?

310
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,241
How come it's you picking me up?

311
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:06,080
It is the Father-Daughter Day.

312
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,600
Father-Daughter Day? What's that?

313
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,208
It is the day we spend together.

314
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,160
Grandma and Mom specially approved it,
for just the two of us to be together.

315
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,440
You'll do whatever you want to do
and eat whatever you want to eat.

316
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:20,960
That's great.

317
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,850
(Send me the slides
for Zhanma Live before midnight.)

318
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,770
Is it Mom?

319
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,290
No, let's go eat something delicious.

320
00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:07,264
(Jinying Culture Media)

321
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:27,370
You're back.

322
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:36,171
Sorry about what happened today.
Don't take it to heart.

323
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,290
It's okay.

324
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:41,664
I still need to modify
a presentation. You sleep first.

325
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,651
I made you a coffee.
See if it's still hot.

326
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:48,090
Good night.

327
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:50,451
Go to bed early. Don't stay up too late.

328
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:52,651
I know. Good night.

329
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,290
Good night.

330
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,610
(Jincao loves me, and I love him too.)

331
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,130
(Love is the armor
that resists the trivialities in life.)

332
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:21,651
(We've been married for years.)

333
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:25,024
(After the quarrels,
we are still comrades in arms.)

334
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:30,368
We need to save energy for handling
tomorrow's tasks and fatigue.

335
00:21:42,656 --> 00:21:45,251
Ms. Li, do you know Xue Feng?

336
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:50,850
Yes, that's him, I just signed him.

337
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,651
If you're interested in his works,

338
00:21:52,651 --> 00:21:54,891
let's set a time,
and I will introduce him to you.

339
00:21:55,651 --> 00:21:57,651
Moli, your husband is here.

340
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,050
Help yourself.

341
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,211
Thanks.

342
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:02,931
Mi Na, this is for you.

343
00:22:02,931 --> 00:22:04,171
Thanks.

344
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,651
Just take anything from the bag.
Help yourself.

345
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:10,570
Okay.

346
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:12,704
- The sweet ones for the girls.
- Okay.

347
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:13,610
Why are you here?

348
00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:17,251
I was nearby and thought
I'd drop in to see you.

349
00:22:17,251 --> 00:22:19,050
You're so handsome
and dote on your wife.

350
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,090
Moli, you're so lucky.

351
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,290
Not really.

352
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,491
Do you have any brothers?
Colleagues are fine too.

353
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:27,290
Your friends must be reliable.
Introduce us to some.

354
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,931
Yeah, are there any girls?

355
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,208
You wish. No girls.

356
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:33,850
Tell Moli what requirements
you have for a boyfriend.

357
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,130
I'll get you ones based on those.

358
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,491
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

359
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:38,731
There are many photos in my phone.
Do you want to take a look?

360
00:22:40,011 --> 00:22:41,530
Enough. You can leave.

361
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,451
I have quite a few.

362
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,370
Goodbye.

363
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:49,952
Bye.

364
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,251
Come often.

365
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:54,050
Come often.

366
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,712
Thank you for helping me
straighten out my affairs.

367
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:01,850
It's not just your business.

368
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,931
It's caused by my mom,
so I should be the one to fix it.

369
00:23:03,931 --> 00:23:05,810
I can't let my wife be unhappy.

370
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,050
Besides, afternoon tea
isn't very expensive.

371
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,168
Once they have it, they can't talk about
you behind your back.

372
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,272
Is it difficult for you being caught
between me and your mom?

373
00:23:18,971 --> 00:23:22,011
It's hard for us two,
and for my mom as well.

374
00:23:25,651 --> 00:23:28,810
I've been thinking lately
that Ke is a preschool child.

375
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,530
She doesn't need constant care anymore.

376
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:33,971
How about the three of us
try living by ourselves?

377
00:23:34,651 --> 00:23:35,610
Really?

378
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:39,050
That's great. I've wanted
that for a long time.

379
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:40,810
Then it's settled.

380
00:23:57,931 --> 00:23:59,691
I'll talk to your mom about it.

381
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:03,211
If you bring it up to your mom,
she will surely be heartbroken,

382
00:24:03,211 --> 00:24:05,280
feeling that her son
and daughter-in-law have betrayed her.

383
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,448
Let me do it. After all, I'm her son.

384
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,290
Even if she verbally accuses me
of being ungrateful,

385
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,971
she won't hold it
against me in her heart.

386
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,864
Okay. When the time comes,
I'll buy some gifts

387
00:24:17,472 --> 00:24:20,691
for your dad, mom and aunts

388
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:23,171
and have your mom
take them back with her.

389
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,504
Carrying many packages
is so inconvenient.

390
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:29,451
It's better to just give Mom
a big red envelope.

391
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:33,920
You don't understand.
We should give money and also buy gifts.

392
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,491
Buy many gifts.

393
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:37,931
Think about it. Your mom
will carry back lots of packages.

394
00:24:37,931 --> 00:24:40,736
How happy she will be
in front of her relatives and friends.

395
00:24:41,504 --> 00:24:44,810
This way, she will feel valued by you.

396
00:24:45,971 --> 00:24:48,810
Okay, my wife is becoming
more and more sensible.

397
00:24:49,451 --> 00:24:51,411
I am not heartless.

398
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,931
Your mom's help with the child
has truly eased our burden.

399
00:24:55,931 --> 00:24:57,810
We don't need
to be tied down by the child.

400
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,570
We have relatively more free time
and can work with peace of mind.

401
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,400
I'm very thankful to her for that.

402
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:06,050
But the cost is constant friction.

403
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:08,290
Your mom has grievances,
and I feel unhappy too.

404
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,200
So this hotel matter is an opportunity.

405
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:14,171
Make the decision decisively
to avoid endless troubles.

406
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,651
Stop playing.

407
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:30,770
Listen to me. Eat first.

408
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,891
Finish eating first, then play.
Be good. Eat it.

409
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,491
Good morning, Dad.

410
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:40,570
Good morning, Ke.

411
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:45,312
Mom, I want to discuss
something with you.

412
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:49,312
Well, I think Ke has grown up

413
00:25:49,891 --> 00:25:51,971
and has slowly adapted to
kindergarten life.

414
00:25:52,691 --> 00:25:57,731
So, Moli and I want to try and see
if we can take care of her by ourselves.

415
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,171
What do you mean?

416
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:06,931
No, it's just that our home is small.

417
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:09,290
It's quite inconvenient for us four
to be crammed together.

418
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,451
Transportation
is convenient now, isn't it?

419
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:14,336
It takes only a few hours
from our hometown to here.

420
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:18,050
When Ke misses you and my father,
I'll take her back to see you.

421
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:24,251
Alright, I understand now. I get it.

422
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:29,491
I have been washing clothes and cooking
for you all these years like a nanny.

423
00:26:29,491 --> 00:26:32,000
Ke has grown up,
and I'm not needed anymore, right?

424
00:26:32,651 --> 00:26:33,888
You want to drive me out, right?

425
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:35,130
No.

426
00:26:41,411 --> 00:26:44,171
Ke, let's eat over there. Come on.

427
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,691
Come, sit here to eat.

428
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,850
Mom, that's really not what I meant.

429
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,691
I know how hard it's been for you,
doing housework and looking after Ke

430
00:27:02,691 --> 00:27:03,648
all these years.

431
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:07,136
You took care of my dad,
then me, and now Ke too.

432
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:12,011
I think it's time for you
to rest and enjoy some peace.

433
00:27:21,251 --> 00:27:22,211
Moli.

434
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:24,731
Come out.

435
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,850
Moli, is this what you mean?

436
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,451
We both discussed it together.

437
00:27:35,451 --> 00:27:37,330
Yes, it's mainly my idea.

438
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,290
Do you really think that doing chores
and taking care of a child is easy?

439
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,152
Not easy, of course. We all know that.

440
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:48,290
But Jincao and I are Ke's parents.

441
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,464
We have to learn to take care of
our child, right?

442
00:27:51,072 --> 00:27:53,971
If we can't handle it,
we will hire a part-time worker.

443
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:59,130
A part-time worker? Do you know
how much they charge per hour?

444
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,891
80 yuan. With the little money
you two earn,

445
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,850
it's not even enough for your expenses.

446
00:28:06,491 --> 00:28:07,936
There will always be a way.

447
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:12,011
We must learn to live our days.

448
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:34,171
Fine, live your days.

449
00:28:36,651 --> 00:28:41,050
Jincao, buy a train ticket for me.
I'll go back to my hometown tomorrow.

450
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,971
By the way, I have still been feeling
a bit unwell these past two days.

451
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:51,770
Today, you accompany me
to the hospital for a check-up.

452
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,971
It is the weekend today.
Ke doesn't need to go to kindergarten.

453
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:55,211
Moli will take care of her.

454
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:57,651
Mom, their gallery is busy on weekends.

455
00:28:57,651 --> 00:28:58,731
How can she look after Ke?

456
00:28:58,731 --> 00:29:00,570
How about Ke and I
accompany you to the hospital?

457
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,130
Is the hospital a good place?
Children shouldn't go.

458
00:29:10,691 --> 00:29:15,130
Mom, I can go to the gallery
with you today.

459
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:19,651
Are you full? Come on, eat it quickly.

460
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:24,971
Mr. Tang, I am truly grateful to you

461
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,370
for agreeing to lend Desire
to us for continued exhibition.

462
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:32,451
Rest assured. After this exhibition
ends, I will package it well

463
00:29:32,451 --> 00:29:33,770
and personally deliver it to you.

464
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,891
Mom, I'll draw right here.

465
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:40,640
Here? Alright, that's fine.

466
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,491
I set up the easel for you right here.

467
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,656
Just sit here and draw.

468
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,770
Ke, I'm especially busy today.

469
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,370
Just stay here and draw.
Don't run around.

470
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,451
I'll be right over there.

471
00:29:53,451 --> 00:29:55,712
Come to me whenever you need me, okay?

472
00:29:56,451 --> 00:29:59,211
You can go to work, Mom. I will be good.

473
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,770
Here's your backpack.
Remember to drink plenty of water.

474
00:30:04,891 --> 00:30:06,171
I'm leaving.

475
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,731
Goodbye, Mom.

476
00:30:07,731 --> 00:30:08,451
Goodbye.

477
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,290
This painting is pretty good-looking.

478
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,616
This is a copy of a painting.

479
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:24,251
Of course, a good copy
can also be very collectible.

480
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,491
The wife of the artist Vermeer
didn't understand art at all.

481
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:32,330
One day, a maid named Griet

482
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,330
entered Vermeer's world.

483
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,451
Day after day, affection
grew between the two.

484
00:30:38,451 --> 00:30:40,096
Their minds clicked.

485
00:30:40,891 --> 00:30:44,171
But all this was discovered
by Vermeer's wife.

486
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:46,016
She demanded
that Griet be sent away from the house.

487
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,370
Before parting, Vermeer hoped

488
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,840
that Griet could become
the protagonist in his painting.

489
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:56,171
That's why there is
the "Girl with a Pearl Earring".

490
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,770
Mom, it's time to go to the hospital.

491
00:31:04,032 --> 00:31:05,651
Lunch isn't ready yet.

492
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:10,931
Are you going
to prepare lunch this early?

493
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:13,251
- I've got you a specialist appointment.
- What's the rush?

494
00:31:13,251 --> 00:31:14,451
Gu Moli!

495
00:31:15,411 --> 00:31:18,171
What are you doing?
Who allowed you to touch this painting?

496
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:20,290
Tell me who allowed you
to touch the painting.

497
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,976
What are you doing, Mi Na?
Why are you yelling at the child?

498
00:31:23,491 --> 00:31:27,810
Take a good look
at what your daughter has done.

499
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,770
Ke, what happened here?

500
00:31:36,411 --> 00:31:38,770
I don't know what happened.

501
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:43,171
I just thought the painting
is pretty, so I looked.

502
00:31:43,171 --> 00:31:47,770
Then someone bumped into me,
and it ended up like this.

503
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,976
Keep making it up.

504
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,491
I've never seen
such a small yet scheming child.

505
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:57,570
Aren't you just jealous
that Mr. Tang ordered the painting?

506
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,171
You can't instruct such a little child
to destroy a painting.

507
00:32:00,171 --> 00:32:01,491
Is that how you teach your child?

508
00:32:01,491 --> 00:32:02,850
Don't talk nonsense.

509
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,971
My daughter did something wrong,
and I apologize on her behalf.

510
00:32:07,971 --> 00:32:09,810
I will compensate for
the painting she ruined.

511
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:13,251
You will compensate?
Is this a matter of money?

512
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:16,570
This affects my reputation
with both the client and the painter.

513
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,251
And my performance as well.

514
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:21,290
Gu Moli, how can you be like this?

515
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,370
You brought your child to the gallery,

516
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,411
and then you ignored her.

517
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:27,530
Now this has happened,
and you're just making snide remarks.

518
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,290
Alright, stop talking.
I'll compensate, okay?

519
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,632
(Desire by Kang Yun, 2022,
oil on canvas, 60,000 yuan)

520
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,152
60,000 yuan, right? I'll compensate you
80,000 yuan. That should be enough?

521
00:32:38,016 --> 00:32:40,128
Give me your card number.
I'll transfer it to you right now.

522
00:32:45,636 --> 00:32:47,460
(Mobile Banking,
Account Balance: 18,532.19 yuan)

523
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,171
I'll transfer it to you tomorrow.

524
00:32:58,251 --> 00:32:59,330
What do you mean?

525
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,971
I will buy this painting.

526
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:12,971
Sir, you don't understand the situation.

527
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:14,891
This is a painting
that has been damaged.

528
00:33:14,891 --> 00:33:15,891
I know.

529
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:21,290
Ladies and gentlemen,

530
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,691
the wedding ceremony now begins.

531
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:28,731
Here come the bride and groom.

532
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,651
Tao.

533
00:33:35,651 --> 00:33:36,251
Stop it.

534
00:33:36,251 --> 00:33:37,090
Who are you?

535
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:37,850
What are you doing?

536
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,411
I punched you...

537
00:33:38,411 --> 00:33:38,931
Stop it.

538
00:33:38,931 --> 00:33:40,411
I punched you for Moli.

539
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:44,891
Jiang Haitao, you're cozying up to
a rich girl while being with Moli.

540
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,090
Did you even get the money
for studying abroad?

541
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,451
Are you even a man?

542
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:52,290
What does this have to do with you?

543
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:56,992
Let me tell you.
Gu Moli is now my girlfriend.

544
00:33:57,856 --> 00:34:00,370
If you don't apologize to her today,
your wedding ceremony can't be held.

545
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:12,170
Moli, I am sorry.

546
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,210
Everyone's aesthetic appreciation
for paintings is different.

547
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:35,690
Besides, I think
there's nothing perfect in this world.

548
00:34:37,371 --> 00:34:40,690
Sometimes, imperfections
also represent a unique beauty.

549
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,451
Like the strokes that were added on,

550
00:34:47,971 --> 00:34:50,851
they too have become the part
of this painting.

551
00:34:51,371 --> 00:34:52,610
I think it's quite good.

552
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,896
Sorry, sir. I have
professional integrity.

553
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,331
We do not sell
damaged paintings to clients.

554
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:08,610
I will contact Kang Yun immediately
to see if she can restore the painting.

555
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:12,451
I will also truthfully tell it
to Mr. Tang, seek his understanding,

556
00:35:12,451 --> 00:35:13,891
and see if he can accept it.

557
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,050
Yu, Xin, please help me tidy up.

558
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:17,730
Okay.

559
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:23,491
Go with me.

560
00:35:25,451 --> 00:35:28,610
Would you spend 80,000 yuan
on damaged clothing?

561
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:33,530
I just heard your unique understanding
of the painting, sir.

562
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,011
May I have your WeChat?

563
00:35:35,011 --> 00:35:35,851
No.

564
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:39,392
Tell me the truth.
Was what you just said for real?

565
00:35:40,192 --> 00:35:41,130
Yes, it is true.

566
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,250
Moli, long time no see.

567
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,411
Long time no see.

568
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,851
Could I have your WeChat?

569
00:35:52,971 --> 00:35:53,971
No.

570
00:35:59,811 --> 00:36:03,530
Mom, who is this?

571
00:36:06,491 --> 00:36:07,170
Hello.

572
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:11,050
Let's go.

573
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,570
Here.

574
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,971
Mom, what made you
think of making these?

575
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:30,931
When you were little, you once wanted
these fried foods for your birthday.

576
00:36:30,931 --> 00:36:34,944
Back then, oil was so expensive
that I didn't make them for you.

577
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:37,331
So I made you a bowl
of longevity noodles instead.

578
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:40,291
You were so angry that you
ignored me all day. Do you remember?

579
00:36:42,272 --> 00:36:49,170
Later on, I was looking for
an opportunity to make them for you.

580
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,032
At that time, I actually felt
particularly sorry for you.

581
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:57,250
But I never managed
to make them for you later.

582
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,690
Isn't today the day
I finally made it up to you?

583
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,090
You still remember. Thank you.

584
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,250
Hurry up and eat.
We're going to the hospital.

585
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,690
I'm not going to the hospital.
I'm not sick.

586
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:13,530
I just feel unhappy.

587
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,210
You did it on purpose,
having Moli take care of Ke.

588
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:20,011
Yes, I did it on purpose.
I wanted her to do it.

589
00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:23,424
She'll know how hard it is
to take care of a child.

590
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:31,648
You two schemed together
to make me go back, didn't you?

591
00:37:32,512 --> 00:37:34,208
This house was bought
by me and your dad.

592
00:37:34,811 --> 00:37:36,931
I've been taking care of
your child for six years.

593
00:37:36,931 --> 00:37:39,371
And what am I now?
Leftover food? Trash, right?

594
00:37:39,371 --> 00:37:41,050
You can throw me away.

595
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,011
Are you trying to abandon me
after I've served my purpose?

596
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,971
No, Mom. We think you're getting old

597
00:37:45,971 --> 00:37:48,210
and you should rest as well.
We don't want you to get tired.

598
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,584
Besides, Moli and I will eventually
have to live our own days.

599
00:37:52,352 --> 00:37:56,170
Living your days. Is it so easy?

600
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,851
The woman you married
is not suited for living a settled life.

601
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:00,451
Let me tell you.

602
00:38:00,451 --> 00:38:03,520
If she doesn't change
her pampered princess syndrome,

603
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,011
you'll be the one at a loss, Jincao.

604
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:11,904
Take her, for example, she's called me
mother-in-law or Ke's Grandma.

605
00:38:12,576 --> 00:38:13,971
Has she ever called me mom even once?

606
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:17,331
I don't care about that.
She can call me whatever she wants.

607
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:20,050
I'm thinking about your best interest.

608
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,371
Aren't you clear
about the grudge in her heart?

609
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:26,570
When you and Dad wanted
to buy the house,

610
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,811
why were you so determined
not to use her family's money?

611
00:38:28,811 --> 00:38:31,904
Wasn't it just because you wanted
only my name on the property deed?

612
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,210
Wasn't that a clear sign of mistrust?

613
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,851
No, it was not. Jincao, you're wrong.

614
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:38,891
You're a man, okay?

615
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:40,971
We bought you the house

616
00:38:40,971 --> 00:38:44,512
and add only your name to allow you
to stand tall in front of her.

617
00:38:45,811 --> 00:38:48,570
I won't say harsh words today.
Let's empathize with each other.

618
00:38:49,851 --> 00:38:53,811
I hope you two will love each other
for life and grow old together.

619
00:38:53,811 --> 00:38:57,491
What if, just what if something
goes wrong?

620
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:59,130
If her name was on the property deed,

621
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,690
wouldn't that be all for naught, Jincao?

622
00:39:03,891 --> 00:39:05,971
This is getting more
and more ridiculous.

623
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,050
(The gallery manager
has checked the surveillance.)

624
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:18,650
(Someone did bump into your daughter,
but the face is not clear.)

625
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:21,730
(Your daughter did draw
on it. That's a fact.)

626
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,411
(So there has to be compensation.)

627
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,130
(I think there's nothing perfect
in this world.)

628
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,848
Sometimes, imperfections
also represent a unique beauty.

629
00:39:35,371 --> 00:39:38,851
Don't be upset.
You have already tried hard enough.

630
00:39:39,851 --> 00:39:42,811
Didn't that painter also agree
to help with the restoration?

631
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:46,811
Didn't that client also agree
to take a look before making a decision?

632
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:57,451
If all else fails,
I'll help you pay the money.

633
00:39:57,451 --> 00:40:00,811
Jincao, I give up. I am no use.

634
00:40:01,371 --> 00:40:03,451
We still can't do without your mother.

635
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:06,730
Let's not let your mom leave.

636
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:11,371
It's my fault. 57.2 square meters.

637
00:40:12,331 --> 00:40:15,170
From two people living together to four.

638
00:40:15,811 --> 00:40:21,331
It's been seven years. The small space
has led to many conflicts.

639
00:40:23,411 --> 00:40:25,650
How about we move to a bigger house?

640
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:28,771
Let's change it.

641
00:40:41,451 --> 00:40:44,090
When I was young,
I never quite understood

642
00:40:44,971 --> 00:40:48,000
why adults always argued over houses.

643
00:40:50,011 --> 00:40:51,008
Now I get it.

644
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:56,610
For the sake of my marriage
and a good future life,

645
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:59,570
I must own my own house.

646
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,730
Now, I'll take the initiative
to get a new house.

647
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:12,960
(The House Exchange Campaign)

648
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:24,992
Morning.

649
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,680
Don't dress Ke in this.
The color doesn't match.

650
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:29,888
I think it matches pretty well.

651
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:36,480
Jincao, you two come back early
after work tonight.

652
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:38,011
What's the matter, Mom?

653
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:42,816
Today, I will take Ke out for a walk
and be back by 7:30 PM.

654
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:45,971
We agreed on two hours.
Make good use of the time.

655
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:49,011
Mom, can you
please not get involved in this?

656
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:50,411
How can I not get involved?

657
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:54,411
I must be involved in any spending.

658
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:58,050
You two, 800 yuan for two hours.

659
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,291
If you two go to a hotel again,

660
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:00,451
do you believe I will go there

661
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,331
and make sure you lose face?

662
00:42:04,411 --> 00:42:06,170
Ke, have you finished eating?

663
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,250
Yes, I'm done.

664
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,250
Let's go to kindergarten. Let's go.

665
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,090
Drink lots of water.

666
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:13,690
Okay, bye, Dad. Bye, Mom.

667
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,210
Bye.

668
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,090
Bye.

669
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,130
Bye.

670
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:19,570
Let's go. Let me open
the door for you. Go.

671
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:21,730
Let's do it.

672
00:42:28,891 --> 00:42:33,824
Look at this, two subways
and a key elementary school branch.

673
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,891
It's newly built
and just 53,000 yuan per square meter.

674
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,570
Okay, as long as you think it's good.

675
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,971
We must make things clear, okay?

676
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:46,610
For selling current house,
you sort it out with your parents.

677
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,192
I'll go ask my parents for a loan.

678
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,371
We two will trade up for a bigger house.

679
00:42:50,371 --> 00:42:53,090
You are the master of the house,
and I am the mistress.

680
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,891
Both our parents are guests. Understand?

681
00:42:55,891 --> 00:42:58,650
Space can be shared,
but not the right to make decisions.

682
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:02,464
Even if you don't contribute a penny,
you're still the mistress of the house.

683
00:43:03,232 --> 00:43:04,570
Like you're so rich.

684
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,451
What's wrong?

685
00:43:12,451 --> 00:43:13,411
Hold on.

686
00:43:22,771 --> 00:43:25,371
Are you really worried about
your mom tailing us?
