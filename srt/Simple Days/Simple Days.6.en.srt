19
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:41,172
Mom, check out Auntie's WeChat Moments.

20
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:46,492
She is showing off.

21
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:50,851
Her purse...

22
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:55,212
When did she post it?

23
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:56,032
I haven't seen it.

24
00:02:56,032 --> 00:02:58,816
She blocked us.
Lingxiao forwarded it to me.

25
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:03,012
That's the real purse. She took it.

26
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:09,892
What's wrong with her?
How can she take the purse?

27
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:13,280
She caused so much trouble
and just left without a word.

28
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:16,212
Why are you nagging again?

29
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:20,032
What's wrong? Who left?

30
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:26,208
We've wronged Moli.

(Shanya, Shanghai Telecom)

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,980
(Jincao)

33
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:20,051
Jincao, I'm waiting for the train.

34
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:24,608
Tell your mom I'm fine. Don't worry.

35
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:30,528
Hello? I have poor reception.
I have to board now.

36
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:35,584
She said poor reception and hung up.

37
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,171
I'll talk to her later.

38
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:43,411
You have to talk to Moli about it.

39
00:04:43,411 --> 00:04:45,408
It's all my fault.

40
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,212
Alright, Mom. I'll tell them

41
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:50,400
both of you
will visit in person to apologize.

42
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:52,491
Alright.

43
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:55,136
What? No.

44
00:04:56,452 --> 00:04:57,376
Never embarrass the elders.

45
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:01,184
Your auntie may have
made a mistake, but she's an elder.

46
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:04,096
You can't embarrass the elders

47
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,656
just to help your wife vent her anger.

48
00:05:07,552 --> 00:05:09,184
Didn't we embarrass my mother-in-law?

49
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,012
Isn't she an elder, too?

50
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:12,851
She hurt her leg and got humiliated.

51
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,731
Don't you care?

52
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:14,784
Why would I care?

53
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:17,376
It's Moli's fault.

54
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:19,424
She had the idea
of getting a counterfeit.

55
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:21,344
Your mom is a housewife.

56
00:05:21,344 --> 00:05:23,136
How can she tell if the purse is real?

57
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:25,472
Moli came up with the wrong idea.

58
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:26,892
You...

59
00:05:28,692 --> 00:05:32,320
Son, it's all my fault.

60
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,851
I'll apologize
to your in-laws in person.

61
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:37,632
What? No! Don't humiliate yourself.

62
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:38,772
You...

63
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:43,932
What's your problem?

64
00:05:43,932 --> 00:05:46,496
What's your problem? Sure, go.

65
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:53,440
Oh, my. This is unbelievable.

66
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,392
I've never seen someone like that.

67
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:58,304
And she happens
to be our in-laws' relative.

68
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:02,560
She came to visit and stole a purse!

69
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:05,216
Birds of a feather flock together.

70
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:09,452
Gu, we raised our girl as a princess.

71
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:13,344
But she ended up marrying
into such a family. What do we do?

72
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:16,851
It's my fault.
I should have known better.

73
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:18,464
Calm down.

74
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:21,611
How can I calm down?

75
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:26,080
Moli, I'm telling you seriously.

76
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:28,736
We must stick to our principles.

77
00:06:29,332 --> 00:06:32,576
You're not going back to that place.

78
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:41,731
(The mystery session ended.
But the drama continues.)

79
00:06:42,272 --> 00:06:43,680
(We've solved the "case".)

80
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:47,332
(But we've grown distant,
and the conflict has deepened.)

81
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:52,384
(I've never been
so disappointed in Jincao's family.)

82
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:09,440
An art agent like you
has to do the heavy labor

83
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:11,651
all by yourself?

84
00:07:11,651 --> 00:07:14,012
Thanks to your mother,
it's the end of the month,

85
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:16,160
and I still haven't sold anything.

86
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,776
Heavy labor is all I can do
to not get fired.

87
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:32,608
I know you don't want to
hear me explain at the moment.

88
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:36,416
I should have
stood up for you and told them

89
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,080
you aren't that kind of person.

90
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:40,320
What kind of person am I?

91
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:43,584
Please, stop being mad.

92
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:51,008
Don't try to lure me.

93
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:54,528
How am I luring you? I've missed you.

94
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:59,456
So what? You can't even protect me.

95
00:08:11,851 --> 00:08:13,051
Hurry up.

96
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:15,171
Hello, ladies.
Do you have an appointment?

97
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:18,372
Good afternoon, ladies. I'm Mi Na,

98
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,576
the top art agent here
at Flying Bird Gallery.

99
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:21,452
(Flying Bird Gallery)

100
00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:24,611
What would you like to see?
I can show you the art pieces.

101
00:08:24,611 --> 00:08:26,132
We're here for Gu Moli.

102
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:30,932
Moli.

103
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:31,692
My mom?

104
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:36,412
Moli.

105
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,332
Mom, what are you doing here?

106
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:40,128
Look who are here.

107
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:43,971
Auntie Xuefang, Auntie Cui,
and Auntie Tian.

108
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:45,851
- Hello, Moli.
- Hello, Moli.

109
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:47,891
They've heard so much about you.

110
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:50,851
Take them around the gallery.

111
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:59,812
Hurry up. They're going back
to their hometown tonight.

112
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:02,052
This way, please.

113
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:03,292
Alright.

114
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,611
This way, please.

115
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:05,851
Hello, Auntie.

116
00:09:10,052 --> 00:09:11,652
Here's our brochure.

117
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,011
Feel free to browse through
the art pieces.

118
00:09:15,332 --> 00:09:18,891
Xuefang, abstractionism.
What do you think?

119
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,091
Look at the colors and the vibe.

120
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:22,172
Listen, Xuefang.

121
00:09:22,172 --> 00:09:24,611
Imagine this on the wall
in the two-story living room

122
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:26,851
of the new villa you got.

123
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:28,928
It's going to look amazing.

124
00:09:31,532 --> 00:09:33,251
Mom, what are you doing?

125
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:35,212
Are you trying to boost my sales?

126
00:09:35,212 --> 00:09:37,692
Stop selling them those pricy paintings.

127
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:40,332
T-They may break up with you.

128
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:43,452
Don't say that. They're my besties.

129
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:46,332
I've made everything clear with them.

130
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:49,376
We're here to impress people.
We've got your back.

131
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,851
What do you think, Xuefang?

132
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:57,932
Yulan, this is totally my style.
I'll take it.

133
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,251
You've got a great taste.

134
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:02,720
Yulan, I'll get this painting
of the white horse.

135
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,491
You have a great taste as well.

136
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:07,552
I'll take the hand sculpture.

137
00:10:07,552 --> 00:10:08,971
I kind of like it.

138
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:11,412
It's going to look nice
in our little garden.

139
00:10:13,332 --> 00:10:16,452
Aunties, please come here.

140
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:18,212
Mom, stay here.

141
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:23,452
Please hear me out.

142
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:25,728
Before you make any decisions,

143
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:30,176
please allow me to tell you about
the ideas and techniques,

144
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:33,251
as well as the stories,

145
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:36,532
and economic and artistic values
of these art pieces.

146
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:40,412
I hope they can speak for themselves.

147
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:42,812
And I hope you can hear them
express themselves

148
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:46,652
and fall in love with them
before purchasing.

149
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:51,292
- I'll get it.
- Bring me the invoice.

150
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:55,572
Me too. Bring me one.

151
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,532
Stay out of it.

152
00:10:58,731 --> 00:11:02,011
I can't let my besties look down on me.

153
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:06,771
That's it. I'll take the one
next to the white horse.

154
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:10,131
I have to show some actual support.

155
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:11,771
I'll get it. Bring me the invoice.

156
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:16,652
Aunties, please follow me.

157
00:11:16,652 --> 00:11:17,371
Okay.

158
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:19,200
Thank you, Auntie.

159
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,812
No problem.

160
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:20,491
Thank you.

161
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:23,131
Thank you, Mom.

162
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,131
Auntie Tian.

163
00:11:30,971 --> 00:11:31,936
This is for you.

164
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:33,292
Thank you.

165
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,332
My pleasure.

166
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:39,611
I saw you bought the painting
of white horse. What a great taste.

167
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:40,891
Thank you.

168
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:43,091
I've always been the agent

169
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:45,131
of the painter Xu Yueping.

170
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:48,320
May I have your WeChat?

171
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:51,212
Feel free to contact me
if you're interested

172
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:52,932
in his future artwork.

173
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:56,971
We'll only get paintings from Gu Moli.

174
00:11:58,172 --> 00:12:00,812
Thank you so much, Moli.

175
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:03,616
You held a mini-lecture for us.

176
00:12:03,616 --> 00:12:05,812
We've done so much shopping in Shanghai.

177
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:08,371
This is the most elegant experience.

178
00:12:08,371 --> 00:12:10,851
I'd call it a journey of culture.

179
00:12:10,851 --> 00:12:12,692
- Yeah, a journey of culture.
- A journey of culture.

180
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:14,412
Thank you for your support.

181
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:17,652
Here are your contracts and receipts.

182
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,572
Thank you.

183
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,251
Thank you.

184
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:23,891
Ms. Wu, here's yours.

185
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:24,891
Thank you.

186
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:27,771
Rest assured.
The art pieces you've purchased

187
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:30,080
will be delivered with care in a month.

188
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:34,212
Alright, I am a bit hungry.

189
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,131
Shall we have some afternoon tea?

190
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,332
- Alright.
- Alright.

191
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:39,296
There's a trendy restaurant nearby.

192
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:42,112
Have a try. It's on Ms. Wu.

193
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:43,648
Of course. Let's go.

194
00:12:43,648 --> 00:12:44,224
Let's go.

195
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:47,744
See you, Aunties.

196
00:12:53,251 --> 00:12:54,932
So happy.

197
00:12:56,212 --> 00:13:00,064
You know, I love their cakes.

198
00:13:00,652 --> 00:13:02,491
I love sweets.

199
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:05,091
Bye, Aunties.

200
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:08,052
Come home early. Go back.

201
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:20,224
Come on, stop staring. They're gone.

202
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:24,512
I didn't see that coming. Impressive.

203
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:27,904
I saw it. My mom ignored you. So what?

204
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:32,512
I'm afraid it's even harder
for you to come home now.

205
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:35,360
You still don't know me.

206
00:13:35,971 --> 00:13:38,720
Have I ever let my parents
affect our relationship?

207
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,731
What happened today won't have anything
to do with my decision.

208
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:44,771
Gifts blind the eyes.

209
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:49,172
The truth is our parents
expect us to pay back.

210
00:13:49,731 --> 00:13:52,512
Both mine and yours.

211
00:13:53,052 --> 00:13:54,812
Still being petty?

212
00:13:55,731 --> 00:13:57,888
Fine, tell me what I should do.

213
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:01,091
Should I tell my mom
that I don't need her help,

214
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,091
cancel the deals and ask the gallery

215
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:05,011
to wire the money back?

216
00:14:05,532 --> 00:14:07,932
Or you're going to
make your parents and your auntie

217
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:10,652
apologize in person? Can you do that?

218
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:16,251
No, I can't. All I can do
is to love you.

219
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:23,491
Honey, come home with me.

220
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:26,212
Not yet.

221
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:55,932
- Give me the red envelope.
- Thank you.

222
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,491
Miss, this is for you.

223
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:02,371
What is it?

224
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:05,731
You paid for Mr. Wang the night before.

225
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:08,412
He told me to
give it to you. Take a look.

226
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:13,292
He put 200 yuan extra to get you a drink
as a token of gratitude.

227
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:14,944
Who's giving out cash these days?

228
00:15:15,488 --> 00:15:16,771
I almost forgot about it.

229
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:17,932
Keep it.

230
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:18,812
Thank you.

231
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:30,752
What a small world. Got the money?

232
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:34,932
Waiter, a Bowmore, please.

233
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:35,812
Okay.

234
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:36,971
Take it back.

235
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:40,000
I did you a small favor.
It's too much for interest.

236
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:45,091
May I have your WeChat?

237
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:48,011
There's no need for that.
You paid me back.

238
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:51,332
Sorry, I was drunk that night.

239
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,652
I forgot I set up a restriction.

240
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,424
I can only add you through the QR code.

241
00:15:56,491 --> 00:15:58,011
So troublesome.

242
00:15:58,011 --> 00:15:59,251
What?

243
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:02,272
I said you are trouble.
And your phone as well.

244
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:05,824
I thought you were a fraud.
Take the money back.

245
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:08,172
May I have your WeChat, please?

246
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:11,264
I think it's okay for a guy
to set up restrictions.

247
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:16,544
But it's not okay for him to insist on
adding someone on WeChat.

248
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:18,848
I sincerely apologize.

249
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:23,040
May I have your WeChat, please?

250
00:16:32,172 --> 00:16:35,172
Do people get divorced because
they share different values?

251
00:16:36,172 --> 00:16:41,760
Because of domestic violence,
adultery, or financial issues?

252
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:46,176
Do they get divorced because
they no longer love each other?

253
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:50,172
Maybe there's one more explanation.

254
00:16:50,851 --> 00:16:53,920
They may get divorced out of love.

255
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:56,416
Sounds weird, right?

256
00:16:58,332 --> 00:17:01,088
But when your life is at a standstill

257
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:04,832
with irreconcilable family issues,

258
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:10,528
and when your marriage
is held hostage by demands,

259
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:16,960
a divorce may be
the solution to all problems.

260
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:19,232
Does it really work?

261
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:27,251
I'd like to try it.

262
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:36,448
(Strategic Divorce)

263
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:04,892
Mom. Dad.

264
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:16,892
(Jincao, my son.
After a long night's contemplation,)

265
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,776
(your mom and I have decided to leave,)

266
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:23,692
(so that you can reflect on yourself.)

267
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:27,932
(I couldn't help but worry
when I saw you in a mess)

268
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:32,412
(after I came to Shanghai.)

269
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:37,092
(Remember, you've worked hard
to achieve what you've achieved.)

270
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:41,491
(But still, you couldn't have made it
without our support.)

271
00:18:42,172 --> 00:18:43,771
(So be grateful.)

272
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:48,811
(We left you a week's dishes
in the fridge.)

273
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:55,452
(Also, your mom knows you like stews.
So she made a big pot of it.)

274
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,331
(It's enough for a few days.)

275
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:06,011
Way to go. You were still
lecturing me before you left.

276
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,360
You created a mess.

277
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,400
How am I going to face Moli's parents?

278
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:32,011
(Ke's Grandma)
(Just so you know, Moli,)

279
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:34,132
(Ke's Grandpa and I are going home.)

280
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,971
(You can go home tonight.)

281
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:39,771
(I left the keys in the fruit bowl.
Put it away.)

282
00:19:59,092 --> 00:20:01,888
(Department of Civil Affairs)
(You applied for divorce one month ago.)

283
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:04,832
(The 30-day cooling-off period is due.)

284
00:20:04,832 --> 00:20:06,400
(If you insist on getting a divorce,)

285
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:10,560
(please visit us
for paperwork in three days.)

00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:22,331
Room 1010. Right now.

287
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,731
Why are we in a hotel again?

288
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:51,712
My parents left. Come home with me.

289
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:55,212
Hug me.

290
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:01,852
What's wrong?

291
00:21:03,452 --> 00:21:07,264
It's been a month.
Let's get the divorce paper done.

292
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:14,092
I can't reach Moli on the phone.

293
00:21:14,092 --> 00:21:16,032
I came to the gallery
and she was on leave.

294
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:17,792
Zhu Jincao's phone is off.

295
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:21,792
She's not with you?

296
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:24,864
(Flying Bird Gallery)

297
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:29,280
Auntie, calm down.
Let me see what I can do.

298
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,816
Excuse me.

299
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,520
Are you also here for Gu Moli?

300
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,224
Who are you?

301
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,639
My sister-in-law is not here?

302
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:43,799
Who are you?

303
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:48,399
Huang Qianniu, Zhu Jincao's cousin.

304
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:52,440
Huang Qianniu? Your mom took the purse
and got Moli into trouble, huh?

305
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,200
Keep it down. She told you everything.

306
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:59,440
I guess you're
my sister-in-law's bestie.

307
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,200
Stop calling her that.

308
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,319
Tell me. I can't reach them right now.

309
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,536
Do you know where they are?

310
00:22:05,536 --> 00:22:06,520
Well...

311
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,992
You either know or you don't.
Tell me the truth.

312
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:11,240
I wouldn't come if I knew.

313
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,712
I'm here to apologize to her in person

314
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,824
and on my mom's behalf.

315
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,480
You've decided?

316
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:29,799
Yeah.

317
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:35,159
My auntie was ridiculous.
My parents hurt you.

318
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:38,639
They owe you
and your parents an apology.

319
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:43,879
You have every reason to be mad.
But I can't divorce you.

320
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,799
That's our only way out of it.

321
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,920
Moli, are you bored of me?

322
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,119
Of course not.

323
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,136
Then why?

324
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,040
Think about it.

325
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,720
What got our marriage to this point?

326
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,040
Our parents? The house? Money?

327
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,359
None of those. It was our attitude.

328
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,960
We allowed our parents
to interfere in our marriage.

329
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,960
We're like unweaned, overgrown babies.

330
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,639
We have too little freedom.

331
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:19,072
It won't end unless we get divorced.

332
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,560
I admit that our marriage
is facing trouble.

333
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,440
But a divorce is not the only solution.

334
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,040
We can make things right
as long as we work together.

335
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:36,280
For how long? One year?
Two years? Forever?

336
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,280
Haven't we tried before?

337
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,520
It only created more problems.

338
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,040
What did we gain?

339
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,960
Do you know
what it means to get divorced?

340
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,424
It means we're no longer married
and our relationship

341
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,599
is no longer legally protected.

342
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,304
You'll be my ex-wife.
I'll be your ex-husband.

343
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,736
The relationship between all of us
will change dramatically.

344
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,000
I don't get it.
It's not like we don't love each other.

345
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,760
You love me and I love you.

346
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:14,560
Why do we have to get divorced?

347
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,368
I know you've been stressed
and have suffered

348
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,800
for me and this family.

349
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,064
You've never asked for anything from me.

350
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:27,072
You've never raised your voice at me.

351
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,680
Marrying you is the best decision
I have made in my life.

352
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,440
Because I married for love.

353
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:37,599
To this very day, I still believe

354
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:40,480
that you're the man who can protect me.

355
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,000
It's not the interference
of parents I'm afraid of now.

356
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,920
Nor am I afraid
of that small one-bedroom apartment.

357
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,359
What I'm afraid of is
that one day we'll forget love.

358
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:53,559
I fear for our immensely precious love

359
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,488
being eroded away by life bit by bit.

360
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,496
What about Ke?

361
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,984
Do you think she'll be happy
to see us fighting

362
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,288
all day long?

363
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,536
Once we get divorced, we don't have to
please our parents anymore.

364
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,480
Nor do we have to
accept any interference.

365
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,480
But we're still in love.
We're still Ke's parents.

366
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,504
Nothing will change.

367
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,879
So we're pretending to be divorced.

368
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,839
Why can't we just
fabricate a divorce certificate?

369
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,799
No, we have to do it for real.

370
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,088
They'll go back to normal
if they find out

371
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,359
that we're faking it.

372
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,080
We're getting a divorce to tell them

373
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,024
that they don't get to say anything

374
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,359
about our lives anymore.

375
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:45,599
You sure you want to do this?
Will you think twice?

376
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,600
Jincao, trust me.

377
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,100
This is the best way
to protect our simple life.

378
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,440
But you have to promise
that the divorce is for show.

379
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,599
We took vows to look after each other.

380
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:06,879
You have to love me forever. Only me.

381
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:17,120
I promise. I'll always love you
even if we get divorced.

Why are you so sticky?

393
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,240
You're following me to the company?

394
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,384
I just want to explain to you.

395
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,152
My mom didn't mean to steal the purse.

396
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:12,000
No one was home,

397
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,079
so she just took it out
for some photos to show off.

398
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:17,280
But the zipper broke,
and she got terrified.

399
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,559
She didn't know what to do.
So I offered her an idea.

400
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:22,879
I said we could get a fabricate
as a substitute for now.

401
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:25,559
I thought my sister-in-law
wouldn't find out

402
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,399
because she had so many purses.

403
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:30,400
I'd buy a real one once I could use

404
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,319
my credit card.

405
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,760
I have no idea what you were thinking.

406
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,440
It's my fault.

407
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,464
I'll show your mom some respect.

408
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,639
You're a grown-up. Is that how
a grown-up handles things?

409
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:45,079
Liu, I was calling you.

410
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:45,760
What's wrong?

411
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,639
Mr. Ma has been hospitalized
with a heart attack.

412
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:51,639
He can't give the opening speech
at the Investment and Development Forum

413
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:52,680
of the Education Industry.

414
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,040
Did you contact other guests?

415
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,119
Yeah, I did. They're all occupied.
It's the season for forums.

416
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:59,240
They're all fully booked.

417
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,319
Go to the hospital first
and look after Mr. Ma.

418
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,960
I'll handle the rest.

419
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,040
Alright.

420
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:07,040
Sister.

421
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,000
Will you just leave?

422
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,064
I can't. I didn't mean to pry,
but I heard that you need a lecturer.

423
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:15,712
I can help you with that.

424
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,879
You know Wang Lingxiao?

425
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:22,200
The famous and mysterious
financial investment analyst.

426
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,319
Yeah, I know him. From Weekly Finance.

427
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,799
I can get him to give
the opening speech. What do you say?

428
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,119
Can you?

429
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,839
What a small world. It's fate.

430
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,520
God is helping me repent.

431
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:38,760
Wang Lingxiao is my eldest cousin.
Zhu Jincao is the second eldest.

432
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,760
I'm the youngest of us all.

433
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,159
Wang Lingxiao's mom
is the eldest sister of my mom.

434
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:48,240
Zhu Jincao's mom
is the second eldest of the three.

435
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,159
They're sisters by blood.

436
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:55,960
We're so close to each other
that we're like brothers by blood.

437
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,920
Finally, we got divorced.

438
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:10,599
Take off the ring.

439
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,559
No.

440
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,720
We have to make it real.

441
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,159
Okay.

442
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,216
(PRC, Divorce Certificate)

443
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,559
Zhu Jincao, you're single now.

444
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,200
I wish you all the romance.

445
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,720
No way!

446
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,839
Gu Moli, I'll keep a close eye
on you from now on.

447
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:37,280
Can you?

448
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:45,520
Where did you go?
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

449
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,119
Liu was looking for you, too.

450
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,280
Why are you packing?

451
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:08,192
Did you change your mind just

452
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,024
because Zhu Jincao went to your gallery
and sweet-talked you?

453
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,000
This is not allowed.
His parents didn't apologize.

454
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,016
They didn't visit us. You can't give in.

455
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,280
Moli.

456
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,168
Your mom is talking to you. Answer her.

457
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,432
Right, I have something to tell you.

458
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,680
I got divorced.

459
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:48,192
(Divorce Certificate)

460
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:11,680
Good. That's good.

461
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:16,720
Don't worry. Mom and Dad
will take care of you and Ke

462
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,720
from all aspects.

463
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,920
Yeah, the divorce
marks the beginning of a new life.

464
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,720
We're your strong support. Don't worry.

465
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:35,960
Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Mom.

466
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,208
Jincao and I decided
to spend the weekend together with Ke.

467
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,016
It's partly to commemorate our marriage

468
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:49,344
and partly to create
a nice memory for Ke.

469
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,119
Mom, Dad, I have to go. See you.

470
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,832
Grandpa and Grandma left.
Our home is so neat.

471
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,799
Look, even she got used to

472
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:30,480
the apartment being crammed.

473
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,280
That pile of delivery boxes
at the entrance, the clothes rack,

474
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,599
this tacky sofa cover,

475
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:41,839
and these boxes. I'm so sick of them.

476
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:44,832
My mom is used to living a thrifty life.

477
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,799
What happened to the art style I chose?

478
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,839
It's completely wiped out.

479
00:32:52,516 --> 00:32:54,048
I don't get it.

480
00:32:54,048 --> 00:32:56,640
How did a classy woman like me
put up with it for so long?

481
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,920
What's so funny?

482
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,639
Nothing. Let's do a thorough cleaning.

483
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:05,319
Restore the apartment
to the classy and warm Moli style.

484
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,079
Let's do it.

485
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:06,760
Let's do it.

486
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,280
Let's go.

487
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,680
It's amazing.

488
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,760
It's amazing.

489
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,159
What are we going to do?
Want to watch a movie?

490
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:27,240
Yeah, let's watch a movie.

491
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,359
Are you happy to be
with Daddy and Mommy today?

492
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:33,280
Yeah!

493
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,240
But I'm even happier
with my grandparents here.

494
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,159
You're such a good girl.

495
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:44,920
But our apartment
is too small for so many people.

496
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,159
Then I'll get a big house
once I grow up.

497
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,879
I'll live with you

498
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:53,200
and my grandparents together.

499
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,720
Alright, I'll wait
to enjoy the big house.

500
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,879
Okay!

501
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,976
You've been happy
since we got the certificate.

502
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:09,520
We've achieved our preliminary goal.
Aren't you happy?

503
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,040
What certificate?

504
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,279
Just eat your snacks.

505
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:18,656
No more questions. Let's watch a movie.

506
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,520
Shall we?

507
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,199
Yeah.

508
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,079
Let's go.

509
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,119
Let's go.

510
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,440
Let's go.

511
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,679
Let's go.

512
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,599
Go to bed.

513
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,440
Gu.

514
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,480
I was so upset when I saw our daughter

515
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:17,040
with that divorce certificate.

516
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,520
Our daughter is so excellent.

517
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,159
How did she end up like this?

518
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,956
From now on,

519
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,640
our daughter is a divorced woman.

520
00:35:57,759 --> 00:36:01,000
She's divorced. So what?

521
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,400
There are so many
divorced women out there.

522
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:07,759
I swear I'll help
my daughter live a decent life

523
00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:10,199
with Ke after the divorce.

524
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:13,520
I want them happier than before.

525
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,040
I'll prove to the Zhu family

526
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,520
that they should regret it.

527
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:02,624
- Ke finally fell asleep.
- We should go to bed.

528
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:06,000
We can finally sleep
in the bedroom tonight.

529
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,320
It's going to be like that.

530
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,719
This is the most inexpensive
activity tonight.

531
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,880
It saved us 800 yuan.

532
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,200
Yeah, that's right.

533
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,639
Hello, Liu.

534
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,240
I assume you're calling
about my cousin for the forum.

535
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,079
Yeah. Everything is settled?

536
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:00,239
Rest assured.
I promise I'll get it done.

537
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,496
Wang Lingxiao
will contact you by tomorrow night.

538
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,440
Are you sure?

539
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,248
Trust me.

540
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:09,880
Alright, I'll wait for him. Thank you.

541
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,736
No problem. My pleasure. See you.

542
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:21,376
Lingxiao, it's time
to build up our reputation.

543
00:38:30,724 --> 00:38:32,192
(Divorce Certificate)

544
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,784
I'm free.

545
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,239
That's enough.
You don't have to carry it around.

546
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:40,279
It makes you so happy to see it, huh?

547
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:45,800
Why don't you just shout out loud?
"I'm divorced. I'm single.

548
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,360
Is there any cool guy who wants me?"

549
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,040
You think I'll be scared? Listen.

550
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,199
My beautiful and free life starts now.

551
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,840
I'm pretty. I have a cute kid.

552
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,200
My boyfriend Zhu Jincao
is handsome and loyal.

553
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,719
He may not be so rich at this point,

554
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:03,840
but he's already perfect for me.

555
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,040
Are you done? Don't get carried away.

556
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,456
I still think you're too irrational.

557
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:15,040
With this, you're no longer
husband and wife

558
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,880
from the legal perspective.

559
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,480
I have to warn you.

560
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,279
Watch your boyfriend.
Someone may approach him.

561
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:23,800
Are you serious? I should be worried?

562
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Someone may approach me.
He should be worried.

563
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:29,279
Does he have a cousin?

564
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:33,040
Wang Lingxiao,
the commentator of Weekly Finance?

565
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,119
You know him?

566
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:36,832
I've heard of him.
I may need to work with him.

567
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,800
Do you need my help?

568
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,759
I wanted to ask you for help.

569
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:44,679
But you're divorced,
so don't disturb your ex

570
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,480
and his family.

571
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,960
It's okay.

572
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,239
I'm more than happy
to disturb my boyfriend Zhu Jincao.

573
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:55,424
Never mind. I don't want you to get
carried away and make another mistake.

574
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:03,119
I've been calling you but your phone
was off. Where did you go?

575
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,079
Take a guess.

576
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,000
Tell me the truth.
Did you do something shady again?

577
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,199
Waiter.

578
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,840
What's wrong?

579
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,000
I packed the food I made for tomorrow.

580
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,840
The fridge is full.

581
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,312
This stewing pot is too big.

582
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,488
Throw away the food.

583
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:25,760
Wash the pot and take out the trash.

584
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,239
Alright.

585
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:33,920
What's going on?

586
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,880
W-Who are you?

587
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,960
Who am I?
This is my home. Give it to me.

588
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,279
Who are you?

589
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,416
Mom, why did you come back?

590
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,528
You're asking me?

591
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:47,679
Thankfully, I came back.

592
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,960
Otherwise, you'll empty this place.

593
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,920
Ke's Grandma.

594
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,320
Grandma.

595
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,119
Ke.

596
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,440
Why did you come back?

597
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,079
Because I missed you.

598
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,199
Did you miss me?

599
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,239
Yeah.

600
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,480
I missed you.

601
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,199
I was gone for a few days.

602
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,840
And you already got a cleaning lady?

603
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,320
Moli, don't you have hands?

604
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,360
Do you have to hire someone
to clean up such a small place?

605
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,320
How much is this going to cost?

606
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,239
I saw it on my way back.

607
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:38,880
You threw away the things
I gathered over the years.

608
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:44,320
This sofa cover is just fine.
Is it broken?

609
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,488
No, it just doesn't
match with the decoration.

610
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:53,040
It doesn't match?
Do you know why I got this?

611
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,119
You paid a few thousand for this sofa.

612
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,696
I have to protect it with a cover.

613
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,360
This is how you live?

614
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,360
And this pot of stew.

615
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,719
You haven't even taken a bite.
Why are you throwing it away?

616
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:10,440
We forgot to eat it. It went bad.

617
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,759
It went bad?
Why didn't you put it in the fridge?

618
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:18,848
You're grown-ups.
How can you waste food like this?

619
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,840
Could you please keep it down?

620
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,759
Ke is right in the room.

621
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:28,119
I bought the house.
I can speak as loudly as I want.

622
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:30,639
Yeah, you're right. This is your house.

623
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:31,880
Do whatever you want.

624
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,800
Jincao and I got divorced, anyway.

625
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:44,360
What? Divorced? What do you mean?

626
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,599
Who's divorced?

627
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,520
We are divorced.

628
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,320
We wanted to throw a party
and end this marriage happily.

629
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,279
But you came back
and started throwing a tantrum.

630
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,960
We didn't even finish the movie.

631
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,719
You got divorced for a purse?

632
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:59,800
Listen to yourself.
Is it about the purse?

633
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,952
The purse revealed
the true nature of people.

634
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,079
That was my fault. I've apologized.

635
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,279
You can't hold on to that

636
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:08,679
and divorce my son.

637
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:12,079
That's enough. Let's call it even.

638
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,400
I have nothing to do
with you now, anyway.

639
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,320
Jincao, show her
the divorce certificate.

640
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,800
Son, are you really divorced?

641
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:37,480
