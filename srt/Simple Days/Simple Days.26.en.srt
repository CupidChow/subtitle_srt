19
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:54,259
I arranged for the meeting
between Moli and Zhou Yu.

20
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:55,819
I did it intentionally.

21
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,539
Because I knew

22
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,100
Moli has harbored the dream
of becoming an artist.

23
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,779
I knew that she has been
good at painting.

24
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:03,179
I think I've always

25
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:05,220
felt guilty about hurting her

26
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,860
and I've been looking

27
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:09,779
to make amends.

28
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,740
That's why I pulled the strings.

29
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:13,420
I think

30
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,339
with Moli's talent

31
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:17,820
and Zhou Yu's resources,

32
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,619
Moli will achieve something great.

33
00:02:20,779 --> 00:02:21,820
When I heard

34
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,580
she was going to have an art exhibition,

35
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:25,219
I was so thrilled.

36
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,980
I didn't expect

37
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,820
introducing Zhou Yu to Moli

38
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,499
almost got her into trouble.

39
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:32,899
I lacked

40
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:35,339
the professional insight of a lawyer.

41
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:37,540
But fortunately, you were there.

42
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,860
You found the problem in time

43
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:41,300
and gathered evidence.

44
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,939
You put this to an end in time

45
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,659
and avoided serious trouble.

46
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:47,980
I'm responsible for what has happened

47
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,939
to Moli.

48
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,420
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:54,379
I see.

50
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,099
You meant well.

51
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,420
I don't blame you.

52
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,580
I think Moli won't blame you either.

53
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,460
Jincao,

54
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,140
what you did proved

55
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,820
Moli had made the right choice.

56
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:07,140
No matter what,

57
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,779
you'll always put her safety first

58
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,059
and protect her.

59
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:14,339
That's quite rare.

60
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:16,499
I will delete both of your phone numbers

61
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,420
once everything is settled

62
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,379
and disappear from your life.

63
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:24,379
You are everything she needs.

64
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,219
I see.

65
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:28,499
I have to go now.

66
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,099
Jincao,

67
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:32,820
Moli is a good woman.

68
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,899
You deserve to be together.

69
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,700
I hope you two never part.

70
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,300
Thank you.

71
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,939
I have made it clear in court.

72
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:00,219
This house is mine.

73
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:03,619
The house in Shanghai is also mine.

74
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,899
I know you too well.

75
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,460
You don't have a place

76
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,219
to stay once you leave.

77
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,580
Therefore,

78
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,260
you can live here

79
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,580
after the divorce.

80
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,020
I'll take the big room.

81
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,659
You'll take the small room.

82
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,140
Then I'll take the small room.

83
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,859
You can have the big one.

84
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,419
No need.

85
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:37,419
You are always

86
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,500
trying to act tough.

87
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:41,779
I'll move out

88
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:43,219
if you insist on it.

89
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:44,260
I'll rent a place.

90
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:45,739
You can live here.

91
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,180
Here are

92
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:06,539
all our savings.

93
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,899
I've withdrawn them all.

94
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,620
I cashed out everything

95
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,779
from these two accounts.

96
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,380
It's 73,651 yuan in total.

97
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,899
Seventy thousand yuan for you.

98
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,219
Three thousand yuan for me.

99
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,419
We are getting a divorce.

100
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:41,020
We must settle the accounts.

101
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,299
I don't want it.

102
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:46,219
You're trying to act tough again.

103
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:49,899
You're retired from kindergarten,

104
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,380
with a pension
of 1,000 yuan or so every month.

105
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:55,460
How are you going to live?

106
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:59,140
Take these 70,000 yuan

107
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,580
in case of any emergency.

108
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,219
You wouldn't have to
ask your son for help.

109
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,260
How are you going to make it

110
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,779
with only 3,000 yuan?

111
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,620
Don't worry about me.

112
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:15,820
I was the head of the publicity dept.
of a machinery factory.

113
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,620
I get a pension

114
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,060
of almost 4,000 yuan.

115
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,339
Can you compare with me?

116
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,779
Just take it.

117
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,419
Hurry up.

118
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:52,020
The accounts are settled.

119
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:55,539
There are a few things I'd like to say.

120
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,659
Zhang Shanya.

121
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:04,700
We've lived together for 36 years.

122
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:11,339
You know what's on my mind.

123
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,460
And I know

124
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:17,700
what's on your mind,

125
00:07:18,859 --> 00:07:20,859
why you're divorcing me,

126
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,539
and why you're back.

127
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:26,180
I know everything.

128
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:32,779
I-I don't know what you're saying.

129
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,620
I stand by what I said.

130
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:38,419
As long as

131
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,820
I'm alive,

132
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,580
I have the final say.

133
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,859
As for your little schemes...

134
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,659
Forget it.

135
00:07:58,339 --> 00:07:59,659
Are you done?

136
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,500
Kind of.

137
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,859
Zhang Shanya...

138
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:19,620
If you have nothing else to say,

139
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,020
I need to pack up.

140
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:22,979
Jincao will be here soon.

141
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:55,499
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,339
Sorry...

143
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,139
Dali.

144
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,700
Dali, what happened?

145
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,259
Wake up.

146
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:13,739
Dali.

Sorry, we've done our best.

150

No way.

No way.

156
00:09:57,859 --> 00:09:58,979
No way.

158
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,019
You finally called me.

159
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,900
Where are you?

160
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,460
My dad passed away.

161
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:37,540
Please bring Ke here.

Why did you put Grandpa's photo here?

164

Your grandpa

165
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,099
has gone on a long trip.

166
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,099
Where did he go?

167
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,979
Somewhere far away.

168
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,379
What do I do if I miss him?

169
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:22,180
Ke.

170
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,780
You didn't sleep all night.

171
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,739
You should get some sleep.

172
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,420
I want Grandma to watch me as I sleep.

173
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,660
Ke, be good.

174
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,820
Grandma is not feeling well.

175
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,940

00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:48,219
Liuliu, I haven't managed

178
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,099
to solve my problems all these years.

179
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:55,060
But I don't think

180
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:56,379
that happiness

181
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,339
necessarily requires a marriage.

182
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:00,420
I know you have opinions about me.

183
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,660
But you must let me explain it.

184
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:05,420
It's okay. Take your time.

185
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:07,700
But I hope

186
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:09,580
this is the last time.

187
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,499
I remember I told you

188
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:17,739
how I became the way I am now.

189
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:19,460
I'm an only child.

190
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,099
My parents have always
had high hopes for me.

00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,060
But I grew up

193
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:28,780
and felt that their love for me

194
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,139
was rather controlling,

195
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,739
demanding, and oppressive.

196
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,780
It suffocated me.

197
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:37,060
I know I shouldn't speak ill of them.

198
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:38,780
But I'm trying to tell you

199
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,060
that my family background

200
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,580
makes me scared.

201
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,820
Once I start a family

202
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,859
and have children,

203
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,379
I might force my kids

204
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,780
to follow the path

205
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,900
I laid out for them

206
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,259
and force them to do things they hate

207
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,820
in the name of love.

208
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:56,580
It's terrifying.

209
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,700
I'm not sure.

210
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:00,820
I've asked myself

211
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:02,780
whether I'd be able

212
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,259
to provide for my family
and protect them

213
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,300
from harm.

214
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,300
I'm not sure about that either.

215
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,660
If I can't make my family happy,

216
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,300
why should I get married

217
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,940
or bring a new life

218
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,099
to this world?

219
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:19,660
That makes sense.

220
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:22,859
So why are you contemplating?

221
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:26,580
Because I met you.

222
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,780
I feel so insignificant

223
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,339
and so selfish.

224
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,019
I like you so much.

225
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,780
But I'm afraid of taking responsibility.

226
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,339
I dare not express myself.

227
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,660
I remained indecisive

228
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,900
even after you got pregnant.

229
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,660
And you?

230
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:50,540
You are so brave.

231
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:54,660
Qianniu told me

232
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,219
you'll give birth to the child

233
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:57,580
even if this child has no father.

234
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:02,780
And this newborn

235
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:04,739
is partly mine.

236
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,460
Also,

237
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,540
there is a woman who is willing to

238
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,619
give her all for me.

239
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:15,300
How can I not care?

240
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,979
How can I remain indifferent?

241
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:23,219
So I came here to tell you

242
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,339
I want to be the father of this child.

243
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:29,060
I want to be your husband.

Your dad gets breakfast

I came over as soon as I got the news.

260
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,420
Your dad had a bit of a temper.

261
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,339
He argued with me

262
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:51,739
many times over a few cents.

263
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,300
(My daughter)

264
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,979
(had severe Kawasaki disease.)

265
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:57,739
(I started fundraising)

266
00:16:57,739 --> 00:16:59,580
(as someone suggested.)

267
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,420
(Your dad was the first one)

268
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,700
(who brought me money.)

269
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,539
(And he gave me 3,000 yuan.)

270
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,900
(It's more than enough)

271
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,460
(for breakfast in a whole year.)

272
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:09,900
I said it was too much.

273
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,620
But he insisted on giving it to me.

274
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,579
Thank you.

275
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:23,620

Director Liu, what brings you here?

277
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:31,180
Mr. Zhu passed away.

278
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,019
Why didn't you tell us?

279
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,259
You are quite busy.

280
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,700
Don't talk like a stranger.

281
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:40,460
Chief Zhu is an esteemed senior.

282
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:41,739
We have to come

283
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:43,499

284
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,059

You've grown up so much.

290
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:21,739
Jincao, you're what makes your dad

291
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:23,420
proud of himself.

292
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,819
He always praised you,

293
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,180
saying that you are independent

294
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,779
and work on your own

295

in Shanghai without him worrying.

296
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:32,860
You even bought an apartment.

297
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,539
All of us have lost

298
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,420
(much of our laughter
ever since your dad retired.)

299
00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:49,660
You have no idea.

300
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,579
Your dad was always the lead drummer

301

for the annual performance.

302
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,739
Without him,

303
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:57,460
the performance lost its vigor.

(your dad would stay up all night)

308
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,660
(writing Spring Festival couplets
before the Lunar New Year.)

309
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,299
After all these years,

310
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,819
the couplets he wrote

311
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,460
have reached every village
and town in our county.

312
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,620
What a pity.

313
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,660
We won't hear the drum

314
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:28,499
or see the couplets anymore.

315
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,819
Condolences.

316
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:40,019
Sister-in-law, my condolences.

317
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:47,180
Thank you.

318
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,900
Let them be.

319
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:12,499
Your dad made those.

320
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:14,900
He made three bowls of them.

321
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:16,460
He broke one bowl.

322
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:19,019
These are the only two bowls left.

323
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,900
It was the first time
your dad cooked for us.

324
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:24,779
Let's keep them.

325
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:43,180
Ke's Grandma.

326
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:44,779
I made some porridge.

327
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,900
Have some.

328
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:52,620
Mom.

329
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,460
You haven't eaten for two days.

330
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:57,900
You'll fall sick if you go on like this.

331
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,340
Ke is not coming out of the bedroom.

332
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,819
She says she won't eat until you eat.

333
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,660
I don't have the appetite.

334
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,380
Our family has undergone

335
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,420
some changes over the years.

336
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,979
You got married in Shanghai

337
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,779
and gave birth to Ke.

338
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:24,779
Your dad told me

339
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:26,340
to retire early

340
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,499
and look after Ke in Shanghai.

341
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:31,180
Babysitters cost a lot there.

342
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,460
And they don't take
great care of the kids.

343
00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:38,579
So, I went to Shanghai.

344
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:41,299
I did my best to take care of Ke

345
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:43,140
and your family.

346
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,499
Right, let me show you.

347
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,860
I found it some days ago

348
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,100
when I was packing.

349
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,860
His medical exam report.

350
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,779
His blood pressure and blood lipids

351
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,579
have been getting higher
over these three years.

352
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,979
The medical advice says

353
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,019
that he needs
regular check-ups and treatment.

354
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,499
But no one reminded him.

355
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:17,620
Nor did anyone care about him.

356
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:19,700
Whenever I called,

357
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,420
he said, "I'm fine.

358
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,259
Don't worry."

359
00:22:23,499 --> 00:22:27,660
I didn't expect it to be so sudden.

360
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,299
The divorce was the fuse.

361
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:31,860
We didn't tell you

362
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,499
when we were getting divorced.

363
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,499
First, we're not so young anymore.

364
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,539
Getting a divorce at this age

365
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,140
might be embarrassing for both of you.

366
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,420
Secondly,

367
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,660
I thought

368
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,739
I couldn't leave this household.

369
00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:49,860
That's what I have decided.

370
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,900
I've spent my whole life with him.

371
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,539
Where could I go?

372
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,019
We came out of the court that day.

373
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:00,499
He took out all his savings,

374
00:23:00,499 --> 00:23:01,860
73,000 yuan.

375
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,340
He kept

376
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,140
only 3,000 yuan for himself.

377
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:09,059
I had no other choice.

378
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,059
I think your conflicts

379
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:12,779
all started

380
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,739
because of that small apartment.

381
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,059
You were talking about selling it

382
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,539
to get a bigger one.

383
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:23,299
I called your dad over
from our hometown.

384
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:26,700
It has been chaotic

385
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,620
since then.

386
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,900
Not a single day passed in peace.

387
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:33,499
I am the one to blame.

388
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,739
So I wondered what to do.

389
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:37,700
The only solution was

390
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,620
to switch to a bigger house.

391
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,620
But your dad was against it.

392
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,900
And your parents wouldn't budge on it.

393
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,819
So I thought

394
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,579
maybe I should get a divorce.

395
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,299
Only by getting a divorce

396
00:23:51,739 --> 00:23:54,779
can I get half
of that apartment in Shanghai.

397
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:57,340
You don't have enough
for the down payment.

398
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:00,299
I was thinking

399
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,779
if your parents could help you out

400
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:03,819
with the down payment,

401
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:06,180
you could get a bigger apartment.

402
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:07,860
Your family of three

403
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,660
could live your life happily.

404
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:25,499
Let's eat.

405
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:29,700
I have no appetite.

406
00:24:29,739 --> 00:24:31,779
Zhu Dali

407
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,620
had a bad temper,

408
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,380
but he was not a bad person.

409
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,660
Look how well he treated Ke.

410
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,819
He was just proud.

411
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:48,739
It's too late now.

412
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,460
It's my fault.

413
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:53,739
He was proud.

414
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,979
I could be less aggressive.

415
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,019
It's all for the kids.

416
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,340
Why would I be against him?

417
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:05,860
Who knows

418
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,140
he'd have a cerebral hemorrhage?

419
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,259
It hasn't been easy for Jincao.

420
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:16,660
He got divorced and lost his job.

421
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,140
And now his father passed away.

422
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:22,180
I'm worried he can't handle it.

423
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:26,860
Gu,

424
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:32,340
am I too harsh on Jincao?

425
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,660
Yeah, me too.

426
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:35,539
No matter what has happened

427
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:37,420
over the years,

428
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,499
he's been genuinely in love with Moli.

429
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:42,979
I can see this.

430
00:25:42,979 --> 00:25:44,739
Yulan, let's agree on this.

431
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:46,620
Let's stop meddling

432
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,739
in the kids' affairs from now on.

433
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,860
Let them live their lives.

434
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,420
Alright?

435
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,219
Grandma,

436
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:19,739
is Grandpa really not coming back?

437
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,539
But,

438
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:29,499
what should we do
about these unfinished boats?

439
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,219
Grandma will finish them for you.

440
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,620
Do you know how to do it?

441
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:46,700
No.

442
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,019
But I can learn.

443
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,700
But can you do it as well as Grandpa?

444
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,660
I will try my best.

445
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:03,620
I guess

446
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,700
you can't do it as well as Grandpa.

447
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,940
That's right.

448
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,499
I can't do it as well as Grandpa.

449
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:21,539
So, let's keep these boats

450
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,620
well-preserved

451
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:27,180
as keepsakes.

452
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,940
Grandma,

453
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,779
where did Grandpa go?

454
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:43,739
Come here, Ke.

455
00:27:49,579 --> 00:27:51,779
Listen to me.

456
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,620
Grandpa has gone to heaven.

457
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,700
If you see the brightest star

458
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,019
blinking at you at night,

459
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:04,499
it's Grandpa saying hello to you.

00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:17,380

♪How I wonder what you are♪

466
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,460
Every word that my mother

467
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,460
said today

468
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,019
was like a knife stabbing my heart.

469
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,299
I never knew

470
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,660
that she did it all for me.

471
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,460
I've been ungrateful.

472
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,140
Apart from causing them
trouble and pain,

473
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,180
I've never

474
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,460
done anything wholeheartedly for them.

475
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:13,180
My life shouldn't be like this.

476
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:17,700
I've put up with so many things

477
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:19,979
and compromised so much

478
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,019
just to enjoy our simple days.

479
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,340
Why is it so hard?

480
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,940
Jincao.

481
00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:41,979
Don't be harsh on yourself.

482
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,059
I'm the one who should feel guilty.

483
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,620
I used to be willful

484
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:51,340
and spoiled.

485
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,940
You spoiled me.

486
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,700
If I could be more tolerant

487
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,180
and more patient,

488
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:08,259
our families wouldn't have
so many misunderstandings.

489
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,660
Our parents

490
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,059
dedicated everything they had

491
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,140
to our family.

492
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,499
It would be their deepest regret

493
00:30:22,979 --> 00:30:25,140
if we were not happy.

494
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,860
Jincao.

495
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,739
Let's remarry.

496
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,259
You calm down and think it over.

497
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:52,420
I'm very calm.

498
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,739
I don't want to have any regrets.

499
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:00,100
Since we love each other,

500
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,460
we should never part.

501
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,420
Moli.

502
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,620
This is the Premises Permit
of your apartment.

503
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:34,059
First things first.

504
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,979
Sell the apartment

505
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:38,259
and get a new house.

506
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,660
(Premises Permit)
Take it.

507
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:42,779
And take the money of 70,000 yuan.

508
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:44,860
No, I can't take the money.

509
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,620
You have to pay off a loan

510
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,700
once you get a new place.

511
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,819
It's not much.

512
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:52,579
Spend it wisely.

513
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:53,979
No, we can't take it.

514
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:54,779
Moli.

515
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,860
Take it.

516
00:31:58,539 --> 00:31:59,380
Take it.

517
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,259
Grandma, come back to Shanghai with me.

518
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,100
Ke, be good.

519
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,019
Grandma can't go back with you yet.

520
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,819
I will visit you

521
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:22,900
after a while, okay?

522
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:25,140
Come, let me kiss you.

523
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:30,420
Mom, I'm worried about leaving you

524
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:31,620
here alone.

525
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:33,900
Come with us.

526
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,299
I can't go.

527
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,100
If I leave,

528
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,579
your dad won't be able
to find his way home.

529
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,539
Besides, he passed away too suddenly.

530
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:48,979
I had to explain to

531
00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:51,299
our relatives and friends.

532
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,700
I'll be fine.

533
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,180
Don't worry, son.

534
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:58,460
Hurry up.

535
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,819
It's quite a long ride.

536
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,460
Drive safe.

537
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:06,219
Get going.

538
00:33:25,496 --> 00:33:28,842
(A few months later)

539
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:33,299
We need to hurry.

540
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:34,940
Liuliu is waiting
at the civil affairs office.

541
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,979
We must be there.

542
00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:36,979
Forget it.

543
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:39,100
Nothing matters more
than making you a painter.

544
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:46,380
(Marriage Registration Office)

545
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,460
Open your mouth.

546
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,499
I want some milk.

547
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:53,140
Here it is.

548
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,539
Here, slowly.

549
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:02,539
What kind of bestie is she?

550
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:05,380
It's the most important day for you.

551
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,340
You didn't

552
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,940
invite anyone but her.

553
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,220
And she stood you up.

554
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,260
What kind of cousin is he?

555
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:13,220
Didn't you invite just him?

556
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:13,860
And?

557
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,179
He promised to come,

558
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,780
but he wasn't texting back.

559
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,340
You can't count on him.

560
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,420
They're just the same.

561
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,059
Yeah, exactly.

562
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,579
Watch how I deal with Gu Moli later.

563
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,019
I will ask Zhu Jincao

564
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,300
for compensation.

565
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,380
Ask for money.

566
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,220
Absolutely.

567
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,260
Wipe your mouth.

568
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,340
Civil registration number 23,

569
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,979
please come to window No. 3.

570
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,220
Here.

571
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:44,139
Honey, please proceed.

572
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,420
Honey, please.

573
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,539
Let's go.

574
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:49,539
Be careful.

575
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,260
Wait.

576
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,059
What's wrong?

577
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,579
I'm about to give birth.

578
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,659
Marriage registration.

579
00:34:57,699 --> 00:34:58,740
Hurry up, please.

580
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,099
My wife is about to give birth.

581
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,300
Maybe you should
go to the hospital first

582
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,220
and come another day.

583
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,019
No way.

584
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,220
She was single

585
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,420
when she got pregnant.

586
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,940
But she wants to
be married to give birth.

587
00:35:11,672 --> 00:35:16,760
(Marriage Certificate)

588
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,579
Mi Na.

589
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,340
Sit down.

590
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,300
- Okay.
- Take a seat.

591
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:38,420
Thank you, Mi Na.

592
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:39,260
I have no idea

593
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,579
how you persuaded your boss

594
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:42,179
to display my paintings.

595
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,179
You even sold two of them!

596
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,019
You're just lucky.

597
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:47,979
Your husband dotes on you.

598
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,139
And you have a benefactor.

599
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:50,300
Who is that?

600
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,860
Na.

601
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:54,340
Na is our benefactor.

602
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,900
How can you make

603
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,099
such a comeback without her?

604
00:35:57,099 --> 00:35:58,139
Right.

605
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,539
Thank you, Na.

606
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,699
Two paintings.

607
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:07,019
A total of 31,000 yuan.

608
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:08,659
Minus 6,200 yuan in commission,

609
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:10,380
you have 24,800 yuan left.

610
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:11,260
Alright.

611
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,059
Count it.

612
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,740
No need.

613
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,460
Honey.

614
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,499
I believe this is just
the good beginning.

615
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,820
We will get on the right track.

616
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,420
Let's talk about our contract now.

617
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,900
- Alright.
- Alright.

618
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,579
Your place is really far away.

619
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:48,820
It's such a long drive
after we get off the highway.

620
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,979
I feel I'm falling apart.

621
00:36:50,979 --> 00:36:51,900
It's so hot.

622
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,460
Here.

623
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,940
- Have some water.
- Thank you.

624
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,499
It is quite far.

625
00:36:57,979 --> 00:37:00,780
Why did you come

626
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,019
all the way here?

627
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,979
Shanya.

628
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,539
Some misfortunes

629
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,780
have occurred in the past few months.

630
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,820
Life is unpredictable.

631
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:16,539
So,

632
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:18,579
this is what I think.

633
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:20,220
Alright, stop.

634
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,579
Let me say it.

635
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,420
Zhang Shanya.

636
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,780
What's wrong with you?

637
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:31,820
What about me?

638
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,300
Didn't you say you'd do anything

639
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,380
for the happiness

640
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,059
of our kids and Ke?

641
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:39,220
How can they be happy

642
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,460
with you like this?

643
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,179
You're living alone here

644
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,059
while they're in Shanghai.

645
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:47,059
They're worried about you

646
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:48,780
all day long.

647
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,820
Can they be happy?

648
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:51,059
Let me tell you.

649
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:53,579
You can't be selfish.

650
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:54,340
You know.

651
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,699
Hurry and pack up.

652
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:57,019
Come back to Shanghai with us.

653
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,499
Wu, I really can't go.

654
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:00,579
Come on.

655
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:03,220
How come you never listen to advice?

656
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:05,860
I've called you several times.

657
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,940
Right? You wouldn't listen.

658
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,179
Now that we're here,

659
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:10,699
you still won't listen.

660
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,099
Listen to me.

661
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:14,340
I'm not worried about your son.

662
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,979
I'm worried because

663
00:38:16,979 --> 00:38:19,019
it concerns my daughter

664
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:21,139
and my granddaughter.

665
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,460
I know.

666
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,139
I totally get it.

667
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,099
But we have a rule here.

668
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,139
I can't leave home

669
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:28,740
for these three years once he's gone.

670
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,059
I have to stay by his side.

671
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:31,900
You can't have a life once he's gone?

672
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,099
Do you have to be so stubborn?

673
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:35,579
Do you, Zhang Shanya?

674
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,979
Yulan, sit down. Let's talk.

675
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,420
Zhang Shanya.

676
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,059
We've come here

677
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,300
to inform you of something.

678
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:52,220
Jincao and Moli have bought a new house.

679
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:57,260
I lent them the money
for the down payment.

680
00:38:57,699 --> 00:39:00,619
Zhu Jincao and Gu Moli
have written me an IOU.

681
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:02,619
They will repay me.

682
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,539
That is to say,

683
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:06,539
you get to keep

684
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:09,460
that 57.2-square-meter small apartment.

685
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:11,820
You can't just leave it there, right?

686
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,179
You'll have to live there.

687
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,780
Also,

688
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:17,539
the two of us rented a bigger apartment

689
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:19,260
in your neighborhood.

690
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,579
It has two bedrooms.

691
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,539
Here's what I'm thinking.

692
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:24,699
We can live together

693
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:26,139
to look after each other.

694
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,780
You're a great cook.

695
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,019
You make great buns,

696
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:32,900
dumplings, and noodles.

697
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,659
And

698
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,220
Gu is also a great chef.

699
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,499
He makes Ningbo cuisine.

700
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:41,579
Have a taste of his dishes.

701
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:44,460
We can have variety.

702
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,300
I've made myself clear.

703
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,220
It's up to you whether you're coming.

704
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:57,300
Shanya.

705
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:00,579
Come back to Shanghai with us.

706
00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:03,019
You have

707
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,019
your son,

708
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,619
your daughter-in-law,

709
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,579
your granddaughter,

710
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:14,420
and us there.

711
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:17,699
We are all family.

712
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:20,380
We all miss you.

713
00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:28,099
Thank you.

714
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:30,900
Thank you.

715
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,900
We are a family.

716
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:39,260
So,

717
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,460
a family

718
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:46,019
should live together, right?

719
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:47,099
Isn't that right?

720
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,300
Listen to me.

721
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,420
Pack your things.

722
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,780
Let's go back to Shanghai.

723
00:40:51,139 --> 00:40:53,380
Wu, let me think about it.

724
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:54,940
I may go back

725
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,740
on my own later, okay?

726
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,539
No way.

727
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,019
Let's do it today.

728
00:40:59,019 --> 00:41:00,019
Listen to me.

729
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,019
Gu.

730
00:41:07,979 --> 00:41:08,979
In-law.

731
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,499
Excuse me.

732
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:12,499
Let's take you back to Shanghai.

733
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,579
