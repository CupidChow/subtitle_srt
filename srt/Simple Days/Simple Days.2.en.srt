Shanya?

21
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:12,996
Speak.

22
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,757
Yulan.

23
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:16,477
Where are you now?

24
00:02:16,477 --> 00:02:19,716
We need to meet.
I have something important to say.

25
00:02:21,716 --> 00:02:23,956
See you in an hour, same place.

26
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:25,357
Wait.

27
00:02:28,597 --> 00:02:31,996
I really hate the way she spoke to me.

28
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:36,157
Where are you going? It's not done yet.

29
00:02:37,276 --> 00:02:41,357
That nosy Shanya wants to see me.

30
00:02:42,716 --> 00:02:43,744
Shanya?

31
00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:48,836
Yulan, try to be nice to her.

32
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,592
Don't be harsh on her.

33
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:53,597
Think about it. If you upset her,

34
00:02:53,597 --> 00:02:55,956
in the end, our daughter will suffer.

35
00:02:55,956 --> 00:02:57,836
I just want to give her a warning

36
00:02:57,836 --> 00:03:02,037
that we're behind Moli.

37
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:03,437
Lest she should bully our family.

38
00:03:05,157 --> 00:03:07,836
Be reasonable. No fights.

00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:21,700
(Old Shanghai Coffee)

40
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:32,197
You've arrived.

41
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:35,680
Weren't you in a hurry?
Why are you late?

42
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:39,197
The subway is too far from here.

43
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:41,836
I trotted over here. I'm all sweaty.

44
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:42,624
What do you drink?

45
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:45,676
Well, just a glass of water.

46
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:46,597
Waitress.

47
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:47,597
Yes?

48
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:50,716
Free water, please.

49
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:51,597
Alright.

50
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:57,157
Thank you.

51
00:03:57,157 --> 00:03:57,996
You're welcome.

52
00:04:00,877 --> 00:04:01,996
Take a look at this.

53
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:02,877
What is it?

54
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:06,396
Who took this?

55
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:09,597
The composition is awful. It's blurry.

56
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:12,384
It doesn't capture Moli's beauty at all.

57
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:15,236
I took it, but that's not the point.

58
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:18,317
You missed the point.

59
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:25,077
The point is, they have a house,
but they went to book a hotel room.

60
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:26,916
It cost 800 for one night.

61
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,036
And they spent 600 on lunch today.

62
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,877
Do you think that's appropriate?

63
00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:33,276
They did so

64
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:36,117
because your tiny house
is only 50 square meters.

65
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:40,000
What's wrong with 600 for a meal?
That's quite normal.

66
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:42,944
If your son can't afford his wife,

67
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:45,797
I can give my daughter meal allowances.

68
00:04:47,596 --> 00:04:51,424
Yulan, first of all,
I need to correct you.

69
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:57,024
Their house is not 50 square meters
but 57.2 square meters.

70
00:04:57,836 --> 00:05:01,716
We're in Shanghai
where house prices are sky-high.

71
00:05:01,716 --> 00:05:03,936
It's almost 60 square meters.
That's enough.

72
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:07,808
You can't imagine
how many girls are jealous of her.

73
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,520
Moli should count her blessings

74
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,797
and be content.

75
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:21,956
Look at what I've found.

76
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:23,637
Unbelievable.

77
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:26,877
These are invoices by the hotel.

78
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:31,197
I counted them.
These are invoices for almost a year.

79
00:05:31,757 --> 00:05:35,520
Moli is so careless with money.

80
00:05:36,197 --> 00:05:37,956
She complains my house is too small?

81
00:05:37,956 --> 00:05:39,757
Given the way she spends,

82
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:42,496
when can they afford a house here?

83
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:47,104
Moli has no money, but we do.

84
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,677
As we can see now,

85
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:55,237
there are 16 viewers online.

86
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:58,208
Give me your kudos, guys.

87
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,748
Get me more traffic.

88
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:10,156
We must avoid mental exhaustion.

89
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:15,276
I don't agonize. I'm not anxious.

90
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:18,237
I want to be positive.

91
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:21,792
You might ask how we do it.

92
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:30,624
Join me next time to find out
how to reconcile with yourselves.

93
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:34,356
Thank you, guys. I am Huang Qianniu.

94
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:37,760
See you tomorrow, same time.

95
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:43,197
(The live-stream is over)
Seven more followers. Getting better.

96
00:06:47,476 --> 00:06:50,336
I'm doing pretty good today.

(Your credit card bill is overdue.)
Dear Sir, your credit card bill...

98
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,484
(To avoid a negative credit record,
please repay immediately.)

99
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:16,956
Huang Qianniu.

100
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:19,476
Didn't you see the message?

101
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,797
Share the utility bills, alright?

102
00:07:23,797 --> 00:07:24,956
Got it.

103
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:28,596
Come on. The landlord
is gonna cut off water and electricity.

104
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:30,117
I'll pay tomorrow.

105
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:33,276
Again? Do it now.

106
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:36,237
Save me some noodles.

107
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:38,197
You wish. We don't have enough to eat.

108
00:07:56,197 --> 00:08:00,836
Old rule. Heads, Lingxiao.
Tails, Jincao.

109
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:13,317
Originally, we were willing

110
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:14,916
to buy them a large house in Shanghai.

111
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:20,916
But someone was narrow-minded
and rejected.

112
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,596
What do you mean?

113
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:27,077
I was a kindergarten teacher.

114
00:08:27,077 --> 00:08:29,117
I am educated and not narrow-minded.

115
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:32,640
If I hadn't retired early
to take care of my granddaughter,

116
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:35,236
I could have been the head
of the kindergarten.

117
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:37,756
Alright, I am wrong.

118
00:08:39,356 --> 00:08:42,836
Let me put it another way.
You're short-sighted, okay?

119
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:44,197
What's the difference?

120
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,056
Ms. Zhang.

121
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:55,136
As Moli's parents, we moved to Shanghai

122
00:08:55,716 --> 00:08:58,624
to give my daughter a better life.

123
00:08:59,677 --> 00:09:04,397
I've been expecting Moli
to live a happy,

124
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:07,116
decent, and beautiful life.

125
00:09:08,356 --> 00:09:10,476
My daughter is young and attractive.

126
00:09:10,476 --> 00:09:14,317
I don't want her to live a hard life.

127
00:09:15,836 --> 00:09:20,677
And saving money can't make you rich.

128
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:24,636
You should learn to enjoy life.

129
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:27,277
At this age, enjoy the moment.

130
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:30,677
After all, you have worked so hard
for most of your life.

131
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:33,397
Yulan.

132
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:37,197
If I hadn't worked so hard,

133
00:09:37,197 --> 00:09:39,517
could my son afford to buy a house here?

134
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:45,037
Enough, nobody fancies your tiny house.

135
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:46,756
Anyway, they can stay at my place.

136
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:50,517
Have you finished?

137
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:52,037
I mean, how do we resolve th...

138
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:55,197
That's it for today.
I have something else to do.

139
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:59,356
Think about what I just told you.

140
00:09:59,356 --> 00:10:02,048
What I said is profound.

141
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:05,116
Alright, I have to go.

142
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:06,876
I've paid the bill.

143
00:10:08,277 --> 00:10:09,197
Waitress.

144
00:10:09,197 --> 00:10:09,797
Yes?

145
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:11,197
Another glass of water for her, please.

146
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:11,872
Okay.

147
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:17,157
You're asking me to convince Auntie?

148
00:10:18,236 --> 00:10:20,928
Renting a house is a good solution.

149
00:10:21,557 --> 00:10:22,876
Don't make it so complicated.

150
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:25,760
My parents can't accept a rented house.

151
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:27,956
They want to have a house.

152
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:31,476
They believe a house means everything
and I can have a voice

153
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:34,816
and face my wife with dignity

154
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:37,088
if I own a house.

155
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:41,956
Since you can't convince your parents,

156
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:44,116
what can I do then?

157
00:10:46,636 --> 00:10:47,636
Who is it?

158
00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:49,476
Lingxiao, it's Niu.

159
00:10:49,476 --> 00:10:50,236
You called him?

160
00:10:50,236 --> 00:10:51,197
I did not.

161
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:54,116
I have a bad feeling.

162
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:04,000
Lingxiao, it's something urgent.

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,317
You must help me.

164
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,636
Jincao, you're here. Great.

165
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,168
I'm sure I'll get my wish today.

166
00:11:12,157 --> 00:11:15,077
Jincao, how have you been?

167
00:11:15,077 --> 00:11:16,157
Be quiet.

168
00:11:18,836 --> 00:11:24,157
Lingxiao, I really like your house.
Looks so nice.

169
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:27,996
Look at this view.

170
00:11:29,277 --> 00:11:32,557
Every time I come here,
it inspires me to strive forward.

171
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:36,716
Can I stay here for a couple of days?

172
00:11:36,716 --> 00:11:37,756
Nice try.

173
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:41,317
You shut up. I'm talking
about a serious matter with Lingxiao.

174
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:42,784
I can help.

175
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:45,517
I'm gonna have some water.

176
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:49,197
Lingxiao, I have thought about it.

177
00:11:49,197 --> 00:11:52,032
Forget about my voice in my house.

178
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:55,296
You help my mom envision a good life
in the future.

179
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:58,397
You can tell her
that you're getting married.

180
00:11:58,397 --> 00:12:00,797
So, you ask her
to tour the new house with you.

181
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,716
Let her imagine the beautiful picture

182
00:12:04,716 --> 00:12:08,397
of three generations living together
in a large house.

183
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:10,917
Just exert your eloquence
as a senior analyst.

184
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,776
The whole family knows
that I won't get married or buy a house.

185
00:12:16,596 --> 00:12:18,116
The premise is not valid.

186
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:21,157
It's valid. Who knows what will happen
to your love life?

187
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,596
Tell them you love a girl at first sight

188
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:24,636
and you will marry her.

189
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:26,784
Please help me.
I'll do anything to repay you.

190
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:28,996
I hope I could help you.

191
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:32,116
But if I do,
how will I explain it to my mom?

192
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:35,476
My mom has been pushing me
to get married.

193
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:37,917
If I help you, I'll be
in endless trouble.

194
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:40,077
Sorry, but I really can't help.

195
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:44,277
Jincao, I'm interested.

196
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:49,397
I get it. You intend
to coax Auntie, right?

197
00:12:49,397 --> 00:12:54,116
You want to sell her small house
to buy a bigger one.

198
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:57,157
I'm close to your mother.
She will listen to me.

199
00:12:59,756 --> 00:13:06,037
I'm getting married. I want a big house.

200
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:10,116
I'll let Auntie imagine the joy
of three generations living together.

201
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:20,236
Then she will think
if even I own a big house,

202
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:23,356
you must have one too.

203
00:13:23,356 --> 00:13:24,836
No, listen to me.

204
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,356
The story I just made up

205
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:28,756
works for Lingxiao, not you.

206
00:13:28,756 --> 00:13:31,917
I don't think Mom will believe you.

207
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:34,157
I'll just make her believe.

208
00:13:34,157 --> 00:13:35,797
Anyway, Lingxiao can't help.

209
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:39,236
Trust me. What do you have to lose?

210
00:13:43,716 --> 00:13:47,116
When did you start a relationship?

211
00:13:47,116 --> 00:13:48,716
How come you didn't tell me?

212
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:50,157
What is your girlfriend like?

213
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:52,557
She's a local, compensated
for the house demolition.

214
00:13:52,557 --> 00:13:56,756
She is forthright
and tall with dark skin.

215
00:13:57,596 --> 00:14:01,596
She became infatuated with me
watching my live-stream.

216
00:14:02,197 --> 00:14:05,996
After dating for three months,
I feel she's the one.

217
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:08,917
Have you told your parents yet?

218
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:11,616
I'll tell them after I buy a house.

219
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:15,797
So, she's rich.

220
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:19,517
You'll be a live-in son-in-law.
Would your parents agree?

221
00:14:19,517 --> 00:14:23,636
Auntie, change your way of thinking.

222
00:14:23,636 --> 00:14:26,157
This is a financial matter.

223
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,356
I have the final say in my house.

224
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:31,116
But I need to have a house first, right?

225
00:14:31,116 --> 00:14:34,077
Buying a house is my first step.

226
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:36,836
And then I will get my way slowly.

227
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:39,116
Mom, how can we live with you?

228
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:43,876
You promised to buy me a house
as a dowry. Remember?

229
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:47,517
How come I have such a foolish daughter
like you?

230
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:49,476
Is this the same thing?

231
00:14:49,476 --> 00:14:52,756
It's millions. I can't believe

232
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:55,808
Zhu Jincao sent you here
to ask for money. Is he even a man?

233
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,397
How can he have the nerve
to ask you for money?

234
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:01,728
You know how he feels?

235
00:15:02,437 --> 00:15:07,157
As your parents,
we're willing to spend money on you.

236
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:09,836
But what can Zhu Jincao do for you?

237
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:12,917
Why should he benefit from it?

238
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:19,808
I'm telling you.
I will not give you the money.

239
00:15:23,996 --> 00:15:24,832
Whatever.

240
00:15:35,996 --> 00:15:37,728
I can give you the money.

241
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:43,677
But only your name is on the deed.

242
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:47,836
Zhu Jincao will also chip in
for the new house.

243
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:50,677
Do you think it's fair to him?

244
00:15:50,677 --> 00:15:52,716
Don't argue with me.

245
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:55,157
When they bought the small house,

246
00:15:55,157 --> 00:15:57,876
they were not willing to buy it with us.

247
00:15:57,876 --> 00:16:00,917
So your name isn't on the deed.

248
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:03,197
After living in a small house
for seven years,

249
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:05,317
now you finally know it's good
to have a bigger one?

250
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:09,024
It's very fair.
I buy my daughter a house.

251
00:16:09,557 --> 00:16:12,864
I don't want to co-purchase with them.

252
00:16:20,517 --> 00:16:24,608
Moli, your mom is right. It's only fair.

253
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:29,504
Some day, our property will be yours,

254
00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:35,008
not your husband's.
Your mom is doing it for you.

255
00:16:58,336 --> 00:17:02,197
How will you handle the painting?

256
00:17:03,236 --> 00:17:09,116
How much do you need to compensate?
I can pay for it.

257
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:15,636
No need, I'll find a way
to deal with it.

258
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:24,717
I have something else to do.
I have to go.

259
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,237
Moli, the dinner?

260
00:17:31,757 --> 00:17:35,840
Why can't you speak nicely to her?

261
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:39,876
Did I say anything harsh?

262
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:45,664
I'm telling you, this is serious.
You stay out of it.

263
00:17:47,037 --> 00:17:48,717
- Here we are.
- Please come in.

264
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:49,557
Come on.

265
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:50,317
I'll show you around.

266
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:52,077
No, let me do it.

267
00:17:52,077 --> 00:17:52,717
Okay.

268
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:56,396
Auntie, look. There's a big study room.

269
00:17:56,396 --> 00:17:58,396
It's cozy to read a book here.

270
00:17:58,396 --> 00:17:58,912
Yes.

271
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,120
Look at the sunlight. Come here.

272
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:09,237
Look at the bay window.
Sunbathing here would be great.

273
00:18:09,237 --> 00:18:11,757
I can enjoy my tea and coffee here.

274
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:16,957
Look. This is the most comfortable spot.

275
00:18:16,957 --> 00:18:19,636
Auntie, you can spend the morning here.

276
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:22,116
I can even spend the whole day here.

277
00:18:22,116 --> 00:18:24,436
Yeah, you'll make many delicious dishes.

278
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,237
Right.

279
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:29,120
I must give you an introduction
to the three bedrooms.

280
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:30,997
Three bedrooms?

281
00:18:30,997 --> 00:18:34,848
The master bedroom is
for me and my wife.

282
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:39,840
It's big.
This room is for my future children.

283
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:43,557
It won't take long to have a child.

284
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:45,396
Okay.

285
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:48,768
Come here. Go in and have a look.

286
00:18:50,116 --> 00:18:53,792
This room is for my parents.

287
00:18:58,477 --> 00:18:59,997
It has a bathroom.

288
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:04,196
You're quite filial, son.

289
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:05,037
Not as much as Jincao.

290
00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:09,916
Is your girlfriend willing
to stay with your parents?

291
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,557
Why? She must listen to me.

292
00:19:13,557 --> 00:19:14,436
Auntie, please sit.

293
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:17,957
Will she?

294
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,717
She must do what I say,

295
00:19:19,717 --> 00:19:22,356
just like I do what my parents say.

296
00:19:23,116 --> 00:19:24,957
Moli does what Jincao says.

297
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:28,876
And Jincao does what you say, right?

298
00:19:33,557 --> 00:19:36,277
Auntie, you know what?

299
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:40,480
Jincao feels quite guilty towards you.

300
00:19:43,797 --> 00:19:49,876
He often tells me he owes you a lot.

301
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:53,600
You take care of the child and cooking.
It's very tiring.

302
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:55,616
He often mentions this to me.

303
00:19:56,224 --> 00:19:59,872
He hopes you have a private room,

304
00:20:02,757 --> 00:20:04,116
a room like this.

305
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:10,037
It's cozy and warm.

306
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:13,957
I'm happy to hear that.

307
00:20:13,957 --> 00:20:16,077
But I'm not as lucky as your mother.

308
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:20,160
What are you talking about?
Ask Jincao to buy a house.

309
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:22,816
We could live across the hall

310
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:24,436
and care for each other.

311
00:20:24,436 --> 00:20:26,997
You and my mom
can spend more time together.

312
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:32,596
If I buy two houses,
will I get a bigger discount?

313
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:35,196
Yes, a bigger discount.

314
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:37,237
Don't talk to me about discounts.

315
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:40,757
I can't afford such a big house.

316
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,237
You can.

317
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:48,717
Jincao can sell the small house
for the down payment of a bigger one.

318
00:20:48,717 --> 00:20:50,757
And then you can move
right into this big house, no?

319
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:56,997
Three generations under one roof,
being neighbors with your sis.

320
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:00,517
That's so great.

321
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:09,156
Auntie, stop thinking.

322
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:11,636
Let's register for it first.

323
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:13,237
Come on.

324
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:14,517
Wait, doesn't registration cost money?

325
00:21:14,517 --> 00:21:16,196
No, it doesn't cost money.

326
00:21:16,196 --> 00:21:18,077
It's free. Look.

327
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,757
So many registrants.

328
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:23,317
Mr. Huang is right.
Our houses are popular.

329
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:25,797
Look, so many people have registered
just after the opening.

330
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:26,757
Sign here?

331
00:21:26,757 --> 00:21:27,676
Yeah.

332
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:30,080
Sign Jincao's name?

333
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:34,304
(Gu Moli)

334
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,144
(Gu Moli)

335
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,836
Gu Moli?

336
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,037
No, Zhu Jincao.

337
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:47,296
(Gu Moli)

338
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:55,317
Same name.

339
00:21:55,317 --> 00:21:58,196
And same phone numbers?

340
00:22:04,717 --> 00:22:09,888
What a coincidence.
Moli also toured their houses.

341
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:13,517
The whole family is thinking alike.
That's nice.

342
00:22:28,116 --> 00:22:30,836
Jincao, we are here.

343
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:34,596
What happened?
Why do you need my ID card?

344
00:22:34,596 --> 00:22:38,356
Give it to me. I'll keep it for you

345
00:22:39,277 --> 00:22:42,432
just in case the name
on the deed is changed overnight.

346
00:22:43,636 --> 00:22:45,156
Mission failed.

347
00:22:46,356 --> 00:22:49,116
I can explain.

348
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:52,077
You don't have to.
You did it all for Ke, right?

349
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:57,037
School district house, three generations
under one roof, and a happy life.

350
00:22:57,037 --> 00:22:58,356
You're quite clear about it.

351
00:22:58,356 --> 00:23:02,848
I do. Qianniu
and the saleslady have made it clearer.

352
00:23:03,676 --> 00:23:07,488
But I don't understand
why you always listen to your wife.

353
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:11,584
She told you to get a hotel room
and sell the house.

354
00:23:12,237 --> 00:23:15,317
Jincao, are you the man of the house?

355
00:23:15,317 --> 00:23:18,880
Auntie, a hotel room?
This is a matter of principle.

356
00:23:19,836 --> 00:23:22,356
You stay out of this.

357
00:23:22,356 --> 00:23:25,037
I warn you. Don't be a loser.

358
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,636
Don't be a loser.

359
00:23:26,636 --> 00:23:28,757
See, Qianniu is more reasonable
than you.

360
00:23:33,156 --> 00:23:35,876
Mom, listen to me. Here's the thing.

361
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:40,396
A bigger house is considered
as an increase in family assets.

362
00:23:40,396 --> 00:23:42,717
It's also for you and Dad.

363
00:23:42,717 --> 00:23:45,676
If we live in a bigger house,
you and Dad won't live separately.

364
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:46,196
Am I right?

365
00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:47,997
Have you thought about me and your dad?

366
00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:51,196
Remember how this house was bought?

367
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,277
Your dad and I have been frugal.

368
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:55,037
We saved the down payment for you.

369
00:23:55,037 --> 00:23:58,496
Your dad never spent over three yuan
on breakfast.

370
00:23:58,997 --> 00:24:00,836
How can you plan to sell the house

371
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:03,237
without telling us?

372
00:24:03,237 --> 00:24:05,152
Have you thought about me and your dad?

373
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,237
Anyway,

374
00:24:08,237 --> 00:24:12,436
tell your wife
that selling the house is impossible.

375
00:24:12,436 --> 00:24:13,957
Don't be mad, auntie.

376
00:24:15,836 --> 00:24:19,436
Come home early.
What would you like to eat for dinner?

377
00:24:19,436 --> 00:24:22,477
How about braised pork?
It's so delicious.

378
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:24,596
It makes my mouth water.
I even dreamed of it.

379
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,356
Okay, I'll cook it.

380
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:29,237
Come back early.
I will make you braised pork.

381
00:24:30,757 --> 00:24:31,557
I gotta go.

382
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:32,356
Stop right there.

383
00:24:37,997 --> 00:24:40,396
What on earth can you do?

384
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:44,116
You promised me.
This is what you've done?

385
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,196
You tricked me?

386
00:24:45,196 --> 00:24:49,440
Jincao, I tried my best though I failed.

387
00:24:50,717 --> 00:24:52,436
Just let me join you for dinner.

388
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:56,517
Auntie!

389
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:11,277
This is all I have.
Take as much as you need.

390
00:25:14,372 --> 00:25:15,232
(Total Assets 428,620.76)

391
00:25:15,636 --> 00:25:18,596
420,000?

392
00:25:18,596 --> 00:25:21,317
You're so rich, lady.

393
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:23,596
My savings have never exceeded 50,000.

394
00:25:23,596 --> 00:25:25,952
That's because you have a rich family.

395
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:28,836
If you run out of money,
your mom will give some to you.

396
00:25:28,836 --> 00:25:30,676
Buying a new house is an exception.

397
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:33,997
It's an old issue.

398
00:25:33,997 --> 00:25:36,544
Your parents are not against you
but your husband's family.

399
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:39,077
If I were your mom,
I wouldn't give you money either.

400
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,636
That's why I'm feeling down.

401
00:25:41,636 --> 00:25:44,997
I'm over 30, married, and have a child.

402
00:25:44,997 --> 00:25:47,797
But I'm still supported
by my family and in-laws.

403
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:51,296
Great, a few drinks in
and you start to reflect on yourself.

404
00:25:54,077 --> 00:25:56,237
I feel like a total failure.

405
00:25:56,797 --> 00:26:01,557
Look at you. You're a director,
while I'm still a mere agent.

406
00:26:01,557 --> 00:26:03,997
You've bought a house on your own.
What about me?

407
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:08,636
Stop, I'll say it again.
That's because I have no one to rely on.

408
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:12,077
As you know, I paid my down payment
with my parents' legacy.

409
00:26:12,077 --> 00:26:14,517
Otherwise, who could afford a house?

410
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:16,757
Anyway, how much do you need?

411
00:26:18,596 --> 00:26:20,077
I can't borrow money from you.

412
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:27,757
(Honey, why don't we rent a house
and move out?)

413
00:26:27,757 --> 00:26:29,876
(Mom would definitely disagree.)

414
00:26:39,748 --> 00:26:40,932
(Audio Muted)

415
00:26:42,757 --> 00:26:46,436
Jincao, I'm the loser, okay?

416
00:26:46,436 --> 00:26:50,517
Please give me one more chance.
I promise I can do it.

417
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:53,557
What nonsense is he talking about?

418
00:26:53,557 --> 00:26:54,797
Don't listen to him.

419
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:04,676
Hello, Wang.

420
00:27:04,676 --> 00:27:06,676
Hello, is this Ms. Gu Moli?

421
00:27:06,676 --> 00:27:10,636
Hold on a moment. Go ahead.

422
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,116
Here's the thing.
You've been qualified to buy a house

423
00:27:14,116 --> 00:27:15,876
in the Haohan Tiancheng Property.

424
00:27:15,876 --> 00:27:18,676
Please come to choose your apartment
in ten days.

425
00:27:18,676 --> 00:27:21,836
And please transfer three million yuan
as a reservation deposit within ten days

426
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:24,237
to the designated escrow account
to be frozen.

427
00:27:24,237 --> 00:27:28,277
Otherwise, it shall be deemed
you have abandoned your qualification.

428
00:27:28,277 --> 00:27:29,477
Have I made it clear?

429
00:27:29,477 --> 00:27:31,517
Yeah, thank you.

430
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:32,676
You're welcome.

431
00:27:42,676 --> 00:27:45,317
Honey, did you hear that?

432
00:27:45,317 --> 00:27:48,396
My good wife brought me good luck.

433
00:27:48,396 --> 00:27:50,356
We must buy a new house.

434
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:53,517
Yes.

435
00:28:15,557 --> 00:28:17,237
Are you still worried?

436
00:28:19,557 --> 00:28:21,477
I didn't sleep all night.

437
00:28:22,797 --> 00:28:27,520
I dislike the Zhu family, but I hate it
when my daughter suffers.

438
00:28:28,277 --> 00:28:29,916
I can't let it happen.

439
00:28:32,317 --> 00:28:34,876
I didn't sleep either.

440
00:28:35,396 --> 00:28:40,596
Anyway, we need to think of a solution.

441
00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:45,952
Moli looked distant when she left.

442
00:28:47,797 --> 00:28:51,872
I'm very upset. What can we do?

443
00:28:55,196 --> 00:28:59,520
We can't push our daughter too hard
on this.

444
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:05,916
- Just do as I say.
- Alright, Mr. Zhu.

445
00:29:08,317 --> 00:29:09,797
Mr. Zhu, wait a moment.

446
00:29:09,797 --> 00:29:10,797
What's the matter, Cui Shan?

447
00:29:10,797 --> 00:29:13,077
Mr. Zhu, you're not qualified

448
00:29:13,077 --> 00:29:15,552
to apply for a 500,000 housing loan
from our company.

449
00:29:16,196 --> 00:29:17,396
How so?

450
00:29:17,396 --> 00:29:20,757
The housing loan plan is aimed at those
who have completed five years of service

451
00:29:20,757 --> 00:29:23,680
and have a strong need for housing.

452
00:29:24,517 --> 00:29:29,237
You have the required service length,
but you already own a house.

453
00:29:29,237 --> 00:29:31,200
You want to buy a bigger one, right?

454
00:29:32,116 --> 00:29:33,957
I have a pressing need for housing.

455
00:29:33,957 --> 00:29:36,836
I have a family of four living
in a 50-square-meter apartment.

456
00:29:36,836 --> 00:29:38,237
Don't you think it's pressing?

457
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:40,077
But according to our company's rules,

458
00:29:40,077 --> 00:29:41,984
only employees
without housing are qualified.

459
00:29:43,517 --> 00:29:45,504
So I am sorry,
but I cannot make an exception for you.

460
00:29:46,676 --> 00:29:47,916
Alright, I understand.

461
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,037
Sorry about that, Mr. Zhu.

462
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:49,676
That's alright.

463
00:29:55,757 --> 00:29:59,916
Hello, Dad. Okay, I'll be there.

464
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:08,797
Jincao, have some tea.

465
00:30:08,797 --> 00:30:09,636
Thank you, Dad.

466
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,356
Where is Moli?

467
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:20,896
We didn't call her.
Today, we want to talk to you alone.

468
00:30:27,156 --> 00:30:32,317
Jincao, I know you're busy,
so I will be direct with you.

469
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:35,268
We want to talk

470
00:30:35,872 --> 00:30:39,676
about the new house.

471
00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:42,368
Here's the thing.

472
00:30:43,077 --> 00:30:45,916
Moli told us

473
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:48,864
that you wanted our financial support.

474
00:30:49,477 --> 00:30:50,400
But we refused.

475
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,416
Moli didn't tell me about this.

476
00:31:04,717 --> 00:31:08,957
Jincao, you're my son-in-law,

477
00:31:08,957 --> 00:31:11,876
and we're both the man of the family.

478
00:31:12,636 --> 00:31:16,608
Today, I'll just lay it out straight,
even if it sounds harsh.

479
00:31:17,436 --> 00:31:20,717
When you married Moli,

480
00:31:20,717 --> 00:31:24,864
your parents refused our good intentions
of chipping in to buy a house.

481
00:31:25,477 --> 00:31:27,557
But in the end,

482
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:30,944
your parents bought a tiny house
for you.

483
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:37,957
Besides, my daughter's name isn't even
on the property deed.

484
00:31:38,636 --> 00:31:41,436
Jincao, do you admit

485
00:31:41,436 --> 00:31:44,512
that your parents have never
respected Moli from the start?

486
00:31:50,396 --> 00:31:52,832
I admit the house is a bit small.

487
00:31:53,797 --> 00:31:59,552
But my parents gave them all
to buy it for me.

488
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:03,264
I am very grateful to my parents.

489
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:10,016
But they're very entrenched in some
of their ideas. I can't persuade them.

490
00:32:11,156 --> 00:32:12,676
What kind of ideas?

491
00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:16,436
Frankly, your parents are afraid
that my daughter

492
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:19,517
will take advantage of your family.

493
00:32:20,797 --> 00:32:22,144
That's not what they mean.

494
00:32:23,237 --> 00:32:26,037
Jincao, we all know

495
00:32:26,037 --> 00:32:27,997
that's exactly what your parents mean.

496
00:32:27,997 --> 00:32:30,116
They never trusted my daughter.

497
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:32,876
They fear she will divorce you one day.

498
00:32:35,156 --> 00:32:37,916
Put yourself in my shoes.
If you were me,

499
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:42,368
and someone didn't respect Ke,
what would you think?

500
00:32:43,037 --> 00:32:44,517
Wouldn't you be angry?

501
00:32:52,196 --> 00:32:57,696
And you know how much Moli has suffered
since she married you.

502
00:33:02,757 --> 00:33:05,664
She truly wants to be with you.

503
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:08,544
But how did your family treat her?

504
00:33:12,717 --> 00:33:15,712
Dad, it's all my fault.

505
00:33:16,436 --> 00:33:19,356
But rest assured,
I will work harder to earn money.

506
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:22,436
I will manage to make things better

507
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:24,037
and give Moli a good life.

508
00:33:24,037 --> 00:33:26,757
Jincao, I believe in your abilities.

509
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:29,676
But given the current housing prices,

510
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:32,077
if you think you can buy a bigger house

511
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,557
by working harder,

512
00:33:34,557 --> 00:33:36,836
that would also be when pigs fly.

513
00:33:37,997 --> 00:33:40,876
Do you think if you sell the house
and we give you some money,

514
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:43,328
you could just buy a bigger house?

515
00:33:44,396 --> 00:33:45,717
I have my doubts.

516
00:33:50,037 --> 00:33:53,600
You don't have a say
in selling your current house.

517
00:33:56,356 --> 00:33:57,396
I do.

518
00:33:57,396 --> 00:33:59,264
Okay, even if you do,

519
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:03,456
we won't agree to buy a house
together with your family.

520
00:34:06,436 --> 00:34:08,096
Do you understand?

521
00:34:19,276 --> 00:34:22,848
Yes. So, you mean
the house can be bought,

522
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,736
but only Moli's name is on the deed?

523
00:34:25,477 --> 00:34:29,596
See, Jincao is sensible.

524
00:34:29,596 --> 00:34:31,236
That's what we're thinking.

525
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,397
Jincao, back then,

526
00:34:33,397 --> 00:34:38,276
your parents were afraid
Moli would take advantage of you.

527
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:42,144
Now, I hope
they can put themselves in my shoes.

528
00:34:43,477 --> 00:34:47,196
Let's be fair, alright?

529
00:34:48,957 --> 00:34:49,997
Okay.

530
00:34:50,877 --> 00:34:55,437
In this case, I'll write a declaration
and get it notarized.

531
00:34:55,437 --> 00:34:57,037
No matter what happens,

532
00:34:57,037 --> 00:34:59,680
this house will forever belong to Moli.

533
00:35:00,357 --> 00:35:02,636
Don't bother. Gu.

534
00:35:12,716 --> 00:35:13,397
Here.

535
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,477
We've already consulted someone
and drafted an agreement.

536
00:35:18,477 --> 00:35:22,397
Take a look, and if there's no problem,
just sign and put your fingerprint.

537
00:35:30,676 --> 00:35:35,392
Well, we do it just for my daughter.

538
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,756
I just hope she can live in her own home

539
00:35:38,756 --> 00:35:42,752
at ease and with dignity.

540
00:35:44,236 --> 00:35:46,688
you can understand, right?

541
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:50,557
Yes, I can.

542
00:36:02,437 --> 00:36:03,957
I have a request.

543
00:36:03,957 --> 00:36:05,557
What is it?

544
00:36:08,756 --> 00:36:12,397
Don't let my parents know about it.

545
00:36:12,397 --> 00:36:15,156
Rest assured,
it's just between the three of us.

546
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:16,477
Moli doesn't need to know either.

547
00:36:16,477 --> 00:36:17,716
Sure.

548
00:36:32,397 --> 00:36:35,997
(I signed without even reading it.)

549
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:38,196
(As long as Moli's parents are happy)

550
00:36:39,276 --> 00:36:42,796
(and nobody fights, I can do anything.)

551
00:36:50,837 --> 00:36:52,397
This way, please.

552
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:56,917
This piece is called Infinite 13
by Xu Dongrong.

553
00:37:02,796 --> 00:37:03,796
Excuse me for a minute.

554
00:37:09,116 --> 00:37:11,008
Check your account right away.

555
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,248
(Ms. Wu Yulan has transferred
2,600,000 yuan to your account.)

556
00:37:36,596 --> 00:37:37,877
Hello?

557
00:37:38,596 --> 00:37:42,077
That's over two million.
Have you changed your mind?

558
00:37:42,957 --> 00:37:45,877
I can't just watch you in trouble
and not help.

559
00:37:47,437 --> 00:37:49,357
Mom, you're so good to me.

560
00:37:49,997 --> 00:37:52,077
Did you just know it?

561
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,236
Moli, remember, in any case,

562
00:37:56,796 --> 00:38:00,448
the ones who care about you the most
are your parents.

563
00:38:01,756 --> 00:38:05,077
Anyway, Jincao
and I borrow the money from you.

564
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:07,357
Once we're well off,
we will pay you back.

565
00:38:08,557 --> 00:38:11,957
Don't be silly. No need to pay back.

566
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:14,592
Whether to accept it is your decision,
but we will pay you back.

567
00:38:15,156 --> 00:38:16,276
Ms. Gu.

568
00:38:17,037 --> 00:38:17,796
Right here.

569
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,316
You do your work. I gotta go.

570
00:38:22,437 --> 00:38:23,796
Thank you, Mom.

571
00:38:44,557 --> 00:38:46,877
Honey, I have good news.

572
00:38:46,877 --> 00:38:49,716
My mom has transferred money to me.

573
00:38:49,716 --> 00:38:51,636
We can select the house tomorrow.

574
00:38:51,636 --> 00:38:53,596
Really? That's great.

575
00:38:53,596 --> 00:38:55,636
Yeah, my parents are so good to me.

576
00:38:55,636 --> 00:38:57,676
Yes, they are.

577
00:38:58,196 --> 00:39:00,676
Why do you seem a little unhappy?

578
00:39:00,676 --> 00:39:02,596
Come on. I'm happy for you.

579
00:39:02,596 --> 00:39:03,196
Really?

580
00:39:03,196 --> 00:39:03,796
Yeah.

581
00:39:04,877 --> 00:39:10,196
Well, don't put my name
on the deed this time.

582
00:39:11,676 --> 00:39:14,716
I mean, only put your name on it.

583
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:15,957
Why?

584
00:39:17,517 --> 00:39:22,156
Because your name is not
on the deed of this house.

585
00:39:22,156 --> 00:39:23,796
I feel quite guilty about it.

586
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:26,880
So, I'll take this opportunity
to show my loyalty to you.

587
00:39:28,397 --> 00:39:30,477
That's it. I'm taking a shower.

588
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:54,496
(Relinquishment of Property Ownership)

589
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,324
(Relinquishment of Property Ownership)

590
00:40:03,456 --> 00:40:04,192
(Zhu Jincao)

591
00:40:15,636 --> 00:40:19,276
When I was young,
my emotions often got the best of me.

592
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:23,837
I had many bad emotions to vent.

593
00:40:25,477 --> 00:40:27,357
Emotions are like this ball.

594
00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:31,104
Every time I threw it hard,
it bounced back.

595
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:35,196
In the end, it was I who got hurt.

596
00:40:37,077 --> 00:40:38,636
Later, I began to understand

597
00:40:40,877 --> 00:40:44,596
that I must learn
to befriend my emotions.

598
00:40:45,796 --> 00:40:48,800
I can't ignore them
or be controlled by them.

599
00:40:49,877 --> 00:40:53,357
Adults must learn
to stabilize their emotions.

600
00:40:57,636 --> 00:41:01,917
Most women are more emotional than men.

601
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:09,756
I agree with him. In marriage,
we shouldn't be too self-centered

602
00:41:09,756 --> 00:41:12,676
or self-willed.
We should see the bigger picture.

603
00:41:13,557 --> 00:41:16,397
According to the Law
of Emotional Stability,

604
00:41:16,397 --> 00:41:20,557
I'm in charge of getting emotions out.

605
00:41:20,557 --> 00:41:21,877
I'm responsible for stabilizing them.

606
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,008
(The Law of Emotional Stability)

607
00:41:34,596 --> 00:41:36,224
When you refused to buy a house

608
00:41:36,224 --> 00:41:39,557
(Relinquishment of Property Ownership)
with Zhu Jincao or lend me money,

609
00:41:39,557 --> 00:41:41,248
I was indeed unhappy about it.

610
00:41:41,997 --> 00:41:43,680
But later I understood your thoughts.

611
00:41:44,596 --> 00:41:46,397
And then you changed your mind.

612
00:41:46,397 --> 00:41:47,712
I thought you were considerate of me.

613
00:41:48,316 --> 00:41:51,236
Unexpectedly, you humiliated Zhu Jincao
behind my back.

614
00:41:51,957 --> 00:41:55,037
Do you have to be so harsh?

615
00:41:55,037 --> 00:41:56,832
We didn't humiliate him.

616
00:41:57,796 --> 00:42:02,796
It was Zhu Jincao's idea,
and we just said yes.

617
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:04,800
You never truly saw him as one of us.

618
00:42:05,716 --> 00:42:08,596
The Zhu family didn't treat you
as one of them.

619
00:42:08,596 --> 00:42:09,504
Exactly.

620
00:42:10,077 --> 00:42:12,352
So, you are the same as his parents?

621
00:42:13,357 --> 00:42:15,397
Moli, calm down.

622
00:42:15,397 --> 00:42:19,877
You think it's inconsiderate
to ask Zhu Jincao

623
00:42:19,877 --> 00:42:21,116
to notarize this agreement.

624
00:42:21,116 --> 00:42:22,276
Isn't it?

625
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:24,156
But have you thought about it?

626
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,316
You want a bigger house.

627
00:42:27,316 --> 00:42:30,596
Even if we support you,
you still can't get your way.

628
00:42:30,596 --> 00:42:31,488
Exactly.

629
00:42:32,037 --> 00:42:34,116
Believe it or not,

630
00:42:34,116 --> 00:42:36,672
your small house cannot be sold

631
00:42:37,437 --> 00:42:40,357
because Zhu Jincao's dad
will never agree.

632
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:43,040
Zhu Jincao can't decide for his dad.

633
00:42:43,596 --> 00:42:45,236
That's their family's business.

634
00:42:45,236 --> 00:42:48,224
Zhu Jincao is your son-in-law
and my husband.

635
00:42:48,957 --> 00:42:52,512
You're hurting not only him but also me.

636
00:42:55,037 --> 00:42:58,156
Zhu Jincao is so untrustworthy.

637
00:42:58,156 --> 00:43:00,256
I can't believe he complained about it.

638
00:43:01,196 --> 00:43:04,256
He didn't say anything.
I found it out myself.

639
00:43:22,997 --> 00:43:24,608
Sir, what do you do?

640
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,877
Head of the Publicity Department
at the machinery factory.

641
00:43:27,877 --> 00:43:30,596
No wonder you have a temperament.

642
00:43:30,596 --> 00:43:32,397
Are you here for a meeting?

643
00:43:34,116 --> 00:43:35,037
Going home.

644
00:43:35,037 --> 00:43:38,397
I didn't realize it.
I thought you were a stranger here.

645
00:43:38,397 --> 00:43:41,756
Never judge a book by its cover.

646
00:43:41,756 --> 00:43:45,196
No, I didn't.
After all, I'm not a local either.
