00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:52,971
She said she was at the door?

20
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:07,970
Did you see her?

21
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,131
You didn't pay.

22
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:11,131
I'm coming.

23
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,530
Gao Xiajing.

24
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,770
(Trust Lovely Pet Hospital)
Do you need anything?

25
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,210
- Here's the thing.
- Gao Xiajing.

26
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,731
Mr. Zhu,

27
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,891
what are you doing here?

28
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:14,331
I was about to ask you.

29
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,930
What are you doing here?

30
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:17,810
Oh, right.

31
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,250
Mimi is in heat.

32
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,930
I brought her
to the hospital to get spayed.

33
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,090
She's stayed here for two days.

34
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,770
I came to take her home today.

35
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,851
Hello, I'm Mimi's owner.

36
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:28,171
Could you please check for me

37
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:29,810
how Mimi's doing?

38
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,930
She had the surgery
the day before yesterday, right?

39
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,490
Right.

40
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:33,650
I'll check for you.

41
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,451
Okay.

42
00:03:38,571 --> 00:03:41,451
Is Mimi the one
that Dr. Duan operated on?

43
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,851
Yes, that's right.

44
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,530
Could you please take a look?

45
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,050
If she has recovered well,

46
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,611
could you help pack her things?

47
00:03:47,611 --> 00:03:48,970
I'm taking her home today.

48
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,411
Alright, please wait a moment.

49
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:51,250
Thank you.

50
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,650
What a coincidence, Mr. Zhu,

51
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,131
to run into you here.

52
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,050
Did you drive here today?

53
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:00,891
Yes, I did.

54
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,650
That's great.

55
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,210
As you know,

56
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,851
many drivers

57
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,050
are unwilling to let kittens
ride in the backseat.

58
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,090
Given Mimi's condition now,

59
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,411
I can't bear to put her in the trunk.

60
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:14,171
I don't know if it's convenient

61
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,891
to catch a ride with you back.

62
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,290
It's not convenient today.

63
00:04:20,691 --> 00:04:21,691
Right.

64
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,491
You're currently suspended
pending investigation.

65
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,811
It's not good to cause you trouble.

66
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:28,530
It will bring you a bad reputation.

67
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,970
Besides,

68
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,290
your ex-wife wouldn't be happy.

69
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,251
It's still best
to avoid any impropriety.

70
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,090
I won't trouble you.

71
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,610
I'll go in and check on Mimi.

72
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:41,051
Goodbye.

73
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:00,970
Moli.

74
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:04,530
Where is she?

75
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,850
You couldn't catch up
with you running so fast just now?

76
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,571
It's not the point.

77
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,251
It's that I'm still not certain.

78
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,251
Uncertain about what?

79
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:18,410
I met Gao Xiajing.

80
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:21,811
See?

81
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:25,170
So what do you think now?

82
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:27,850
I'm definitely suspicious of her.

83
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:29,331
But you know what?

84
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:30,970
The explanation she just gave me

85
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,850
was really flawless.

86
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,891
Those words

87
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:36,051
were all delivered with a tone
and rhythm that felt right.

88
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:38,251
She even said she wanted
to take my car home.

89
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:39,290
It must have been her.

90
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:41,290
It can't be that coincidental.

91
00:05:41,451 --> 00:05:42,331
Just think about it.

92
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:44,011
You were just sitting by the window.

93
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,491
She was standing
on the overpass opposite.

94
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:46,530
She must have seen you.

95
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,850
And she must have seen me too.

96
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,011
How clever she is!

97
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:50,530
She could realize at a glance

98
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,410
that you're the bait and I'm the hunter.

99
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,811
So she turned around and left,

100
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,051
refusing to meet.

101
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,210
Is it really that terrible?

102
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:58,970
You're convinced it's her?

103
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,970
Zhu Jincao,

104
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,571
she's not as great as you think.

105
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:05,730
Yes, Moli.

106
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,451
I admit it.

107
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,770
I feel sympathy for her.

108
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,251
Think about it.

109
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:11,811
A woman raising a child

110
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:13,170
and struggling in this city on her own.

111
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,491
It's not easy at all.

112
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,691
I really can't imagine it.

113
00:06:15,691 --> 00:06:17,451
If she really is Insomniac Gale,

114
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:19,210
that would be so frightening.

115
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:24,331
You just don't understand women.

116
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,931
Have you ever thought about it?

117
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:29,730
If you hadn't forgotten
your status or responsibilities,

118
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,331
whether it was Insomniac Gale

119
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:32,530
or Gao Xiajing,

120
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,170
or the two of them together,

121
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:37,650
they wouldn't have hurt you at all.

122
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,730
Let alone hurt me.

123
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,290
Hello?

124
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,691
Hello.

125
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:50,891
Okay, okay.

126
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,410
I'll be right there.

127
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,051
I have to go now.

128
00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:00,051
I'll drive you.

129
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,371
No need.

130
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,210
Sir, hello.

131
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,491
May I know how I can help you?

132
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,371
I'd like to ask,

133
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,610
have you seen this cat around here?

134
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,011
It lives nearby and is called Mimi.

135
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:43,850
Take a look.

136
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,170
Mimi belongs to Ms. Gao

137
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,210
who lives in the neighborhood.

138
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:48,931
Right.

139
00:07:48,931 --> 00:07:49,610
What's wrong?

140
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,891
I want to ask,

141
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:52,290
was its sterilization surgery

142
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,691
done here?

143
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:54,770
Yes.

144
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,290
Ms. Gao just brought
it here a few days ago

145
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:57,371
for the surgery.

146
00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:58,811
It's recovering quite well.

147
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:09,970
Who is it?

148
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:21,850
Mr. Zhu.

149
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,850
Can I help you?

150
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,610
I have something to ask you.

151
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:28,571
Come in then.

152
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,291
What is it?

153
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,411
Sit.

154
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:53,811
I talked to Gao Xiajing.

155
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,890
Listen to this.

156
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,850
Where was
Mimi's sterilization surgery done?

157
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,411
In the Trust Lovely Pet Hospital.

158
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,691
Didn't we see each other there that day?

159
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:12,730
Are you sure?

160
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,890
Of course.

161
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,171
How do you explain this?

162
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:29,171
I went to the Aibao Pet Hospital

163
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:31,051
near the entrance gate and asked.

164
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,651
The surgery was done there.

165
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,970
So that day, you went to the cafe

166
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,010
for me, right?

167
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:46,490
I admit it.

168
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,890
Mimi's sterilization surgery

169
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,531
was done at the Aibao Pet Hospital

170
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:52,411
at the entrance of our community.

171
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,451
That day,

172
00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:57,931
I happened to run into you

173
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,691
and Gu Moli at the cafe.

174
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:04,730
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,931
I lied to you at that time.

176
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:10,250
But I just

177
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,451
didn't want to get caught
between you and Gu Moli.

178
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:14,451
That's all.

179
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,331
So you are Insomniac Gale, right?

180
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:21,571
What's that?

181
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:24,610
Would you like to show me your phone?

182
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,651
I want to take a look

183
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:28,451
at your usernames.

184
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:30,171
Do you distrust me that much?

185
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:30,890
Yes.

186
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,090
Okay.

187
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:42,210
Here.

188
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:56,970
Is it there?

189
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,370
Did you find it?

190
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,610
Did you find the username,
Insomniac Gale?

191
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,171
You know

192
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:06,691
I am a single mother.

193
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,010
I'm busy with work and my child

194
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,090
every day.

195
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,771
I don't have time to play games.

196
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,130
Have I told you

197
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,130
Insomniac Gale and I

198
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,850
got to know each other through a game?

199
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:39,571
Where is the phone you use for gaming?

200
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,451
Where is it? Hidden away?

201
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,210
Why do you force me to admit it?

202
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,171
Why did you do that?

203
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,610
Why did you snap pictures
of Gu Moli at the gym?

204
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,171
Why did you spread those rumors

205
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:57,571
on the public account?

206
00:11:57,771 --> 00:11:59,291
Why did you send Moli
that anonymous message

207
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,130
on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival?

208
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:01,970
Why?

209
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:05,451
To keep my family from getting together?

210
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:07,890
You know that Ke can't eat ice cream.

211
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,970
Why did you let her eat so much?

212
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,051
What on earth do you want?

213
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:12,250
What are your intentions?

214
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,850
You're already divorced.

215
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:17,090
Why do you still take
Gu Moli's side all the time?

216
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,531
Yes, I am divorced.

217
00:12:18,811 --> 00:12:19,651
I am divorced,

218
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:20,811
but Gu Moli is my ex-wife,

219
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:21,730
my family.

220
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,090
I'm divorced, but Ke is always my child.

221
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,850
You used such insidious means
against them.

222
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,291
Do you think I wouldn't care?

223
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:30,850
Gao Xiajing,

224
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:32,490
I think

225
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,571
I have never done bad things

226
00:12:33,571 --> 00:12:34,771
to you, right?

227
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:35,811
Zhu Jincao,

228
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,451
you really don't understand

229
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:39,051
why I did it?

230
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,451
Because I like you.

231
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,171
I posted the gym photos online

232
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:50,531
because someone wanted to slander you,

233
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,210
and I wanted to speak out for you.

234
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:54,451
At the Mid-Autumn Festival,

235
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:56,370
Ke ate the ice cream I made.

236
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,571
I really didn't mean it.

237
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,090
I thought about telling you,

238
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,490
but I was afraid.

239
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,090
I was afraid you would misunderstand me.

240
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,571
I was afraid Gu Moli
would make trouble for me.

241
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:07,970
I also admit

242
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,610
I sent the anonymous messages online.

243
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,890
But

244
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:15,571
I just wanted Gu Moli to understand it.

245
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,090
I wanted her to realize

246
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:21,370
who is truly right for you

247
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:22,890
and who truly loves you.

248
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:25,370
You are so good, so outstanding,

249
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,890
but she doesn't cherish you at all

250
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,010
and also doesn't let you go.

251
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,531
I wanted to make her give up.

252
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:33,531
But I never hid it from you

253
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:35,051
from the very beginning.

254
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,730
All I think about is only her.

255
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,730
I love only her.

256
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:51,691
Have you

257
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:56,490
never liked me at all?

258
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,171
Not in the past, not now,

259
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,691
and definitely not in the future.

260
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,130
It will never happen.

261
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,010
But I like you.

262
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:05,970
Even if you don't care about me,

263
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:09,970
I will still worry about you
and defend you at every turn.

264
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,850
I carefully protect

265
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,130
my feelings for you.

266
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:15,490
But what do you take me for?

267
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,411
A homewrecker.

268
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,010
A bad woman.

269
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:24,771
Why do you keep helping me?

270
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:27,370
Time and again, you offer me
warmth when I need it.

271
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,610
Why?

272
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,010
I don't believe

273
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:33,651
adult men can be friends with women.

274
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:36,451
You're just afraid to admit
that you like me, right?

275
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:37,331
Stop it.

276
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:42,970
Don't use this absurd logic of yours

277
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,331
to coerce me, okay?

278
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,411
Your words make me sick.

279
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:48,571
Sick?

280
00:14:53,411 --> 00:14:55,451
You think I'm disgusting now?

281
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:58,771
How can you stand

282
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:01,130
on a moral high ground to humiliate me?

283
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,451
I am also a woman.

284
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:04,291
I am a mother.

285
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,331
Why do you have to
humiliate me like this?

286
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:10,411
Fine, I'll ask you.

287
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,651
Don't you and Gu Moli

288
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:13,291
have any problems?

289
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:14,850
You keep saying

290
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,811
you trust each other
and there are no grudges between you.

291
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:19,291
Then why did you divorce?

292
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,090
Can't you just live a good life?

293
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,691
If you trusted each other,

294
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:23,651
why would your marriage

295
00:15:23,651 --> 00:15:25,771
come to this point today?

296
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:27,490
No matter how bad things are

297
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,130
between Gu Moli and me,

298
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:32,490
it is not your place

299
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,970
to make comments.

300
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,490
They are my family

301
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:40,691
for life.

302
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,651
If you use such despicable means

303
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,571
against them,

304
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,411
I will never let you off.

305
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,571
Why don't you say anything?

306
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:28,931
What should I say?

307
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,210
During this time,
because of Gao Xiajing,

308
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,931
a misunderstanding
has arisen between us.

309
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,771
But you heard it too.

310
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,730
Whether it's Gao Xiajing

311
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,610
or Insomniac Gale,

312
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,250
I haven't done anything out of line.

313
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,291
Gao Xiajing got
one thing right in all this.

314
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,210
If there's no grudge between us,

315
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:54,610
and we trust each other completely,

316
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,811
even if there were a hundred others

317
00:16:56,811 --> 00:16:58,210
like Gao Xiajing,

318
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,691
they couldn't break us apart.

319
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,331
I have said the same thing
to you before.

320
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:09,170
You remember, don't you?

321
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:13,890
Leaving Gao Xiajing aside,

322
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:17,291
it was you who went
to meet an online friend

323
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,130
and tracked my phone.

324
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:29,051
I admit I was wrong.

325
00:17:31,331 --> 00:17:32,571
Starting today,

326
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:36,930
I will reflect carefully
on the problems between us.

327
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,690
I really will change.

328
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,370
Will you give me another chance?

329
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,291
I am also to blame

330
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,130
in all this.

331
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:57,370
I should not have doubted you.

332
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,731
In the quiet of the night,

333
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:01,410
I often reflect on myself

334
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,491
and our relationship.

335
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:06,291
We both have given our all,

336
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,370
but why have we still
come to this point today?

337
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,450
We have doubted each other,

338
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:13,450
hurt each other,

339
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,051
shown our claws to each other,

340
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:21,291
and exposed our worst sides.

341
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:24,650
Now, we are both covered in scars.

342
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:31,450
So tired.

343
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,690
I regret going to Jinshan.

344
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:50,610
Turns out long-distance relationships

345
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:53,971
can really lead to misunderstandings

346
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,690
and they

347
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,690
snowball.

348
00:19:00,491 --> 00:19:02,130
I want to transfer back from Jinshan.

349
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:04,531
Can we start over,

350
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:06,051
okay?

351
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,890
You're doing well in Jinshan.

352
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:17,410
Distance has created issues between us,

353
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,890
but it can also help us calm down.

354
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:29,410
Let's both think this through.

355
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:40,170
Those middle-aged ones

356
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,090
who pretend to work in the cafes,

357
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:44,930
the subway stations
and on the park benches.

358
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,450
What they fear most

359
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:49,690
is not the ridicule of colleagues

360
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:52,890
or the coldness of friends.

361
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:56,811
They just don't have
the courage to tell their families

362
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,771
they've lost their jobs.

363
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:03,650
Because sharing their pain
with family members

364
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,051
only doubles

365
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,771
the trouble.

366
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,531
So they can only keep it to themselves,

367
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:17,011
even if they feel they can't continue.

368
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:21,251
But one day,

369
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:23,771
if you find the one

370
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:25,650
who's been through
thick and thin with you

371
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,251
is going to leave you behind

372
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:31,130
because you can't hold the umbrella

373
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:34,771
and get wet in the rain,

374
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,491
what would you think?

375
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,571
Can you hold on any longer?

(Fair-Weather Couple)

377
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,531
Who is it?

378
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,130
Ms. Wang.

379
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,610
It's time to pay the rent.

380
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,491
You don't answer my calls
or reply to my messages.

381
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:34,571
What are you up to?

382
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,690
Sorry about that, Ms. Wang.

383
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:38,450
I didn't mean to ignore you.

384
00:21:38,571 --> 00:21:40,771
I've been too busy these past few days.

385
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:43,410
Can you give me one more week?

386
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,771
I will pay you next week.

387
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:47,251
No need. Life is not easy for you.

388
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:49,531
I don't want to come over

389
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:50,731
to hurry you for the rent anymore

390
00:21:50,971 --> 00:21:52,090
or act like

391
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,090
I am bullying a single mother.

392
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,170
How about this?

393
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,211
Pack up your stuff

394
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,850
and move out before next week.

395
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,811
Ms. Wang,

396
00:21:58,971 --> 00:22:00,890
you've taken special care of
my child and me.

397
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,170
I am very grateful to you.

398
00:22:02,211 --> 00:22:03,571
Just one week, please.

399
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:05,531
Let me think of a solution.

400
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:06,571
Look,

401
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,450
my child's kindergarten is nearby.

402
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,850
If I move out straight away,

403
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,610
he may have to drop out.

404
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,251
That's none of my business.

405
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,650
You've already fallen behind
half a month's rent.

406
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,491
Fine, I don't want the money.

407
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,690
Consider it my last act
of kindness towards you.

408
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,251
Pack up your things and move right away.

409
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,610
I will have the lock changed next week.

410
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,410
That's it.

411
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,491
Ms. Wang.

412
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:32,856
(Gynecology 2)

413
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,531
Doctor, is there any bad news?

414
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,690
Please tell me the truth.

415
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:54,930
It's not bad news.

416
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,690
Don't worry unnecessarily
at your young age.

417
00:22:57,331 --> 00:22:58,571
Benign cyst.

418
00:22:58,571 --> 00:23:00,051
Pay attention to your diet in the future

419
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,331
and have regular check-ups.

420
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,211
Check-ups.

421
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,011
That's to say,

422
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:09,251
I don't have to die just yet.

423
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:10,531
What are you talking about?

424
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:12,930
Progesterone does affect cysts.

425
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,090
But now, medical science
is very advanced.

426
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,971
You don't need
to worry excessively about this.

427
00:23:16,971 --> 00:23:19,051
Just maintain a good lifestyle.

428
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,571
Now that you're going to be a mother,

429
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,011
you must take good care of
your health first.

430
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:26,410
Go to bed early and wake up early,
and you must quit drinking, okay?

431
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:28,610
Don't worry.

432
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:30,571
The arrival of new life is always good.

433
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:31,650
Congratulations.

434
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:33,370
Doctor,

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,771

436
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,211

Allen,

I know it's night there,

469
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:33,291
but I have to trouble you

470
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,410
with something very important.

471
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,850
I have a friend who has cancer.

472
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,410
I know that St. George's Hospital

473
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,211
is globally renowned
for cervical cancer treatment.

474
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,571
Could you help me get in touch
with a specialist in that field?

475
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:45,491
Thank you.

This apartment is pretty good.

477
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,051
Living quite comfortably, aren't you?

478
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:00,610
You.

479
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,011
How could you

480
00:26:02,011 --> 00:26:02,811
call me,

481
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,531
asking for alimony
in the middle of the night?

482
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:05,890
I've never seen anyone like you.

483
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,130
I've heard
you live-streaming internet celebrities

484
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:11,890
can make quite a lot of money

485
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,090
and get rich quick.

486
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:14,370
I was even thinking about

487
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,811
asking you for financial help.

488
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,410
Why are you still asking me for money?

489
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:18,890
Alright, enough.

490
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,251
Stop making that face.

491
00:26:20,771 --> 00:26:21,890
Isn't it money that you want?

492
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,531
Count it. Several thousand.

493
00:26:32,011 --> 00:26:32,930
Chen Xiaodong,

494
00:26:33,571 --> 00:26:34,610
have you no shame?

495
00:26:34,771 --> 00:26:36,291
What I want is alimony.

496
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,690
You gave me gift cards again.

497
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:38,971
What's wrong with them?

498
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:40,650
Aren't they money?

499
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:42,531
Can't you use them to buy things?

500
00:26:42,971 --> 00:26:43,930
If you don't want them,

501
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,491
you can sell them to card collectors

502
00:26:45,491 --> 00:26:46,571
to get cash.

503
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,771
Then won't you get money?

504
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,531
Let me tell you.

505
00:26:48,531 --> 00:26:49,731
Don't talk to me like that.

506
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,650
Now, it's you who's asking me for money.

507
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,571
I'm giving you money, understand?

508
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,051
Do you believe

509
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,650
I could sue you for that?

510
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,850
Go ahead.

511
00:26:58,331 --> 00:26:59,610
I have been waiting for that.

512
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,971
I'm so fed up

513
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:01,971
with your constant demands.

514
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:03,571
Let me remind you.

515
00:27:03,731 --> 00:27:05,890
Don't call me in the middle
of the night again.

516
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,450
My wife won't be pleased.

517
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:42,650
It's not suitable

518
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,771
for you to eat
such oily, spicy food now.

519
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,450
At this stage I'm in,

520
00:27:57,971 --> 00:27:59,610
I eat whatever I want.

521
00:28:08,331 --> 00:28:09,090
Liuliu,

522
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,011
you must pull yourself together.

523
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:12,811
You're still young now.

524
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:14,930
With active cooperation with treatment,
there's still hope.

525
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:15,850
And

526
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,331
a good mood

527
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:19,170
is the best medicine
for treating cancer.

528
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:20,331
I'm not talking nonsense.

529
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,890
That is scientifically based.

530
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,051
I understand you are

531
00:28:26,051 --> 00:28:27,291
in an emotional turmoil.

532
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:28,370
I've thought it over.

533
00:28:28,491 --> 00:28:29,890
If it can't be cured here,

534
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:30,971
we can go abroad.

535
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,011
I just called my friend working

536
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:33,890
as a doctor abroad.

537
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,410
We can leave at any time.

538
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,971
You don't have to worry about the cost.

539
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,771
I will help you share the burden.

540
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:40,370
Why do you want
to help me share the burden?

541
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,930
What is our relationship now?

542
00:28:42,051 --> 00:28:45,170
Friends, boyfriend and girlfriend,
or ex-boyfriend and girlfriend?

543
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:46,571
Do you pity me?

544
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,610
No.

545
00:28:47,771 --> 00:28:49,170
That's not what I meant.

546
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:50,610
I mean...

547
00:28:53,051 --> 00:28:54,450
I want to face it together with you.

548
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,090
Wang Lingxiao,

549
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,850
I don't have cancer.

550
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,610
It's just a benign cyst.

551
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,811
I am having hot pot today

552
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:19,650
to celebrate it.

553
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,491
Thank you.

554
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,051
Thank you for caring about me

555
00:29:26,211 --> 00:29:27,731

00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,571

557
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,011
You treat me to this meal today.

558
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,650
Zhu Jincao has completely
let you down, hasn't he?

559
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,610
I told you long ago,

560
00:29:47,011 --> 00:29:48,571
men are unreliable.

561
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,331
So, are you reliable?

562
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:51,610
No.

563
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,331
But money can be relied upon.

564
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:57,850
There are no eternal friends
in the world,

565
00:29:57,971 --> 00:29:59,771
only eternal interests.

566
00:29:59,811 --> 00:30:02,370
It is a wise move to contact me.

567
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,291
There's great potential
in our cooperation.

568
00:30:05,731 --> 00:30:07,370
Can you help me make money?

569
00:30:08,571 --> 00:30:12,090
I need money, lots of it.

570
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,971
That's my strong suit.

571
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:16,251
To be honest,

572
00:30:16,971 --> 00:30:20,291
because of Zhu Jincao,
and thanks to you,

573
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,610
I had to leave Jinying Live.

574
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,090
But I already wanted
to do it before that.

575
00:30:25,211 --> 00:30:26,650
Because their way of making money

576
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,291
is just too old-fashioned.

577
00:30:28,771 --> 00:30:31,331
It would be an eternity
before I could become a millionaire.

578
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,130
I've been looking for

579
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,731
a partner who can
strike it rich with me.

580
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:39,531
I think you are
a very suitable candidate.

581
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,890
Put it simply.

582
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:43,610
How can I make money
as soon as possible?

583
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,850
Do as I say,

584
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,170
and you'll make
half a million in six months.

585
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,331
Don't bluff me. I'm not a child.

586
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,650
I urgently need
to provide for my family.

587
00:30:54,571 --> 00:30:55,531
Let's put it this way.

588
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,811
Due to the scandal,

589
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,731
the number of your real-time followers

590
00:30:59,731 --> 00:31:01,850
has already reached over 200,000.

591
00:31:01,971 --> 00:31:03,251
You're an internet celebrity now.

592
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,331
But you must understand

593
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:09,211
the ultimate goal
of traffic is to get money.

594
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,971
How do we do it?

595
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,211
By promoting products.

596
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:15,331
Is that okay?

597
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,690
Sure.

598
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:19,291
I've already made a plan.

599
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,571
We will split the profits fifty-fifty.

600
00:31:21,571 --> 00:31:22,811
If you don't earn 500,000

601
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,370
within half a year,

602
00:31:24,571 --> 00:31:25,971
I'll pay you personally.

603
00:31:31,331 --> 00:31:32,571
But to promote products,

604
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,011
you need to maintain
the number of your followers.

605
00:31:35,491 --> 00:31:37,051
How do you do it?

606
00:31:37,251 --> 00:31:41,130
By keeping hyping up your scandal.

607
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,410
If you agree,

608
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:48,170
I can pay you an advance of ten percent.

609
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:01,251
Deal.

610
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,211
Don't rush.

611
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,370
Before that,

612
00:32:06,811 --> 00:32:08,090
I have a condition.

613
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,571
What is it?

614
00:32:11,211 --> 00:32:12,571
I never

615
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,370
let myself take a loss.

616
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:17,531
Those who mess with me,

617
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:19,771
I'll get back at them.

618
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:21,211
So, please

619
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:23,650
testify for me.

620
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:46,811
Let's begin.

621
00:32:48,331 --> 00:32:49,130
Gao Xiajing,

622
00:32:49,811 --> 00:32:51,090
you reported

623
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,850
at the last inquiry, you were coerced

624
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,690
into making a false statement,

625
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,850
so today we are reconvening the inquiry,

626
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,610
and we hope you will tell the truth.

627
00:33:06,571 --> 00:33:07,610
Everyone,

628
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:09,491
I'm sorry.

629
00:33:10,051 --> 00:33:11,811
I didn't tell the truth last time,

630
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,410
but I didn't mean to do it.

631
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,890
As a single mother,

632
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:16,771
I was clearly informed by Zhu Jincao

633
00:33:16,771 --> 00:33:17,971
that he was already divorced,

634
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:19,971
and I had been

635
00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:21,610
meticulously looked after by him.

636
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,571
Gradually, I developed
feelings and admiration for him.

637
00:33:24,811 --> 00:33:26,690
I sincerely wanted to be with him.

638
00:33:27,491 --> 00:33:28,771
But I realized

639
00:33:29,251 --> 00:33:31,331
I was gradually being
mentally controlled by him.

640
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,771
He has seriously affected my life.

641
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:35,090
What are you talking about?

642
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,571
Sit down.

643
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:38,731
Sit down.

644
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:46,690
Do not interrupt her.

645
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:48,850
Continue.

646
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,971
Zhu Jincao told me

647
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,531
as long as I helped him take down

648
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,051
his rival, Liu Zhi,

649
00:33:54,331 --> 00:33:56,051
and resolve the current crisis,

650
00:33:56,051 --> 00:33:57,930
he would marry me.

651
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,410
So

652
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:01,410
I went against my own wishes

653
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,011
and fabricated false accusations
of Mr. Liu Zhi accepting bribes.

654
00:34:08,331 --> 00:34:10,811
Mr. Liu Zhi, I'm sorry.

655
00:34:14,331 --> 00:34:15,291
Everyone,

656
00:34:16,691 --> 00:34:17,811
I do not know

657
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:19,211
why Gao Xiajing

658
00:34:19,211 --> 00:34:20,811
is accusing me today,

659
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:22,691
but there's already evidence

660
00:34:22,691 --> 00:34:24,450
proving that Liu Zhi accepted bribes.

661
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,771
I trust the inquiry team

662
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:27,010
can clear my name.

663
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,450
I'll say it again.

664
00:34:29,131 --> 00:34:30,291
All that evidence

665
00:34:30,811 --> 00:34:32,211
was fabricated.

666
00:34:32,211 --> 00:34:33,731
I believe

667
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,771
you will clear my name.

668
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:37,171
There are some words

669
00:34:37,171 --> 00:34:39,291
Ms. Gao Xiajing is embarrassed to say.

670
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,611
During Zhu Jincao's relationship
with Gao Xiajing,

671
00:34:41,611 --> 00:34:44,291
Ms. Gao chronicled their romance

672
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,651
entirely on her public account.

673
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,691
What exactly is their relationship?

674
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,691
You will know after reading.

675
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,771
Each of my articles

676
00:34:59,251 --> 00:35:01,131
has an exact publication time on it.

677
00:35:01,611 --> 00:35:03,211
We were once so in love,

678
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:05,490
and it was impossible for me so early on

679
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:07,570
to predict that Zhu Jincao and I

680
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,410
would confront each other one day,

681
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,771
let alone plan to frame him

682
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,850
a long time ago

683
00:35:14,251 --> 00:35:16,611
and write those heartfelt articles.

684
00:35:16,691 --> 00:35:18,370
My account itself is the evidence.

685
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,570
I have no regrets

686
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:24,091
because it is all true.

687
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,171
Zhu Jincao,

688
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:36,091
you toyed with me.

689
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,331
Moli.

690
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:57,050
I've seen the trending searches online.

691
00:35:57,331 --> 00:35:59,651
I never expected Gao Xiajing
to distort right and wrong.

692
00:35:59,651 --> 00:36:01,370
She's so crazy.

693
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,291
This is for you.

694
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,291
You even came

695
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,410
for this matter. Thank you.

696
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,530
Cut the crap.

697
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,291
Hurry up and play the recording.

698
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:13,211
Gao Xiajing will be exposed.

699
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,811
Go. What are you waiting for?

700
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,410
I don't want to do that.

701
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:27,331
What do you mean?

702
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,811
Do you know how terrible
cyberbullying is nowadays?

703
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,771
They're all onlookers
who enjoy the drama.

704
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:36,811
I don't want to get involved anymore.

705
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:38,331
I don't want to waste time

706
00:36:38,331 --> 00:36:39,490
arguing with a woman anymore,

707
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,370
making me a laughingstock.

708
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,771
I think it's disgraceful.

709
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:46,171
You don't want to do it with women

710
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,050
or just not with Gao Xiajing?

711
00:36:49,811 --> 00:36:51,811
Zhu Jincao,
are you still sympathetic to her?

712
00:36:52,331 --> 00:36:53,731
No, I'm not.

713
00:36:54,731 --> 00:36:56,171
I pity her child.

714
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,370
Guo is only five.

715
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,010
If this

716
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,890
gets blown up...

717
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,251
So you still care about Gao Xiajing.

718
00:37:08,331 --> 00:37:09,410
Look at me.

719
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:11,651
Can you say

720
00:37:11,651 --> 00:37:14,091
you have never had
feelings for Gao Xiajing

721
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,171
or any improper thoughts?

722
00:37:16,171 --> 00:37:17,291
Never.

723
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:18,131
As if I'd believe that.

724
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:19,771
Moli, please listen to me, okay?

725
00:37:20,651 --> 00:37:22,131
I have thought about it.

726
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,490
I did have some contact

727
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,370
with her in life or at work.

728
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,490
I've also helped her.

729
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,771
Perhaps because of that,

730
00:37:29,771 --> 00:37:31,811
she developed
some misunderstandings about me.

731
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:33,370
Yes.

732
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,331
She did many out-of-line things.

733
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:38,370
But that's not a reason
for me to take revenge on her.

734
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:39,930
Alright, stop talking.

735
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:40,611
I'm not listening.

736
00:37:40,611 --> 00:37:41,930
Moli, don't be so agitated.

737
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:42,570
Calm down.

738
00:37:42,611 --> 00:37:43,930
I can't calm down.

739
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,890
If I make this recording public today,

740
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,251
Gao Xiajing
and her child will be ruined.

741
00:37:58,251 --> 00:37:59,611
This is fighting evil with evil.

742
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:00,731
I don't want to do that.

743
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,970
She's quite strange today.

744
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:07,050
I'm sure there's something going on.

745
00:38:07,731 --> 00:38:08,691
Believe me.

746
00:38:08,691 --> 00:38:10,131
I can handle this matter well.

747
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,850
How noble you are.

748
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,050
I shouldn't have come.

749
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,490
Mr. Bai,

750
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,091
you need me?

751
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,530
Jincao, the matter has been figured out.

752
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:05,811
Liu Zhi did accept bribes

753
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:06,970
in the guild

754
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,930
and has been fired by us.

755
00:39:09,331 --> 00:39:11,731
The company is recovering
the illicit money and goods.

756
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:12,570
Thank you.

757
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,970
Thanks to the inquiry team
for clearing my name.

758
00:39:17,611 --> 00:39:19,091
Truth is truth.

759
00:39:19,171 --> 00:39:21,010
A good person will never be wronged.

760
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,171
Jincao, take it easy.

761
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,050
I know

762
00:39:26,091 --> 00:39:28,570
you may feel wronged

763
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:30,370
and unjustly treated.

764
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:34,970
But the thing between you
and Gao Xiajing

765
00:39:35,091 --> 00:39:36,970
has caused quite a stir

766
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:40,131
and had a bad influence on the company.

767
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,251
If you're fired,

768
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,530
it might affect

769
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,771
your future career.

770
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:57,811
I don't understand.

771
00:39:57,811 --> 00:39:59,091
What do you mean?

772
00:39:59,091 --> 00:40:00,771
What I mean is

773
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:02,771
that I suggest you resign.

774
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,091
What?

775
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,410
I'll share the blame?

776
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:12,930
I am the victim.

777
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:14,291
The victim.

778
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:16,651
The company doesn't care
who the victim is.

779
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:18,211
It just cares about

780
00:40:18,211 --> 00:40:19,970
the negative impact
you caused on itself.

781
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,331
That is true, isn't it?

782
00:40:23,251 --> 00:40:24,530
I

783
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,490
want to keep you,

784
00:40:27,331 --> 00:40:28,890
but I can't.

785
00:40:31,251 --> 00:40:32,570
This is a letter of dismissal.

786
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,850
Don't make it difficult for me.

787
00:40:44,811 --> 00:40:47,651
I have been giving my all
to the company for ten years.

788
00:40:47,731 --> 00:40:48,930
I understand.

789
00:41:35,731 --> 00:41:36,850
You tell them.

790
00:41:37,091 --> 00:41:39,651
It is impossible
for the Puhua Hotel to get ten paintings

791
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:40,651
by Mr. Yan Li.

792
00:41:41,091 --> 00:41:42,850
I'll make it if it's three or fewer.

793
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,691
All right. I'll reply to them this way.

794
00:41:46,691 --> 00:41:47,530
Okay, thank you.

795
00:41:55,621 --> 00:41:59,960
(Zhou Yu)

796
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:03,771
If you don't have anything urgent,

797
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,291
can we talk about it later?

798
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:07,530
I'm crazy busy right now.

799
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,331
This is urgent.

800
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:12,490
I've got a pressing business order.

801
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,091
Please come over right away.

802
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,930
What urgent business could you get?

803
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:18,570
I still have

804
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,211
20 things unfinished today.

805
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:23,010
Put those trivial things aside for now.

806
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,611
You must arrive within 20 minutes.

807
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,890
I guarantee it's worth it.

808
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:29,530
Gu Moli,

809
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,370
you can look down on me,

810
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:34,010
but when it's about business,

811
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,850
I am your client.

812
00:42:36,211 --> 00:42:37,490
Watch your attitude.

813
00:42:39,611 --> 00:42:40,490
I'm coming.

814
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:42,410
If your business

815
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:44,291
can't make me 100 million,

816
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:45,370
just you wait.

817
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,771
Alright, let's eat.

818
00:42:55,731 --> 00:42:57,010
You've been transferred back?

819
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,211
You made a mistake?

820
00:43:02,731 --> 00:43:03,970
I applied for it myself.

821
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:05,211
I felt it was too far from home.

822
00:43:06,611 --> 00:43:08,010
Did you get promoted?

823
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,131
It's a lateral move.

824
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,811
Tech giants

825
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,050
are just private companies
that can't provide stable jobs.

826
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,450
Changing from one thing to another.

827
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,651
Messing around as they please.

828
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:26,291
Alright, just eat your meal.

829
00:43:26,731 --> 00:43:29,370
Isn't it a good thing
that he has been transferred back?

830
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:32,211
Look, my son has lost weight in Jinshan.

831
00:43:32,211 --> 00:43:33,131
Jincao, eat a lot.

832
00:43:33,131 --> 00:43:34,651
I will serve you more.

833
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:36,450
