19
00:01:52,232 --> 00:01:53,472
Thankfully, the bones are fine.

20
00:01:53,472 --> 00:01:55,168
Keep the wound dry.

21
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,839
Don't do any heavy work.
Leave it to your husband.

22
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,400
No, no.

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,880
We're not a couple.

24
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,040
Be careful.

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,719
It's okay.

26
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,799
I got this.

27
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:11,200
I told you it was nothing.

28
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,440
We didn't have to come.

29
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,720
Still, you must be careful.

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,560
My wife sprained her ankle last year.

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,000
We thought it was no big deal,

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,399
but it was a ligament tear.

33
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,840
She was in bed for a month.

34
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:21,609
She's not like you.

35
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:23,208
If it were her,

36
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,088
she'd need at least three fancy meals

37
00:02:25,088 --> 00:02:27,088
plus a month
of pork rib soup to recover.

38
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:30,049
That's because she is well-cared for.

39
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:31,768
I always come to the hospital

40
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:32,768
on my own.

41
00:02:32,768 --> 00:02:33,928
I'm used to it.

42
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:35,889
You know?

43
00:02:35,928 --> 00:02:37,449
Once I fell asleep

44
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,248
during an IV infusion.

45
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:40,329
I woke up and saw blood in the tube.

46
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,088
So dangerous.

47
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,169
Where were the nurses?

48
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:44,329
It was crowded back then.

49
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,449
They didn't notice me.

50
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:46,729
It's understandable.

51
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,688
We've met several times,

52
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:51,129
but I still don't know your name.

53
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,248
I'm Gao Xiajing.

54
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,368
I'm Zhu Jincao.

55
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:58,049
Compared to money,

56
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:00,488
my husband values more

57
00:03:00,488 --> 00:03:02,009
the spiritual connection

58
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:03,528
between the artist

59
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:05,688
and the gallery as well as the agent.

60
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:10,729
Therefore, I've prepared three sketches.

61
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:13,488
I'd like to hear your opinions.

62
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:28,528
Is this a test?

63
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:29,688
You could say that.

64
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:45,049
These three sketches
represent landscapes, streets,

65
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:46,329
and buildings.

66
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:48,129
From a technical standpoint,

67
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:51,409
the first two should be
Mr. Yan's early works.

68
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,329
This last one in progress

69
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:55,088
must have been painted a bit later.

70
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:57,648
These paintings feature
a strong sense of layering,

71
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:00,889
with a great combination
of color and intended blank.

72
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,889
Most importantly,
they have a unique perspective.

73
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:06,609
You searched it online, huh?

74
00:04:10,248 --> 00:04:11,609
It's just my opinion.

75
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:13,528
What about you?

76
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:28,289
Mr. Yan is a master.

77
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:31,049
I won't presume to
comment on the technique here.

78
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:32,328
I'll just try to

79
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:34,928
analyze Mr. Yan's mood
when he painted these.

80
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:37,529
There are no dates signed on them.

81
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:39,409
But I guess the first one

82
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:42,008
was painted when Mr. Yan
first arrived in New York.

83
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:44,448
There's a sense of panic
from leaving one's hometown.

84
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:46,568
So the brushwork is quite tense.

85
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:47,849
This second one

86
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,209
might have been painted

87
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:51,008
after some time in the city.

88
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:53,169
Mr. Yan still had some hope

89
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,649
about settling in.

90
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,688
As for this third piece...

91
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:06,089
Go ahead. It's fine.

92
00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:10,008
It seems like

93
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:12,928
you were in agony while creating it.

94
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:15,488
I don't know if there was any pressure.

95
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,049
It doesn't look like an intended blank.

96
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:19,609
It's more like unfinished.

97
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:35,089
I'm sorry, Mr. Yan.

98
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,609
If I was wrong,

99
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:37,928
please don't feel offended...

100
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:50,769
Mr. Yan.

101
00:05:51,128 --> 00:05:52,688
Mr. Yan, wait.

102
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:03,368
Ke,

103
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,529
your mom is still on her business trip.

104
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:07,729
So she can't join you for burgers today.

105
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:10,368
But I want burgers.

106
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:12,409
Me too.

107
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:14,368
Easy.

108
00:06:14,568 --> 00:06:16,089
We can have burgers.

109
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:17,849
It's on me, okay?

110
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:19,409
Let's have burgers and go home.

111
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:20,008
Okay.

112
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:20,688
Okay.

113
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:22,928
I know a burger place
next to the hospital.

114
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:23,928
It's quite good.

115
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:24,769
Okay.

116
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:27,409
Yan Li just has that kind of temper.

117
00:06:28,248 --> 00:06:30,089
But he got angry

118
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:32,089
not because you were wrong.

119
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:34,169
It was quite the opposite.

120
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:39,769
He just couldn't paint anymore
after he found out

121
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:43,169
I had developed breast cancer.

122
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:46,209
He was rushing

123
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:48,888
to find hospitals for me.

124
00:06:49,448 --> 00:06:52,448
Then came the surgery
to remove the lesion.

125
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:55,089
Then it was the chemotherapy.

126
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:57,409
So how are you doing now?

127
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:00,368
The surgery went quite well.

128
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:01,928
But the chemotherapy

129
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,568
destroyed me.

130
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,128
Yan Li felt very guilty
after he found out

131
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:08,969
that I was sick.

132
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:10,688
He felt that

133
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:12,169
he'd been focused on painting

134
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:13,688
and had failed to look after me.

135
00:07:13,688 --> 00:07:16,888
So he stopped all his work

136
00:07:16,928 --> 00:07:18,849
to take care of me wholeheartedly.

137
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:21,769
But he couldn't do anything

138
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:23,928
apart from painting.

139
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,008
He knows nothing about

140
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:27,928
house chores or socializing.

141
00:07:27,928 --> 00:07:30,008
I used to manage his meals,

142
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:32,888
daily routine, and art-related work.

143
00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:34,289
But now,

144
00:07:34,609 --> 00:07:36,928
he only gets groceries, cooks for me,

145
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:39,409
cleans the room,
and takes me to the doctor.

146
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:41,488
Nothing else.

147
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:43,248
He also told me

148
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:45,969
that he didn't want to paint anymore.

149
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:48,289
So no matter what the gallery

150
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:50,169
offered him as renewal terms,

151
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:52,049
he turned them down outright.

152
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:53,248
He also said that

153
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:54,888
he wanted to take me abroad.

154
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:57,128
Because people will

155
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:59,488
keep approaching him
as long as we stay here.

156
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:01,688
It'd be better to live somewhere

157
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:03,688
where no one knows him.

158
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:04,888
It would be quieter.

159
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:06,409
And I can rest well.

160
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,328
If we really do this,

161
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:11,209
that would mean I've ruined him.

162
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:14,488
His works are renowned

163
00:08:14,688 --> 00:08:17,888
for the scenes
of the Jiangnan water towns.

164
00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:19,609
Where would he find the passion

165
00:08:19,928 --> 00:08:23,089
and inspiration
for his creations if we leave?

166
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:26,409
It would be like cutting off
the root of his inspiration.

167
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:31,289
So I've always wanted a new agent

168
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:32,928
who could help him

169
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:35,489
get back on the right track
with his career.

170
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:36,889
I took his phone

171
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:39,608
and added you behind his back.

172
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:42,369
He was furious when he found out.

173
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,129
I'm truly sorry

174
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:47,728
about what has happened.

175
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:49,688
I was wondering

176
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:52,369
why Mr. Yan would
suddenly be so cold to us.

177
00:08:53,728 --> 00:08:54,968
It seems that

178
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,009
our meeting didn't go very well.

179
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,208
I made you come in vain.

180
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,608
I'm really sorry.

181
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:01,889
It's okay.

182
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,448
I respect Mr. Yan's decision.

183
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:08,249
I just learned about your love story.

184
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,049
I think it's beautiful.

185
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:14,649
Ms. Li.

186
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:16,489
Do you have a minute?

187
00:09:19,448 --> 00:09:20,489
Hello.

188
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:22,129
Here's the popcorn chicken for the kids.

189
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:22,649
Thank you.

190
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:23,728
- Thank you.
- Not with your hands.

191
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:24,529
Use a fork.

192
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:26,568
We have a promotional event

193
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:27,769
for our newly launched

194
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:29,169
"Four-All" family meal set.

195
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,328
It's perfect for a family of four.

196
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:31,448
Please take a look.

197
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:32,489
We are not a family.

198
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,848
Sorry, sorry.

199
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:35,568
It's okay. I'll get something else.

200
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:38,208
Actually, you can

201
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,808
get the meal set, anyway.

202
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:40,769
It's very economic.

203
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:42,889
Let me introduce it to you.

204
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:44,129
It includes

205
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:45,728
two adult beef burger sets

206
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:46,928
and two children's meals.

207
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:47,808
Yeah, that one.

208
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,009
I don't mind.

209
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:55,249
Shall we go with it?

210
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:55,808
Sure.

211
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:57,249
Alright, I'll place the order.

212
00:09:57,249 --> 00:09:58,688
And if you need anything else,

213
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:00,009
please scan the QR code.

214
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:01,129
Enjoy your meal.

215
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:01,848
Thank you.

216
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:04,848
Mom, I want an ice cream.

217
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:06,009
Okay, no problem.

218
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:07,049
Sit down.

219
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:10,608
Ke, do you want an ice cream?

220
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,208
They have...

221
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:12,968
Let me see.

222
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:15,448
Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry.

223
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,249
Which flavor?

224
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:16,968
Strawberry.

225
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:17,489
Okay.

226
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:18,289
Ke.

227
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:20,649
What did you promise me?

228
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:22,369
No ice cream.

229
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:24,529
Just one bite.

230
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:26,968
Ke has a weak tummy.

231
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:28,649
Ice creams would give her diarrhea

232
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:29,728
and even a fever.

233
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:31,049
I'm scared to let her have any.

234
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:33,129
Then she shouldn't have it.

235
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:34,649
You see, the auntie said so.

236
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:35,848
Guo.

237
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:38,009
Let's not have it, either. Okay?

238
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:38,808
Ke can't have it.

239
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:40,009
Order one for Guo.

240
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:40,808
It's okay.

241
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,208
Mommy will get you one later.

242
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,208
Ke.

243
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,289
What did you promise me?

244
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:18,249
Here we are.

245
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:20,928
They're both asleep.

246
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,328
Guo, you're home.

247
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:45,009
- Ke.
- Let's go.

248
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:47,088
Alright.

249
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:02,529
Thank you.

250
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:03,968
You took me to the hospital

251
00:12:03,968 --> 00:12:05,169
and brought us back.

252
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:06,409
Don't mention it.

253
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:08,049
I should thank you

254
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:09,448
for treating Ke to lunch.

255
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:11,848
Give him to me.

256
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:12,529
No, no.

257
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:14,129
You're injured, and the kid is

258
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:14,968
too heavy.

259
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:16,088
Let me take him up.

260
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:17,928
This is nothing.

261
00:12:17,968 --> 00:12:19,649
I'm always on my own.

262
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:21,409
How do I get by if I can't even

263
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,009
carry my son upstairs?

264
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:25,049
Give me a hand.

265
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:27,928
Guo, go to your mom.

266
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:28,529
Guo.

267
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:29,808
Okay.

268
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:31,369
You're home.

269
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:32,968
Alright.

270
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,328
We have to go.

271
00:12:36,848 --> 00:12:37,568
See you.

272
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:17,688
Ms. Li, it's done.

273
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:19,608
Do you like it?

274
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:22,889
I prepared two more wigs for you

275
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:24,848
for different occasions.

276
00:13:24,848 --> 00:13:25,848
Let me get them.

277
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:26,728
Thank you.

278
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,249
Ms. Li, what do you think?

279
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:38,928
I've never taken

280
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,968
a good look at myself
ever since I fell sick.

281
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:45,289
Thank you, Ms. Gu.

282
00:13:46,688 --> 00:13:48,928
You make me feel like a woman again.

283
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:12,448
Here.

284
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:13,769
Thank you so much.

285
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,249
No problem.

286
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:15,409
See you then.

287
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:15,928
Okay.

288
00:14:24,848 --> 00:14:25,889
Honey.

289
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:29,448
Were you worried?

290
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,328
Moli took me to get my hair done.

291
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:39,009
How is it?

292
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:42,409
What do you think of my hairstyle?

293
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:55,289
It's very

294
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:58,529
pretty.

295
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:04,409
Let's go.

296
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:31,009
You're back.

297
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:33,448
Honey.

298
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:36,688
Have you been waiting?

299
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:39,289
I'm sorry.

300
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:40,808
I was busy today.

301
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:44,088
Ms. Gu is always so busy.

302
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:45,769
She only remembers

303
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:48,369
her poor child and husband
when she has some time.

304
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:51,529
I'm really, really sorry.

305
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:53,889
Was Ke very upset today?

306
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:55,728
You can imagine that.

307
00:15:58,369 --> 00:15:59,568
Tell Ke that

308
00:15:59,568 --> 00:16:00,968
I'll make it up to her.

309
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:04,249
What about me?

310
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:14,169
I hope

311
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:15,889
everything went well with Yan Li today.

312
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,088
I'd be very upset

313
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:18,889
if I got stood up for nothing.

314
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:22,049
It didn't work out.

315
00:16:22,808 --> 00:16:24,568
Then why do you look so happy?

316
00:16:24,848 --> 00:16:26,568
It's not all about the result.

317
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:27,808
It didn't work out.

318
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:30,009
But it was a pleasant meeting.

319
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,409
Most importantly, I witnessed

320
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,649
the love between an artist and his wife.

321
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:35,889
It's beautiful.

322
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,608
Don't be envious of others.

323
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:39,289
Take pity on me.

324
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:44,769
Happy now?

325
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:45,808
Yeah.

326
00:16:48,088 --> 00:16:50,049
Didn't you do a live streaming

327
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:52,088
on women's health once?

328
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:53,489
Yeah, what about it?

329
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,328
Do you know

330
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:57,529
what may help patients
with breast cancer

331
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:00,049
regain stamina after surgery

332
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:01,968
as soon as possible?

333
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:04,088
Pilates.

334
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:05,769
Pilates?

335
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:07,888
They were saying that

336
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:10,049
breast cancer surgery may cause

337
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:12,209
muscle and nerve damage.

338
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:15,328
It can also lead to something called...

339
00:17:17,808 --> 00:17:19,049
Sensory Processing Disorder.

340
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,969
They say that Pilates may be

341
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,489
of significant help.

342
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:28,489
What's wrong?

343
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,289
Don't scare me.

344
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:33,449
You got me wrong.

345
00:17:33,568 --> 00:17:34,608
It's not me.

346
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:43,608
I used to complain
because you'd work overtime.

347
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:45,808
Now I understand that

348
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:48,608
it's not something you can just give up.

349
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:51,489
It's not just about
competition and promotions.

00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,969
(and my sweet daughter)

380
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:03,648
(rushing towards me
once I open the door.)

381
00:20:04,864 --> 00:20:10,361
♪Like a tape rewinding,
wiping out the past♪

382
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:14,496
♪The past♪

383
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,328
You'd better get accurate information

384
00:20:18,328 --> 00:20:19,769
and stop wasting my time.

385
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:22,969
Didn't you rush out
and chase after Mr. Yan?

386
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:24,608
Nothing happened?

387
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:25,769
You didn't do any better.

388
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:26,888
Like you got anything?

389
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:27,769
Shut up.

390
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,168
Both of you.

391
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:32,568
I've heard that Black Rock Gallery
and Free Cloud Gallery

392
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:34,489
have offered tempting terms,

393
00:20:34,489 --> 00:20:36,049
determined to get Yan Li.

394
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:37,408
And what are you doing?

395
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:38,888
Stop arguing.

396
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:39,769
Mr. Chen.

397
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:41,529
I met five groups of people in a day.

398
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:42,729
I'm working myself to the bone.

399
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:44,249
I wish I could be making

400
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:45,529
ten calls at the same time.

401
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:46,888
I've done everything.

402
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:48,328
I've tried my best.

403
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:49,249
Have you?

404
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:51,489
Have you begged him?

405
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:54,049
And you?

406
00:20:54,168 --> 00:20:55,529
Have you begged him?

407
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,769
You must resort to

408
00:20:57,769 --> 00:20:59,209
every conceivable method!

409
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:01,608
Moli, Ms. Li is looking for you.

410
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:07,128
Has Mr. Yan

411
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:08,729
painted anything recently?

412
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:10,929
Many known collectors
are looking forward to it.

413
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:15,088
Ms. Li.

414
00:21:16,328 --> 00:21:17,529
I made a coffee for you.

415
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:18,449
Please try it.

416
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,568
I don't drink coffee, thank you.

417
00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:22,969
Could you please excuse yourselves?

418
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:25,729
I'd like to talk to Moli alone.

419
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,088
Ms. Li.

420
00:21:39,568 --> 00:21:41,088
What brought you here?

421
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:42,808
Is there something important?

422
00:21:46,648 --> 00:21:47,848
I'm sorry.

423
00:21:48,249 --> 00:21:51,328
I'm bringing you some bad news.

424
00:21:51,368 --> 00:21:54,088
I had a serious discussion with Yan Li.

425
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:56,568
He insisted on going abroad.

426
00:21:57,088 --> 00:21:58,289
It's okay.

427
00:21:58,888 --> 00:22:00,729
Staying away from the turmoil

428
00:22:01,128 --> 00:22:02,969
and residing in a cozy environment

429
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:05,049
may help you recover.

430
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:07,449
Mr. Yan insists on doing so

431
00:22:07,449 --> 00:22:09,088
because he loves you too much.

432
00:22:09,689 --> 00:22:11,449
But it's such a huge loss

433
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:13,608
for him to stop painting.

434
00:22:15,328 --> 00:22:16,888
I've held him back.

435
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:22,449
Sometimes, such love is too heavy

436
00:22:23,368 --> 00:22:24,888
for me to bear.

437
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:29,489
Forget it. Let's not talk about this.

438
00:22:30,088 --> 00:22:31,969
There is another thing.

439
00:22:32,449 --> 00:22:33,568
Once we're abroad,

440
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:34,969
we'd like you to find

441
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:38,689
a warehouse
to store his paintings left in Shanghai.

442
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:43,328
Also, I'd like you to
act as the agent for these paintings.

443
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:45,088
What do you say?

444
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,088
Ms. Li, look forward
to working with you.

445
00:22:57,249 --> 00:22:58,449
Me too.

446
00:22:58,648 --> 00:22:59,128
Goodbye.

447
00:22:59,128 --> 00:22:59,608
Goodbye.

448
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:03,969
Thank you, Ms. Li.

449
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:05,568
What for?

450
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:07,328
You earned it.

451
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:09,969
Yan Li has strict requirements

452
00:23:09,969 --> 00:23:11,328
for agents.

453
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:14,128
You convinced him
with your ability and character.

454
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:15,808
He chose you.

455
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,289
Alright, I have to go.

456
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:19,568
Goodbye, Ms. Li.

457
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:20,289
Goodbye.

458
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:30,328
We didn't manage to represent Yan Li,

459
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:31,969
but we got half of his paintings.

460
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:32,969
You get the credit.

461
00:23:35,568 --> 00:23:36,929
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

462
00:23:38,128 --> 00:23:39,449
Isn't Yan Li known

463
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:41,408
as stubborn and unapproachable?

464
00:23:41,648 --> 00:23:42,368
See?

465
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:44,289
She made it.

466
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:45,449
That's why we say,

467
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:48,009
"Where there is a will, there is way."

468
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:51,049
See, Mi Na,

469
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:52,368
you are still too young.

470
00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:53,249
You'd better

471
00:23:53,249 --> 00:23:55,168
learn from your role model.

472
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:56,608
Keep it up.

473
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:11,489
(Mom)
(Sweetie, we're going back to Ningbo.)

474
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,128
Just part of them.

475
00:24:17,848 --> 00:24:19,209
Impressive.

476
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:19,929
Congratulations.

477
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:21,808
That's all?

478
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:23,328
Nothing more substantial?

479
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:26,049
Okay, dinner is on me.

480
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:27,289
Tacky.

481
00:24:27,808 --> 00:24:29,888
Would my dear boyfriend

482
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:32,049
like to come over tonight

483
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:34,929
and celebrate with me
over a bottle of red wine?

484
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:37,328
How romantic. How charming.

485
00:24:38,249 --> 00:24:40,328
What if we run into your parents?

486
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:41,328
I wouldn't dare.

487
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,568
They went back to Ningbo.

488
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:48,689
You should have said so earlier.

489
00:24:48,808 --> 00:24:49,929
Deal.

490
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:11,209
I'm here.

491
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:20,929
Gee, it's really chilly tonight.

492
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:23,328
Why did you come in your pajamas?

493
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:25,689
I'm trying to

494
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:27,128
save us some time.

495
00:26:28,209 --> 00:26:30,449
This is getting
more and more like a spy drama.

496
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:32,608
Would you like to have a drink first?

497
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,249
My mom gets up early.

498
00:26:35,368 --> 00:26:37,168
I need to get back before dawn.

499
00:26:37,848 --> 00:26:41,808
So, let's hurry up. Come on.

500
00:26:49,648 --> 00:26:51,128
You keep saying you're tired.

501
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:52,608
But we made it home.

502
00:26:52,848 --> 00:26:55,049
Our sweet daughter boosts my morale.

503
00:26:58,489 --> 00:26:59,368
It's open.

504
00:26:59,608 --> 00:27:00,929
Come on, take it easy.

505
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:01,368
Alright.

506
00:27:01,368 --> 00:27:02,608
Dad, Mom.

507
00:27:02,729 --> 00:27:03,568
Moli.

508
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:04,769
Moli.

509
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:06,689
- Take it slow.
- Okay.

510
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:08,249
See?

511
00:27:08,449 --> 00:27:10,368
I said she wasn't asleep.

512
00:27:10,368 --> 00:27:11,729
You didn't believe it.

513
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:13,888
You win.

514
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,929
Why did you come back so quickly?

515
00:27:17,209 --> 00:27:18,929
Your mom is worried about you.

516
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,408
So she made me drive at night

517
00:27:20,568 --> 00:27:21,888
just to rush home.

518
00:27:21,888 --> 00:27:22,929
Get the stuff inside.

519
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:24,209
Why are you worried?

520
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,128
I'm a grown-up.

521
00:27:26,168 --> 00:27:27,608
You just got divorced

522
00:27:27,608 --> 00:27:29,929
and might be having mood swings.

523
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:33,568
Moli.

524
00:27:35,408 --> 00:27:37,168
What's going on?

525
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:39,568
Who visited?

526
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:41,168
Who else could it be?

527
00:27:41,449 --> 00:27:42,568
Liu.

528
00:27:42,648 --> 00:27:44,969
We had a few drinks here.

529
00:27:45,368 --> 00:27:47,249
Why did you make it

530
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,648
so romantic just to drink with Liu?

531
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,328
Don't you know?

532
00:27:51,328 --> 00:27:52,648
It's

533
00:27:53,128 --> 00:27:54,568
Besties' Day today.

534
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:55,929
Liu cares about these things.

535
00:27:56,729 --> 00:27:58,088
There's a Besties' Day?

536
00:27:58,088 --> 00:27:59,489
How come I've never heard of it?

537
00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:01,449
There's a lot you haven't heard of.

538
00:28:01,808 --> 00:28:03,608
Baby.

539
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:05,529
I have some good news for you.

540
00:28:05,568 --> 00:28:06,729
What is it?

541
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:09,689
We sold the house in Ningbo.

542
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:10,568
From now on,

543
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:13,249
we're going to settle down in Shanghai.

544
00:28:16,168 --> 00:28:18,209
You're moving to Shanghai?

545
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:20,608
You don't have

546
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,128
relatives or friends here.
You'll be so lonely.

547
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:24,888
We have you.

548
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:26,769
We want to live with you.

549
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:28,289
Nothing matters more than you,

550
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,489
especially now.

551
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:30,648
From now on,

552
00:28:30,648 --> 00:28:32,888
we will start our life

553
00:28:32,888 --> 00:28:33,848
in Shanghai.

554
00:28:33,848 --> 00:28:34,408
Yeah.

555
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:35,088
Look.

556
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:37,888
We brought all your things from Ningbo.

557
00:28:37,888 --> 00:28:38,769
Where do I put them?

558
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:40,249
In her big wardrobe.

559
00:28:40,249 --> 00:28:40,888
Yes, Madam.

560
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:42,009
Wait, Dad.

561
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:43,568
Dad, I can do it.

562
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:44,249
I got this.

563
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:44,929
It's heavy.

564
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:46,249
You don't know where to put it.

565
00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:47,009
Be good.

566
00:28:50,568 --> 00:28:51,529
Alright.

567
00:28:54,408 --> 00:28:55,529
Moli.

568
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:57,648
Moli.

569
00:28:58,449 --> 00:28:59,769
This wine smells good.

570
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:34,568
People tend to

571
00:29:35,168 --> 00:29:37,608
keep a distance, especially between

572
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:40,128
men and women.

573
00:29:40,848 --> 00:29:43,009
We call it "safe distance".

574
00:29:44,128 --> 00:29:45,729
The safe distance

575
00:29:45,969 --> 00:29:48,328
between a loving couple may be so small

576
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:49,888
that can be ignored.

577
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:53,608
But it can become a huge gap
in the blink of an eye.

578
00:29:57,168 --> 00:29:58,808
For the people you deeply love,

579
00:29:59,489 --> 00:30:00,929
you have to

580
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:02,449
adjust the distance

581
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:04,168
based on

582
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:07,888
the objects, occasions,

583
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:10,009
and times accordingly.

584
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:13,328
Can you manage it with great accuracy?

585
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:21,856
=Simple Days=
(Safe Distance)

586
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:48,249
It's cold outside. Put this on.

587
00:30:49,568 --> 00:30:50,489
Thanks, Dad.

588
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,848
Dad, I...

589
00:30:57,848 --> 00:30:58,848
Say no more.

590
00:31:00,088 --> 00:31:01,729
It takes two to tango.

591
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,848
She obviously opened the door for you.

592
00:31:08,209 --> 00:31:09,168
Jincao.

593
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:11,729
Just tell me one thing.

594
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,449
Who asked for the divorce, you or her?

595
00:31:16,729 --> 00:31:18,289
B-Both of us...

596
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:19,608
It was Moli, right?

597
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:26,088
It's evident

598
00:31:27,408 --> 00:31:30,289
that you people have broken her heart.

599
00:31:34,648 --> 00:31:35,408
Dad.

600
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:37,328
It's my fault.

601
00:31:39,489 --> 00:31:41,729
I haven't handled it properly.

602
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:44,769
That's how we've come to this point.

603
00:31:45,328 --> 00:31:46,289
But you know what?

604
00:31:46,848 --> 00:31:48,729
We still have feelings for each other.

605
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:51,969
She just finds it difficult
to adapt to our marriage.

606
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:54,328
So we wanted to stay apart for a while.

607
00:31:54,328 --> 00:31:55,128
For a while?

608
00:31:55,729 --> 00:31:57,489
What do you mean by that?

609
00:31:58,368 --> 00:31:59,608
I'm just trying to say.

610
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:01,088
I still love her.

611
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:02,289
I don't want it to end.

612
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:03,449
Zhu Jincao, listen.

613
00:32:03,848 --> 00:32:05,729
I know my daughter the best.

614
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:08,529
She has never been through any hardship.

615
00:32:08,648 --> 00:32:11,209
She's kind, pure, and deeply emotional.

616
00:32:11,648 --> 00:32:14,289
A few sweet words can get her wavered.

617
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:16,729
Not me.

618
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:25,808
I reflected on myself

619
00:32:25,969 --> 00:32:27,529
after your divorce.

620
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:31,009
I may have crossed the line sometimes.

621
00:32:31,328 --> 00:32:34,128
But the harm you people
have done to my daughter

622
00:32:34,128 --> 00:32:36,888
is real and irreversible, right?

623
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:40,929
We are both fathers. I bet you get it.

624
00:32:41,368 --> 00:32:42,489
A father always

625
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:45,249
prioritizes his own child.

626
00:32:45,249 --> 00:32:46,049
Right?

627
00:32:48,328 --> 00:32:50,049
I may sound a bit selfish.

628
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:51,648
But I don't think I'm wrong.

629
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,168
Jincao, think about it.

630
00:32:53,209 --> 00:32:54,529
If you were me,

631
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:56,289
would you let

632
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:57,769
your daughter go back

633
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,168
to that whole mess
your family put her through?

634
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:08,529
Moli's mother acts
as if nothing has happened.

635
00:33:08,568 --> 00:33:10,009
But do you know

636
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:12,449
how many times
she's cried over your divorce?

637
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:15,128
She just didn't want Moli to see it.

638
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:20,049
I didn't want to expose you upstairs

639
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:22,689
because I didn't want her to see you

640
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:23,729
and get hurt again.

641
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:25,969
I don't want that for my wife.

642
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:27,408
Her heart can't

643
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:29,088
withstand any more turmoil.

644
00:33:32,249 --> 00:33:34,128
We were doing well in Ningbo.

645
00:33:34,128 --> 00:33:35,888
Why did we move to Shanghai?

646
00:33:36,249 --> 00:33:38,568
Because we were worried about Moli.

647
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:43,088
Didn't you create this mess?

648
00:33:49,209 --> 00:33:50,929
Let's take a step back.

649
00:33:51,689 --> 00:33:52,888
Even if Moli agrees

650
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:55,209
to remarry you now,

651
00:33:55,689 --> 00:33:57,888
do you think I can trust her

652
00:33:58,969 --> 00:34:00,249
to you again

653
00:34:00,489 --> 00:34:02,808
considering
what's going on in your family?

654
00:34:03,328 --> 00:34:04,769
Can you guarantee

655
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:07,529
that she will be happy and fulfilled?

656
00:34:14,128 --> 00:34:15,768
What's with Gu Demao?

657
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:17,889
It takes him so long
to take out the trash?

658
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,208
Why are you so lost today?

659
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:24,329
I'm not.

660
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:25,128
You're not?

661
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:25,929
I'm not.

662
00:34:26,288 --> 00:34:27,288
Naughty kid.

663
00:34:27,288 --> 00:34:29,009
You stay up late when I'm not home.

664
00:34:29,009 --> 00:34:29,929
Go to sleep.

665
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:30,849
I'll do it, Mom.

666
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:32,969
Off to bed, go on.

667
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:34,248
Naughty kid.

668
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:43,088
Jincao.

669
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,449
I've said enough.

670
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:47,208
I just want to tell you.

671
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:51,529
No matter why you got divorced,

672
00:34:52,088 --> 00:34:54,929
you're no longer married.

673
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:57,009
It's not a temporary thing.

674
00:35:01,088 --> 00:35:02,889
The best outcome

675
00:35:03,128 --> 00:35:06,369
is for both of you to live well.

676
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:08,728
Don't interfere with each other.

677
00:35:09,009 --> 00:35:10,568
You're both young.

678
00:35:11,088 --> 00:35:13,489
You have your whole life ahead of you.

679
00:35:14,568 --> 00:35:18,648
Keep going and just move on.

680
00:35:23,128 --> 00:35:24,889
Drive safe.

681
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:28,449
Keep the outfit.

682
00:35:30,248 --> 00:35:31,369
I don't want to

683
00:35:31,608 --> 00:35:33,809
see you here again.

00:36:19,728 --> 00:36:20,969
No problem.

693
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:25,369
It's not the first time
I've covered for you.

694
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,248
Sweetie,

695
00:36:26,248 --> 00:36:28,768
let's not do something
like this again, okay?

696
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:30,608
It would be a sleepless night

697
00:36:30,608 --> 00:36:32,208
if your mom found out about it.

698
00:36:32,529 --> 00:36:35,168
Got it. It won't happen again.

699
00:36:35,688 --> 00:36:37,168
Have some breakfast.

700
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:41,809
Stop.

701
00:36:44,049 --> 00:36:45,728
Be disciplined as a single lady.

702
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:47,329
Maintain your figure.

703
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:50,248
You're about to start a new life.

704
00:36:51,889 --> 00:36:52,969
Starting tomorrow,

705
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:55,168
I'll make your breakfast.

706
00:36:55,288 --> 00:36:57,208
No more carbs.

707
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:58,688
What do you mean?

708
00:36:58,728 --> 00:37:01,088
I only get to
have some salad from now on?

709
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:02,889
And you should be grateful.

710
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:03,728
Come on.

711
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:08,009
No carbs even for breakfast?

712
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:18,248
(Li Rui)
(Moli, I'm caught in the traffic.)

713
00:37:18,248 --> 00:37:20,009
(It will take me another 20 minutes.)

714
00:37:20,728 --> 00:37:22,128
Oh no, I forgot about it.

715
00:37:22,128 --> 00:37:23,849
Mom, why didn't you wake me up earlier?

716
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:24,929
So annoying.

717
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:26,768
She lost it.

718
00:37:26,768 --> 00:37:28,529
Gu.

719
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:30,608
What's up with your daughter now?

720
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:39,049
Let's go.

721
00:37:40,768 --> 00:37:42,288
Hello, where is your motorbike?

722
00:37:42,568 --> 00:37:43,568
Hello.

723
00:37:43,568 --> 00:37:45,009
Our electric bike is broken.

724
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:46,849
I'm getting a cab at the entrance.

725
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:47,529
Get in my car.

726
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:48,648
No need.

727
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:50,369
You're going to be late. Get in the car.

728
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:51,728
Guo, go find Ke.

729
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:52,969
Thank you.

730
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:53,608
Guo.

731
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:54,449
Ke.

732
00:37:54,449 --> 00:37:55,889
Ke, good morning.

733
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:56,529
Good morning, Auntie.

734
00:37:56,529 --> 00:37:57,208
Sit tight.

735
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,728
Excuse me, could you sit in the back?

736
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:06,728
Okay, no problem.

737
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:14,809
Pretty flowers!

738
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:16,449
- Give it to me.
- Birthday?

739
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:18,969
It's my wedding anniversary
with my wife.

740
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:20,088
This is the gift.

741
00:38:21,648 --> 00:38:22,608
Sit tight.

742
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:26,688
Come on, fasten your seatbelt.

743
00:38:29,688 --> 00:38:30,608
Let's go.

744
00:38:30,728 --> 00:38:31,969
Off we go!

745
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:39,529
I'm really sorry.

746
00:38:39,648 --> 00:38:42,168
My wife doesn't like it
when others take the passenger seat.

747
00:38:42,728 --> 00:38:44,889
It's okay. I understand.

748
00:38:45,728 --> 00:38:46,768
Put your feet down.

749
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:48,088
Don't step on it.

750
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,809
What are you sitting on, Guo?

751
00:38:51,608 --> 00:38:52,728
It's all smashed.

752
00:38:53,088 --> 00:38:54,849
I'm sorry.

753
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:55,969
Guo sat on something.

754
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:56,608
Here.

755
00:38:57,929 --> 00:39:00,208
My wife got a gym membership card there.

756
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:01,768
But she's been too busy to go.

757
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:03,568
This trial voucher is going to waste.

758
00:39:05,088 --> 00:39:06,969
It's for Pilates.

759
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:09,648
This looks pretty good.

760
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:12,409
I've always wanted to practice yoga.

761
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:14,369
Take it if you like it.

762
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:15,768
No, no need.

763
00:39:15,768 --> 00:39:17,088
That's not what I meant.

764
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,088
No, just keep it.

765
00:39:19,248 --> 00:39:20,529
Try it out.

766
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:23,088
Or it's going to expire
and be a piece of trash.

767
00:39:24,688 --> 00:39:26,489
This is so awkward.

768
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,489
It's okay. Just take it.

769
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:38,449
Very good, keep your abdomen tight.

770
00:39:38,449 --> 00:39:40,009
Bend your knees forward.

771
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:42,449
Use your glute muscle to push.

772
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:44,208
Push straight back against my hand.

773
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:45,969
Very good, back again.

774
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:47,768
Control your upper limbs.

775
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:50,088
Pull your ribs in as you exhale.

776
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,409
Good, straighten your back.

777
00:39:51,409 --> 00:39:53,088
Keep your necks elongated and upward.

778
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,728
Excellent.

779
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:55,208
Push it with the forefoot.

780
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:57,409
Good, exhale again and pull the ribs in.

781
00:39:57,409 --> 00:39:59,688
Use the core to push the legs out.

782
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:01,529
Keep your right leg down.

783
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:02,088
Very good.

784
00:40:02,088 --> 00:40:02,849
One last time.

785
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:04,248
Inhale. Forward.

786
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:06,648
Good, exhale. Backward. That's great.

787
00:40:06,648 --> 00:40:08,128
Keep your neck stretched.

788
00:40:08,128 --> 00:40:09,889
Very good, let's keep it up.

789
00:40:11,529 --> 00:40:13,929
Very good, lower it a bit more.

790
00:40:13,929 --> 00:40:15,568
Inhale and bend your knees.

791
00:40:15,568 --> 00:40:16,288
Very good.

792
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,409
Push back again.

793
00:40:17,409 --> 00:40:18,568
Engage the upper side

794
00:40:18,568 --> 00:40:19,809
of your buttocks again.

795
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:21,088
Good, retract it again.

796
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:22,969
Keep lifting it.

797
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:24,768
Bend your knees and pull back again.

798
00:40:24,768 --> 00:40:25,688
Very good.

799
00:40:26,168 --> 00:40:27,489
Push back again.

800
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:28,768
You're shrugging a bit.

801
00:40:28,768 --> 00:40:30,128
Stretch out your neck.

802
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,449
Last time.

803
00:40:31,449 --> 00:40:33,568
Bend the knees. Retract. Move forward.

804
00:40:33,568 --> 00:40:35,529
Let's keep it up. Good.

805
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:37,449
I'm so sore.

806
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:39,208
It's normal the first time.

807
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:41,648
Mr. Yan is really sweet.

808
00:40:41,688 --> 00:40:42,329
Look.

809
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:44,369
He's the only guy here,

810
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:45,849
just to keep you company.

811
00:40:46,728 --> 00:40:47,768
He may not be

812
00:40:47,768 --> 00:40:49,168
a sweet talker,

813
00:40:49,168 --> 00:40:51,128
but he's very considerate.

814
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:52,369
He heard that

815
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:54,208
you were bringing me to Pilates class

816
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:56,088
and felt so guilty yesterday.

817
00:40:56,088 --> 00:40:57,648
He couldn't believe he hadn't

818
00:40:57,648 --> 00:40:59,409
thought of rehabilitation works.

819
00:40:59,409 --> 00:41:01,688
So he had to come along today.

820
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:05,409
This way, please.

821
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:06,009
Okay.

822
00:41:06,168 --> 00:41:08,009
Our training room
is on the second floor.

823
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:09,208
A class is in session.

824
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:10,568
Let's take a look.

825
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:11,288
Thank you.

826
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:15,849
Good work, everyone.

827
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:17,009
You are amazing.

828
00:41:17,009 --> 00:41:18,568
We'll take a ten-minute break

829
00:41:18,568 --> 00:41:20,049
and come back for more.

830
00:41:20,049 --> 00:41:20,449
Okay.

831
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:21,809
Thank you.

832
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:28,409
Are you tired?

833
00:41:28,409 --> 00:41:29,049
Not at all.

834
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:29,969
Have some water.

835
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:32,889
You seem to be enjoying it.
Everything fine?

836
00:41:34,128 --> 00:41:35,768
Don't worry. I can handle it.

837
00:41:36,608 --> 00:41:38,248
I'm going to the restroom.

838
00:41:41,409 --> 00:41:44,128
This is our Pilates equipment area.

839
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,648
A class is in session.

840
00:41:45,768 --> 00:41:47,369
This is the yoga room.

841
00:41:48,529 --> 00:41:49,449
And this is

842
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:51,688
the Pilates core equipment area.

843
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:58,728
Great environment.

844
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:02,369
Can I take a look and get a few photos?

845
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:02,969
Sure.

846
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:03,728
Look around.

847
00:42:03,728 --> 00:42:04,889
Call me if you need me.

848
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,049
Okay, thank you.

849
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:08,688
Moli.

850
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:10,248
Mr. Yan.

851
00:42:10,889 --> 00:42:12,009
You're doing quite well.

852
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:12,889
Do you practice often?

853
00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:13,688
Not really.

854
00:42:13,688 --> 00:42:15,049
I have to take care of my kid.

855
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:16,369
So I don't come often.

856
00:42:18,608 --> 00:42:20,849
Those moves don't look so difficult.

857
00:42:20,849 --> 00:42:22,248
If it really works,

858
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:23,489
I'd like to learn it

859
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:24,969
and practice with her at home.

860
00:42:25,529 --> 00:42:27,969
Actually, Pilates is great for you.

861
00:42:28,009 --> 00:42:30,009
You paint while standing.

862
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:32,128
I bet you have a lumbar muscle strain.

863
00:42:32,128 --> 00:42:33,608
Yeah, exactly.

864
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:35,849
Pilates relaxes the muscles in the back.

865
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:36,969
That's wonderful.

866
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:38,288
Can you teach me?

867
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:39,168
No way.

868
00:42:39,168 --> 00:42:40,489
Wait for the coach.

869
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:41,809
Just show me a few basics.

870
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,608
Let me try it.

871
00:42:42,608 --> 00:42:44,168
I saw you...

872
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,688
Then, Mr. Yan,

873
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,049
maybe you shouldn't start there.

874
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:50,849
Okay.

875
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:52,248
Then you can practice at home.

876
00:42:52,608 --> 00:42:54,889
Stand here with both legs.

877
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:56,409
Step back with one leg.

878
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:58,329
Keep this leg bent.

879
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:00,288
Lift your hands by your ears.

880
00:43:00,688 --> 00:43:02,809
Then tighten your core.

881
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:04,648
Lift your leg.

882
00:43:06,299 --> 00:43:08,032
(Ke's Mom, Gu Moli)

883
00:43:25,529 --> 00:43:27,648
One, two, go. How's that?

884
00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:31,409
It's okay.

885
00:43:31,529 --> 00:43:32,128
Are you okay?

886
00:43:32,128 --> 00:43:33,288
You were too hasty, Mr. Yan.
