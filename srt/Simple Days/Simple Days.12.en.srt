Leaving so soon?

28
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,777
No, I've just finished warming up.

29
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:27,736
Perfect, let's team up in a bit.

30
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,217
But I'm not very good at it.

31
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:34,576
No worries. I'll teach you.

Frisbee is really simple.

We have two throwing techniques.

35
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:42,136
One is the forehand, like this.

36
00:02:42,217 --> 00:02:46,296
Use this grip. Hold the disc
in the middle of this cleft

37
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:47,937
and throw it forward.

38
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:50,176
The other is backhand. Here.

39
00:02:51,217 --> 00:02:53,537
Pinch it with your index
and middle fingers like this

40
00:02:53,696 --> 00:02:54,696
and throw it this way.

41
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,896

Chen Cancan.

54
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:40,016
I can't believe I ran into you here.

55
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:41,856
When did you get back?

56
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:43,416
I've been back for three months.

57
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,896
You're not paying
attention to me at all.

58
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:46,416
How could you say that?

59
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,976
I liked your post the other day.

60
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:50,136
If you did, you would know I'm back.

61
00:03:50,217 --> 00:03:51,937
I've been quite busy recently.

62
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:54,296
Busy with a romance, I bet?

63
00:03:54,377 --> 00:03:55,736
Nonsense.

64
00:03:56,217 --> 00:03:57,136
How about you?

65
00:03:57,217 --> 00:03:58,176
Same old, same old.

66
00:03:58,176 --> 00:03:59,416
No time like the present.

67
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,736
Let's have a frisbee duel.

68
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:01,856
No problem.

69
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,136
Come, let me introduce you.

70
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:06,617
This is my friend Shen Liuliu.

71
00:04:06,856 --> 00:04:08,736
This is my classmate
who's studying abroad,

72
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:09,537
Chen Cancan.

73
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:10,617
Hello.

74
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:11,657
Hi.

75
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:16,096
You're Mimi, right?

76
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,096
You're so cute.

77
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:22,057
Come, let me show you the new home.

78
00:04:22,216 --> 00:04:24,536
Meet your new friend.

79
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,617
Her name is Cream.

80
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:28,617
Cream, come say hello.

81
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:31,016
Thank you for helping me with Mimi.

82
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:33,216
I didn't expect you
to have a native resident.

83
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:34,456
Sorry to trouble you.

84
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:35,817
No trouble at all.

85
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:38,417
Guo and I also like small animals.

86
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:41,297
Besides, our native resident
also needs a companion.

87
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:43,536
If you miss Mimi in the future,

88
00:04:43,536 --> 00:04:45,216
you're welcome to come over and visit.

89
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:51,096
My wife was too anxious
when looking for our child last time.

90
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:52,417
She was a bit rude.

91
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:54,417
Please don't take it to heart.

92
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:55,297
It's okay.

93
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:58,016
As a mother, I completely understand.

94
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:01,297
It's just that recently after school,

95
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:03,257
I haven't seen Ke playing in the yard.

96
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:05,177
Well, my dad is here.

97
00:05:05,177 --> 00:05:06,536
Our home is too small to fit everyone.

98
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:09,216
So her mom took Ke
to stay at her grandfather's place.

99
00:05:10,136 --> 00:05:13,497
Hold on a second. I have to take this.

100
00:05:17,377 --> 00:05:19,817
Hello, Mr. Li.

101
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:22,177
If the number of online viewers
in your livestream this month

102
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:23,776
still fails to meet the standard,

103
00:05:23,896 --> 00:05:25,737
the company will withdraw
its traffic support for you.

104
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,896
No, no, Mr. Li!

105
00:05:28,057 --> 00:05:32,737
Here's the thing. The competition
in livestream has been fierce.

106
00:05:33,497 --> 00:05:35,536
I might need some time.

107
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:38,417
At most, I'll give you one more week.
If it doesn't work out, we'll pull out.

108
00:05:38,696 --> 00:05:39,336
Okay.

109
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:40,216
Sure, no problem.

110
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:41,057
Thank you.

111
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:42,257
Goodbye.

112
00:05:46,857 --> 00:05:48,057
Sorry about that.

113
00:05:48,136 --> 00:05:51,336
I see you're in livestreaming, right?

114
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,456
Yes, I do livestreaming.

115
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:55,937
I'm raising a child on my own, right?

116
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:57,776
I can't hold down a stable job.

117
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:59,617
Livestreaming offers flexible hours.

118
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:01,417
But I don't have much experience yet.

119
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:04,417
So my results aren't that good.

120
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:05,576
I'm still trying to figure it out.

121
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:07,977
I work at a livestreaming company.

122
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:10,377
If you need any help in this regard,

123
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:11,696
you can contact me anytime.

124
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:14,336
Really? That would be great.

125
00:06:14,336 --> 00:06:15,377
Don't mention it.

126
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:16,817
You're adopting Mimi for me, aren't you?

127
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:20,016
Look, I am being transferred
to work in Jinshan,

128
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:21,656
leaving in the next few days.

129
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:23,177
But that's really fine.

130
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:24,696
You can call me at any time.

131
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,257
Okay.

132
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:30,937
Right, a bit higher.

133
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:33,576
Let's go.

134
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:35,456
Well done.

135
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:37,136
Yes, just like that.

136
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:46,016
Mr. Wang, are you okay?

137
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:46,576
Mr. Wang.

138
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:47,576
Mr. Wang.

139
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:50,776
Liuliu, I am really fine.

140
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,817
Having me sit
in a wheelchair is too much.

141
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:55,336
You're hurt. Don't play tough.

142
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:57,057
I'm really fine.
I'll come down and walk for you.

143
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:57,857
Sit down.

144
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:00,857
Your feet are hurt.

145
00:07:01,696 --> 00:07:03,617
With registration, payment,
X-rays, and seeing the doctor,

146
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:04,977
you'd be running up and down the stairs.

147
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:06,776
Can you handle it by yourself?

148
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:09,896
Just stay put and follow my lead.

149
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:12,177
I've lived in Shanghai
for so many years,

150
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:14,216
and I've always
gone to the doctor alone.

151
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:16,216
They say the highest realm of loneliness

152
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:17,896
is to undergo surgery by oneself.

153
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:19,776
I've experienced that more than once.

154
00:07:19,817 --> 00:07:21,576
It's an unpleasant feeling.

155
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,136
That's why I know

156
00:07:23,136 --> 00:07:25,937
how important it is to have someone
take care of you when you're sick.

157
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:27,656
Alright, I'll follow your lead.

158
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:29,096
That's right.

159
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:33,216
Are you alright?

160
00:07:33,297 --> 00:07:34,576
Yeah. I got it.

161
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:37,696
Let me get it.

162
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:45,817
Okay.

163
00:07:45,817 --> 00:07:46,576
Be careful.

164
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:49,857
Here.

165
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:51,016
Thank you.

166
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:52,257
Lift your foot.

167
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:55,456
It takes a hundred days
to cure a bone injury.

168
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:57,057
Fortunately, your bone is fine.

169
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,257
Listen to the doctor
and get some good rest.

170
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:00,136
Thank you so much.

171
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:02,977
You accompanied me to the hospital
and now you've brought me back.

172
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:05,377
After all this hassle,
you must be hungry, right?

173
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:06,456
I'll order some takeout.

174
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:07,336
Eat before you go.

175
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:08,896
Why would you do that?

176
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:09,977
I'll cook for you.

177
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:12,776
No, I can't let you do that.

178
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:15,977
What vegetables do you have at home?

179
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,977
I don't even know what I have.

180
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:24,456
Your kitchen is really clean.

181
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:31,416
The fridge is even cleaner.

182
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:33,896
A rented house is also home.

183
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,337
How do you live your days
like you're staying in a hotel?

184
00:08:37,737 --> 00:08:39,977
When you're alone,
minimalism is the best.

185
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,617
Come and go as you please,
without any worries.

186
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:06,977
The noodles are ready.

187
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:09,097
This is really quite a feast.

188
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:12,737
Just one bowl? Aren't you eating?

189
00:09:12,737 --> 00:09:13,617
I'm not hungry.

190
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:15,377
Go ahead.

191
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:20,457
This is really good.

192
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:34,656
So you live in a luxury apartment

193
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:36,097
by yourself,

194
00:09:36,457 --> 00:09:37,857
with a non-marriage doctrine.

195
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:41,497
It's like a rebellion
against your mother's control.

196
00:09:41,896 --> 00:09:44,977
I don't want to lower my living standard
because of a house.

197
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:48,097
Isn't it quite good to be like me?

198
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:52,097
Just look at how much pressure people
like Moli and Jincao are under.

199
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:54,097
They divorced over a house.

200
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:58,377
It's not just that, right?

201
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:01,737
The relatives in your family
are quite something.

202
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:07,457
That's why I don't want
to drag another person into this.

203
00:10:07,536 --> 00:10:09,896
Is this why you
reject close relationships

204
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:13,257
and always keep people at bay?

205
00:10:13,257 --> 00:10:14,936
I don't want others
to be responsible for me.

206
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:16,577
And I don't have
to be responsible for others.

207
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:20,097
To put it bluntly,
it's a form of selfishness.

208
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:24,776
I didn't expect you
to analyze yourself so deeply.

209
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:27,296
I wanted to put it in a nice way.

210
00:10:31,936 --> 00:10:38,936
Not every intimate relationship
is a shackle and a burden.

211
00:10:51,656 --> 00:10:52,776
It's so late.

212
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:54,176
I'll go now.

213
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:56,377
I can't see you out.

214
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:57,656
Don't, just stay seated.

215
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,337
Did you miss me?

216
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:29,097
Of course, I did.

217
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:36,056
My parents took Ke to learn ballet.

218
00:11:36,056 --> 00:11:37,136
They left a little while ago.

219
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:38,136
You weren't exposed, were you?

220
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,936
No, don't worry.

221
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:41,457
I've carefully scouted.

222
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:43,097
I made sure there were no enemies.

223
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:47,977
What's wrong?

224
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:49,577
Nothing.

225
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:53,416
I just feel a bit sorry for Ke.

226
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,936
She's already enrolled
in a painting class.

227
00:11:55,936 --> 00:11:57,617
And now another ballet class.

228
00:11:57,697 --> 00:11:59,097
Isn't that too exhausting?

229
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,697
It's all because of my mom.

230
00:12:00,697 --> 00:12:02,737
She insists that girls learn
to dance from a young age

231
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:04,577
for good figures and poise
in the future.

232
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:07,097
Poor Ke.

233
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:09,257
I'm the poor one.

234
00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:11,896
I used to see you
as soon as I got home from work.

235
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:13,257
Now, look.

236
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:15,457
The house is bigger, but it's so empty.

237
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,577
You're going to Jinshan soon.

238
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:19,776
Then we'll be like the Cowherd
and the Weaving Maid.

239
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:23,377
You know what?

240
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,977
When I see your big house now,

241
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:28,257
I should be happy for you.

242
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:29,977
But for some reason,

243
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:31,617
I feel so empty inside now.

244
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:34,217
Am I being too sensitive?

245
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:36,097
You are being sensitive.

246
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,136
What do you mean by "my house"?

247
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:39,816
This is our house.

248
00:12:40,497 --> 00:12:41,816
It's completely different.

249
00:12:42,857 --> 00:12:44,176
I'm going to Jinshan

250
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,977
all to buy you a big house like this.

251
00:12:48,377 --> 00:12:49,497
I know.

252
00:12:50,776 --> 00:12:53,056
Alright, you're going to Jinshan.

253
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:54,056
Let's hurry.

254
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:00,497
Mom, open the door.

255
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:03,416
Mom, open the door quickly.

256
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,896
What's going on?

257
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:07,377
Mom, open the door.

258
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:08,536
Over here, over here.

259
00:13:09,097 --> 00:13:10,936
Mom, open the door quickly.

260
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:14,016
Did Moli go out?

261
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:15,337
That's not possible.

262
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:17,217
She didn't say she was going out.

263
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:19,097
We just stepped out for a moment.

264
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:28,176
We're back.

265
00:13:28,176 --> 00:13:29,217
Alright, we're back.

266
00:13:29,217 --> 00:13:30,217
Come on, Ke.

267
00:13:30,337 --> 00:13:31,457
Mom.

268
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,697
Mom and Dad, why are you back?

269
00:13:33,697 --> 00:13:34,257
We're back.

270
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,977
I thought you were
going to her dance class.

271
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:39,377
Your dad and I went to check it out.

272
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:42,377
That ballet teacher was too amateur.

273
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:45,016
The basics of ballet are very important.

274
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:48,016
Our Ke has to learn from the best.

275
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:52,176
A girl's figure and poise
cannot be neglected.

276
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:55,136
Your mom will find Ke a new teacher,
and she can attend class another day.

277
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:57,217
But it's a bit expensive.

278
00:13:57,217 --> 00:13:58,536
This isn't about money.

279
00:13:58,816 --> 00:14:01,377
She's just a kid. Is it necessary?

280
00:14:01,377 --> 00:14:02,416
Yes.

281
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,217
She can't lose at the starting line.

282
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:06,977
Mom, I'm tired.

283
00:14:07,217 --> 00:14:10,617
Sweetheart, I have to work tonight.

284
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,136
Can you stay in Grandma's room?

285
00:14:12,136 --> 00:14:14,577
No, I want to sleep in your bed.

286
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:16,617
Be good. I have to work.

287
00:14:16,617 --> 00:14:17,217
Right.

288
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:19,377
I will tell you the story
of the red dancing shoes.

289
00:14:19,377 --> 00:14:20,577
No.

290
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:28,857
Daddy.

291
00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:40,656
Are you playing hide and seek with me?

292
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:49,176
Gu Demao.

293
00:15:02,656 --> 00:15:05,936
Zhu Jincao,
I'm not trying to criticize you,

294
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:08,577
but what on earth have you done?

295
00:15:09,136 --> 00:15:11,896
To put it nicely, it's improper conduct.

296
00:15:12,257 --> 00:15:15,257
And to put it bluntly, it's hooliganism.

297
00:15:15,257 --> 00:15:16,457
Mom, what hooliganism?

298
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:17,656
What's that supposed to mean?

299
00:15:17,656 --> 00:15:19,056
What are you even talking about?

300
00:15:19,257 --> 00:15:20,936
Could you keep your voice down, please?

301
00:15:22,936 --> 00:15:24,377
Ke just fell asleep.

302
00:15:25,577 --> 00:15:27,977
Look, Zhu Jincao.

303
00:15:28,296 --> 00:15:30,737
This is called committing a crime.

304
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:33,377
Nobody committed any crime.
I consented.

305
00:15:33,377 --> 00:15:34,737
You shut up.

306
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:36,617
How dare you say you consented?

307
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:38,296
I'll deal with you later.

308
00:15:38,296 --> 00:15:39,257
Let's talk about you.

309
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:40,296
Wait a minute.

310
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:41,816
Take it easy.

311
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:44,056
Jincao.

312
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:46,857
Now that things have come
to this point today,

313
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:48,617
I must say a few words.

314
00:15:50,257 --> 00:15:53,497
Our Gu family is not
as dramatic as your family,

315
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:55,176
but first of all,

316
00:15:55,176 --> 00:15:56,617
we need to have dignity.

317
00:15:56,617 --> 00:15:57,337
That's right.

318
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:59,176
The family's reputation must be proper.

319
00:15:59,176 --> 00:15:59,936
Exactly.

320
00:16:00,737 --> 00:16:05,176
You keep coming to our home sneakily.

321
00:16:05,217 --> 00:16:07,337
What's going on here?

322
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:14,217
Besides, I've already made myself
clear to you last time.

323
00:16:14,257 --> 00:16:16,697
A grown man should keep his word, right?

324
00:16:16,697 --> 00:16:17,416
Mr. Gu.

325
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,617
Last time?

326
00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:20,457
What does that mean?

327
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:21,896
Was he here before?

328
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:22,737
Yes.

329
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:25,136
No, I mean...

330
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:27,136
We are a democratic family,

331
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:29,097
but we also have our limits.

332
00:16:29,097 --> 00:16:29,936
Yes.

333
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:32,737
I'm telling you.

334
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:34,457
I won't waste my words with you anymore.

335
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:36,296
Starting from now,

336
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:37,936
without the consent of both of us,

337
00:16:37,936 --> 00:16:40,136
don't set foot
in this house again, okay?

338
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:47,056
Otherwise, if your parents
can't educate you,

339
00:16:47,737 --> 00:16:48,977
I will.

340
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:51,977
What are you doing?

341
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:55,776
This is Jincao, Jincao is Ke's father.

342
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,816
How can you treat him like this?

343
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:58,776
I agree.

344
00:17:02,016 --> 00:17:04,336
Today, I make a promise here to you.

345
00:17:06,217 --> 00:17:09,897
If I cannot bring happiness
to Ke and Moli,

346
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:11,497
I will never come here again.

347
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:15,217
Good, but remember,
these are your words.

348
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:16,697
Yes, they are.

349
00:17:17,376 --> 00:17:18,296
Two years.

350
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:22,536
In two years, I will definitely buy
a big house for her and our daughter.

351
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:25,897
Zhu Jincao, enough with the big mouth.

352
00:17:25,897 --> 00:17:27,616
A bigger house in two years?

353
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:30,977
After two years, my daughter will be
a white-haired witch.

354
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:33,177
Stop issuing us empty promises.

355
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:35,776
Empty or not,

356
00:17:36,217 --> 00:17:37,816
time will tell in two years.

357
00:17:39,177 --> 00:17:40,576
If after two years,

358
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:42,376
my promises can be fulfilled,

359
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:44,336
I hope you two

360
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,616
will agree to let our family of three

361
00:17:47,137 --> 00:17:48,937
live our own lives well.

362
00:17:52,576 --> 00:17:53,776
Jincao.

363
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:04,376
This young man is quite ambitious.

364
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:06,417
Can ambition buy a big house?

365
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:09,737
Anyway, you don't have to
pay for your bragging.

366
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:38,576
732, delivery.

367
00:18:38,977 --> 00:18:39,816
Coming.

368
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:41,177
I'll leave it at the door.

369
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:43,336
No, wait for me a moment.

370
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,856
Don't you know my leg is injured?

371
00:19:00,296 --> 00:19:00,977
How...

372
00:19:09,217 --> 00:19:10,257
Seriously.

373
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:27,257
Come on.

374
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:31,536
Dude.

375
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:39,137
Mr. Wang.

376
00:19:39,937 --> 00:19:41,576
What happened?

377
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:45,497
Takeout.

378
00:19:48,177 --> 00:19:49,937
Why are you in such a hurry?

379
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:52,257
I thought you were leaving tomorrow.

380
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,137
The things I bought for you online

381
00:19:54,137 --> 00:19:55,177
haven't arrived yet.

382
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:57,016
I had to buy them again
at the last minute.

383
00:19:57,536 --> 00:19:59,336
Early or late, I have to go.

384
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:01,177
The company notified me
at the last minute

385
00:20:01,257 --> 00:20:03,257
about an emergency meeting in Jinshan,

386
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:05,616
so I had to leave early.

387
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:08,576
When you get to Jinshan,
don't just focus on work.

388
00:20:08,576 --> 00:20:10,576
You have to learn
to take care of yourself, you know?

389
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:12,296
This is food.

390
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:14,616
Here, I bought you a bath towel

391
00:20:14,616 --> 00:20:15,816
and disinfectant.

392
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:17,137
Once you get to the room,

393
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:19,336
you must thoroughly clean every corner.

394
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:21,177
It's not like I'm living there forever.

395
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:22,897
I'm going to Jinshan, not San Francisco.

396
00:20:22,897 --> 00:20:25,376
It's an hour's drive, no jet lag.

397
00:20:30,816 --> 00:20:34,657
There's no physical time difference,
but a psychological one.

398
00:20:43,457 --> 00:20:44,257
I get it.

399
00:20:46,457 --> 00:20:48,897
I'll try to come back every weekend

400
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:50,417
to be with you and Ke.

401
00:20:57,937 --> 00:21:01,177
This is still the first time we've been
apart since we got married,

402
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:03,457
and it's such a long time.

403
00:21:04,217 --> 00:21:05,657
I'm missing you already.

404
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,016
Remember what I said?

405
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:12,816
A short separation
is for a long reunion.

406
00:21:14,016 --> 00:21:16,536
When I've earned enough money
for a bigger house,

407
00:21:17,217 --> 00:21:18,856
we'll be together every day,

408
00:21:19,497 --> 00:21:20,616
never apart again.

409
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:26,737
I'll count on that.

410
00:21:30,257 --> 00:21:30,937
See you.

411
00:21:39,376 --> 00:21:40,257
Moli.

412
00:21:41,497 --> 00:21:43,776
There's one more thing
I need to ask of you.

413
00:21:44,897 --> 00:21:45,977
What is it?

414
00:21:46,257 --> 00:21:47,497
When I'm not here,

415
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,776
take Ke to stay
with my parents more often.

416
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:54,177
Two days a week, okay?

417
00:21:54,177 --> 00:21:55,536
No, that's too little.

418
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:56,776
Go there more.

419
00:21:57,977 --> 00:22:00,417
Why? You won't be there.

420
00:22:02,096 --> 00:22:04,096
I'm not there, and neither is Ke,

421
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:07,816
so at home, my dad and mom

422
00:22:07,816 --> 00:22:10,296
will be eyeing each other every day,

423
00:22:11,056 --> 00:22:12,336
and that easily leads to conflict.

424
00:22:13,056 --> 00:22:14,417
Once there's a conflict,

425
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:19,816
it's always my mom
who ends up at a disadvantage.

426
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:24,417
My dad is hot-tempered and unreasonable.

427
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:27,376
My mom is quite scared of him.

428
00:22:32,376 --> 00:22:33,336
I see.

429
00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:36,056
I'll take Ke to see them more often.

430
00:22:39,217 --> 00:22:39,977
Thank you.

431
00:23:00,897 --> 00:23:03,737
How is it? Do you like
the pig's trotter soup I made?

432
00:23:03,776 --> 00:23:04,937
It's very delicious.

433
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:07,816
Talk about 'fighting like with like'.

434
00:23:07,816 --> 00:23:09,776
I really didn't expect
your cooking skills to be so good.

435
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:11,497
Everything you make is so tasty.

436
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:15,376
I have decided.

437
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:18,336
You've been injured, right?

438
00:23:19,016 --> 00:23:20,336
So you need to boost your nutrition.

439
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:23,856
Let me know anytime
what you'd like to eat.

440
00:23:23,856 --> 00:23:25,576
I'll cook it and bring it over to you.

441
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:27,856
No way. I can't cause you
that much trouble.

442
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:29,217
It's no trouble at all.

443
00:23:29,697 --> 00:23:31,376
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about with me.

444
00:23:36,177 --> 00:23:37,697
Don't just drink the soup.

445
00:23:37,776 --> 00:23:38,457
Come on.

446
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:41,417
Get some pig's trotters.

447
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:43,096
Bring the bowl here.

448
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:02,697
It could be the courier.

449
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:05,897
Don't move. I'll get it.

450
00:24:06,576 --> 00:24:08,217
You've already taken a fall.

451
00:24:09,457 --> 00:24:11,177
Lingxiao, it's Niu.

452
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:17,897
Huang Qianniu?

453
00:24:22,737 --> 00:24:23,776
Is he not home?

454
00:24:26,056 --> 00:24:27,816
I ordered two portions
of pig's trotters.

455
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:41,933
(Qianniu)

456
00:24:43,217 --> 00:24:44,257
Lingxiao.

457
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,376
His foot is hurt, right?

458
00:24:51,376 --> 00:24:53,217
Where could he possibly gallivant to?

459
00:24:56,816 --> 00:24:58,257
See if he's left.

460
00:25:11,056 --> 00:25:11,856
He's gone.

461
00:25:15,697 --> 00:25:18,096
Is it okay not to let him in?

462
00:25:18,096 --> 00:25:19,177
It's fine.

463
00:25:19,737 --> 00:25:20,977
You know Qianniu.

464
00:25:21,177 --> 00:25:22,536
It won't be anything serious.

465
00:25:49,336 --> 00:25:51,457
So, you're just letting
Zhu Jincao go to Jinshan?

466
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:53,257
He's already made up his mind.

467
00:25:53,257 --> 00:25:54,457
All I can do is support him.

468
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:57,616
Besides, with this job offer in Jinshan,

469
00:25:57,616 --> 00:25:59,497
he can earn quite a bit more money.

470
00:25:59,497 --> 00:26:00,657
Money-grubber.

471
00:26:01,137 --> 00:26:02,257
But have you thought about it?

472
00:26:02,257 --> 00:26:04,457
This is a special period.

473
00:26:04,457 --> 00:26:06,336
The two of you are now divorced.
With the long distance,

474
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:07,536
can you really be at ease?

475
00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:10,217
I still trust Jincao's character.

476
00:26:10,217 --> 00:26:12,497
How many couples,
due to physical distance,

477
00:26:12,497 --> 00:26:15,217
have worn out what they thought
was indestructible affection,

478
00:26:15,296 --> 00:26:18,657
and plunged into the tender
arms within reach?

479
00:26:18,657 --> 00:26:19,816
What's that saying again?

480
00:26:19,937 --> 00:26:21,336
A good neighbor over a far brother.

481
00:26:21,336 --> 00:26:23,336
Say something nice, will you?

482
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:26,056
Good medicine tastes bitter,
and honest advice is hard to hear.

483
00:26:28,937 --> 00:26:31,096
Since I've decided,
I might as well take a gamble.

484
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,296
Winning the bet proves
I loved the right person.

485
00:26:33,697 --> 00:26:34,977
And if I lose,

486
00:26:35,257 --> 00:26:38,016
at worst, I'll just play along for real.

487
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,977
I hope you really can be this carefree.

488
00:26:39,977 --> 00:26:42,616
Although this divorce
has caused a lot of trouble,

489
00:26:43,177 --> 00:26:44,576
I've gained something from it.

490
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:45,937
I've come to understand a principle.

491
00:26:46,177 --> 00:26:47,177
What principle?

492
00:26:47,576 --> 00:26:51,576
If it takes all one has
to maintain a relationship,

493
00:26:51,616 --> 00:26:53,497
it's better to give up early.

494
00:26:53,616 --> 00:26:55,576
The best state in love

495
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,897
is when you're not afraid
at all of losing someone.

496
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:07,016
Come, look into my eyes.

497
00:27:07,897 --> 00:27:09,536
Words are at odds with thoughts.

498
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,657
I hope you'll do as you say.

499
00:27:16,697 --> 00:27:17,697
I can't do it.

500
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:21,697
The time difference is easy to resolve,

501
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:25,137
but distance is what I fear the most.

502
00:27:25,336 --> 00:27:28,137
We are far away
and mutually untouchable.

503
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,816
If something really happened to Jincao,

504
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,737
I really wouldn't know what to do.

505
00:27:41,257 --> 00:27:42,657
(When I'm not here,)

506
00:27:43,137 --> 00:27:45,536
(take Ke to stay
with my parents more often.)

507
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,616
I'm not there, and neither is Ke,

508
00:27:48,897 --> 00:27:52,856
so at home, my dad and mom
will be eyeing each other every day,

509
00:27:53,336 --> 00:27:54,776
and that easily leads to conflict.

510
00:27:55,217 --> 00:27:58,016
Once there's a conflict, it's always
my mom who ends up at a disadvantage.

511
00:27:58,217 --> 00:28:01,376
My dad is hot-tempered and unreasonable.

512
00:28:03,336 --> 00:28:04,737
My mom is quite scared of him.

513
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:06,897
Liuliu.

514
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:10,137
Let me tell you something weird.

515
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:11,937
Stop playing for a moment. Listen to me.

516
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:14,776
What is it?

517
00:28:14,937 --> 00:28:17,217
Before Jincao went to Jinshan,
he told me

518
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:19,016
that after he left,

519
00:28:19,056 --> 00:28:21,816
he wanted me to take Ke
to his parents' place more often.

520
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:23,616
That's understandable.

521
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:24,977
No.

522
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:28,096
Jincao said that
after he went to Jinshan,

523
00:28:28,177 --> 00:28:30,096
he wanted me to take care of his mom.

524
00:28:30,257 --> 00:28:33,257
He said his mom often has disputes
with his dad when they're together.

525
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:35,137
His mom would be at a disadvantage.

526
00:28:35,697 --> 00:28:37,336
I didn't follow.

527
00:28:44,977 --> 00:28:46,137
Domestic violence?!

528
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:48,217
Lower your voice.

529
00:28:48,737 --> 00:28:50,977
No, I'm just speculating.

530
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:53,937
So if Zhu Jincao's dad
really behaves like that,

531
00:28:53,937 --> 00:28:56,056
we absolutely cannot turn a blind eye.

532
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:58,657
This is Shanghai,
and he must obey the law.

533
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:00,016
He needs to respect women.

534
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:01,137
If he dares to misbehave,

535
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:03,016
he must be severely dealt with.

536
00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:04,697
How should I do that?

537
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:08,217
You have to find evidence.

538
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:10,536
Right, the key is evidence.

539
00:29:18,576 --> 00:29:19,697
Come here, let me tell you.

540
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:30,657
Well done, Gu Moli.

541
00:29:30,657 --> 00:29:32,217
You've got a plan.

542
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:38,296
Mom.

543
00:29:38,296 --> 00:29:40,856
What delicious food did Grandpa
make for me today?

544
00:29:40,856 --> 00:29:42,856
You'll know once you get home,
you little glutton.

545
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:43,816
Moli.

546
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:44,897
Ke's Grandma.

547
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:46,536
Hello, Grandma.

548
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:48,417
Ke, did you miss Grandma?

549
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:49,536
Yes, I did.

550
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:51,737
What are you doing here?

551
00:29:52,497 --> 00:29:55,497
I want to take Ke home
to stay for a couple of days.

552
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:56,897
I miss her.

553
00:29:57,016 --> 00:29:59,137
And so does her grandpa.

554
00:29:59,816 --> 00:30:03,177
No, I want to stay with Mom.

555
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:07,096
Ke, Grandma made you

556
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,016
your favorite fried chicken wings today.

557
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:11,457
Didn't you break that boat last time?

558
00:30:11,457 --> 00:30:12,977
Grandpa has fixed it for you.

559
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,737
Do you want to go back and see it?

560
00:30:20,137 --> 00:30:23,417
Didn't you say this morning that you
missed Grandpa and Grandma?

561
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:25,856
How about you go stay
with Grandma for a few days?

562
00:30:25,897 --> 00:30:27,257
What about you?

563
00:30:27,336 --> 00:30:30,336
I promise to come and pick you up
in a couple of days.

564
00:30:30,336 --> 00:30:32,376
You have to keep your word.

565
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,137
I will. Go on.

566
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:37,217
Okay.

567
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:39,457
Carry it yourself.

568
00:30:41,616 --> 00:30:43,137
Thank you, Moli.

569
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:43,977
Of course.

570
00:30:44,937 --> 00:30:46,257
Let's go, Ke.

571
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:48,816
Say goodbye to Mom quickly.

572
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:50,016
Goodbye, Mom.

573
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:50,576
Goodbye.

574
00:30:50,576 --> 00:30:51,977
Goodbye.

575
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:55,776
Let's go, back to Grandma's house.

576
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:59,217
Grandma has made some
delicious food for you.

577
00:31:00,657 --> 00:31:02,497
Dad, Mom, I'm back.

578
00:31:03,457 --> 00:31:04,457
Welcome home, Ke.

579
00:31:04,457 --> 00:31:06,137
Our baby.

580
00:31:07,016 --> 00:31:07,776
Where is she?

581
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:10,697
Ke was picked up by her Grandma.

582
00:31:14,737 --> 00:31:16,536
What does Zhang Shanya want to do?

583
00:31:17,616 --> 00:31:18,816
Is she trying to take the child?

584
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:20,816
What kind of family is this?

585
00:31:21,376 --> 00:31:23,616
Mom, don't get upset yet.

586
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:26,497
I agreed to let Ke's Grandma take Ke.

587
00:31:27,257 --> 00:31:29,257
Didn't Jincao go to Jinshan?

588
00:31:29,257 --> 00:31:32,137
Ke's grandparents hardly talk
to each other at home.

589
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:33,937
Her grandma is quite lonely.

590
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:36,177
Just let Ke keep her company
for a couple of days.

591
00:31:38,336 --> 00:31:41,096
You sure know how
to feel sorry for others, huh?

592
00:31:41,257 --> 00:31:43,417
Where's that empathy for me?

593
00:31:44,217 --> 00:31:45,737
I'll show you.

594
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,257
I'll cook dinner tonight, okay?

595
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:51,137
Forget it, who would eat your cooking?

596
00:31:51,137 --> 00:31:52,096
Just give it a try.

597
00:31:52,096 --> 00:31:52,856
It's useless.

598
00:31:52,856 --> 00:31:54,657
Alright, stop arguing.

599
00:31:54,657 --> 00:31:55,937
I'll do it.

600
00:31:55,937 --> 00:31:58,977
Darling, don't fight over this with Dad.

601
00:31:58,977 --> 00:32:00,096
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

602
00:32:02,056 --> 00:32:02,897
Don't leave.

603
00:32:02,937 --> 00:32:04,336
I haven't finished talking yet.

604
00:32:05,296 --> 00:32:07,056
I was very upset last night.

605
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:09,016
I was so angry
that I couldn't sleep all night.

606
00:32:10,497 --> 00:32:13,536
If Zhu Jincao goes back on his word
and dares to come again,

607
00:32:13,616 --> 00:32:15,536
I will go to Zhang Shanya.

608
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:17,616
Okay, I know.

609
00:32:18,497 --> 00:32:20,056
I'm serious.

610
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:24,376
Yulan, Yulan.

611
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:25,977
Listen to me now.

612
00:32:26,056 --> 00:32:28,417
Can you stop obsessing over this matter?

613
00:32:30,937 --> 00:32:32,016
Forget it.

614
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:45,290
(Hua Family Apartments)

615
00:32:45,816 --> 00:32:46,937
Look, honey.

616
00:32:47,137 --> 00:32:49,576
There's a microwave and a refrigerator.

617
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:51,897
This is an open kitchen.

618
00:32:53,177 --> 00:32:54,616
This is the bathroom.

619
00:32:56,296 --> 00:32:57,657
This is the sofa.

620
00:32:58,177 --> 00:32:59,937
It's a separate living room.

621
00:33:01,697 --> 00:33:03,257
This is the bedroom.

622
00:33:03,257 --> 00:33:04,457
This is my bed.

623
00:33:05,257 --> 00:33:06,776
This is my work desk.

624
00:33:08,336 --> 00:33:09,056
What do you think?

625
00:33:10,096 --> 00:33:13,457
Living here alone should be
quite spacious, right?

626
00:33:13,816 --> 00:33:18,016
Not bad, eh? Away from your wife,
no need to take care of kids.

627
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:19,816
No need to listen to parents' nagging.

628
00:33:19,816 --> 00:33:22,296
Back to the happy single life again.

629
00:33:22,296 --> 00:33:23,576
Aren't you very happy?

630
00:33:23,576 --> 00:33:27,177
How could I be?
Without you and Ke by my side,

631
00:33:27,697 --> 00:33:30,096
I feel as if I've been
exiled to the frontier,

632
00:33:30,336 --> 00:33:32,576
toiling in the bitter
wind and rain alone.

633
00:33:32,816 --> 00:33:34,417
There are sorrows in my heart.

634
00:33:34,657 --> 00:33:35,937
Alright. Fine.

635
00:33:35,937 --> 00:33:37,217
Look.

636
00:33:37,376 --> 00:33:39,737
Today, I had Grandma take Ke away.

637
00:33:39,816 --> 00:33:41,417
I'll visit her in a couple of days.

638
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:42,856
Thank you.

639
00:33:43,177 --> 00:33:45,457
You should rest early too,
after a tiring day.

640
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,616
I'm off to take a shower, good night.

641
00:33:47,856 --> 00:33:48,737
Good night.

642
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:10,257
Ke's Grandma.

643
00:34:10,976 --> 00:34:13,217
Moli, what brings you here?

644
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:15,896
These are all the clothes
Ke likes to wear.

645
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:17,017
I've brought them over.

646
00:34:19,296 --> 00:34:21,976
Last night, Ke made a fuss with me.

647
00:34:22,097 --> 00:34:24,296
She said she only wanted
to stay for two days.

648
00:34:24,336 --> 00:34:26,496
But you even brought so many clothes.

649
00:34:26,936 --> 00:34:30,336
It's okay. I'll tell Ke to stay longer.

650
00:34:32,816 --> 00:34:34,257
No, Moli.

651
00:34:34,257 --> 00:34:35,577
You should go.

652
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:37,617
Ke's grandpa has gone out to exercise.

653
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,657
I'm afraid it'll be trouble if he sees
you when he comes back.

654
00:34:42,336 --> 00:34:43,776
How have you been lately?

655
00:34:45,737 --> 00:34:47,697
I'm fine.

656
00:34:48,697 --> 00:34:49,816
Since Jincao isn't here,

657
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:52,257
if you need anything, call me anytime.

658
00:34:53,577 --> 00:34:55,416
Why bother?

659
00:34:55,496 --> 00:34:58,137
What do you have to do with this family?

660
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:01,936
It's not that you are
embarrassed to see me,

661
00:35:02,137 --> 00:35:04,017
but I'm embarrassed to see you.

662
00:35:04,017 --> 00:35:05,416
What should we talk about?

663
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,177
No. Wait.

664
00:35:06,177 --> 00:35:08,177
Go on, leave.

665
00:35:08,896 --> 00:35:10,657
I'll go in to get some of my stuff.

666
00:35:10,657 --> 00:35:11,776
I'll leave once I've got them.

667
00:35:12,257 --> 00:35:14,217
Yes, her stuff.

668
00:36:13,776 --> 00:36:16,137
Ke's Grandma, see you then.

669
00:36:17,336 --> 00:36:18,697
You've got everything, right?

670
00:36:19,496 --> 00:36:20,217
Take care.

671
00:36:20,217 --> 00:36:20,776
Okay.

00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:51,376
I'm sorry.

674
00:36:52,017 --> 00:36:53,296
(Jinying Live)
You're late.

675
00:36:55,057 --> 00:36:56,697
Liu Zhi said the meeting
was at two o'clock.

676
00:36:56,697 --> 00:36:59,336
I said one o'clock. You're mistaken.

677
00:36:59,336 --> 00:37:00,376
No, you didn't.

678
00:37:00,376 --> 00:37:01,217
Yes, I did.

679
00:37:01,217 --> 00:37:02,057
Zhu Jincao.

680
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,097
I don't care how you operate
at the headquarters.

681
00:37:04,137 --> 00:37:05,537
But this is Jinshan.

682
00:37:05,577 --> 00:37:08,017
The rule in Jinshan is that no one
can be even a minute late.

683
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:09,577
But you're an hour late

684
00:37:09,577 --> 00:37:11,097
for the very first meeting.

685
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,336
You're from the headquarters,
but don't think that

686
00:37:13,456 --> 00:37:14,776
we have to hold you in high esteem.

687
00:37:15,177 --> 00:37:16,336
If you fail to reach the standard,

688
00:37:16,697 --> 00:37:18,257
and you will be sent home.

689
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,217
If you're late, you are late.

690
00:37:20,217 --> 00:37:21,776
What is there to justify?

691
00:37:24,017 --> 00:37:25,657
I'm sorry, I understand now.

Mr. Bai, based on our original plan,

695

we have made two modifications.

696
00:37:35,617 --> 00:37:38,257
First, we plan to increase
the number of people,

697
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:41,017
but at the same time,
we want to combine the scenes.

Gently, gently.

708
00:38:12,816 --> 00:38:14,137
Try not to scratch it.

709
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:16,177
Right, handle it with care.

710
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:16,856
Let me take a look.

711
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:19,137
Don't go away.

00:38:19,336 --> 00:38:21,537
Come on. Aren't you responsible
for the installation?

713
00:38:21,537 --> 00:38:24,017
You are being quite
irresponsible, aren't you?

714
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,936
I had these two big boxes
shipped all the way across the ocean.

What am I supposed to do?

716
00:38:28,336 --> 00:38:31,137
I am a frail woman. How can I
possibly install it by myself?

for delivery, not installation.

Please, don't leave.

720
00:38:35,697 --> 00:38:37,336
I'll pay more. I will.

721
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:38,737
It's not about money.

00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:40,577
Hello, Ms. Yi.

723
00:38:40,577 --> 00:38:42,856
Hello, go ahead.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

724
00:38:42,856 --> 00:38:45,177
I said I could come over
right away to help you.

Please be gentle, young lady.

00:39:02,097 --> 00:39:03,697
This was shipped from abroad.

727
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:06,017
I can't afford to get it scratched.
It's very expensive.

728
00:39:06,017 --> 00:39:07,376
Rest assured, Ms. Yi.

729
00:39:07,376 --> 00:39:08,856
I am a professional at this.

730
00:39:11,137 --> 00:39:12,097
Ms. Yi.

731
00:39:12,097 --> 00:39:13,097
Choose a spot

732
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:15,057
to hang this painting,
and I'll hang it for you.

733
00:39:15,376 --> 00:39:16,097
Okay.

734
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:32,537
Honey.

735
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,496
I visited Ke's Grandma today,

736
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:35,737
and she's quite well.

737
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:39,097
I've decided to let Ke stay
at her grandma's these few days

738
00:39:39,097 --> 00:39:40,177
to spend more time with her.

739
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,177
Don't worry.

740
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:43,496
Are you doing okay
after arriving at Jinshan?

741
00:39:43,896 --> 00:39:45,177
Is everything going smoothly?

742
00:39:45,856 --> 00:39:47,776
Are the new colleagues
easy to get along with?

743
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,697
Honey, I was just in a meeting.

744
00:39:52,296 --> 00:39:53,336
Don't worry.

745
00:39:53,537 --> 00:39:56,217
The new colleagues here
are very friendly and enthusiastic.

746
00:39:56,697 --> 00:39:59,137
I'm now full of confidence
in my work at Jinshan.

747
00:40:40,697 --> 00:40:42,776
Ms. Yi, does this look alright to you?

748
00:40:43,177 --> 00:40:44,496
Quite good.

749
00:40:44,896 --> 00:40:45,537
Great.

750
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:12,496
Ms. Yi, how about this?

751
00:41:13,816 --> 00:41:15,177
I like it. It looks good.

752
00:41:15,177 --> 00:41:16,416
The artwork is nailed up, right?

753
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:18,017
Careful, young lady.

754
00:41:18,057 --> 00:41:19,896
Seeing you like this makes me anxious.

755
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:22,217
If you fall, I'll have
to take responsibility.

756
00:41:22,217 --> 00:41:22,776
I won't.

757
00:41:22,776 --> 00:41:23,697
Come on, come on down.

758
00:41:23,697 --> 00:41:24,737
Have a cup of coffee.

759
00:41:25,896 --> 00:41:27,617
Here you go. Be careful.

760
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:30,856
Thank you.

761
00:41:31,336 --> 00:41:33,017
Come on. Sit down.

762
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:36,617
Don't mention it.

763
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:39,296
You, young lady,
are quite spirited, aren't you?

764
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:40,856
I thought you would
bring workers with you.

765
00:41:40,856 --> 00:41:42,057
I didn't expect you to come

766
00:41:42,057 --> 00:41:44,177
with everything and get it all sorted.

767
00:41:44,177 --> 00:41:46,137
You can even use a drill.
Impressive indeed.

768
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:46,976
Ms. Yi.

769
00:41:46,976 --> 00:41:48,776
Although I graduated
from the Fine Arts department.

770
00:41:48,776 --> 00:41:49,697
Besides painting,

771
00:41:49,697 --> 00:41:51,776
I can also do mounting
and hanging of paintings.

772
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:54,057
You can call me anytime in need.

773
00:41:54,057 --> 00:41:55,776
You bought such expensive paintings.

774
00:41:55,776 --> 00:41:57,057
Some workers might not understand,

775
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:58,737
and it would be a pity to hurt them.

776
00:41:58,737 --> 00:41:59,976
Just call me for it.

777
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:02,336
You know what?

778
00:42:02,336 --> 00:42:03,416
You, young lady.

779
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:06,257
The determination in you is just like

780
00:42:06,336 --> 00:42:08,257
what I had back in the day.

781
00:42:08,657 --> 00:42:10,177
When you stood me up last time,

782
00:42:10,177 --> 00:42:11,416
I almost blocked you.

783
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,296
That being said,

784
00:42:13,296 --> 00:42:14,577
when I went to the gallery last time,

785
00:42:14,577 --> 00:42:16,496
I've been wanting to pick
a sculpture for this house.

786
00:42:16,496 --> 00:42:18,097
I didn't see anything I liked,

787
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:20,816
but there was a small
landscape painting I quite liked.

788
00:42:20,816 --> 00:42:21,416
Here.

789
00:42:21,697 --> 00:42:23,577
I remember taking a picture of it.

790
00:42:24,816 --> 00:42:25,936
Come on, take a look.

791
00:42:26,737 --> 00:42:28,217
I'm familiar with this one.

792
00:42:28,537 --> 00:42:29,976
Should I reserve it for you?

793
00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:31,936
Okay, reserve it. I'll take it.

794
00:42:33,537 --> 00:42:34,816
Give me your account number.

795
00:42:34,816 --> 00:42:36,097
I'll pay the deposit to you first.

796
00:42:36,097 --> 00:42:37,456
Okay, thank you, Ms. Yi.

797
00:42:37,456 --> 00:42:38,617
Don't call me "Ms. Yi".

798
00:42:38,617 --> 00:42:40,137
Now that we're all close,

799
00:42:40,177 --> 00:42:41,617
just call me Yi.

800
00:42:42,336 --> 00:42:44,416
Honey, I was...

801
00:42:46,617 --> 00:42:47,976
Hello? Mr. Yan.

802
00:42:47,976 --> 00:42:48,856
Moli.

803
00:42:49,057 --> 00:42:50,336
Print out and deliver the contract

804
00:42:50,336 --> 00:42:52,217
for my "Autumn Day" painting.

805
00:42:52,217 --> 00:42:53,816
Now, immediately.

806
00:42:54,737 --> 00:42:57,097
Mr. Yan, I just left a client's house.

807
00:42:57,097 --> 00:42:58,177
If I go back to the office,

808
00:42:58,177 --> 00:43:00,296
it'll take about an hour. Is that okay?

809
00:43:00,296 --> 00:43:02,657
No, I can only give you
half an hour at most.

810
00:43:02,737 --> 00:43:04,496
The guest will be
returning to Beijing soon.

811
00:43:04,737 --> 00:43:05,776
Think of a solution.

812
00:43:08,816 --> 00:43:09,496
Moli.

813
00:43:09,496 --> 00:43:11,737
Jiang Haitao, what are you doing here?

814
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:13,816
I live here.

815
00:43:14,896 --> 00:43:16,296
