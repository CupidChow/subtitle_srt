19
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,602
(Feiye Gallery)

20
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:16,636
Excuse me.

21
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:18,796
Is Mr. Wang Buhui here?

22
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:20,995
Who are you?

23
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:22,875
I'm a fan of his.

24
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:25,035
I heard that he works here,

25
00:02:25,116 --> 00:02:26,315
so I came to meet him

26
00:02:26,556 --> 00:02:29,276
and admire his works in person.

27
00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:31,995
He's not here today.

28
00:02:32,315 --> 00:02:33,636
These are his works.

29
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:34,636
Look around.

30
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:35,755
By the way,

31
00:02:35,796 --> 00:02:37,396
this is a painting studio now.

32
00:02:37,396 --> 00:02:38,475
We're starting a lesson

33
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:39,356
once the kids arrive.

34
00:02:39,356 --> 00:02:40,796
You'd better hurry.

35
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,475
How did a painter

36
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:51,995
who has been on the news,

37
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:54,595
held exhibitions,

38
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:56,636
and made millions yuan a year

39
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:58,195
suddenly open a studio

40
00:02:58,236 --> 00:03:00,315
and start teaching kids to paint?

41
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:03,475
What has he been through?

42
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:13,915
Is there something unspeakable?

43
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:15,315
Was he used

44
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:16,915
or set up by someone?

45
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:19,315
What's all that nonsense?

46
00:03:19,315 --> 00:03:20,796
I don't know what you're saying.

47
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:21,676
Please get out.

48
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:23,396
Please get out...

49
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:30,396
"I've been looked down upon
and belittled all my life."

50
00:03:32,116 --> 00:03:33,595
"I never went to a prestigious school."

51
00:03:34,356 --> 00:03:36,035
"Nor did I have a known mentor."

52
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:37,755
"I have nothing"

53
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,475
"but passion for painting."

54
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,396
"My splendor is not in a single day,"

55
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:44,435
"but every day."

56
00:03:45,715 --> 00:03:47,875
These are Wang Buhui's own words.

57
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:50,116
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:51,995
I'm not his fan.

59
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:54,315
I came here today

60
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:56,076
for my wife.

61
00:03:57,035 --> 00:03:58,595
My wife loves painting

62
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:00,076
just like Mr. Wang.

63
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:02,676
But she is going through

64
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,836
what Mr. Wang once went through.

65
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:08,676
So,

66
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:13,875
I'd like to seek your help.

67
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:16,316
Can I?

68
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:18,396
Mr. Wang Buhui.

69
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:27,876
I met Zhou Congde

70
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:30,396
at the Hangzhou Art Salon.

71
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:32,196
We had a great conversation.

72
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:33,836
He kept praising me,

73
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:35,876
saying that my works

74
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:37,795
were lively

75
00:04:37,836 --> 00:04:38,876
and realistic.

76
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:43,316
We met a few more times after that

77
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,756
and got along very well.

78
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:46,516
A month later,

79
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:48,155
they signed a contract with me.

80
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:51,355
Then they organized exhibitions for me.

81
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:52,956
I felt that I found

82
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:54,475
someone who understood me.

83
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:57,115
Who would have known?

84
00:04:57,155 --> 00:04:58,915
They knew nothing about art.

85
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:00,795
They signed me just to brand me up.

86
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:02,115
They traded my paintings

87
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:03,475
to get the prices high

88
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:05,396
through a bunch of organizations.

89
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:09,235
What they did with my paintings

90
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:11,595
ruined my reputation.

91
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:13,355
No one wanted my paintings anymore.

92
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:15,235
Then, they signed new artists.

93
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,795
The same tactics.

94
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:18,076
Those artists vanished

95
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:19,516
just like I did.

96
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:28,076
Jing Nanhua.

97
00:05:31,516 --> 00:05:32,355
Zhu Jincao.

98
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:33,996
That's me.

99
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:40,795
Buhui has contacted me.

100
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:41,915
Let's get down

101
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:43,155
to business.

102
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:44,475
Here's the thing.

103
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:47,155
I learned you were a signed artist

104
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:49,436
at Decong Company two years ago.

105
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,235
You held grand exhibitions.

106
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:55,115
And your paintings
were sold for quite a high price.

107
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:58,795
Why did you disappear into thin air?

108
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:01,436
How did that happen?

109
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:02,836
I don't want to talk about it.

110
00:06:04,756 --> 00:06:05,996
To tell you the truth,

111
00:06:06,436 --> 00:06:07,516
I've been

112
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:09,196
looking into Decong Company

113
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:11,595
through various channels.

114
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:14,235
I found that they signed
a bunch of painters

115
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:15,915
like you two years ago.

116
00:06:16,155 --> 00:06:17,756
Your paintings were known overnight.

117
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:19,475
Their prices soared.

118
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:21,915
And then you vanished.

119
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:25,155
It's a classic money laundering

120
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:26,396
via art transactions.

121
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:28,876
But I don't get it.

122
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,715
How come

123
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:33,595
none of the painters dare to speak out?

124
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:38,595
Because of the shame.

125
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:41,956
No one wants to discuss
what disgraces themselves,

126
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:45,876
especially as an artist.

127
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:49,996
I believe you must come forward

128
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,516
and tell the truth as a victim.

129
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,956
You can't let them go on like this.

130
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:58,235
Are you a journalist?

131
00:06:58,276 --> 00:06:59,115
No.

132
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:01,115
Then why do you care?

133
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:04,675
Because their latest target

134
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:06,715
is my wife.

135
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,595
Relatively speaking, I prefer this one.

136
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:12,035
Yeah, it's closer to nature.

137
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:12,956
It's really nice.

138
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:13,836
Thank you.

139
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:14,836
Hi.

140
00:07:17,155 --> 00:07:18,035
Ms. Gu.

141
00:07:18,436 --> 00:07:20,316
Your paintings are great,

142
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:22,396
especially this "Pale White Light".

143
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:23,876
I really like it.

144
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:24,836
Thank you.

145
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:25,475
Look around.

146
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:26,115
Okay.

147
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:28,715
Ms. Gu.

148
00:07:29,436 --> 00:07:31,475
When did you paint this one?

149
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:33,155
During my college years.

150
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:34,915
Excuse me for a second.

151
00:07:34,915 --> 00:07:35,795
Moli.

152
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:37,876
Jincao is waiting for you outside.

153
00:07:51,235 --> 00:07:52,076
Come with me.

154
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:55,555
Why didn't you come in?

155
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:57,115
Something is wrong.

156
00:07:57,355 --> 00:07:59,636
Is your painting
really worth that much money?

157
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:02,276
Zhou Yu is most probably
using you as a pawn.

158
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:05,475
What do you mean?

159
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:07,196
He's using you to launder money.

160
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:11,155
"Pawn?" "Launder money?"

161
00:08:11,235 --> 00:08:12,276
I don't get it.

162
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:15,555
I thought you came to congratulate me.

163
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,516
I guess I was wrong.

164
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:18,276
No.

165
00:08:18,555 --> 00:08:20,355
I can explain it later.

166
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:22,355
But you can't stay here.

167
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:23,316
Come with me.

168
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:25,675
Zhu Jincao, where are we going?

169
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:26,876
Come with me. Trust me.

170
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:27,555
Where should I go?

171
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:28,076
I'll explain it.

172
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:28,675
It's my art...

173
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,076
Zhu Jincao, let her go.

174
00:08:32,396 --> 00:08:33,795
Moli, trust me, please.

175
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:35,356
Or you'll be in big trouble.

176
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:37,155
It's okay if you don't congratulate me.

177
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:38,435
Why are you cursing me?

178
00:08:39,195 --> 00:08:40,596
Please trust me. Let's go.

179
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:41,035
Security!

180
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:42,075
What's wrong with you?

181
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:42,675
Security!

182
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,236
You can't stay here, you know?

183
00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:45,756
Can you trust me just this once?

184
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:49,716
Escort him out.

185
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:51,035
Wait.

186
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:54,795
I know you feel challenged.

187
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:56,835
I know how you feel.

188
00:08:57,476 --> 00:08:59,516
But it's an important day for me.

189
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:02,795
Let's talk after the exhibition.

190
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:12,716
Sir, please.

191
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:20,795
Mr. Fan,

192
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:22,155
what do you think about

193
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:23,276
Xu Weiping's potential?

194
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:24,396
He's doing well.

195
00:09:26,075 --> 00:09:27,356
Your paintings are nice.

196
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:29,195
Thank you.

197
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:29,876
You're welcome.

198
00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:32,835
Ms. Gu.

199
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:33,915
Mr. Fan.

200
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:34,955
Congratulations.

201
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:37,356
I've read the article you wrote.

202
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:38,435
Thank you.

203
00:09:38,555 --> 00:09:40,795
Your approval matters a lot to me.

204
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:43,516
It's just an art review. It's nothing.

205
00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:45,675
Isn't that how the art circle works?

206
00:09:46,035 --> 00:09:47,396
I've received the payment.

207
00:09:48,116 --> 00:09:50,356
I wrote it for fun. So read it for fun.

208
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:51,716
Don't take it seriously.

209
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:53,396
We are good friends.

210
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:55,356
I won't hesitate to endorse you

211
00:09:55,435 --> 00:09:57,155
whenever you need me.

212
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:58,476
Thank you.

213
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:07,996
What do you want?

214
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,276
Mi Na, you have to help me out.

215
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,116
Mr. Ex-husband,

216
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:12,716
why should I help you?

217
00:10:13,236 --> 00:10:14,435
Listen to me.

218
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:27,356
I want nothing to do

219
00:10:27,356 --> 00:10:29,035
with all your messy family stuff.

220
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:29,915
Besides,

221
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:32,236
Gu Moli is hitting it off
with the new boss.

222
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:33,675
You don't stand a chance.

223
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,636
Don't drag me down.

224
00:10:35,195 --> 00:10:36,116
Mi Na.

225
00:10:36,955 --> 00:10:38,315
It's a serious matter.

226
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:40,996
I'm begging you, okay?

227
00:10:52,476 --> 00:10:53,075
So?

228
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:54,236
Are you ready?

229
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:57,155
It's about to end.

230
00:10:57,195 --> 00:10:58,396
You've got to say something.

231
00:10:58,675 --> 00:10:59,315
Okay?

232
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:05,396
What's going on?

233
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:07,236
Sorry...

234
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:08,396
What have you done?

235
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,315
I'm sorry.

236
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:10,075
Go, clean it up.

237
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:11,116
Okay, I'll take her.

238
00:11:11,276 --> 00:11:12,476
Come on.

239
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:17,795
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

240
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:18,756
No, I didn't.

241
00:11:18,756 --> 00:11:20,516
My hand shook for a second.

242
00:11:20,516 --> 00:11:21,596
I poured too much.

243
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:22,835
You drank too much.

244
00:11:24,636 --> 00:11:25,716
The restroom is there.

245
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:26,955
No, come back.

246
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:28,396
Someone is upstairs,

247
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,835
waiting for you. It's urgent.

248
00:11:32,835 --> 00:11:34,236
Hurry up.

249
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,276
Go!

250
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:47,516
What do you want?

251
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:49,795
Take a look at this.

252
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:00,555
I've collected information

253
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:02,636
(Art as a tool to launder money)
on a dozen signed painters like you.

254
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,596
They were all overpaid

255
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:07,315
and they vanished from the market.

256
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:09,276
I've met three of them.

257
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:11,276
((Shocking inside story))
The most successful one is Wang Buhui.

258
00:12:12,276 --> 00:12:13,116
He's just

259
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:14,716
teaching kids how to paint

260
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:16,236
in a training institution.

261
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:19,555
The other two have long since
switched careers.

262
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:21,435
One is an Uber driver.

263
00:12:21,636 --> 00:12:22,915
One is in the catering business.

264
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:30,435
Zhou Yu's father, Zhou Congde's company

265
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:32,116
is suspected of money laundering.

266
00:12:33,276 --> 00:12:35,236
There have been three cases

267
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:36,476
in the litigation process.

268
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:38,996
Zhou Congde was found guilty
in all three cases.

269
00:12:39,476 --> 00:12:40,555
This scandal caused

270
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:42,035
an uproar on the internet.

271
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:43,396
So they had to back down.

272
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:45,236
But two years later,

273
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:47,155
Zhou Yu took over

274
00:12:47,195 --> 00:12:49,396
and restarted
their illegal family business.

275
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,756
But they miscalculated this time.

276
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:54,356
I won't let them hurt you.

277
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,356
Moli.

278
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:20,075
I really like your paintings.

279
00:13:20,996 --> 00:13:21,756
You've been

280
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:23,636
a real painter for a long time.

281
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:25,476
But it has nothing

282
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:27,795
to do with the market value

283
00:13:27,996 --> 00:13:29,236
of your paintings.

284
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:30,876
You are in the business.

285
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:32,675
You know better than I do.

286
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:33,996
It's very obvious.

287
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:35,955
Zhou Yu is just using you as a pawn.

288
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:38,435
This is a scam and a setup.

289
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:39,716
I'd like to know

290
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:41,315
what setup it is.

291
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:56,675
Are you laundering money through me?

292
00:14:11,035 --> 00:14:12,035
You're investigating me?

293
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:12,795
That's right.

294
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:18,035
I've never seen someone like you.

295
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:20,155
Why are you investigating me?

296
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:21,835
For Moli?

297
00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:24,035
Are you scared I'd win her over?

298
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:27,516
You know what you've done.

299
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:30,116
Don't make Moli

300
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:31,996
the scapegoat of your illegal conduct.

301
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:34,596
Business fraud, money laundering.

302
00:14:34,596 --> 00:14:36,396
Calculate the sentence for yourself.

303
00:14:40,116 --> 00:14:41,075
Name your price.

304
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,756
What do you mean?

305
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:47,915
I said

306
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:50,116
name a price

307
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:52,116
for these things

308
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:53,996
plus your silence.

309
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:55,035
Name the price.

310
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:56,795
So you're admitting it.

311
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:57,396
Admitting what?

312
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,315
You're laundering money through Moli

313
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:01,636
and paying me off to stay silent.

314
00:15:02,195 --> 00:15:02,915
Right?

315
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:19,315
Zhou Yu.

316
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:21,795
Why did you lie to me?

317
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,476
Why did you break the law?

318
00:15:27,315 --> 00:15:28,876
I'm so disappointed in you.

319
00:15:32,075 --> 00:15:32,915
Gu Moli.

320
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:35,276
Listen to me carefully.

321
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:38,476
All those painters
who have worked with me,

322
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:41,596
let's say Holi, Poli, Roli,

323
00:15:41,596 --> 00:15:42,756
Boli, or whatever,

324
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:44,835
no one dares to talk to me like this.

325
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:47,476
They agreed with me

326
00:15:47,476 --> 00:15:49,075
and played this game.

327
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:52,555
Put the money in your pocket

328
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:54,795
and then shut your mouth.

329
00:15:55,356 --> 00:15:56,596
Don't you want money?

330
00:15:58,195 --> 00:15:59,236
I promoted you.

331
00:15:59,516 --> 00:16:01,236
I spent so much money on you.

332
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:03,795
You made a fortune because of me.

333
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:05,476
But what do I get in the end?

334
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:08,716
Gu Moli.

335
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:12,116
I've been so sweet to you.

336
00:16:12,435 --> 00:16:14,035
Yet your ex-husband

337
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:15,675
comes to threaten me

338
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:17,396
with these things.

339
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:19,756
And you're questioning me.

340
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,675
I regret it deeply.

341
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:28,675
Why am I

342
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:30,516
getting dragged down by people

343
00:16:30,675 --> 00:16:31,876
in your class?

344
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:33,195
What class are we?

345
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:37,035
We make a living in an honorable way.

346
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:39,636
We are not loaded,
but it's nothing shameful.

347
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:41,476
What about you?

348
00:16:42,236 --> 00:16:44,555
Tell me what class you are.

349
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,195
Your so-called business

350
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:50,116
is about making money
through dirty tricks.

351
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:51,315
Dirty?

352
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:53,396
Gu Moli.

353
00:16:53,636 --> 00:16:54,996
Why do you paint?

354
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:57,315
Isn't it for fame and money?

355
00:16:57,756 --> 00:16:58,636
Let me tell you.

356
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:01,075
Everyone in the world

357
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,595
is measured by economic value.

358
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,196
The so-called art

359
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:07,476
is just a pretentious
and fabricated idea.

360
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:08,716
That is reality.

361
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:11,395
Think about it.

362
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:13,395
Who unleashed your potential?

363
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:15,355
You think your paintings can sell

364
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:17,436
for millions yuan without me?

365
00:17:18,196 --> 00:17:20,115
They are just a pile of paper.

366
00:17:29,035 --> 00:17:30,635
If that's how it works,

367
00:17:31,835 --> 00:17:33,676
I'd rather not paint again.

368
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:35,115
Fine.

369
00:17:36,115 --> 00:17:37,075
Gu Moli.

370
00:17:37,676 --> 00:17:38,716
Zhu Jincao.

371
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:43,156
Have you ever thought about

372
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,676
why your marriage

373
00:17:45,756 --> 00:17:47,835
and your life have come to this point?

374
00:17:49,516 --> 00:17:51,276
It happened because

375
00:17:51,276 --> 00:17:53,395
you never saw your real value.

376
00:17:54,635 --> 00:17:55,916
Well said.

377
00:17:57,716 --> 00:17:59,075
I've recorded everything.

378
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:02,996
Especially you.

379
00:18:05,236 --> 00:18:07,355
I despise someone like you.

380
00:18:07,835 --> 00:18:09,276
What do you gain

381
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:11,115
by bringing me down?

382
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,476
Can you make her happy?

383
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:14,875
You can't.

384
00:18:15,436 --> 00:18:16,795
You can only turn

385
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:18,436
the man who could make her happy

386
00:18:18,436 --> 00:18:19,835
into a suspect.

387
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:21,196
Are you happy now?

388
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:22,875
You just said

389
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:24,716
that Gu Moli is a pawn.

390
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:27,315
You're not even

391
00:18:28,436 --> 00:18:30,716
worthy to be my pawn.

392
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,075
Who the heck are you?

393
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:43,115
You're just someone
living off her fortune.

394
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:45,956
Jincao.

395
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:47,395
I'm living off her fortune?

396
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:48,795
I'm living off her fortune?

397
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,795
I'm going to kill you!

398
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,916
I'm going to kill you!

399
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:58,392
(Public Security)

400
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:15,635
What's going on?

401
00:19:15,635 --> 00:19:16,756
Who is Mi Na?

402
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:19,355
Me, I'm Mi Na, officer.

403
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:20,835
Okay, thank you for calling.

404
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,676
Zhu Jincao asked me to call you.

405
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,115
Officer.

406
00:19:24,115 --> 00:19:25,795
Gu Moli is also a victim.

407
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:26,916
She's innocent.

408
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:27,916
Rest assured.

409
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:29,756
We won't let go of a bad person.

410
00:19:29,756 --> 00:19:31,516
Nor will we falsely accuse
a good person.

411
00:19:32,795 --> 00:19:34,276
You shouldn't resort to violence

412
00:19:34,276 --> 00:19:35,676
no matter what.

413
00:19:35,835 --> 00:19:36,635
Understood.

414
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:37,795
Come with us.

415
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:39,075
We'll follow the rules.

416
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,355
Let's go.

417
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:53,115
Mr. Zhu.

418
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:58,436
First of all, we'd like to thank you.

419
00:19:58,555 --> 00:19:59,795
To be honest,

420
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:00,516
we have been

421
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:02,476
studying Decong Company for a long time.

422
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:04,115
We have received several reports

423
00:20:04,276 --> 00:20:06,355
and we've been gathering evidence.

424
00:20:06,595 --> 00:20:08,756
The recordings
and other information you provided

425
00:20:08,756 --> 00:20:10,196
are very helpful.

426
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:13,276
We might need to
contact you for more evidence.

427
00:20:13,315 --> 00:20:14,595
Okay, no problem.

428
00:20:14,795 --> 00:20:16,476
But I must remind you.

429
00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:17,516
For safety reasons,

430
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,956
we do not encourage you

431
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:20,996
to act alone in situations like this.

432
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:22,716
Always call the police first.

433
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:24,676
I see.

434
00:20:25,196 --> 00:20:26,795
Where is Gu Moli?

435
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:28,156
She is giving a statement.

436
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,916
From what we've learned,

437
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,355
she got involved in this scam

438
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:35,315
without knowing the truth.

439
00:20:35,476 --> 00:20:37,676
Thankfully,
you had someone call the police,

440
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:40,115
which prevented
the situation from escalating

441
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:42,395
and avoided worse consequences.

442
00:20:42,835 --> 00:20:45,276
Otherwise, she would be
in deeper trouble.

443
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:46,236
So,

444
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:46,996
does Gu Moli

445
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,795
need to bear any responsibility?

446
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:50,196
No.

447
00:20:50,196 --> 00:20:51,996
She can go home
after giving the statement.

448
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:54,196
Meanwhile, we have informed her

449
00:20:54,196 --> 00:20:56,756
that the 1,048,000 yuan
would be frozen in the account.

450
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,315
The money may be reclaimed

451
00:20:58,315 --> 00:20:59,595
once the case is closed.

452
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:02,595
Thank you, officer.

453
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:04,075
Thank you.

454
00:21:08,196 --> 00:21:09,595
Thank you for your cooperation.

455
00:21:09,716 --> 00:21:11,355
I may contact you again.

456
00:21:11,795 --> 00:21:12,916
Okay, anytime.

457
00:21:13,196 --> 00:21:15,236
Excuse me, where is Zhu Jincao?

458
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:16,716
He did the papers and left.

459
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,516
Goodbye.

460
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,436
(It feels like a dream.)

461
00:21:27,595 --> 00:21:30,795
(It's so hard for one
to know who they really are.)

462
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,236
(Even Zhu Jincao has left me.)

463
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:35,676
(Is life really so cruel?)

464
00:21:35,676 --> 00:21:38,552
♪This is not the result I wanted♪

465
00:21:38,552 --> 00:21:40,110
♪I'm sure♪

466
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:45,676
You say I have a bad temper.

467
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:47,716
You say I'm nagging.

468
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,315
You call me stubborn.

469
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,276
Do I want to be like this?

470
00:21:54,156 --> 00:21:55,676
The teachings of the Zhu family

471
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,555
have been passed down to me,
the thirteenth generation.

472
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:02,035
It was over 4000 characters

473
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:03,635
and more than 80 items.

474
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:07,516
I have edited it down to 24 items.

475
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:10,916
I felt guilty after I did that.

476
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:14,115
Who am I

477
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:16,795
to edit the Zhu family's teachings?

478
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:21,236
We can't throw away

479
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:23,075
what's left by our ancestors.

480
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,516
We must keep the good things.

481
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,516
Otherwise, how do I

482
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,115
face our ancestors

483
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:32,635
after I die?

484
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:36,875
We don't have to be wealthy.

485
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,996
But we can't live without morality.

486
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,395
You're bored to learn

487
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:48,676
how to make stews.

488
00:22:49,595 --> 00:22:52,716
But we're not only eating
to stop the hunger.

489
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:55,035
We also eat to obtain nutrition.

490
00:22:55,835 --> 00:22:58,156
Stews require simple ingredients

491
00:22:58,156 --> 00:23:00,956
that vary in different seasons.

492
00:23:01,996 --> 00:23:06,115
As the saying goes,
mutton in autumn and chicken in spring,

493
00:23:06,236 --> 00:23:08,676
radishes in winter and melons in summer.

494
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:11,875
A well-made stew

495
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:14,035
could be a meal in itself.

496
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:18,595
Marriage is marriage.

497
00:23:18,956 --> 00:23:20,916
Love is love.

498
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:24,276
We often yearn for the beauty of love

499
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:27,795
and feel moved by the everlasting love

500
00:23:27,795 --> 00:23:28,795
we hear about.

501
00:23:29,196 --> 00:23:30,516
But we forget

502
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:33,716
about the contributions and tolerance

503
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:36,996
of our family members in daily life.

504
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:38,676
They do their best

505
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:40,156
to protect us

506
00:23:40,156 --> 00:23:41,996
wholeheartedly and carefully

507
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:43,476
without ever stopping.

508
00:23:44,196 --> 00:23:45,795
They deserve respect.

509
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:47,236
They deserve love.

510
00:23:48,516 --> 00:23:51,956
They deserve your attention,

511
00:23:52,756 --> 00:23:53,635
a hug,

512
00:23:54,196 --> 00:23:55,115
and a kiss.

513
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,875
Don't take their contributions

514
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,315
for granted.

515
00:24:00,476 --> 00:24:01,635
Don't ignore them.

516
00:24:02,555 --> 00:24:03,875
Don't neglect them.

517
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,996
We are truly insignificant
in this metropolis

518
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:09,276
of twenty million people.

519
00:24:10,236 --> 00:24:11,635
Life is tiring

520
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,355
and challenging.

521
00:24:14,635 --> 00:24:15,875
But think about

522
00:24:16,075 --> 00:24:19,635
all those who
care about you and love you.

523
00:24:20,756 --> 00:24:23,956
I hope there's
an everlasting light in my heart

524
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:26,956
that illuminates our lives with hope

525
00:24:27,436 --> 00:24:30,555

How did you get involved
in fraud and money laundering?

532
00:24:59,595 --> 00:25:02,156
You won't have a criminal record, right?

533
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:05,956
Thankfully, Zhu Jincao
discovered it early.

534
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:08,115
We were so lucky.

535
00:25:08,835 --> 00:25:10,315

537

We can't keep ill-gotten wealth.

539
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:17,516
Why is it ill-gotten wealth?

540
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,315
How come it's ill-gotten wealth?

541
00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:21,996
Moli was unaware.

542
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:23,395
She was exploited.

543
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:24,956
She was the victim.

544
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:26,835
But she learned this lesson

545
00:25:27,196 --> 00:25:28,395
in a painful way.

546
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:30,756

547
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:32,315
We must give it in.

549
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:38,196
Please.

550
00:25:38,595 --> 00:25:40,436
Just leave me alone for a second.

00:26:58,276 --> 00:27:00,035
I've always been on your side.

570
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,115
Still lying?

571
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:03,196
If it happens again,

572
00:27:03,395 --> 00:27:04,355
you'll be fired.

573
00:27:04,355 --> 00:27:05,236
All right, Ms. Shen.

574
00:27:11,716 --> 00:27:12,716
Well,

575
00:27:13,795 --> 00:27:15,476
I won't go to the Hangzhou forum.

576
00:27:15,555 --> 00:27:16,516
Go alone.

577
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:20,075
Okay, Ms. Shen.

578
00:27:28,676 --> 00:27:29,555
(My dear cousin.)

579
00:27:30,075 --> 00:27:31,355
(I'm exposed.)

580
00:27:31,355 --> 00:27:32,555
(She called me a traitor.)

581
00:27:32,676 --> 00:27:34,355
(She won't visit Hangzhou)

582
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:36,436
(even at the cost of the business.)

583
00:27:36,676 --> 00:27:37,835
(I'm clueless now.)

584
00:27:38,355 --> 00:27:39,835
Still those same old sayings.

585
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:41,916
Don't be tired of it.

586
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:44,075
Safety comes first.

587
00:27:44,075 --> 00:27:45,236
Our slogan is...

588
00:27:45,236 --> 00:27:46,476
Surpass...

589
00:27:46,516 --> 00:27:47,835
The KPI!

590
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:48,956
Marry...

591
00:27:48,956 --> 00:27:50,276
A fair lady!

592
00:27:50,276 --> 00:27:51,555
We got this!

593
00:27:51,555 --> 00:27:53,035
We got this!

594
00:27:53,035 --> 00:27:53,916
Get to work!

595
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:56,795
You got this!

596
00:27:56,795 --> 00:27:57,315
Alright.

597
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:57,875
Be careful.

598
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,236
Boss.

599
00:27:59,236 --> 00:27:59,795
Who are you?

600
00:28:01,395 --> 00:28:04,035
I'd like to be a part-time deliveryman

601
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:06,756
for the orders from
the nearby neighborhoods.

602
00:28:07,075 --> 00:28:08,956
Here is my resume. Please have a look.

603
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:11,682
(Recruiting, Weekly Wage Settlement)

604
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:12,756
Undercover peer.

605
00:28:12,756 --> 00:28:13,956
No, no.

606
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:16,595
Undercover journalist.

607
00:28:16,676 --> 00:28:17,436
Let me tell you.

608
00:28:17,436 --> 00:28:18,795
This is a legitimate business.

609
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:19,835
You'd better not

610
00:28:19,835 --> 00:28:21,035
cause problems here.

611
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:21,916
You got me wrong.

612
00:28:23,276 --> 00:28:24,516
Let me be honest.

613
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:26,236
I'm an author,

614
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:28,875
working on a motivational novel

615
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,476
about a career path to success.

616
00:28:31,595 --> 00:28:33,075
The protagonist

617
00:28:33,075 --> 00:28:34,956
started as a takeout deliveryman.

618
00:28:34,956 --> 00:28:36,196
I believe that

619
00:28:36,196 --> 00:28:37,595
the food deliverymen

620
00:28:37,595 --> 00:28:39,035
lead brilliant lives

621
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:40,835
with plenty of anecdotes

622
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:44,115
that are worth writing about.

623
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:46,436
You want an experience?

624
00:28:47,395 --> 00:28:48,276
Tell you what.

625
00:28:48,276 --> 00:28:49,395
You've found

626
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,795
the right place.

627
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,516
Our food deliverymen

628
00:28:52,516 --> 00:28:54,635
have a taste of joys and sorrows

629
00:28:54,635 --> 00:28:55,835
in their everyday life.

630
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:57,355
Let me read your resume.

631
00:28:57,355 --> 00:28:58,875
Come on in.

632
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:02,196
Takeaway.

633
00:29:02,196 --> 00:29:02,996
Coming.

634
00:29:05,395 --> 00:29:06,276
Your takeaway.

635
00:29:06,516 --> 00:29:07,236
Thank you.

636
00:29:07,476 --> 00:29:08,875
Enjoy your meal.

637
00:29:13,035 --> 00:29:14,276
What's going on?

638
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:15,916
You keep shunning me.

639
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:17,355
This is my last resort.

640
00:29:18,075 --> 00:29:19,676
Lingxiao, you look kind of cute.

641
00:29:21,355 --> 00:29:23,395
Liuliu, it has nothing to do with me.

642
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:24,236
I swear.

643
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:28,276
Since I'm here,

644
00:29:28,315 --> 00:29:29,676
may I come in?

645
00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:30,835
No.

646
00:29:33,996 --> 00:29:35,916
Keep delivering takeaways.

647
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,476
Liuliu, let's keep the food.

648
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:45,196
Ms. Shen.

649
00:29:45,355 --> 00:29:47,035
You shouldn't drive him away.

650
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:48,676
Call him back.

651
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:50,956
Give him a lesson to vent your anger.

652
00:29:51,236 --> 00:29:52,156
Shut up.

653
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,156
You traitor.

654
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:55,716
He learned it from you.

655
00:29:57,035 --> 00:29:58,635
We won't order takeaways again.

656
00:30:00,436 --> 00:30:02,355
What am I going to eat then?

657
00:30:02,595 --> 00:30:05,115
I don't think you'll like my cooking.

658
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:08,436
And look at you.

659
00:30:08,756 --> 00:30:11,156
I can't bear to let you cook.

660
00:30:11,156 --> 00:30:12,276
Then let's move.

661
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:14,236
Can't I just hide from him?

662
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:27,236
Ms. Zhang, you can start anytime.

663
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:31,236
I returned to my maiden home

664
00:30:31,236 --> 00:30:32,756
without telling him

665
00:30:32,756 --> 00:30:34,716
and stayed there overnight.

666
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,075
After I went back,

667
00:30:36,996 --> 00:30:38,236
he said

668
00:30:38,716 --> 00:30:40,595
that I shouldn't spend the night out

669
00:30:41,196 --> 00:30:43,196
since we were married.

670
00:30:44,315 --> 00:30:46,315
And the second time was right after

671
00:30:46,756 --> 00:30:48,795
I had given birth to Jincao.

672
00:30:49,276 --> 00:30:51,156
Jincao was just a baby.

673
00:30:52,196 --> 00:30:53,676
I was breastfeeding him

674
00:30:53,676 --> 00:30:55,075
a bit hastily.

675
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,635
He choked and vomited.

676
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:00,875
He said I couldn't even
take care of our kid.

677
00:31:01,315 --> 00:31:03,516
And then, we took Jincao

678
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:07,075
to my in-laws' house once.

679
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:10,115
He was already in primary school.

680
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,875
That's when the kids are the naughtiest.

681
00:31:14,196 --> 00:31:16,716
I scolded him for being naughty.

682
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:18,916
My mother-in-law wouldn't allow it.

683
00:31:18,996 --> 00:31:22,315
She sided with her grandson.

684
00:31:22,355 --> 00:31:23,916
I was still young back then,

685
00:31:24,156 --> 00:31:25,756
so I talked back.

686
00:31:26,956 --> 00:31:28,115
He said that

687
00:31:29,236 --> 00:31:31,875
a daughter-in-law shouldn't

688
00:31:32,035 --> 00:31:34,276
talk like that to her mother-in-law.

689
00:31:34,276 --> 00:31:35,676
The worst case

690
00:31:36,156 --> 00:31:37,795
happened when my client's son

691
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:40,035
was boarding in junior high school.

692
00:31:40,595 --> 00:31:41,996
The defendant said he wanted

693
00:31:41,996 --> 00:31:43,835
to train the child to be independent

694
00:31:43,956 --> 00:31:45,795
by reducing his living expenses

695
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:48,795
so that he wouldn't
waste money on snacks.

696
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:52,795
My client saw that the child
was getting thinner day by day.

697
00:31:53,115 --> 00:31:54,436
She felt sorry for him,

698
00:31:54,555 --> 00:31:56,916
and brought him food and money

699
00:31:57,156 --> 00:31:58,595
in secret.

700
00:31:59,156 --> 00:32:00,996
The defendant found out about it

701
00:32:01,196 --> 00:32:04,075
(Plaintiff)
and accused her of spoiling the child

702
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:06,075
(Defendant)
which might ruin him.

703
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:07,956
My client retorted,

704
00:32:08,476 --> 00:32:10,676
saying the child was growing

705
00:32:10,835 --> 00:32:12,996
and shouldn't be left to starve.

706
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:15,236
She said no parents
would do such a thing.

707
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,236
The defendant kicked my client

708
00:32:17,516 --> 00:32:19,115
in a fit of rage.

709
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:25,355
Your Honor,

710
00:32:25,355 --> 00:32:26,156
(Defendant, Lawyer)

711
00:32:26,156 --> 00:32:28,156
in the 36-year marriage

712
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,395
between my client and the defendant,

713
00:32:32,716 --> 00:32:33,916
my client tried her best

714
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:36,676
to keep the family harmonious

715
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:38,075
and protect the child.

716
00:32:38,075 --> 00:32:39,236
She put up with it,

717
00:32:39,476 --> 00:32:40,916
hoping that the defendant

718
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:42,236
would come

719
00:32:42,236 --> 00:32:44,315
to his senses one day.

720
00:32:44,555 --> 00:32:45,835
However,

721
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:48,115
the defendant, now a grandfather,

722
00:32:48,476 --> 00:32:50,676
grew even more aggressive.

723
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:53,956
He abused my client in front of his son

724
00:32:54,156 --> 00:32:56,355
and his son's ex-wife.

725
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,115
This is unbearable.

726
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:16,956
Want a drink? It's on me.

727
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,835
Forget it. You might poison me.

728
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:20,156
What do you want?

729
00:33:21,355 --> 00:33:23,756
I'm working at Black Rock Gallery.

730
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:25,276
We are organizing

731
00:33:25,276 --> 00:33:27,795
a private European art exhibition.

732
00:33:27,835 --> 00:33:28,756
But

733
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,756
the main artist Marni's paintings

734
00:33:30,756 --> 00:33:31,835
haven't arrived yet.

735
00:33:31,996 --> 00:33:33,835
Our boss is losing it.

736
00:33:34,476 --> 00:33:36,795
You know those shipping agents well.

737
00:33:37,196 --> 00:33:38,196
Urge them to ship over

738
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:39,355
the paintings.

739
00:33:40,956 --> 00:33:42,236
You should prepare

740
00:33:42,276 --> 00:33:44,196
the artwork in advance, shouldn't you?

741
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:45,115
Yeah, I should.

742
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,236
But I messed it up
because I was incompetent.

743
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:48,315
So I'm seeking your help.

744
00:33:48,956 --> 00:33:51,156
First of all, why should I help you?

745
00:33:51,355 --> 00:33:53,476
You went somewhere else and I resigned.

746
00:33:53,676 --> 00:33:55,795
We're not even colleagues.

747
00:33:56,115 --> 00:33:58,355
Secondly, you're asking me for help

748
00:33:58,355 --> 00:33:59,635
but you act like my boss.

749
00:34:02,516 --> 00:34:03,476
Gu Moli.

750
00:34:04,236 --> 00:34:05,835
Don't you see

751
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,276
what's going on?

752
00:34:08,116 --> 00:34:10,315
Others are avoiding you.

753
00:34:10,955 --> 00:34:12,196
I'm giving you a job.

754
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:13,835
You'd better curry favor with me.

755
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:15,395
Why should I?

756
00:34:15,395 --> 00:34:16,795
Stay away from me.

757
00:34:18,116 --> 00:34:20,435
You really have no conscience.

758
00:34:21,236 --> 00:34:22,676
Zhu Jincao begged me for help.

759
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:23,756
Otherwise, I won't bother.

760
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:26,355
What did you say?

761
00:34:26,756 --> 00:34:28,196
Jincao begged you for help?

762
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:31,835
Let me be honest.

763
00:34:32,156 --> 00:34:34,475
Zhu Jincao has come to us,

764
00:34:35,756 --> 00:34:36,915
asking us to

765
00:34:36,915 --> 00:34:38,435
keep you in mind when there are

766
00:34:38,435 --> 00:34:39,716
job opportunities.

767
00:34:40,676 --> 00:34:42,515
He is afraid that others will avoid you

768
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:43,915
after what has happened.

769
00:34:44,076 --> 00:34:45,596
Others pretend to agree

770
00:34:45,596 --> 00:34:47,156
without taking it seriously.

771
00:34:47,276 --> 00:34:49,236
I'm the only one who cares.

772
00:34:51,395 --> 00:34:52,435
I have no idea

773
00:34:52,435 --> 00:34:54,556
what Zhu Jincao loves about you.

774
00:34:54,716 --> 00:34:56,156
Why would such a good man

775
00:34:56,156 --> 00:34:57,596
keep following you around?

776
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:00,276
The court believes that

777
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,716
the marriage cannot be sustained

778
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:05,276
due to the defendant's misconduct.

779
00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:08,515
The plaintiff's claims
are reasonable and justifiable.

780
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,435
To conserve judicial resources,

781
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:12,955
I suggest the defendant

782
00:35:12,955 --> 00:35:14,116
accept the mediation

783
00:35:14,236 --> 00:35:15,716
and the plaintiff's demands.

784
00:35:15,995 --> 00:35:17,315
Do you understand?

785
00:35:18,036 --> 00:35:19,515
I disagree with the divorce.

786
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:23,875
Marriage is not child's play.

787
00:35:24,676 --> 00:35:26,156
Every family has conflicts.

788
00:35:26,795 --> 00:35:28,196
Isn't it normal

789
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:29,276
to have disputes?

790
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:32,355
Don't get a divorce
over a trivial matter.

791
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,276
Or the society would be in chaos.

792
00:35:38,395 --> 00:35:39,915
Zhang Shanya wants trouble.

793
00:35:39,915 --> 00:35:41,116
I won't indulge her.

794
00:35:43,156 --> 00:35:44,036
That's right.

795
00:35:44,795 --> 00:35:46,795
I have hit her in the past.

796
00:35:47,156 --> 00:35:49,756
Feel free to arrest me and sentence me.

797
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:50,636
I'll accept that.

798
00:35:51,676 --> 00:35:53,315
But I'm not getting a divorce.

799
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:54,835
Defendant,

800
00:35:54,835 --> 00:35:57,236
the plaintiff is now suing for divorce.

801
00:35:57,236 --> 00:35:58,315
If this court believes

802
00:35:58,315 --> 00:35:59,955
such a request is reasonable,

803
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,395
we can reach a verdict

804
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:03,116
(Judge)
even if you disagree.

805
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:04,556
Do you understand?

806
00:36:10,556 --> 00:36:12,276
If you mandate the divorce, so be it.

807
00:36:12,915 --> 00:36:14,915
But keep your hands off
my family's property.

808
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:17,795
You're tearing apart

809
00:36:18,236 --> 00:36:19,435
my family.

810
00:36:20,435 --> 00:36:22,716
You're destroying my family.

811
00:36:23,835 --> 00:36:25,156
In that case,

812
00:36:26,196 --> 00:36:28,315
leave if you want.

813
00:36:28,835 --> 00:36:31,156
But keep your hands off
my family's property.

814
00:36:32,915 --> 00:36:35,636
You can leave the house.

815
00:36:35,636 --> 00:36:37,716
But you can't take it with you.

816
00:36:38,036 --> 00:36:38,955
No way.

817
00:36:39,716 --> 00:36:40,435
Auntie.

818
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:42,556
Usually, the first hearing

819
00:36:42,556 --> 00:36:43,995
doesn't result in anything.

820
00:36:44,355 --> 00:36:45,835
But it is a good start

821
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:46,875
as long as

822
00:36:46,995 --> 00:36:48,556
we express our demands.

823
00:36:48,716 --> 00:36:49,116
I know.

824
00:36:49,116 --> 00:36:49,756
Mom.

825
00:36:54,648 --> 00:36:56,568
(Justice for the people)

826
00:37:02,007 --> 00:37:03,810
(Judicial fairness)

827
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:05,716
Son.

828
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,435
I've embarrassed you.

829
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:12,395
I'm sorry.

830
00:37:13,676 --> 00:37:14,276
Mom.

831
00:37:16,556 --> 00:37:17,756
All these years,

832
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:21,315
I've only cared about my small family

833
00:37:22,596 --> 00:37:24,596
and never looked after you.

834
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:29,596
I didn't know you had

835
00:37:30,955 --> 00:37:32,236
suffered so much.

836
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:40,835
Son, I only hope you could do well.

837
00:37:41,236 --> 00:37:43,395
As long as your family of three

838
00:37:43,915 --> 00:37:46,276
can live your life well,

839
00:37:46,756 --> 00:37:48,515
it's all worth it for me

840
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:50,315
to endure any hardship

841
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:52,076
or suffer any injustice.

842
00:38:19,995 --> 00:38:20,756
Apologize.

843
00:38:22,116 --> 00:38:23,315
Apologize to my mom.

844
00:38:23,716 --> 00:38:24,955
What if I don't?

845
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:28,596
Son, step aside.

846
00:38:28,596 --> 00:38:29,756
He's your father.

847
00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:33,076
Apologize.

848
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:36,716
Want to hit your old man?

849
00:38:38,795 --> 00:38:39,636
Go ahead.

850
00:38:41,515 --> 00:38:42,756
She's filed a lawsuit.

851
00:38:43,596 --> 00:38:44,756
One punch won't matter.

852
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:48,395
My mom has always

853
00:38:49,716 --> 00:38:51,076
been so obedient to you.

854
00:38:53,276 --> 00:38:54,915
If you have any conscience,

855
00:38:56,596 --> 00:38:57,515
divorce her.

856
00:38:59,196 --> 00:39:01,596
Consider it one good deed
done in your life.

857
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:10,156
Jincao.

858
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:11,276
This is the courthouse.

859
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:12,596
Control yourself.

860
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:14,676
Let's go.

861
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:16,435
Mom, let's go.

862
00:39:32,556 --> 00:39:34,435
You know this place better.

863
00:39:34,636 --> 00:39:35,515
Place the order.

864
00:39:35,835 --> 00:39:37,076
I don't have the appetite.

865
00:39:37,515 --> 00:39:39,756
What do you want to say? Go ahead.

866
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:41,156
I'm in a hurry to get back.

867
00:39:42,196 --> 00:39:42,995
Jincao.

868
00:39:43,395 --> 00:39:44,395
Here's the thing.

869
00:39:45,395 --> 00:39:46,915
About a month ago,

870
00:39:47,475 --> 00:39:50,116
I took on your mother's divorce case.

871
00:39:50,196 --> 00:39:51,116
A month ago?

872
00:39:52,116 --> 00:39:53,556
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

873
00:39:53,676 --> 00:39:55,676
Because she specifically told me

874
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:57,196
not to inform you and Moli.

875
00:39:57,276 --> 00:39:59,716
She said that it was
between her and your father.

876
00:40:00,475 --> 00:40:01,756
She would explain it to you

877
00:40:01,995 --> 00:40:03,835
once she handled it properly.

878
00:40:04,156 --> 00:40:05,435
As a lawyer,

879
00:40:05,835 --> 00:40:08,036
I need to respect my client.

880
00:40:09,835 --> 00:40:11,036
Yet you still told me.

881
00:40:11,716 --> 00:40:13,636
After much contemplation,

882
00:40:14,196 --> 00:40:15,315
I felt that

883
00:40:15,556 --> 00:40:17,435
I had to tell you about it.

884
00:40:17,556 --> 00:40:18,556
Of course.

885
00:40:19,036 --> 00:40:20,156
By doing this,

886
00:40:20,475 --> 00:40:21,276
I've already

887
00:40:21,276 --> 00:40:23,036
violated my professional ethics.

888
00:40:23,395 --> 00:40:24,475
But I think

889
00:40:24,475 --> 00:40:26,276
it's a serious matter for your family.

890
00:40:26,435 --> 00:40:29,475
If your father
refuses to settle out of court,

891
00:40:29,515 --> 00:40:30,835
things won't be so pleasant

892
00:40:30,835 --> 00:40:32,156
once the verdict is out.

893
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:34,716
Then you won't forgive me.

894
00:40:37,116 --> 00:40:38,156
You did well.

895
00:40:38,756 --> 00:40:39,636
Thank you.

896
00:40:39,676 --> 00:40:40,995
I didn't want to

897
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:42,955
take on the case at the beginning.

898
00:40:43,395 --> 00:40:45,556
But your mother came to me

899
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,596
and said that she only knew me

900
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:49,915
apart from you guys

901
00:40:50,236 --> 00:40:51,835
in Shanghai.

902
00:40:52,236 --> 00:40:54,636
She only had 2,800 yuan in cash on her

903
00:40:54,636 --> 00:40:56,116
to retain me as her lawyer.

904
00:40:57,076 --> 00:40:58,556
She needed my help.

905
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,156
I couldn't turn her down.

906
00:42:24,395 --> 00:42:25,756
Don't be in a daze.

907
00:42:27,036 --> 00:42:28,875
This is our farewell meal.

908
00:42:31,355 --> 00:42:33,276
I-I've already eaten.

909
00:42:33,955 --> 00:42:35,116
Where is your son?

910
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:38,355
He's meeting with Lawyer Jiang.

911
00:42:38,955 --> 00:42:41,596
Jincao told me to come home and pack up.

912
00:42:41,795 --> 00:42:43,716
I won't stay here tonight.

913
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,036
Don't rush.

914
00:42:45,995 --> 00:42:47,556
There are some things

915
00:42:47,556 --> 00:42:49,995
I couldn't tell you in court.

916
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:51,795
It was also because

917
00:42:51,795 --> 00:42:53,435
your son was there.

918
00:42:54,596 --> 00:42:55,596
Now,

919
00:42:56,795 --> 00:42:58,756
it's just the two of us.

920
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:02,355
I need to make things clear.
