=Episode 9=

19
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:03,644
Why did you pick

20
00:02:03,644 --> 00:02:05,284
this faraway place as the warehouse?

21
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:06,644
Mr. Yan,

22
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:09,563
your paintings are renowned
for the water town series.

23
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:12,403
Many people
in the art scene admire them.

24
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:14,324
The perspective is unique.

25
00:02:14,523 --> 00:02:18,164
Especially, those rain scenes
that appear rippling and misty

26
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:20,003
have touched many people.

27
00:02:20,044 --> 00:02:21,283
So I was thinking,

28
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:22,644
we must find a place

29
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:23,604
that spiritually resonates

30
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:25,724
to store those important works.

31
00:02:25,724 --> 00:02:27,044
Only that would be fitting.

32
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:29,444
It's useless. The humidity is too high.

33
00:02:29,563 --> 00:02:30,884
Not suitable for storing the paintings.

34
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:33,123
I think it's quite good.

35
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:34,083
You don't know,

36
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,683
Moli specially transformed a room

37
00:02:35,683 --> 00:02:37,724
into a constant temperature
and humidity space specifically

38
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,364
to store your precious paintings.

39
00:02:39,364 --> 00:02:41,444
Not a single one will be damaged.
Don't worry.

40
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:44,764
This is a three-story building.

41
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,003
I've made a warehouse
on the second floor.

42
00:02:48,523 --> 00:02:49,604
Really nice.

43
00:02:50,123 --> 00:02:51,123
Oh, right, Moli.

44
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:53,683
I remember there is
a vegetable patch at the back, right?

45
00:02:53,683 --> 00:02:54,924
When I came in just now,

46
00:02:54,963 --> 00:02:57,164
I could smell the scent
of tomatoes and cucumbers.

47
00:02:57,164 --> 00:02:58,243
Let's go pick some

48
00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:00,484
for a green and healthy dinner

49
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:01,523
tonight, okay?

50
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:02,044
Let's go.

51
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:02,484
Yeah.

52
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:02,963
Let's go.

53
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:06,243
Moli, I have something to tell you.

54
00:03:07,963 --> 00:03:08,604
Ms. Li,

55
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:09,924
you go ahead. I'll come in a while.

56
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:11,123
Okay, I'll wait for you.

57
00:03:22,963 --> 00:03:23,884
Say it.

58
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:26,724
Say what?

59
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:28,884
Why did you bring me here?

60
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:30,683
What do you want to do?

61
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:33,724
Li Rui is very innocent.

62
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:36,523
You don't need
to sell your ideas to her.

63
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:40,044
And I hired you to manage my paintings,

64
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:42,324
not to interfere with my private life.

65
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:45,924
But this is what Ms. Li wants.

66
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:46,843
What do you mean?

67
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:48,324
She doesn't want to go abroad.

68
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:50,044
She also feels very distressed,

69
00:03:50,324 --> 00:03:52,283
but she doesn't know how to tell you.

70
00:03:54,803 --> 00:03:56,243
She doesn't want to go abroad?

71
00:03:58,843 --> 00:04:01,604
Her illness is actually stable
now after treatment.

72
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:03,283
It's considered the recovery stage now.

73
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:05,644
Going abroad
is merely for convalescence.

74
00:04:05,803 --> 00:04:07,724
She can do the same at home, too.

75
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:09,083
Speaking of recovery,

76
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,884
the patient's mood
is also very important.

77
00:04:11,604 --> 00:04:12,484
I know

78
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:14,604
you are worried about Ms. Li's health

79
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:16,524
and want to take her abroad
for a peaceful retreat.

80
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:18,323
But have you asked her?

81
00:04:18,604 --> 00:04:20,924
Is this what she
truly wants in her heart?

82
00:04:20,964 --> 00:04:22,563
Ms. Li has told me

83
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:25,964
you and your artworks

84
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:29,164
are the most important in her life.

85
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:33,404
She's worried
that leaving the motherland

86
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:36,484
and the ancient water towns of Jiangnan
filled with poetic charm

87
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:38,123
will make you lose your inspiration

88
00:04:38,524 --> 00:04:40,203
and desire to create.

89
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:42,883
And your techniques will become rusty.

90
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:44,524
But if you are here,

91
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:47,003
she can watch you paint every day,

92
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:48,443
undisturbed by others,

93
00:04:48,524 --> 00:04:51,323
and breathe fresh air and smell
the fragrance of vegetables and fruits.

94
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:53,284
Her mood would be very pleasant.

95
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:55,803
And it would quicken her recovery.

96
00:04:55,924 --> 00:04:58,443
I searched hard to find this place.

97
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:00,643
Although it's far,

98
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:02,003
it's very comfortable.

99
00:05:02,284 --> 00:05:04,003
And the transportation
is quite convenient.

100
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,323
But all this is new.

101
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:13,243
I haven't seen the ancient
and poetic Jiangnan you mentioned.

102
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:15,243
This is the new Jiangnan.

103
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:17,844
Don't you want to use your brush

104
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:19,643
to depict it?

105
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:23,123
Go pick vegetables.

106
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:34,883
This place is quite private.

107
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:36,924
Didn't I tell you to come early?
What took you so long?

108
00:05:36,924 --> 00:05:37,883
I took the subway, then the bus.

109
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:39,243
I got here but couldn't find the door.

110
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:40,643
This place is too hard to find.

111
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:42,044
So you think you have a point, right?

112
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:44,763
Get a stool.

113
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:45,844
Waiter, a stool for me.

114
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:46,724
He's just like this.

115
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:48,524
Bring a set of cutlery.

116
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,724
Move over a bit.

117
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:55,203
I need some water.

118
00:06:00,164 --> 00:06:00,924
I'm really thirsty.

119
00:06:00,924 --> 00:06:02,563
I have it.

120
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:08,003
Put it in the middle.

121
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:11,284
More wine.

122
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:13,443
Okay. That's enough.

123
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:16,643
Isn't this private room a bit cramped?

124
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,883
How about we change to another one?

125
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:20,044
It's not cramped.

126
00:06:20,123 --> 00:06:21,563
Isn't it quite cozy here?

127
00:06:23,044 --> 00:06:24,364
Today, I invited you here

128
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:27,643
to apologize with Qianniu.

129
00:06:27,683 --> 00:06:28,643
And

130
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:30,803
let me treat you to this meal today.

131
00:06:30,883 --> 00:06:31,803
No.

132
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:34,084
I said my treat.

133
00:06:34,123 --> 00:06:35,964
Miss Shen, please don't insist.

134
00:06:35,964 --> 00:06:37,724
It would be too much of a favor I owe.

135
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:39,284
Let him do it.

136
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:40,563
He's rich.

137
00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:41,563
Besides,

138
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:43,404
you are dining with two gentlemen.

139
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,203
How can we let a lady pay the bill?

140
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:49,123
That sounds quite reasonable.

141
00:06:49,484 --> 00:06:50,364
You caused the trouble.

142
00:06:50,364 --> 00:06:51,203
And you are a man too.

143
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,243
You pay the bill later.

144
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:54,164
You're here. Should I still do it?

145
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:55,964
Lingxiao, can we get a tomahawk steak?

146
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:57,404
It's been so long
since I had a tomahawk.

147
00:06:57,803 --> 00:06:59,443
I really want to give you a whack.

148
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:05,044
Cheers, Mr. Wang.

149
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:06,563
Cheers.

150
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:08,084
I'm late.

151
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:16,364
This wine is good.

152
00:07:16,364 --> 00:07:17,364
Mr. Wang,

153
00:07:17,643 --> 00:07:19,803
in fact, I've read
many of your articles.

154
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:21,763
When talking with you,

155
00:07:21,763 --> 00:07:23,123
I feel quite comfortable.

156
00:07:23,164 --> 00:07:26,164
Not at all as aloof
as your articles suggest.

157
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:28,164
Being aloof is too much effort.

158
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:30,243
I'm particularly lazy.

159
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,323
I value economy and practicality.

160
00:07:32,443 --> 00:07:34,243
Those meaningless people and things.

161
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:35,964
I'm too lazy to invest
time and energy in them.

162
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:38,724
May I ask an overstepping question?

163
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,683
Go ahead. Lingxiao is very easy-going.

164
00:07:41,404 --> 00:07:43,323
Do you really have
no plans to date or marry?

165
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:46,724
Tastes good, right?

166
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:48,364
Yes.

167
00:07:48,524 --> 00:07:50,123
It even tastes sweet.

168
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:53,003
Honey,

169
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:54,964
I think the environment here is so nice.

170
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:56,643
Why don't we stay for a few more days?

171
00:07:56,683 --> 00:07:57,563
What do you think?

172
00:07:59,323 --> 00:08:01,763
I'm going to eat vegetables
like this in the future.

173
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:03,284
Just rinse it with water.

174
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:04,484
Then dip it in some sauce.

175
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,164
I find it especially good.

176
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:08,280
Since you like it so much,

177
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,763
let's not go abroad

178
00:08:09,763 --> 00:08:10,924
and settle down here.

179
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:13,164
Really?

180
00:08:16,123 --> 00:08:18,683
You'll farm, and I'll paint.

181
00:08:20,844 --> 00:08:22,683
Honey, you are too good.

182
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:25,284
Happy?

183
00:08:25,643 --> 00:08:26,604
Yes.

184
00:08:35,084 --> 00:08:35,883
Gu Moli.

185
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,976
Since we are not leaving,

186
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:41,084
I now formally invite you
to be my agent.

187
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:42,163
Would you like that?

188
00:08:46,964 --> 00:08:48,283
That's great.

189
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,923
I will certainly provide good service.

190
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:09,523
Ladies and gentlemen, today marks

191
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:11,603
an important moment
for the Flying Bird Gallery.

192
00:09:11,722 --> 00:09:13,883
We have successfully signed Mr. Yan Li.

193
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:15,243
It is my honor.

194
00:09:15,243 --> 00:09:16,922
It is also an honor
for the Flying Bird Gallery.

195
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:18,682
Mr. Yan Li, please.

196
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:31,802
Mr. Yan Li,

197
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:33,802
May I ask about your expectations

198
00:09:33,802 --> 00:09:35,243
for collaboration with Ms. Gu Moli

199
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:36,523
and the Flying Bird Gallery?

200
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:39,763
Ms. Gu Moli

201
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:41,962
is the best agent I've ever met.

202
00:09:42,243 --> 00:09:43,842
Mr. Yan, you flatter me.

203
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:46,243
She is well deserved.

204
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,883
Time for a photo. Get closer.

205
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:10,842
Moli,

206
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:13,603
when will you bring Ke back to me?

207
00:10:13,603 --> 00:10:15,322
I'm in a bad mood.

208
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:17,283
I need a cute child to cheer me up.

209
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,123
Yulan.

210
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:20,123
I have to tell you again.

211
00:10:20,283 --> 00:10:22,603
Your daughter is so busy at work.

212
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:24,483
Can you please not disturb her?

213
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:27,763
Gu Demao, what's wrong?

214
00:10:27,763 --> 00:10:29,322
I'm in a bad mood.

215
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:30,922
Don't provoke me.

216
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:43,288
(Moli)

217
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:47,962
Mom,

218
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:50,883
I've nailed a collaboration
with the grumpiest painter Yan Li.

219
00:10:51,322 --> 00:10:52,603
Am I impressive or what?

220
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:54,082
Can it cheer you up?

221
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,523
This is indeed some good news.

222
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,202
Yan Li.

223
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,603
Not bad.

224
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:21,592
(Perfect match)

225
00:11:26,962 --> 00:11:29,403
Gu, where are the peaches?

226
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:31,042
On the table in the back.

227
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:34,842
Let me pick a big one for you. This.

228
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:07,883
You're even dressing up.

229
00:12:08,763 --> 00:12:10,523
Going to a rendezvous with your ex-wife?

230
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:12,202
Yes.

231
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:17,202
Silly. Take a look.

232
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:22,883
(Wu Yulan, perfect match)
I know him.

233
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,643
This is the painter Moli just signed.

234
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:28,003
This must be their signing ceremony.

235
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:29,802
This is quite normal. What's the fuss?

236
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:31,082
Normal, is it?

237
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:33,562
Do the words above look normal to you?

238
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:36,082
Your ex-mother-in-law is so annoying.

239
00:12:36,082 --> 00:12:37,523
Perfect match.

240
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,842
And she even tagged me.

241
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:41,802
First time I've realized
you can tag people on Moments.

242
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:44,643
She is just showing off.

243
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:49,682
Jincao, that's not right.

244
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,283
Look.

245
00:12:52,643 --> 00:12:54,283
I've always felt

246
00:12:54,283 --> 00:12:57,123
she wouldn't divorce you
just over a lousy bag.

247
00:12:57,802 --> 00:12:59,842
Look, after all this,

248
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:01,202
I really get it now.

249
00:13:01,763 --> 00:13:02,962
She just found an excuse

250
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:04,202
to divorce you first.

251
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:05,243
Then she bought an apartment.

252
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,082
After that,

253
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:09,243
now she's hooked up
with a famous painter.

254
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,842
What a long game
the Gu family has played.

255
00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:15,042
Jincao,

256
00:13:15,202 --> 00:13:17,523
you haven't really been played
by them, have you?

257
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:19,562
Look how tightly they were hugging.

258
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:21,363
They might have been
together for a while.

259
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:22,682
Mom, don't talk nonsense.

260
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:24,163
I know Moli.

261
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:25,763
She wouldn't do such a thing.

262
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:27,763
You...

263
00:13:28,283 --> 00:13:28,922
Well,

264
00:13:28,962 --> 00:13:30,802
that's why I say you're such a wimp

265
00:13:30,802 --> 00:13:32,042
and helpless.

266
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:34,483
Be smart, Jincao.

267
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:10,003
How dare he be late today?

268
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:15,243
(I've arrived. Why is no one here?)

269
00:14:32,802 --> 00:14:33,883
Mr. Zhu.

270
00:14:35,883 --> 00:14:36,763
Mr. Zhu.

271
00:14:57,883 --> 00:14:58,763
Mr. Zhu.

272
00:15:19,922 --> 00:15:22,283
(You haven't really been played
by them, have you?)

273
00:15:22,283 --> 00:15:24,163
(Look how tightly they were hugging.)

274
00:15:24,163 --> 00:15:26,243
(They might have been
together for a while.)

275
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:58,363
(Appear before me)

276
00:15:58,363 --> 00:16:00,024
(within five minutes.)

277
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:02,163
(Otherwise, I will return.)

278
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:12,536
(I'll spend the rest
of my life with you.)

279
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,788
(Young Woman Lures Married Painter)

280
00:17:04,202 --> 00:17:05,043
Sorry.

281
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:06,843
May I ask if we can
serve the dishes now?

282
00:17:07,522 --> 00:17:08,682
Wait a bit longer, please.

283
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:10,002
Someone hasn't arrived yet.

284
00:17:10,002 --> 00:17:11,163
Still waiting?

285
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:13,522
You've only booked
for three hours in total.

286
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:15,202
And the band you ordered.

287
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:16,682
They can't wait any longer.

288
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:18,323
They have to rush
to their next performance.

289
00:17:18,482 --> 00:17:19,482
I'll pay more.

290
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:21,163
What did you say?

291
00:17:21,762 --> 00:17:23,643
I'll pay more, okay?

292
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,163
How many more hours?

293
00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:26,843
Go ask Zhu Jincao.

294
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:45,688
(Young Woman Lures Married Painter)

295
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:06,883
You've gone missing
and not answering calls

296
00:18:06,883 --> 00:18:09,123
just because of this boring article?

297
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:12,962
Do you think this article
is about me and Yan Li?

298
00:18:13,922 --> 00:18:15,123
You have nothing else to do?

299
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:17,043
Tell me why this article exists.

300
00:18:17,323 --> 00:18:18,722
How would I know?

301
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:21,202
You have to give me
a reasonable explanation.

302
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:24,563
Are you planning
to argue with me over the phone?

303
00:18:24,962 --> 00:18:26,282
Can you act like a man?

304
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:27,803
Let's say it face to face.

305
00:18:28,722 --> 00:18:30,323
Fine, I'm coming over now

306
00:18:30,323 --> 00:18:31,442
to listen to your explanation.

307
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:40,563
I signed Yan Li.

308
00:18:40,722 --> 00:18:42,522
It must have affected others' interests,

309
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:43,922
so they had someone write the article

310
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:46,163
and slander me using official accounts.

311
00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:48,843
I'll go to our legal department
to complain tomorrow.

312
00:18:49,242 --> 00:18:51,323
If that doesn't work,
I'll take legal action.

313
00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:53,123
It's just so simple.

314
00:18:54,803 --> 00:18:55,762
What about this?

315
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:04,952
(Wu Yulan, perfect match)

316
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:10,403
Your mom spilled the beans.

317
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:12,883
Think about it. If you were me

318
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:15,163
and you saw these things
one after another,

319
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:16,563
what would you think?

320
00:19:39,202 --> 00:19:41,043
Baby, what's wrong?

321
00:19:41,282 --> 00:19:42,803
Mrs. Wu Yulan,

322
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:43,883
I want to ask you.

323
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,123
What exactly does
your weird Moments post mean?

324
00:19:46,282 --> 00:19:47,922
It'd be fine
if you just posted a picture.

325
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:49,522
What does "perfect match" mean?

326
00:19:50,202 --> 00:19:53,163
A great painter
collaborates with the best agent.

327
00:19:53,163 --> 00:19:55,002
Is that a perfect match?

328
00:19:55,643 --> 00:19:58,323
What's wrong with me
showing it off on Moments?

329
00:19:58,522 --> 00:20:01,563
Zhang Shanya said my daughter
had no prospects of remarriage.

330
00:20:01,563 --> 00:20:02,922
I just wanted to show her

331
00:20:02,922 --> 00:20:05,843
how much more popular
my daughter was compared to her son.

332
00:20:05,962 --> 00:20:07,083
You heard that, right?

333
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,242
It's a rivalry between the two
of them. I'm innocent.

334
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:10,323
Moli,

335
00:20:10,323 --> 00:20:11,522
I can imagine

336
00:20:11,522 --> 00:20:14,522
what Zhang Shanya would look like
when seeing that photo.

337
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:17,043
Her round face
would turn into a long one.

338
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:20,403
I couldn't be happier.

339
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:22,043
You really overdo it.

340
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:23,160
(Mom)

341
00:20:26,202 --> 00:20:27,563
You heard it clearly?

342
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:29,123
This has nothing to do with me.

343
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:31,922
Even if that's the case,

344
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,442
tell me who's defaming you.

345
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:35,682
It must be Mi Na.

346
00:20:35,682 --> 00:20:38,002
She's had ulterior motives
to sign Yan Li.

347
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:40,043
Tomorrow, I'll go to
the legal department.

348
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:42,563
I won't rest until this matter
is thoroughly investigated.

349
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,762
I was being too petty.

350
00:20:48,762 --> 00:20:50,242
You're so jealous.

351
00:20:59,922 --> 00:21:01,282
Because I care about you.

352
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,002
Moli,

353
00:21:05,962 --> 00:21:08,123
just act like nothing
happened today, okay?

354
00:21:10,123 --> 00:21:11,722
Our seventh-anniversary dinner

355
00:21:13,163 --> 00:21:14,282
now officially begins.

356
00:21:48,922 --> 00:21:49,682
Start.

357
00:22:04,563 --> 00:22:05,403
Honey.

358
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,722
Don't be so intimate.

359
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:13,682
Happy seventh anniversary.

360
00:22:16,163 --> 00:22:17,363
Happy seventh anniversary.

361
00:22:26,163 --> 00:22:28,403
(The great painter mentioned
in the article must be Yan Li.)

362
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,043
(The woman must be his new agent.)

363
00:22:31,403 --> 00:22:33,163
(I've heard she's called Gu Moli.)

364
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:35,442
(How could a painter like Yan Li)

365
00:22:35,442 --> 00:22:36,803
(sign with an obscure gallery)

366
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:38,843
(like Flying Bird?)

367
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:42,002
(Turns out it's an affair.)

368
00:22:43,202 --> 00:22:45,522
(Such things often
happen to those people.)

369
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:48,522
(Ultimately,
it's because the man is not up to par.)

370
00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:51,123
(He can't even keep his woman in check.)

371
00:22:51,643 --> 00:22:53,482
(When one spouse has issues,)

372
00:22:53,883 --> 00:22:55,722
(how can you put)

373
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:57,442
(all the blame on the man?)

374
00:22:57,522 --> 00:22:58,722
(As far as I know,)

375
00:22:58,722 --> 00:23:00,563
(the husband has been good to his wife.)

376
00:23:01,442 --> 00:23:03,242
(Here comes the person
supporting the man.)

377
00:23:03,442 --> 00:23:05,843
(Seems like the husband
is riding the wave of popularity too.)

378
00:23:13,323 --> 00:23:16,123
(Concrete evidence.
It's more and more interesting.)

379
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:20,043
(What's going on
with that gym photo of you and Yan Li?)

380
00:23:21,123 --> 00:23:23,323
(Although the faces were pixelated,)

381
00:23:23,323 --> 00:23:25,202
(we can tell at a glance)

382
00:23:25,202 --> 00:23:26,323
(it was Gu Moli.)

383
00:23:27,603 --> 00:23:30,282
(The person posting the photo
definitely has malicious intent.)

384
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,843
(But you looked so close.)

385
00:23:35,242 --> 00:23:37,363
(Bro, they were too close.)

386
00:23:37,363 --> 00:23:40,163
(Has my sister-in-law
really lost interest in you?)

387
00:23:57,242 --> 00:23:57,843
Stop.

388
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:02,522
Stop.

389
00:24:05,883 --> 00:24:08,363
Sorry, could you
please step out for a moment?

390
00:24:23,883 --> 00:24:25,403
Are you done yet?

391
00:24:25,682 --> 00:24:27,722
I'd like to know
when it will be done too.

392
00:24:28,403 --> 00:24:31,242
The first time, you said
it was slander from a colleague.

393
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:33,922
Next time, you said our moms did it.

394
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:35,242
Now it's the third time.

395
00:24:35,883 --> 00:24:38,323
I don't know
if there will be a fourth or fifth time.

396
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:40,202
This time, it was at the gym.

397
00:24:40,682 --> 00:24:42,123
Where are you planning
to do it next time?

398
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:43,843
This time, he put his arm
around your waist.

399
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:45,482
Where is he going to put it next time?

400
00:24:46,323 --> 00:24:48,762
- Zhu Jincao.
- Gu Moli, do you take me for a fool?

401
00:24:53,603 --> 00:24:55,202
I never thought you were stupid,

402
00:24:55,682 --> 00:24:58,083
but now, I'm not so sure.

Hello,

00:26:45,043 --> 00:26:46,482
I'm a member of yours.

429
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:47,722
Here's the thing.

430
00:26:47,762 --> 00:26:49,482
I saw someone

431
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,922
I know on the website,

432
00:26:50,922 --> 00:26:53,043
but I'm not sure if he's divorced.

433
00:26:53,043 --> 00:26:54,002
Is there a problem?

434
00:26:54,043 --> 00:26:55,643
Have the information

435
00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:56,843
on it been confirmed?

436
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:58,083
Please rest assured.

437
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,762
All member's information
is strictly confirmed.

438
00:27:03,202 --> 00:27:05,803
Okay. Thank you.

439
00:27:05,803 --> 00:27:07,363
You're welcome.

440
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:18,803
Hungry? Let me get you something to eat.

441
00:27:18,962 --> 00:27:20,682
No, thanks. I have no appetite.

442
00:27:20,803 --> 00:27:22,643
Your seventh-anniversary celebration

443
00:27:22,722 --> 00:27:24,043
was a total mess.

444
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,682
I've called your mom

445
00:27:25,722 --> 00:27:26,762
to reassure her.

446
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:28,603
Stay at my place tonight.

447
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:29,242
Alright.

448
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:33,043
Isn't Zhu Jincao out of his mind?

449
00:27:33,043 --> 00:27:34,563
He even believes in gossip news?

450
00:27:35,002 --> 00:27:37,002
What can those two photos prove anyway?

451
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:39,363
They've even pixelated it.
Obviously it's been doctored.

452
00:27:39,363 --> 00:27:40,682
Just because of that trivial matter,

453
00:27:40,722 --> 00:27:42,123
he made you so upset.

454
00:27:42,123 --> 00:27:43,202
I'm going to call and scold him.

455
00:27:43,722 --> 00:27:45,522
No. Let it be.

456
00:27:45,522 --> 00:27:47,123
It's not entirely his fault.

457
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,163
If the one

458
00:27:48,163 --> 00:27:49,002
seeing that news

459
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:50,123
and those photos were me,

460
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:51,563
I would definitely have exploded.

461
00:27:53,043 --> 00:27:55,282
I've just realized
that after divorcing him,

462
00:27:55,403 --> 00:27:56,722
he's become more sensitive.

463
00:27:56,722 --> 00:27:57,883
You regret it now, don't you?

464
00:27:57,883 --> 00:27:59,363
I've told you before.

465
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:00,922
Was your divorce

466
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:03,043
too hasty?

467
00:28:03,043 --> 00:28:04,762
Who do you think is so unscrupulous?

468
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:06,083
Stabbing me in the back?

469
00:28:06,202 --> 00:28:08,403
Right, think about it.

470
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:10,323
I think it could only be Mi Na.

471
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:12,043
She's harmed you once before.

472
00:28:12,403 --> 00:28:14,123
Would she be
foolish enough to repeat it?

473
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:15,722
That's what I thought too.

474
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:18,922
But apart from her,
no one else has a grudge against me.

475
00:28:18,922 --> 00:28:20,403
I can't think of anyone else.

476
00:28:20,563 --> 00:28:21,682
But don't worry.

477
00:28:21,762 --> 00:28:23,202
I won't wrongly accuse the innocent.

478
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,563
I will find the evidence.

479
00:28:52,043 --> 00:28:52,922
What's the matter?

480
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:53,803
Mr. Zhu,

481
00:28:53,803 --> 00:28:55,643
I see you've been sitting in the car.

482
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:57,403
Has something happened?

483
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:58,442
Nothing's wrong.

484
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:00,482
Then why aren't you going home?

485
00:29:01,682 --> 00:29:03,962
I was a bit sleepy just now
and fell asleep in the car.

486
00:29:05,522 --> 00:29:06,762
What about Ke's mom?

487
00:29:07,922 --> 00:29:09,522
She has gone back.

488
00:29:12,242 --> 00:29:13,722
I made some wontons

489
00:29:13,722 --> 00:29:14,922
with pork and shepherd's purse filling.

490
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:16,803
They are still hot and quite fresh.

491
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,282
Would you like to try some?

492
00:29:18,682 --> 00:29:21,002
No, thanks. I've eaten already.

493
00:29:21,163 --> 00:29:22,202
Here's the thing,

494
00:29:22,403 --> 00:29:24,123
Guo's classmate, Xia,

495
00:29:24,123 --> 00:29:25,922
likes the wontons I make.

496
00:29:25,922 --> 00:29:27,403
I made some for her,

497
00:29:27,403 --> 00:29:29,043
but there was no one at her home.

498
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,563
If you don't eat it, it will be a waste.

499
00:29:32,682 --> 00:29:33,522
Take it.

500
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:39,323
Thank you.

501
00:29:42,522 --> 00:29:44,043
Eat it while it's hot.

502
00:29:44,962 --> 00:29:45,962
I'm leaving.

503
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:01,202
What do you want?

504
00:30:02,643 --> 00:30:05,123
Mr. Chen, my request is very small.

505
00:30:05,242 --> 00:30:06,962
Sue the Jungle of Art official account.

506
00:30:06,962 --> 00:30:08,202
They spread rumors and slander me.

507
00:30:08,202 --> 00:30:09,883
Make them delete the post and apologize.

508
00:30:10,603 --> 00:30:12,522
Did that article mention your name?

509
00:30:13,163 --> 00:30:14,482
Did it mention Yan Li's name?

510
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:17,002
It was insinuating.

511
00:30:17,123 --> 00:30:18,323
I've asked Lawyer Liu.

512
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:21,242
We can send them
a demand letter in legal ways,

513
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:22,403
but it's basically useless.

514
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,522
Lawsuits like this.

515
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:25,043
You never know
how long they will drag on.

516
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:26,563
And those small official accounts

517
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:28,323
post too much gossip.

518
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:30,722
In the end,
it's just a lose-lose situation.

519
00:30:31,043 --> 00:30:32,323
Wait, Mr. Chen.

520
00:30:33,202 --> 00:30:35,843
What do you mean
by a lose-lose situation?

521
00:30:36,282 --> 00:30:38,002
This matter must be made clear.

522
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,643
It's obvious
that they are spreading rumors.

523
00:30:39,722 --> 00:30:41,083
Are we just going to let it go?

524
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:42,363
Of course not.

525
00:30:45,922 --> 00:30:47,722
I've been thinking about it all night.

526
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:48,643
Was this matter

527
00:30:48,643 --> 00:30:51,202
intentionally designed
by you for publicity?

528
00:30:51,843 --> 00:30:52,522
Of course.

529
00:30:52,522 --> 00:30:53,762
I know

530
00:30:53,762 --> 00:30:55,522
you wouldn't do such a thing.

531
00:30:56,682 --> 00:30:58,442
But I think

532
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,722
we should thank them.

533
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:02,803
Thank them?

534
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:03,682
Think about it.

535
00:31:04,242 --> 00:31:06,202
With those two articles,

536
00:31:06,202 --> 00:31:08,202
we've gained much popularity.

537
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:09,242
We've signed Yan Li,

538
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,282
and it's known to all
without any pennies spent

539
00:31:11,282 --> 00:31:12,563
on promotion.

540
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:13,403
Isn't it worth it?

541
00:31:13,643 --> 00:31:14,522
Shouldn't we be grateful?

542
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:15,722
Let me tell you.

543
00:31:15,803 --> 00:31:17,242
This is just a passing phase.

544
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,482
It will be over before you know it.

545
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:19,682
And let me tell you, Moli,

546
00:31:19,762 --> 00:31:22,002
great minds
do not dwell on small matters.

547
00:31:22,403 --> 00:31:24,163
I am a professional agent.

548
00:31:24,522 --> 00:31:27,403
No need for these underhanded tricks
to attract attention.

549
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,682
If you don't want to get involved,

550
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:31,282
I'll investigate it to the end myself.

551
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:40,522
I'll check if she's our member.

552
00:31:40,843 --> 00:31:41,403
Okay.

553
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:42,962
No.

554
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:46,922
She never signed up for classes either.

555
00:31:48,163 --> 00:31:49,883
Lately, I've been at the reception desk.

556
00:31:49,883 --> 00:31:52,163
Anyway, I haven't seen her this week.

557
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,442
Okay, thank you.

558
00:31:57,043 --> 00:31:57,762
Sunny.

559
00:31:57,762 --> 00:32:00,442
Can your experience coupons
still be used?

560
00:32:00,482 --> 00:32:03,083
Yes, they can be used before the 10th.

561
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:09,083
Can you check who used this coupon?

562
00:32:10,202 --> 00:32:11,363
The 7th.

563
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:13,403
It's a woman.

564
00:32:13,403 --> 00:32:15,762
In her early thirties, quite tall.

565
00:32:15,762 --> 00:32:16,843
And quite pretty.

566
00:32:16,883 --> 00:32:18,363
She must be a friend of our member.

567
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:19,962
Take a look. Is it her?

568
00:32:19,962 --> 00:32:21,403
No.

569
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:25,123
Do you still need this coupon?

570
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:26,682
It's been used.
We don't need it anymore.

571
00:32:26,722 --> 00:32:27,762
Can I take it away?

572
00:32:27,762 --> 00:32:28,202
Alright.

573
00:32:28,202 --> 00:32:28,883
Thank you.

574
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:29,482
Take care.

575
00:32:29,482 --> 00:32:29,922
Alright.

576
00:32:32,883 --> 00:32:33,762
What's wrong?

577
00:32:33,922 --> 00:32:35,603
This coupon is mine.

578
00:32:35,643 --> 00:32:36,323
Look.

579
00:32:36,403 --> 00:32:38,442
I wrote down my client's address here.

580
00:32:38,522 --> 00:32:39,883
And I put these coupons

581
00:32:39,883 --> 00:32:41,442
in Jincao's car.

582
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:43,603
Why did she say a woman used it?

583
00:32:45,242 --> 00:32:46,482
Zhu Jincao

584
00:32:47,323 --> 00:32:48,442
has affairs?

585
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,242
What's the matter?

586
00:33:05,563 --> 00:33:06,522
Give me the car key.

587
00:33:06,522 --> 00:33:08,083
I need to use the car
for something urgent.

588
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:09,803
What about your car?

589
00:33:09,962 --> 00:33:10,722
It's broken.

590
00:33:10,843 --> 00:33:11,883
You can take a taxi.

591
00:33:12,163 --> 00:33:13,762
Why all the nonsense?

592
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:16,843
Wait, where are you going to go by car?

593
00:33:17,522 --> 00:33:19,363
Liu has arranged a dinner with me.

594
00:33:21,603 --> 00:33:22,482
Remember

595
00:33:22,482 --> 00:33:24,323
not to drive after drinking.

596
00:33:24,722 --> 00:33:25,883
I will.

597
00:33:25,883 --> 00:33:27,442
And you come pick me up then.

598
00:33:27,482 --> 00:33:29,202
I've given you my car.
How am I supposed to do it?

599
00:33:29,202 --> 00:33:30,442
Find a way yourself.

600
00:33:35,202 --> 00:33:37,363
(Excuse me, could you sit in the back?)

601
00:33:37,522 --> 00:33:38,803
(Okay.)

602
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:41,363
(What beautiful flowers!)

603
00:33:41,762 --> 00:33:42,762
(Give them back to me.)

604
00:33:43,043 --> 00:33:44,403
(Tomorrow is the anniversary)

605
00:33:44,403 --> 00:33:45,522
(of my marriage with my wife.)

606
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:46,682
(This is the gift.)

607
00:33:47,482 --> 00:33:48,603
(This got squashed.)

608
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:50,682
(I'm sorry.)

609
00:33:50,682 --> 00:33:52,403
(Guo sat on something.
Please take this.)

610
00:33:52,403 --> 00:33:54,643
(My wife got
a gym membership card there.)

611
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:56,363
(But she's been too busy to go.)

612
00:33:56,363 --> 00:33:58,083
(This trial voucher is going to waste.)

613
00:33:58,482 --> 00:34:00,363
(It's for Pilates.)

614
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:03,083
(This looks pretty good.)

615
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:05,843
(I've always wanted to practice yoga.)

616
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,762
(Take it if you like it.)

617
00:34:07,802 --> 00:34:09,083
(No, you don't have to.)

618
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,802
(That's not what I meant.)

619
00:34:10,802 --> 00:34:12,402
(Just take it.)

620
00:34:12,563 --> 00:34:13,963
(Try it out.)

621
00:34:13,963 --> 00:34:14,802
(Otherwise,)

622
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,402
(once it expires,
it will just be waste paper.)

623
00:34:16,443 --> 00:34:18,003
(This is so awkward.)

624
00:34:18,003 --> 00:34:19,802
(It's okay, take it.)

625
00:34:19,802 --> 00:34:20,722
Case solved.

626
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:23,242
Turns out that the photo
was taken by this woman.

627
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:26,202
Judging by their conversation,

628
00:34:26,842 --> 00:34:29,083
she often hitchhikes with Jincao.

629
00:34:29,563 --> 00:34:31,603
Don't be so suspicious.

630
00:34:31,882 --> 00:34:33,242
According to the recording,

631
00:34:33,242 --> 00:34:36,483
Zhu Jincao was polite and measured

632
00:34:36,483 --> 00:34:38,003
and maintained boundaries with her.

633
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:39,762
Is he really that good?

634
00:34:39,762 --> 00:34:41,282
You know better than I do.

635
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:45,322
Just a few days after the divorce,
he was targeted by someone.

636
00:34:45,322 --> 00:34:46,483
That's not all.

637
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:47,802
She's quite proactive,

638
00:34:47,802 --> 00:34:49,003
even taking pictures of me secretly

639
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,722
and writing articles to smear me.

640
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,003
Moli,

641
00:34:52,282 --> 00:34:54,242
family harmony matters.

642
00:34:54,362 --> 00:34:55,483
A little give-and-take

643
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:57,842
is necessary in a marriage.

644
00:34:57,842 --> 00:34:59,043
I can't do it.

645
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:00,842
Just keep being unreasonable.

646
00:35:10,202 --> 00:35:12,882
Mom, I'm so happy
that you came to pick me up today.

647
00:35:12,882 --> 00:35:14,282
I've missed you so much.

648
00:35:14,282 --> 00:35:15,242
Really?

649
00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:17,123
I missed you terribly too.

650
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:21,643
Why didn't I see Guo who often rides

651
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:23,322
in our car back home today?

652
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:33,163
Isn't he there?

653
00:35:37,722 --> 00:35:38,722
Put the helmet on.

654
00:35:39,123 --> 00:35:40,362
That's his mom?

655
00:35:40,802 --> 00:35:42,682
Yes, it's Ms. Gao.

656
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,563
Zhu Jincao, why did you
agree to the divorce?

657
00:35:58,083 --> 00:35:59,643
Because I love my wife very much.

658
00:36:00,722 --> 00:36:02,842
It might sound a bit weird to say this.

659
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:06,242
Since she wanted a divorce, we divorced.

660
00:36:07,402 --> 00:36:09,443
Have you considered
the risks after your divorce?

661
00:36:10,362 --> 00:36:13,083
There would be also risks
even if we didn't divorce.

662
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:15,722
I trust my wife.

663
00:36:16,762 --> 00:36:20,083
Gu Moli, what is
the essence of marriage?

664
00:36:21,802 --> 00:36:24,083
I can't clearly define it,

665
00:36:24,362 --> 00:36:25,523
but I do know

666
00:36:25,682 --> 00:36:27,362
it's definitely not
just a piece of paper,

667
00:36:27,802 --> 00:36:29,722
be it a marriage or divorce certificate.

668
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,682
I think only the one
that can withstand trials

669
00:36:33,722 --> 00:36:35,362
is the best kind of marriage.

670
00:36:35,762 --> 00:36:37,083
So you divorced him

671
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:40,322
to test your love with Zhu Jincao?

672
00:36:41,443 --> 00:36:42,882
I haven't thought about it that way.

673
00:36:43,762 --> 00:36:45,443
But since I chose to divorce him,

674
00:36:45,523 --> 00:36:48,043
I'm confident he won't betray me.

675
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:58,029
(The Failed Divorce Experiment)

676
00:37:16,523 --> 00:37:17,362
Wait a moment.

677
00:37:19,882 --> 00:37:21,322
You're Gao Xiajing, right?

678
00:37:23,762 --> 00:37:24,722
You are...?

679
00:37:24,722 --> 00:37:25,682
You don't know me?

680
00:37:25,682 --> 00:37:27,322
Don't you recognize our car?

681
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:29,603
Haven't you ridden in it several times?

682
00:37:30,163 --> 00:37:31,603
I am Gu Moli, Ke's mom

683
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:33,963
and Zhu Jincao's wife.

684
00:37:36,523 --> 00:37:37,483
I know.

685
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,923
I've heard Jincao mention you.

686
00:37:41,043 --> 00:37:42,643
But didn't he get a divorce?

687
00:37:42,842 --> 00:37:44,483
You're his ex-wife, aren't you?

688
00:37:52,282 --> 00:37:54,083
How do you know that we got divorced?

689
00:37:57,043 --> 00:37:59,563
Anyway, I just know.

690
00:37:59,802 --> 00:38:01,563
I know everything you've done.

691
00:38:01,923 --> 00:38:03,362
Don't try to sow discord.

692
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,523
I warn you, Gao Xiajing.

693
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:07,402
Sneaky photography is despicable.

694
00:38:07,603 --> 00:38:09,202
And slander is illegal.

695
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:12,202
You defamed me
on the Jungle of Art official account.

696
00:38:13,402 --> 00:38:14,842
You did that, didn't you?

697
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:16,163
What sneaky photography?

698
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:18,163
What slander?

699
00:38:18,802 --> 00:38:19,762
Gu Moli,

700
00:38:20,523 --> 00:38:21,882
did you start having

701
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,402
psychological problems
after the divorce?

702
00:38:23,882 --> 00:38:25,762
I suggest you should see a psychologist.

703
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:26,923
Still pretending?

704
00:38:26,963 --> 00:38:29,282
Jincao gave you a fitness coupon.

705
00:38:29,322 --> 00:38:31,043
After you used the coupon,

706
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:33,563
photos of me
being secretly taken appeared online.

707
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:36,603
You're not going to tell me
this is a coincidence, are you?

708
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:38,563
It's just a coincidence.

709
00:38:39,362 --> 00:38:41,603
Ke and Guo just happen to be classmates.

710
00:38:41,842 --> 00:38:44,123
I just happened to know your ex-husband

711
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,443
and have a chat with him that day.

712
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:48,282
And we hit it off quite well.

713
00:38:48,282 --> 00:38:50,242
I just happened to want to go to a gym.

714
00:38:50,242 --> 00:38:51,282
And you

715
00:38:51,322 --> 00:38:53,003
just happened to be working out

716
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:54,882
at the gym with another man.

717
00:38:55,242 --> 00:38:56,722
I just so happened to take a picture.

718
00:38:56,722 --> 00:38:58,003
It's just that coincidental.

719
00:38:59,123 --> 00:39:01,682
But one thing is not a coincidence.

720
00:39:02,762 --> 00:39:05,083
I do have a thing for Zhu Jincao.

721
00:39:06,123 --> 00:39:08,282
I am a divorced single woman.

722
00:39:08,603 --> 00:39:10,762
He is a divorced single man.

723
00:39:11,242 --> 00:39:12,483
I can pursue him.

724
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:15,163
It's legitimate.

725
00:39:15,163 --> 00:39:17,043
Gao Xiajing, I'm telling you.
Don't be too arrogant.

726
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:18,643
And I want to remind you

727
00:39:19,322 --> 00:39:21,043
you are already divorced.

728
00:39:21,802 --> 00:39:23,362
You are not his wife anymore.

729
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:24,242
So

730
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,882
you have no right to lecture me.

731
00:39:27,163 --> 00:39:28,443
I have the right.

732
00:39:32,322 --> 00:39:33,483
I'm warning you.

733
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,362
Stay away from Zhu Jincao.

734
00:39:37,163 --> 00:39:38,123
You are...?

735
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:41,003
I am Zhu Jincao's mother
and Ke's grandmother.

736
00:39:41,402 --> 00:39:42,563
Listen well.

737
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,802
Whether they are divorced or not,

738
00:39:45,123 --> 00:39:48,282
Gu Moli is my granddaughter's mother.

739
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:50,682
On this point, you will never
match up in your lifetime.

740
00:39:51,643 --> 00:39:53,003
I've lived for so long.

741
00:39:53,003 --> 00:39:55,762
A glance at you allows me to know
what kind of person you are.

742
00:39:56,362 --> 00:39:57,842
Nothing has happened,

743
00:39:57,842 --> 00:39:59,282
and you're already thinking of

744
00:39:59,282 --> 00:40:01,123
setting traps for the former spouse.

745
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:02,762
Not to mention you
have a child with you,

746
00:40:02,762 --> 00:40:04,643
even if you're still an unmarried woman,

747
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:06,643
I would never allow you
to marry into our family.

748
00:40:07,043 --> 00:40:08,722
Mrs. Zhu, I can explain.

749
00:40:08,722 --> 00:40:09,802
No need to explain.

750
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:11,802
I heard everything you said just now.

751
00:40:12,483 --> 00:40:13,682
If you meddle in

752
00:40:13,682 --> 00:40:14,722
my son's marriage,

753
00:40:14,722 --> 00:40:16,043
I will make sure you pay the price.

754
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:21,882
I take my leave.

755
00:40:24,043 --> 00:40:26,163
Don't let me see you in the yard again.

756
00:40:36,842 --> 00:40:37,722
Say something.

757
00:40:39,163 --> 00:40:40,802
Why are you silent now?

758
00:40:41,563 --> 00:40:43,443
Aren't you quite talkative at home?

759
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:44,722
All chatty and gossipy.

760
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,563
You clam up in front of Gao Xiajing.

761
00:40:49,443 --> 00:40:50,923
You know what?

762
00:40:51,563 --> 00:40:54,523
Gao Xiajing is truly a hundred times
better than you.

763
00:40:54,643 --> 00:40:56,163
She knows very well

764
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:58,443
it's not easy for her
to remarry with a son.

765
00:40:58,443 --> 00:40:59,443
Upon meeting a good one,

766
00:40:59,443 --> 00:41:01,083
she shamelessly clings to him.

767
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,603
If she fails, she'll move onto the next

768
00:41:02,603 --> 00:41:04,083
until she succeeds.

769
00:41:04,523 --> 00:41:05,682
Unlike you.

770
00:41:08,163 --> 00:41:09,362
What's wrong with me?

771
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:10,722
You...

772
00:41:14,523 --> 00:41:16,762
Do you know what Ke said
to me when she got back?

773
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:19,483
She said, "Grandma,
Mommy came to pick me up."

774
00:41:19,483 --> 00:41:20,963
"Mommy is not
on a business trip anymore."

775
00:41:20,963 --> 00:41:23,163
"Why doesn't Mommy live at home?"

776
00:41:23,163 --> 00:41:24,762
What should I tell the child?

777
00:41:25,682 --> 00:41:27,483
I've told Ke

778
00:41:27,483 --> 00:41:28,842
I've been quite busy lately,

779
00:41:28,842 --> 00:41:31,443
and my parents' place
is closer to my office,

780
00:41:31,443 --> 00:41:32,963
so I'm staying there now.

781
00:41:33,842 --> 00:41:34,563
You...

782
00:41:37,882 --> 00:41:39,483
Do you think the child is naive?

783
00:41:39,603 --> 00:41:42,083
My granddaughter is incredibly smart.

784
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,802
She can sense whether her parents
are getting along well or not.

785
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:49,523
A happy home

786
00:41:49,523 --> 00:41:52,003
has been torn apart by the two of you.

787
00:41:52,123 --> 00:41:53,722
You've already broken it,

788
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:55,443
but you still spend
most of your time together.

789
00:41:55,443 --> 00:41:56,202
Moli,

790
00:41:56,242 --> 00:41:58,523
you've really divorced Jincao.

791
00:41:58,563 --> 00:42:00,923
You have no right to meddle
in his affairs anymore.

792
00:42:01,163 --> 00:42:03,643
I didn't want to criticize you
in front of others just now.

793
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:04,762
You...

794
00:42:05,163 --> 00:42:07,402
Do the two of you
really want to break up?

795
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:08,563
Or do you want to reconcile?

796
00:42:08,563 --> 00:42:10,603
You've got to have an answer, don't you?

797
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:13,682
We got divorced

798
00:42:13,802 --> 00:42:16,083
to have a better life.

799
00:42:17,563 --> 00:42:18,282
Wait.

800
00:42:18,722 --> 00:42:22,362
You divorced for a better life?

801
00:42:22,923 --> 00:42:25,123
Why does this sound so awkward to me?

802
00:42:26,842 --> 00:42:28,802
You were confronting
the other woman just now.

803
00:42:28,802 --> 00:42:30,242
Aren't you going to face reality?

804
00:42:32,282 --> 00:42:33,402
Moli,

805
00:42:34,123 --> 00:42:36,123
there are no issues

806
00:42:36,123 --> 00:42:38,322
in your marriage in principle.

807
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:40,603
Why didn't you just enjoy your life?

808
00:42:40,603 --> 00:42:42,443
Did you have to make a fuss?

809
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:48,523
I have to warn you.

810
00:42:49,123 --> 00:42:51,682
You should listen to me.

811
00:42:53,202 --> 00:42:56,202
Please don't tell Jincao
about what happened just now.

812
00:42:57,043 --> 00:42:57,923
Why not?

813
00:42:58,882 --> 00:43:00,202
Gao Xiajing has even gotten in his car.

814
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,163
You're waiting for those two to hook up?

815
00:43:05,123 --> 00:43:06,242
Being scared is useless.

816
00:43:06,963 --> 00:43:08,443
What will be will be.

817
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,603
But I believe Jincao won't.

818
00:43:12,802 --> 00:43:14,282
Still being stubborn?

819
00:43:14,282 --> 00:43:15,842
Still?

820
00:43:17,722 --> 00:43:18,682
I just don't understand you.

821
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:19,483
You two

822
00:43:19,483 --> 00:43:22,563
do things before thinking about them.

823
00:43:22,842 --> 00:43:24,443
You completely
disregard the consequences.

824
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:28,963
Just think about it here.

825
00:43:29,043 --> 00:43:31,043
I won't talk to you anymore.
I'm going to buy groceries.
