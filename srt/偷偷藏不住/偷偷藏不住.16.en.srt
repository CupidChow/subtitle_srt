Do you like the gift?

4
00:02:40,465 --> 00:02:41,905
He has really thick skin.

5
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:45,985
He took such a picture
and even asked if I like it.

6
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:02,705
Why is this picture there?

8
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,385
It's not clear at all.

This gift is a defect.

I'll send you an HD version immediately.

14
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:55,585
You wish.

15
00:04:00,945 --> 00:04:02,105
I had wanted to use this

16
00:04:02,185 --> 00:04:04,025
to speed up the courting process.

17
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:06,065
I didn't expect you
to reject me right off the bat.

18
00:04:06,585 --> 00:04:08,105
I can only resort to this

19
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:09,865
to win a chance for myself.

20
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,865
You crafty old thing.

00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:32,225

to deal with a young fox like you.

27
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:43,505
I'm going to sleep now.

28
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:44,505

The pool table will be blocked

37
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:30,225
if you move it there.

38
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:31,305
Do you see that?

39
00:05:31,385 --> 00:05:32,265
Okay, boss.

40
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:42,745
Sang Yan, I might be dating soon.

SILLY DOG

43
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:48,425
Are you attending university

44
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:49,825
to study or to date?

45
00:05:52,665 --> 00:05:53,985
Isn't it common to date

46
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:55,665
during university?

47
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:00,025
SILLY DOG

48
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:00,945
Suit yourself.

49
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:02,985
Be careful. Don't get cheated.

50
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:08,305
Yes, place the stool over there.

51
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:09,385
That's right. Over there.

52
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:10,345
Yes.

53
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:18,745
He's a bit old.

54
00:06:36,225 --> 00:06:37,905
-Hello?
-Don't tell me he's older than me!

55
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:39,185
Lower your voice.

56
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,905
Where did you meet him?

57
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:44,065
He…

58
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:47,585
He's a postgraduate student here.

59
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:48,585
Listen.

60
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:50,425
You should study hard at your age.

61
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:51,705
Forget about dating.

62
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:53,745
He can't be even one day older than me.

63
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:56,465
I can't accept being addressed formally
by someone older.

64
00:06:56,545 --> 00:06:58,025
Even if he's one day older than you…

65
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:08,105
You should feel respected
to be addressed formally.

66
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:27,745
CHAPTER 16, FEELINGS

67
00:07:27,825 --> 00:07:29,865
WAITING FOR YOU TO DATE ME

68
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:53,545
Is that from your crush?

69
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,665
Have you decided

70
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:01,905
when you will accept him?

71
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:07,665
Do I need to think about that?

72
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:08,985
Of course.

73
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:10,345
Since he wants to pursue you,

74
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:12,625
you need to decide for how long.

75
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:15,025
How long should it be then?

76
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:18,425
That depends.

77
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:19,625
I accepted Chen Qiang

78
00:08:19,705 --> 00:08:21,265
not long after he started pursuing me.

79
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:23,505
But it's up to you.

80
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:26,905
The right time for you is the best time.

81
00:08:27,705 --> 00:08:30,185
I think right now is perfect.

82
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:34,505
You're something else.

83
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:39,945
But listen, Sangsang.

84
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:42,024
You have to protect yourself.

85
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,065
Do you understand?

86
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:45,225
Weiwei.

87
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,265
I'm actually a little worried.

88
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:49,705
Worried about what?

89
00:08:50,585 --> 00:08:52,545
I'm afraid that he's doing it on a whim.

90
00:08:53,385 --> 00:08:55,265
What if he loses interest after a while?

91
00:08:56,305 --> 00:08:58,745
I don't think that is very likely.

92
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:01,585
You two have known each other for years.

93
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:03,425
Since he has decided to pursue you,

94
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:05,385
that means he must be determined.

95
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:06,865
What do you think?

96
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:08,905
You have a point.

97
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,345
It's okay.

98
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:13,425
If you're worried about that,

99
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:14,505
you can test him.

100
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:16,585
I'm going to sleep now.

101
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:34,905
Don't give in yet.

102
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,385
-Here is your favorite.
-Thank you.

103
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,865
-Your Americano.
-Here it is.

104
00:09:52,945 --> 00:09:54,305
Thank you, Wangwang.

105
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,745
-Here is your latte.
-Thank you.

106
00:09:58,705 --> 00:09:59,745
Did you buy a new bracelet?

107
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:00,745
It's pretty.

108
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:02,505
What are you saying?

109
00:10:03,105 --> 00:10:04,185
It's a gift from her crush.

110
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:06,025
-A gift from her crush?
-Really?

111
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:08,225
Come on. Let me take a look.

112
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:13,065
It's pretty nice.

113
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,585
-What is this?
-Is it a mouse?

114
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:18,065
It's a fox.

115
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:21,505
-A fox? I couldn't tell.
-A mouse?

116
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:24,985
-A mouse?
-Sorry.

117
00:10:25,065 --> 00:10:26,465
He has good taste.

118
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:33,025
This one.

119
00:10:33,585 --> 00:10:34,825
Are you free tomorrow?

120
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:36,865
Did your crush text you?

121
00:10:40,865 --> 00:10:42,225
Wait.

122
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:44,025
What will you reply?

123
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:46,745
Let me reply for you.

124
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:50,225
Didn't we say that we would test him?

125
00:10:50,945 --> 00:10:52,505
It will be fine. Trust me.

126
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:56,905
"No."

127
00:10:56,985 --> 00:10:57,865
Send!

128
00:10:58,585 --> 00:10:59,505
Stop messing around.

129
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:01,665
What do you know?

130
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,745
Sangsang and I talked about this before.

131
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:04,745
Right, Sangsang?

132
00:11:04,825 --> 00:11:05,945
What did you two talk about?

133
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:15,945
No.

134
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:16,865
SANG ZHI

135
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:27,425
Did he reply?

136
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:30,585
"What about the day after tomorrow?"

137
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:33,985
I might not

138
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:37,585
be free either.

139
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:45,185
I might not be free either.

140
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:52,745
But what if he fails the test?

141
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:53,985
That's impossible.

142
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:55,065
He will pass the test.

143
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:56,305
He definitely will.

144
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:58,905
Listen, these relationship tests

145
00:11:58,985 --> 00:11:59,945
can go either way.

146
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:01,505
Sangsang, you had better think twice.

147
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:08,385
Let me ask you guys something.

148
00:12:09,905 --> 00:12:12,385
If you asked someone out

149
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,345
and she replied

150
00:12:15,105 --> 00:12:16,745
that she might not be free,

151
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:20,345
is she free or not?

152
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:22,025
"Might not be free" means

153
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:23,585
it depends on your performance.

154
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:27,665
Why don't I call him?

155
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:29,905
You don't get it.

156
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:32,345
This is the appeal of love.
Do you understand?

157
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:33,385
-Okay.
-What do you know?

158
00:12:33,465 --> 00:12:34,985
Just reply like that.

159
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:37,105
Just wait. Hold back a little longer.

160
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:40,025
Eat something first.

161
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,825
Don't meddle when you don't know anything.

162
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,465
Does that mean she's free?

163
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:52,025
Jiaxu, look into my eyes.

164
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,065
Who is it?

165
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:07,545
Who might not be free?

166
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:09,065
Eat your food.

167
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:10,145
Don't be nosy.

168
00:13:10,985 --> 00:13:12,585
Something is up.

169
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:20,705
Here it is! See?

170
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:22,305
I told you. I knew he would reply.

171
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,745
-What did he say?
-Let me see.

172
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:26,745
How about Thursday night?

173
00:13:27,465 --> 00:13:29,545
"How about Thursday night?"

174
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:36,745
Fine.

175
00:13:37,945 --> 00:13:40,065
Since he has tried three times, he passes.

176
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:42,545
Hurry up. Stop being pretentious.

177
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:45,705
I'm free.

178
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:46,865
SANG ZHI

179
00:13:54,985 --> 00:13:56,105
Do I look okay?

180
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:57,905
Yes, you look beautiful.

181
00:13:58,585 --> 00:14:01,025
There is a new noodle shop
right off campus.

182
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:02,065
I heard that it's good.

183
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:03,185
-Really?
-Let's go together.

184
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:05,025
-Sure.
-You guys can go.

185
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:06,105
Today, I…

186
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:08,345
Sure.

187
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:09,505
We'll try it out for you.

188
00:14:10,345 --> 00:14:11,905
What noodles do you guys want?

189
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,945
I heard from Yuting that their shrimp…

190
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:15,385
Sang Zhi.

191
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:17,105
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:20,025
What's the matter?

193
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:22,105
Why did you start with an apology?

194
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:24,225
It's like this.

195
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:26,345
We just found a bug in our system,

196
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:29,505
so we're all rushing to fix it.

197
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:31,105
I think

198
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:33,625
I won't be able to have dinner with you.

199
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:37,505
Okay. Will you be working very late?

200
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,625
Will you have dinner?
Should I get something for you?

201
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:42,225
Why is there another error, Jiaxu?

202
00:14:42,305 --> 00:14:43,505
Jiaxu, save us.

203
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:46,025
Lower your voice.

204
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:46,945
Hello?

205
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:49,305
You should get back to work.

206
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:51,145
It's fine. Don't worry about me.

207
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,265
Sorry about this.

208
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:55,465
Remember to eat dinner, okay?

209
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:56,905
Okay.

210
00:14:56,985 --> 00:14:57,905
Bye.

211
00:14:57,985 --> 00:14:59,225
Bye.

212
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:02,345
It's done.

213
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:06,185
I guess I'm having noodles today.

214
00:15:06,265 --> 00:15:07,225
Where is the shop?

215
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:09,985
-Just to the right of the entrance.
-You're so dressed up.

216
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:11,145
Are you going like this?

217
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:14,145
Can't I eat noodles like this?

218
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:16,745
I guess so.

219
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:17,905
-Come on.
-Let's go.

220
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:21,705
Let's go.

221
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:22,665
-Bye.
-See you.

222
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:23,985
-Bye.
-Bye.

223
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:25,065
She's so pretty.

224
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:28,185
-Hello, Jiaxu.
-What should we eat later?

225
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:29,465
-Sorry.
-Pork hock with rice?

226
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:32,425
Sure. Or the noodles we had last time.

227
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:34,105
You're apologizing again.

228
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:35,425
This time,

229
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:40,305
a colleague suddenly ran into some issues.

230
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:42,465
We have to change the requirements
and add functions.

231
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:45,425
There's no helping it.

232
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:46,425
Well,

233
00:15:47,505 --> 00:15:49,145
call me when you're free.

234
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:51,145
You're not upset, are you?

235
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:55,025
Once things settle down here,

236
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:56,505
I'll take you out for a nice meal.

237
00:15:57,385 --> 00:15:58,345
That's all for now.

238
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:00,505
Hurry up.

239
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,705
-Right?
-Right.

240
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:05,905
Didn't he say
that he was going to pursue me?

241
00:16:06,585 --> 00:16:08,585
Is he even trying?

242
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:14,625
I don't want it!

243
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:15,905
Wait for me!

244
00:16:15,985 --> 00:16:16,905
I'll stop.

245
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:17,825
Wait for me!

246
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:21,665
-What happened?
-Why are you back?

247
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:30,265
You…

248
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:32,305
What are you doing here?

249
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:34,305
I thought you were going on a date.

250
00:16:34,385 --> 00:16:35,705
-That's right.
-You scared me.

251
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:39,105
He canceled it.

252
00:16:39,185 --> 00:16:40,945
Didn't he say he wanted to pursue you?

253
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:42,585
How many times has he canceled?

254
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:45,025
It doesn't look like he's trying.

255
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,505
He's busy with work.

256
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:48,745
He didn't do it on purpose.

257
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:50,105
So what?

258
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:51,425
Can't he spare a few minutes?

259
00:16:51,505 --> 00:16:53,585
He should have time before and after work.

260
00:16:53,665 --> 00:16:55,625
He can see you if he wants to.

261
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:57,465
-Precisely.
-But he really is busy.

262
00:16:57,545 --> 00:17:00,305
He's so busy
that he doesn't have time to sleep.

263
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:01,745
It would already be our curfew

264
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:03,385
by the time he gets here after work.

265
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:05,665
Why are you still defending him, Sangsang?

266
00:17:05,745 --> 00:17:07,464
Don't you blame him?

267
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:11,704
It's fine.

268
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:18,184
I'm utterly speechless.

269
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:20,585
Don't tell me I have to teach him
how to pursue you.

270
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:23,145
Sangsang.

271
00:17:23,224 --> 00:17:24,424
Have you not had dinner yet?

272
00:17:24,505 --> 00:17:26,145
-Are you hungry?
-That's right.

273
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:27,665
Where are our leftovers?

274
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:35,465
-They're delicious leftovers.
-That's right.

275
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:37,105
-There is fruit too.
-They're delicious.

276
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:39,265
Here, take it.

277
00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:40,385
You haven't eaten, right?

278
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:42,905
Smell it. It's nice.

279
00:17:43,945 --> 00:17:45,225
Don't eat that yet.

280
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:46,145
Eat the hamburger.

281
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:47,425
I'll have some fruit first.

282
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:49,985
No, you can't have the fruit first.

283
00:17:50,065 --> 00:17:51,265
Why?

284
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:53,745
Well, the hamburger will spoil
by tomorrow.

285
00:17:56,505 --> 00:17:57,825
Eat this first. It's very filling.

286
00:17:58,585 --> 00:18:00,585
Eat this.

287
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:01,945
Take a sniff. It smells great.

288
00:18:02,985 --> 00:18:05,785
Currently, the character modeling

289
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:07,265
is basically completed.

290
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:08,185
Regarding this,

291
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:10,225
we actually optimized the fluidity

292
00:18:10,305 --> 00:18:12,145
of the characters' techniques.

293
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,745
Currently,

294
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:16,345
we have basically completed
all optimizations.

295
00:18:17,225 --> 00:18:19,305
There are no issues for now.

296
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:20,265
Yes.

297
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:22,665
I'm sure everyone has seen

298
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:23,985
how much Jia Yang has improved.

299
00:18:24,065 --> 00:18:24,905
You flatter me.

300
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:26,985
This has been tough on you guys.

301
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,505
Our optimization

302
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:31,705
has proved to be effective.

303
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:32,785
So

304
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:34,905
I want to congratulate you guys.

305
00:18:36,185 --> 00:18:37,065
No overtime today!

306
00:18:40,465 --> 00:18:42,545
-Go home and rest.
-At long last!

307
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:44,505
We can finally leave on time.

308
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:46,505
-Yes.
-Let's go.

309
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,665
NURSING HOME

310
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:52,905
Drawing it like this won't do.

311
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:54,345
What are you drawing?

312
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:57,425
Sangsang, why are you back again?

313
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:58,945
Did he cancel again?

314
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:01,105
I was stood up again.

315
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:04,305
-No way!
-Wait, what?

316
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:05,945
How many times has it been now?

317
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:07,385
-Was it work again?
-Don't cry.

318
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:10,385
It's not work this time.

319
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:12,705
But I didn't ask him about it.

320
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:13,905
I couldn't be bothered.

321
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,425
Is he pursuing her if he doesn't date her?

322
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:17,625
Of course not.

323
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:18,745
What is he doing?

324
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:21,025
All right. It will be fine.

325
00:19:21,105 --> 00:19:22,905
Even without him, we are here for you.

326
00:19:22,985 --> 00:19:24,665
-We'll take you out for coffee.
-Yes.

327
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:25,665
-No.
-Let's go.

328
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:27,105
I don't

329
00:19:27,185 --> 00:19:28,465
feel like going out today.

330
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:29,585
-Come on.
-Let's go.

331
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:31,105
-Let's go. You have to go.
-No.

332
00:19:31,185 --> 00:19:32,065
-Come.
-No, thank you.

333
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:33,585
-I'm not going.
-You have to go.

334
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:35,425
-No, thank you.
-You're coming right now.

335
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:36,785
C&D YIBAI ELDERLY CARE CENTER

336
00:19:36,865 --> 00:19:37,825
Mr. Duan.

337
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,385
Your dad hasn't been doing well lately.

338
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:44,225
I see. Thank you, Dr. Yang.

339
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,065
He has been bedridden for nine years.

340
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,105
His health and immunity are subpar.

341
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:52,465
His pulmonary edema has worsened lately.

342
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:56,025
I suggest taking him
to the hospital for surgery

343
00:19:56,585 --> 00:19:58,225
to remove the excess water in his lungs.

344
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,105
Otherwise, an infection might occur.

345
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:02,945
It will be even more severe by then.

346
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:27,465
Do you think

347
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:29,345
he will wake up?

348
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:33,425
Miracles will happen

349
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:34,945
as long as he is still alive.

350
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:40,705
Dr. Yang, I'll let you handle

351
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:42,265
the hospital transfer procedure.

352
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:45,585
I'll be going then.

353
00:20:45,665 --> 00:20:46,545
Okay.

354
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:26,385
Jiaxu.

355
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:28,545
Mom, look.

356
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:30,305
It's snowing today.

357
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:33,225
Call your dad. Why isn't he back yet?

358
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:34,345
We were going to celebrate

359
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:36,225
your first place
in the city's physics contest.

360
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:37,265
I'll ask him.

361
00:21:48,745 --> 00:21:49,665
Don't eat it yet.

362
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,065
-Well?
-He didn't pick up.

363
00:21:55,345 --> 00:21:56,425
Call him again.

364
00:22:03,745 --> 00:22:04,665
-Dad.
-There you are.

365
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:09,465
What's the matter?

366
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:12,905
Did you drink?

367
00:22:14,145 --> 00:22:15,145
I'm done for.

368
00:22:16,305 --> 00:22:17,705
-What do you mean?
-I'm done for.

369
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:19,225
What do you mean?

370
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:20,425
Dad, what's the matter?

371
00:22:22,345 --> 00:22:23,465
I ran someone over.

372
00:22:26,665 --> 00:22:27,785
Where did it happen?

373
00:22:29,345 --> 00:22:31,705
At the burger shop on Renmin Road.

374
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:32,785
How is that person doing?

375
00:22:34,225 --> 00:22:35,065
Well…

376
00:22:36,545 --> 00:22:37,825
No one saw it.

377
00:22:39,385 --> 00:22:41,665
I drank. I couldn't call the cops.

378
00:22:41,745 --> 00:22:43,705
Duan Zhicheng, have you lost your mind?

379
00:22:43,785 --> 00:22:45,305
How could you drive after drinking?

380
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:46,825
Are you mad? What were you thinking?

381
00:22:46,905 --> 00:22:48,705
Jiaxu!

382
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,225
Jiaxu, don't call the cops.

383
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:52,185
-Don't call them.
-Dad, listen to me!

384
00:22:52,825 --> 00:22:54,305
We have to save that person!

385
00:22:54,785 --> 00:22:55,945
It will be worse

386
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:57,185
if something happens to them!

387
00:22:57,265 --> 00:22:59,345
Dad, you can't escape from this.

388
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:01,385
Zhicheng, go and turn yourself in.

389
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:02,545
We'll figure something out.

390
00:23:03,585 --> 00:23:05,985
-I don't want to go to jail.
-Zhicheng, turn yourself in.

391
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:07,145
Jiaxu!

392
00:23:07,225 --> 00:23:08,065
-Zhicheng!
-Jiaxu!

393
00:23:08,145 --> 00:23:10,145
There was a car accident
outside the burger shop on Renmin Road!

394
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:13,745
-Send medical help!
-Turn yourself in!

395
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:14,705
Dad!

396
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:16,305
-Dad!
-Zhicheng!

397
00:23:17,705 --> 00:23:18,825
Zhicheng!

398
00:23:19,585 --> 00:23:20,665
Zhicheng!

399
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:23,385
Zhicheng!

400
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:47,745
You're back.

401
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:50,665
Why are you still up?

402
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:52,185
You're making that again.

403
00:23:52,825 --> 00:23:54,505
You're back late from work too.

404
00:23:54,585 --> 00:23:55,705
Look at the time.

405
00:24:04,305 --> 00:24:05,905
Did you skip dinner again?

406
00:24:06,465 --> 00:24:08,305
I'm not hungry. I was waiting for you.

407
00:24:09,585 --> 00:24:10,865
I brought noodles back for you.

408
00:24:10,945 --> 00:24:11,985
Put that down for now.

409
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:13,345
Let's have dinner together.

410
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:14,785
You're wasting money again.

411
00:24:15,545 --> 00:24:16,745
These?

412
00:24:17,905 --> 00:24:19,745
-They're inexpensive.
-Let me finish this first.

413
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:22,345
-Let's eat first.
-Okay.

414
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,185
Try this.

415
00:24:28,745 --> 00:24:30,985
I heard that this restaurant is good.

416
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:38,025
Here.

417
00:24:42,545 --> 00:24:44,625
Other kids are enjoying themselves

418
00:24:44,705 --> 00:24:46,265
after the college entrance exam.

419
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:47,545
But my son

420
00:24:48,585 --> 00:24:50,145
took on two jobs right after the exam,

421
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:51,465
working from morning until night.

422
00:24:51,545 --> 00:24:52,985
It's because I'm young.

423
00:24:53,585 --> 00:24:55,665
Young people should endure more hardships.

424
00:24:57,265 --> 00:24:58,745
By the way, Mom,

425
00:24:58,825 --> 00:24:59,825
I asked my boss

426
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,945
for an advance.

427
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:04,905
But he can only give me
half a month's advance

428
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:06,065
since I'm a newcomer.

429
00:25:07,425 --> 00:25:08,545
But that's fine.

430
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:09,905
I'll think of something else.

431
00:25:09,985 --> 00:25:11,545
Just let me handle this.

432
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,345
I'll try to borrow money
from our relatives.

433
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:15,225
Stop borrowing money from them.

434
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,345
I'm serious.

435
00:25:22,505 --> 00:25:23,985
Mom, I have something to tell you.

436
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:25,865
What is it?

437
00:25:27,585 --> 00:25:28,785
After giving it some thought,

438
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:30,545
I won't attend university in Nanwu.

439
00:25:31,105 --> 00:25:32,545
Earning money is more important now.

440
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,385
Absolutely not.

441
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:35,865
You have to attend university.

442
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:40,425
Our family is in huge debt.

443
00:25:41,225 --> 00:25:42,505
I don't have to go to university.

444
00:25:42,585 --> 00:25:44,265
I will work in the morning

445
00:25:44,345 --> 00:25:46,305
and do part-time jobs at night.

446
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,225
We'll pay off the debt eventually.

447
00:25:49,305 --> 00:25:50,985
You mustn't let our mistakes

448
00:25:51,065 --> 00:25:52,105
affect your future.

449
00:25:54,105 --> 00:25:55,305
But you know that--

450
00:25:55,385 --> 00:25:56,505
No buts.

451
00:25:57,065 --> 00:25:58,465
You have to finish university.

452
00:25:58,545 --> 00:25:59,705
If not,

453
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:02,305
don't call me your mom.

454
00:26:06,785 --> 00:26:07,785
Mom, what's wrong?

455
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:09,265
I'm fine.

456
00:26:09,345 --> 00:26:10,745
Maybe it's because I skipped dinner.

457
00:26:11,985 --> 00:26:14,625
My tummy is protesting.

458
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:16,505
How many times have I told you?

459
00:26:16,585 --> 00:26:18,225
You can't skip meals.

460
00:26:18,305 --> 00:26:19,665
I'll get you some water.

461
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:36,145
Mom, it's time to eat.

462
00:26:37,825 --> 00:26:39,465
Have you done the discharge paperwork?

463
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:42,785
You're not leaving.

464
00:26:45,985 --> 00:26:47,225
What are you doing?

465
00:26:49,865 --> 00:26:50,905
Sit down and rest.

466
00:26:58,105 --> 00:26:58,985
Mom.

467
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,145
You don't need to be discharged.

468
00:27:02,065 --> 00:27:04,225
I borrowed 30,000 yuan
from my university friend.

469
00:27:04,745 --> 00:27:07,385
You can stay here and recuperate.

470
00:27:09,345 --> 00:27:10,265
Jiaxu.

471
00:27:10,905 --> 00:27:12,465
I feel much better now.

472
00:27:13,545 --> 00:27:14,545
I feel like going home.

473
00:27:15,665 --> 00:27:16,505
I'm serious.

474
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:17,865
Return the money.

475
00:27:18,865 --> 00:27:19,905
I already borrowed it.

476
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:21,625
Your health matters the most.

477
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:22,625
Rest well.

478
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:25,945
My son.

479
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,585
Aren't you tired of owing people money?

480
00:27:31,145 --> 00:27:33,025
We cannot stand with our heads up high

481
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,785
until the day we pay off all our debt.

482
00:27:37,385 --> 00:27:40,065
I don't want you to be burdened by this.

483
00:27:41,505 --> 00:27:42,785
Mom, don't worry.

484
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:46,065
I can earn back the money in the future.

485
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,745
Don't overthink it.

486
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:50,225
Now, have something to eat, okay?

487
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:51,625
I brought you some--

488
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:52,905
I'm begging you!

489
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:55,625
Will you please return the money?

490
00:27:56,905 --> 00:27:59,145
We haven't paid off our existing debt yet.

491
00:27:59,225 --> 00:28:01,545
We still need to take care
of Xiaoying and her mom.

492
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,625
We can't afford to take on more debts!

493
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:06,065
What if I die one day

494
00:28:06,145 --> 00:28:07,865
and the debt isn't paid off yet?

495
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:09,225
What will you do then?

496
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:11,025
Mom, you won't die. What are you saying?

497
00:29:02,145 --> 00:29:03,345
What are you doing?

498
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:05,065
SANG ZHI

499
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:06,625
DUAN JIAXU

500
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:07,665
I just got home.

501
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:32,785
Hello, Jiaxu.

502
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:34,065
What is it?

503
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:36,425
What are you doing?

504
00:29:37,465 --> 00:29:38,545
I'm at my dorm.

505
00:29:41,145 --> 00:29:42,265
I'll go and see you.

506
00:29:45,945 --> 00:29:47,145
Right now?

507
00:29:48,305 --> 00:29:49,425
It's 8:30 p.m.

508
00:29:50,985 --> 00:29:52,665
That's three and a half hours left

509
00:29:52,745 --> 00:29:53,945
until your curfew.

510
00:30:02,785 --> 00:30:03,905
Okay then.

511
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:05,705
I'll take you out for supper.

512
00:30:05,785 --> 00:30:07,145
What do you want to have?

513
00:30:07,225 --> 00:30:08,905
I'm fine with anything. I'm not hungry.

514
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,665
I'll be right there. Wait.

515
00:30:15,745 --> 00:30:16,625
Don't wait.

516
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:18,425
-Wait, I--
-Hurry up.

517
00:30:29,985 --> 00:30:31,425
What have you been busy with lately?

518
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:38,425
Plenty of things.

519
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:39,705
I have lectures to attend,

520
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,985
assignments to finish,

521
00:30:43,465 --> 00:30:44,425
also,

522
00:30:45,185 --> 00:30:46,225
a drawing exhibition,

523
00:30:46,905 --> 00:30:48,145
my school club,

524
00:30:48,705 --> 00:30:51,145
and wait for someone to ask me out.

525
00:31:00,465 --> 00:31:01,545
Lately…

526
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:05,545
I'm sorry.

527
00:31:06,785 --> 00:31:08,785
I didn't mean to keep canceling.

528
00:31:09,665 --> 00:31:10,825
I've just been deluged

529
00:31:10,905 --> 00:31:12,705
with too many miscellaneous things lately.

530
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:15,585
Miscellaneous things?

531
00:31:16,545 --> 00:31:18,145
They're just trivial matters.

532
00:31:18,665 --> 00:31:19,545
They're not important.

533
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,585
If that's the case,

534
00:31:28,665 --> 00:31:29,825
why didn't you ask me out?

535
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:35,265
I had no idea

536
00:31:35,345 --> 00:31:37,625
you wanted me to ask you out so badly.

537
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:45,665
Are you upset?

538
00:31:47,545 --> 00:31:48,385
No.

539
00:31:50,145 --> 00:31:51,025
I feel

540
00:31:52,665 --> 00:31:53,985
that you're unhappy.

541
00:31:58,065 --> 00:31:59,665
Are you burned out from work?

542
00:32:01,305 --> 00:32:03,185
No. How can that be?

543
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:06,185
I'm finally having a meal with you.

544
00:32:06,265 --> 00:32:07,465
I'm over the moon.

545
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:11,465
I'm serious.

546
00:32:13,585 --> 00:32:14,425
If so,

547
00:32:15,545 --> 00:32:16,505
give me a smile.

548
00:32:26,025 --> 00:32:26,865
Wait here.

549
00:32:27,585 --> 00:32:29,385
-Where are you going?
-Wait here.

550
00:32:36,065 --> 00:32:36,905
Hello.

551
00:32:36,985 --> 00:32:38,625
Can I make one?

552
00:32:38,705 --> 00:32:40,145
Hi. Do you want to make one?

553
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:41,305
I would like to have a try.

554
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:43,385
Thank you.

555
00:32:43,465 --> 00:32:44,585
It's pretty difficult.

556
00:32:44,665 --> 00:32:45,545
Do I do it like this?

557
00:33:11,785 --> 00:33:12,745
Cut it for me.

558
00:33:14,825 --> 00:33:15,705
Okay.

559
00:33:17,945 --> 00:33:19,065
Take your time.

560
00:33:28,185 --> 00:33:29,065
Bring it lower.

561
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:31,185
Is this okay?

562
00:33:31,265 --> 00:33:32,345
Yes.

563
00:33:35,785 --> 00:33:37,225
Do you want cotton candy?

564
00:33:44,985 --> 00:33:46,545
-I'll pay you in a bit.
-Okay.

565
00:33:50,185 --> 00:33:51,225
This is for you.

566
00:33:51,705 --> 00:33:52,585
For me?

567
00:34:00,345 --> 00:34:02,145
It's as if you're cheering a child up.

568
00:34:02,785 --> 00:34:04,825
Yes, an old child.

569
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:10,985
When I was unhappy in the past,

570
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:12,344
eating sweets would cheer me up.

571
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,705
Do you want to try it?

572
00:34:14,945 --> 00:34:15,905
I'll try it.

573
00:34:22,705 --> 00:34:23,545
Is it sweet?

574
00:34:25,985 --> 00:34:26,905
It's very sweet.

575
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:28,385
Thank you.

576
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:37,705
It's my first time
being comforted like this.

577
00:34:43,264 --> 00:34:44,225
Do you want to try it?

578
00:34:53,665 --> 00:34:54,505
Is it sweet?

579
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:57,785
It's sweet.

580
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:11,145
You're pretty good at making cotton candy.

581
00:35:11,825 --> 00:35:13,465
Have you made it for someone else before?

582
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:14,905
No.

583
00:35:16,305 --> 00:35:17,905
So I'm the first person to try

584
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:19,305
the cotton candy you made.

585
00:35:20,425 --> 00:35:21,345
Yes.

586
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,905
I understand what you mean now.

587
00:35:28,145 --> 00:35:29,385
What do you mean?

588
00:35:32,385 --> 00:35:33,225
I understand.

589
00:35:36,465 --> 00:35:37,585
What do you understand?

590
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:40,985
Haven't you agreed

591
00:35:41,945 --> 00:35:42,985
to be my girlfriend?

592
00:35:47,785 --> 00:35:49,985
When did I agree to that?

593
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,305
Why would someone make cotton candy

594
00:35:52,385 --> 00:35:53,505
for an ordinary friend?

595
00:35:58,025 --> 00:35:59,065
-Ordinary--
-That's not all.

596
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,265
You're wearing the bracelet.

597
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:12,105
Jiaxu, you…

598
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:14,025
Stop being so devious.

599
00:36:14,945 --> 00:36:17,225
You won't win me over like this.

600
00:36:18,105 --> 00:36:19,305
Then how can I win you over?

601
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:21,185
You can

602
00:36:21,745 --> 00:36:24,905
search online

603
00:36:24,985 --> 00:36:27,505
or ask other people.

604
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,585
Ask other people how to pursue a girl.

605
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:30,745
How do I pursue a girl?

606
00:36:32,385 --> 00:36:33,865
Must you ask me?

607
00:36:34,465 --> 00:36:35,625
Can you teach me?

608
00:36:37,305 --> 00:36:39,105
Anyway, listen up.

609
00:36:39,745 --> 00:36:41,025
At this rate,

610
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:42,465
if we're only texting,

611
00:36:42,545 --> 00:36:44,185
occasionally calling,

612
00:36:44,265 --> 00:36:46,785
and meeting up once in a long while,

613
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:48,705
it definitely won't work.

614
00:36:48,785 --> 00:36:49,985
It's not online dating.

615
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:52,305
Online dating at your age?

616
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:54,305
Speaking of online dating,

617
00:36:54,385 --> 00:36:55,705
I suddenly recall something.

618
00:36:56,265 --> 00:36:58,065
-A certain kiddo had--
-Okay, that's enough.

619
00:36:58,145 --> 00:36:59,225
That's enough. Great job.

620
00:36:59,305 --> 00:37:00,545
Don't bring it up again.

621
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:07,025
I was just joking with you.

622
00:37:10,065 --> 00:37:10,985
I'm serious.

623
00:37:11,545 --> 00:37:12,585
Today,

624
00:37:12,665 --> 00:37:14,105
I've realized my mistakes.

625
00:37:15,465 --> 00:37:16,305
From today on,

626
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,785
I will be serious

627
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:22,425
and work hard to pursue you.

628
00:37:25,425 --> 00:37:26,305
I'm serious.

629
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:31,345
Great.

630
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:33,025
I will look forward

631
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:34,905
to your performance.

632
00:37:38,585 --> 00:37:39,785
Are you free tomorrow?

633
00:37:43,745 --> 00:37:44,985
Tomorrow morning?

634
00:37:46,145 --> 00:37:47,265
Not in the morning.

635
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:48,745
I need to be at school.

636
00:37:48,825 --> 00:37:50,265
Do you have classes on the weekend?

637
00:37:50,745 --> 00:37:51,865
It's not a class.

638
00:37:51,945 --> 00:37:54,185
An alumnus is giving a sharing seminar.

639
00:37:55,985 --> 00:37:57,025
But…

640
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:58,985
-My afternoon--
-I see.

641
00:38:00,105 --> 00:38:02,305
-My afternoon--
-I'll just work overtime tomorrow then.

642
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:04,905
It's fine.

643
00:38:05,465 --> 00:38:06,465
I will keep at it.

644
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:13,025
I said "but" very loudly.

645
00:38:13,105 --> 00:38:14,385
Don't tell me he didn't hear me.

646
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:24,305
I'm excited about this sharing session.

647
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,705
We should tell them to come.

648
00:38:25,785 --> 00:38:27,985
All right. I'll text them right now.

649
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:31,505
Let's sit here.

650
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:32,425
Okay.

651
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:40,065
Text them right now.

652
00:38:40,545 --> 00:38:42,065
I'll ask them on WeChat.

653
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:52,025
Sangsang,

654
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:54,185
I can't see the blackboard from here.

655
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,265
I'm going to sit closer.

656
00:39:02,185 --> 00:39:03,105
Good morning.

657
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:09,905
What's the matter?

658
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:14,905
Who is that next to Sang Zhi?

659
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:15,985
Is that her boyfriend?

660
00:39:16,585 --> 00:39:18,025
I don't know.

661
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,185
What are you doing here?

662
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:22,025
Didn't you say that
there is a sharing session today?

663
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:22,945
Yes.

664
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:25,545
So I inquired about the time and location.

665
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,225
Don't you have work today?

666
00:39:30,305 --> 00:39:31,465
I took time off.

667
00:39:35,345 --> 00:39:36,185
So…

668
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:39,665
Are you here to keep me company?

669
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:41,545
What do you mean?

670
00:39:42,105 --> 00:39:43,745
I just happened to run into you.

671
00:39:46,745 --> 00:39:47,625
Sure.

672
00:39:48,145 --> 00:39:50,385
You graduated from university
almost two years ago

673
00:39:50,465 --> 00:39:52,345
and just happened
to run into a freshman like me.

674
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,425
And look at your getup.

675
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:57,985
Do I look young?

676
00:40:03,345 --> 00:40:04,225
It's not bad.

677
00:40:05,585 --> 00:40:06,985
I'll dress like this from now on.

678
00:40:23,185 --> 00:40:25,385
Sang Zhi's boyfriend keeps gazing at her.

679
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:26,705
He's so gentle.

680
00:40:34,825 --> 00:40:36,625
Why does he keep staring at me?

681
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,825
Maybe I should pretend to sleep.

682
00:40:38,905 --> 00:40:41,345
I'm sleepy all of a sudden.

683
00:40:42,705 --> 00:40:44,545
It hasn't started yet. I'll take a nap.

684
00:40:45,865 --> 00:40:47,625
Why are you sleepy now that I'm here?

685
00:40:48,985 --> 00:40:51,385
No, I would be sleepy
even if you weren't here.

686
00:40:53,505 --> 00:40:54,585
Take a nap then.

687
00:41:03,585 --> 00:41:04,505
Go to sleep.

688
00:41:17,025 --> 00:41:18,585
This kiddo is pretending to be asleep.

689
00:42:21,425 --> 00:42:23,065
SANG YAN

690
00:42:24,065 --> 00:42:25,425
I think my sister is seeing someone.

691
00:42:26,145 --> 00:42:27,185
She's alone out there.

692
00:42:27,265 --> 00:42:28,465
Help me look out for her.

693
00:42:29,025 --> 00:42:30,345
Make sure she doesn't get tricked.

694
00:42:49,105 --> 00:42:49,985
Okay.
