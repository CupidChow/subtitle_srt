HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

2
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:57,785
Tell that dog to come down here.

3
00:01:59,425 --> 00:02:00,825
He's coming down already.

4
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:05,945
Maybe I should leave you here.

5
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,385
I'm going to go.

6
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:10,825
I thought we were having a barbecue.

7
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,265
You seem quite happy to be here.

8
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:15,665
All right. Go on.

9
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:17,185
Give me my phone and bag.

10
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:18,425
Hey.

11
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,865
Can't you be more reserved?

12
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:21,785
What's wrong now?

13
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:23,465
I'm here for my boyfriend.

14
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:25,025
Why should I be reserved?

15
00:02:25,105 --> 00:02:26,185
You're weird.

16
00:02:27,945 --> 00:02:29,585
Are you sure it was Duan Jiaxu

17
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:30,785
who did the pursuing?

18
00:02:41,185 --> 00:02:42,665
What is that supposed to mean?

19
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:44,745
I'm just asking.

20
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:47,305
Don't spin any stories.

21
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:48,785
Mind your language.

22
00:02:48,865 --> 00:02:51,185
I said I was just asking.

23
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:52,585
You were implying something.

24
00:02:52,665 --> 00:02:53,705
I was asking…

25
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:56,145
What are you arguing about?

26
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,865
Get in the car.

27
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:01,945
Ignore him. Let's go.

28
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:17,785
Come here.

29
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:27,865
Sorry for the long wait.

30
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:32,505
Are you hungry?

31
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:33,825
No.

32
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:37,345
Are you hungry?

33
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:39,105
Not yet.

34
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:50,025
What?

35
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:52,705
Do me a favor.

36
00:03:52,785 --> 00:03:54,305
Please don't do anything

37
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:55,705
you shouldn't do in my car.

38
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:56,785
Thank you.

39
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,025
What shouldn't we do here?

40
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,025
Just drive.

41
00:04:01,945 --> 00:04:03,145
What?

42
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:05,185
Do you take me as your personal driver?

43
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:08,465
Sang Yan, be honest with me.

44
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:10,385
Do you envy us a lot?

45
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:12,105
Fine, little demon.

46
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,505
Jiaxu, let me ask you something.

47
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:15,065
Back in our senior year of university,

48
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:16,745
we moved dorms and my sister…

49
00:04:18,585 --> 00:04:19,665
Shut it.

50
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:21,305
Let go.

51
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:22,865
Just drive.

52
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:28,385
All right.

53
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:30,225
Welcome to Sang Yan's personal ride.

54
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:33,065
Please fasten your seat belts.

55
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:35,025
May I know if the temperature is okay?

56
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:37,345
If so, please give me a five-star rating.

57
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:39,665
-Today--
-Shut it. Just drive.

58
00:04:40,665 --> 00:04:42,465
Your brother talks a lot.

59
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:52,505
I'm hungry.

60
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:53,945
-You must be starving.
-In college--

61
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:55,865
-I just ate.
-Here they come.

62
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:56,865
Hurry up!

63
00:04:56,945 --> 00:04:58,025
We've been waiting for ages!

64
00:04:58,105 --> 00:04:59,065
What took you…

65
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:01,065
What's going on?

66
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:02,465
-Don't you know?
-I don't.

67
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:03,465
I'm not telling you.

68
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:05,305
Hello, guys.

69
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:07,145
-Hi.
-Take your seats.

70
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:08,225
Hello, Qian Fei.

71
00:05:09,305 --> 00:05:11,105
I forgot to introduce her.

72
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,505
This is my girlfriend.

73
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,345
Hold on.

74
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:16,785
When we graduated,

75
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:18,145
you two were taking photos.

76
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:20,105
Wang Jun asked you who she is.

77
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:21,465
You said she is your sister.

78
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:23,305
That's right.

79
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:25,865
Back then,

80
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:27,105
I had a crush on her.

81
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:28,505
I was too embarrassed to say it.

82
00:05:29,105 --> 00:05:30,385
-Sang Yan.
-Did you know?

83
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:31,945
Sang Yan, are you and Jiaxu already…

84
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:32,985
Yes.

85
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:34,265
Order food already.

86
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:35,505
I'm footing the bill tonight.

87
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,705
I'm starving.

88
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:37,865
-Excuse me!
-Menu, please.

89
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:40,465
Do you have pork knuckles?

90
00:05:41,185 --> 00:05:42,665
You waited three months to tell us!

91
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:44,145
-No, wait. Hear me out.
-Qian Fei!

92
00:05:44,225 --> 00:05:45,585
We should congratulate him.

93
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:47,345
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

94
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:48,905
This is too sudden. Thank you!

95
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:49,905
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

96
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:51,185
I was going to tell you.

97
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:52,305
I'll go first.

98
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,705
Take it easy.

99
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:54,665
I'll be fine.

100
00:05:56,665 --> 00:05:58,665
So have you found a confinement center?

101
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:00,825
No? What about the hospital?

102
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:01,905
Private or public?

103
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:03,665
Hold on.

104
00:06:04,185 --> 00:06:06,865
You should start
drawing up a budget, buddy.

105
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,305
-Is it expensive?
-Yes.

106
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:09,825
A premium center costs six figures.

107
00:06:09,905 --> 00:06:11,545
-Some charge over a million.
-Is that all?

108
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,625
-Yes.
-Sang Yan.

109
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,905
How do you know?

110
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:16,065
She has a point.

111
00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:19,425
I'll have to know eventually.

112
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,105
I did some research in advance.

113
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:23,505
Why were you researching this?

114
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,625
That's fishy.

115
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:26,945
Forget about me.

116
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:28,345
-Something is up.
-Forget it.

117
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:33,225
Stop drinking. You've had enough.

118
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:35,305
What do you mean? I barely had any.

119
00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:37,385
What's wrong?

120
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:39,225
Can't my girlfriend have some wine?

121
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:40,705
Can't I?

122
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:41,705
Fine, as you wish.

123
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:43,225
Your old boyfriend can deal with you.

124
00:06:43,785 --> 00:06:45,385
"Boyfriend" is enough.

125
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:46,985
Why are you calling me old?

126
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:48,385
It's hard on the ears.

127
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:49,505
No, I mean it.

128
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:51,425
She has to be home by ten.

129
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:52,865
All right.

130
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:54,825
Why should we listen to him?

131
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:56,985
Are you feeling rebellious?

132
00:06:57,825 --> 00:06:58,905
Fine.

133
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:02,745
The call went through.

134
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:05,705
Hello, Mom.

135
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:08,905
Sang Zhi called me a midget!

136
00:07:08,985 --> 00:07:10,745
-Keep it down.
-She even called me ugly.

137
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:11,985
She even hit me.

138
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,185
-Enough, buddy.
-That's so embarrassing.

139
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:16,025
You are too old for this prank.

140
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:18,145
I know. She will be home by ten.

141
00:07:19,385 --> 00:07:20,305
Qian Fei.

142
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,265
Congratulations.

143
00:07:22,345 --> 00:07:23,625
-Drink up.
-Yes.

144
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:26,425
-Bottoms up.
-Congratulations, Qian Fei.

145
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:28,345
Your turn will come eventually.

146
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:29,745
Eventually? Not anytime soon.

147
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:30,745
It has to wait!

148
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,905
Finish your wine.

149
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:35,145
Enough with your feudal mindset. Be nice.

150
00:07:36,345 --> 00:07:37,265
Sang Yan.

151
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:39,265
Ease up on the wine.

152
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:40,785
How is your wine better?

153
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:43,945
Okay, you've had enough.

154
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:03,625
Are you eager to go home?

155
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:05,305
No.

156
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:14,665
Jiaxu, why didn't you drive today?

157
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:17,425
It's quite a long walk from here.

158
00:08:18,305 --> 00:08:19,745
You drank too much wine.

159
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:22,465
You can't go home reeking of wine.

160
00:08:33,985 --> 00:08:34,945
What's the matter?

161
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:38,105
Are you really allergic to alcohol?

162
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:42,745
Should we give it a try?

163
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:48,625
Let's see

164
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,025
if I'm allergic to it.

165
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:06,065
I don't think I'm allergic anymore.

166
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,945
I can give you a few more kisses.

167
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:18,625
Hold on.

168
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:22,905
This can't go on forever.

169
00:09:23,825 --> 00:09:24,745
I think

170
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:26,785
I have to see you every day.

171
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:29,025
If I don't see you for even a day,

172
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:30,145
I'll miss you so badly.

173
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:52,425
I'm heading home.

174
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:05,505
Bye.

175
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:41,185
Where were you?

176
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:43,345
I took out the trash.

177
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:46,105
Why did you come home so late?

178
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:49,585
Sang Yan took me out to dinner.

179
00:10:50,945 --> 00:10:51,945
-Then…
-I'm going to sleep.

180
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:26,745
What's wrong?

181
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:28,345
Did you have wine?

182
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:33,985
Just a little bit.

183
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:34,985
I didn't drink much.

184
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:36,545
Sang Yan was there anyway.

185
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,305
I'll let it go since Sang Yan was there.

186
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:41,665
But when you go out alone,

187
00:11:41,745 --> 00:11:42,665
do not drink.

188
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:52,945
Are you and Duan Jiaxu dating?

189
00:11:57,705 --> 00:11:58,985
I saw everything.

190
00:12:05,545 --> 00:12:06,545
How long has it been?

191
00:12:13,185 --> 00:12:15,065
Not that long.

192
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:17,985
I wanted to tell you.

193
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:20,025
But…

194
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:22,265
Is this why you didn't come home
for the summer?

195
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:28,585
That was part of the reason.

196
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:31,585
But it was also

197
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:33,545
because I finally got an internship.

198
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,265
I wanted to gain some experience
before I graduated.

199
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,705
Did you stay at the dorm or his place

200
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:41,785
over the summer?

201
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:42,785
The dorm.

202
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:45,745
It's true.

203
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:47,665
Sang Yan came to Yihe.

204
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:48,865
He knows everything.

205
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:01,705
Mom, don't worry about it.

206
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:03,945
Jiaxu treats me well.

207
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:05,745
He is a kind person.

208
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:07,385
You know him well.

209
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:09,305
I know him. I know he is a good man.

210
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:11,825
But do you know about his family?

211
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:15,825
I don't know how it is now.

212
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,065
Your brother told me before

213
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:21,225
that his dad is in a coma.

214
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:24,145
The victim's family
often gives them trouble.

215
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:25,425
It's not really that often.

216
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:27,265
Have you run into them?

217
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:34,465
Jiaxu told me about it.

218
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:37,985
You just took his word for it.

219
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:39,865
You haven't seen it for yourself,
have you?

220
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:42,585
I know he has been nice to you
since you were little.

221
00:13:43,385 --> 00:13:44,865
He was your tutor.

222
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:46,065
I wonder

223
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:48,945
if you've mistaken your admiration for him

224
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:50,745
for love.

225
00:13:51,545 --> 00:13:53,865
You only see him as a brother, right?

226
00:13:54,985 --> 00:13:57,225
But if you two are in a relationship,

227
00:13:57,825 --> 00:13:59,185
your dad and I…

228
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:06,105
I…

229
00:14:06,185 --> 00:14:07,545
I don't.

230
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:09,905
I am an adult now.

231
00:14:09,985 --> 00:14:12,585
Would I not be able
to tell admiration from love?

232
00:14:13,265 --> 00:14:14,705
I really do like him.

233
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:16,945
Zhizhi, you are only a young girl.

234
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:17,985
You're still in college.

235
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:18,905
But he's different.

236
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:19,985
He's much older than you.

237
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:22,705
He has a lot of experience as an adult.

238
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:24,865
I know you won't like what I'm saying.

239
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:26,505
We'll talk about it another time.

240
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:27,665
Shower and go to bed.

241
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:47,105
CHAPTER 23, STRANDED

242
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:49,185
LOVE WITHOUT SECOND THOUGHTS

243
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:14,825
Who do we have here?

244
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:17,145
Where were you this morning?

245
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:19,865
I…

246
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:23,505
I did something very important.

247
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,785
Something very important?

248
00:15:26,745 --> 00:15:27,785
What is it?

249
00:15:29,785 --> 00:15:31,385
You'll know soon enough.

250
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:33,265
I can't tell you yet. All right?

251
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:40,745
I've been thinking.

252
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:43,345
You didn't go home all summer.

253
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:45,145
Spend more time with your parents.

254
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:48,185
What about you?

255
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:49,905
I'll stay here too.

256
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:52,385
I'm thinking

257
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:54,545
I should pick a day

258
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,905
to formally visit your parents.

259
00:15:59,865 --> 00:16:00,945
What do you think?

260
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:03,025
I think it's a great idea.

261
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,985
I'll ask them when I get back.

262
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,745
And then we can go out for dinner.

263
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:10,745
We can ask them.

264
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:13,225
All right.

265
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:14,745
Then let's go.

266
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,425
I'll turn 20 next year.

267
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:35,185
And I am almost 26.

268
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:38,705
Time doesn't slow down for anyone.

269
00:16:41,105 --> 00:16:43,385
I'm not calling you old.

270
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,785
I just think

271
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:51,025
I am too young.

272
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,145
I wish I weren't 20 years old.

273
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:57,145
It would be great if I were 29.

274
00:16:58,505 --> 00:16:59,985
What makes you say that?

275
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:03,985
I would be three years older than you

276
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,385
if I were 29.

277
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:08,745
That way…

278
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:11,345
That way,

279
00:17:12,585 --> 00:17:14,345
my brother wouldn't have hit you

280
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:16,145
for dating me.

281
00:17:24,345 --> 00:17:25,345
I can't allow that.

282
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:28,265
I like younger girls.

283
00:17:32,345 --> 00:17:34,265
But I'll turn old someday.

284
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:37,825
But you'll still be younger than me.

285
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:40,145
What has gotten into you?

286
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,665
Duan Jiaxu.

287
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:55,945
Are you happy?

288
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,065
Of course I am.

289
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,145
Are you really happy?

290
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:02,585
I really am.

291
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:05,025
What's wrong?

292
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:07,585
It's nothing.

293
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:08,785
I'm glad to hear that.

294
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:12,585
I want you to stay happy every day.

295
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:15,145
I will make sure

296
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:17,225
you are happy every day of your life.

297
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:21,145
Okay.

298
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,625
That will depend on you.

299
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:25,465
We'll see if you'll keep staying with me.

300
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,025
Here you go.

301
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:48,665
Xiaoduan, have some tea.

302
00:18:48,745 --> 00:18:49,585
Thank you, Mr. Sang.

303
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:50,785
Take a seat.

304
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:53,785
Don't act like a stranger.

305
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:54,985
Did you bring me tea leaves?

306
00:18:55,545 --> 00:18:57,105
You like tea.

307
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:58,225
I don't know much about it.

308
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,985
I thought you could appraise them.

309
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,185
Very well.

310
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:06,425
I asked you to come here

311
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:07,585
while Zhizhi is away today.

312
00:19:07,665 --> 00:19:08,705
I know it was sudden.

313
00:19:08,785 --> 00:19:10,865
I hope you don't mind.

314
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:12,225
I don't.

315
00:19:12,305 --> 00:19:13,505
I was planning

316
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,865
to visit you and Mrs. Sang in person soon.

317
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:17,905
Honestly,

318
00:19:18,385 --> 00:19:20,305
I was a little surprised when I found out

319
00:19:20,385 --> 00:19:21,665
that you and Zhizhi are dating.

320
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:26,025
I wanted to inform you personally.

321
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:28,425
I talked to her

322
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:29,625
about some issues.

323
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:32,105
But she doesn't seem to get it.

324
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:34,745
Her mom and I have been thinking.

325
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:36,025
Since you are in Nanwu,

326
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:37,945
we might as well ask you to come here,

327
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:39,625
so we can discuss it face-to-face.

328
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,465
Mr. Sang,

329
00:19:43,545 --> 00:19:45,385
is there anything that concerns you?

330
00:19:45,465 --> 00:19:46,545
Feel free to ask me.

331
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:49,025
That is great.

332
00:19:49,745 --> 00:19:51,705
How long have you and Zhizhi been dating?

333
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:54,345
We started dating in May.

334
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:56,545
It has been less than a year.

335
00:19:57,825 --> 00:19:59,945
It hasn't been that long.

336
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:02,585
Sang Yan told me

337
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:04,745
that you've settled your family affairs.

338
00:20:04,825 --> 00:20:06,625
-Is that right?
-Yes.

339
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,945
Did that family cause you
any more trouble?

340
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:10,545
Not recently.

341
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,545
So how is your dad doing lately?

342
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:17,345
He is

343
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:19,345
still the same.

344
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:20,785
He's still bedridden.

345
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,545
I'm sorry.

346
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:25,225
It's okay.

347
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,305
Xiaoduan.

348
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:30,065
You've always been good to Zhizhi.

349
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,225
You've taken care of her.

350
00:20:31,305 --> 00:20:33,305
Her mom and I are grateful for that.

351
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,185
But if you want to be
in a relationship with her,

352
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:38,465
given the circumstances of your family,

353
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:40,465
her mom and I

354
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:44,225
are indeed a bit concerned.

355
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,225
Zhizhi is still young.

356
00:20:47,305 --> 00:20:48,905
Maybe she hasn't thought that far ahead

357
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:50,345
about this relationship.

358
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:52,665
However,

359
00:20:52,745 --> 00:20:54,865
if you two are in a relationship…

360
00:20:55,785 --> 00:20:57,505
After all, we are her parents.

361
00:20:57,585 --> 00:20:58,825
We are worried.

362
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:01,985
I understand.

363
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:04,185
I can relate to that, Mr. Sang.

364
00:21:04,945 --> 00:21:06,705
All the concerns you have

365
00:21:06,785 --> 00:21:08,465
are things that I should consider.

366
00:21:09,945 --> 00:21:11,345
But you have my word.

367
00:21:11,425 --> 00:21:12,385
I will

368
00:21:12,945 --> 00:21:14,465
resolve all of these issues.

369
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:18,265
I believe you on this.

370
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:21,025
I'm only expressing my concerns.

371
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,985
This might sound hurtful to you.

372
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:24,585
I hope you understand.

373
00:21:24,665 --> 00:21:25,865
It's okay.

374
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:27,185
After all,

375
00:21:27,825 --> 00:21:29,465
we've doted on Zhizhi all her life.

376
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:31,905
It pains us to see her suffer.

377
00:21:33,145 --> 00:21:34,025
Yes.

378
00:21:37,385 --> 00:21:39,145
Zhizhi isn't even 20 yet.

379
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,905
You are a bit older than her.

380
00:21:42,265 --> 00:21:43,505
I truly hope

381
00:21:44,065 --> 00:21:45,945
that you can seriously consider

382
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,825
your future with her.

383
00:21:48,585 --> 00:21:49,465
Is that clear?

384
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:50,985
Yes, Mr. Sang.

385
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:11,585
I'm home.

386
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:12,745
Welcome home.

387
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:14,185
How was the classmate gathering?

388
00:22:14,705 --> 00:22:16,185
It was not bad.

389
00:22:17,105 --> 00:22:18,065
I just feel

390
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,065
that everyone has changed

391
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:22,505
quite a lot.

392
00:22:22,585 --> 00:22:23,505
Is that so?

393
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:26,625
Let me get it for you.

394
00:22:33,545 --> 00:22:34,905
I'll help you slice the fruit, Mom.

395
00:22:35,545 --> 00:22:37,585
No need. Talk to your dad.

396
00:22:37,665 --> 00:22:38,545
I can manage.

397
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:41,745
What did we do to deserve
such a lovely daughter?

398
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,345
I've been thinking about the past.

399
00:22:47,705 --> 00:22:49,625
I remember you were weak as a child.

400
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:52,065
You often had a cold or fever.

401
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:53,665
Your mom and I

402
00:22:53,745 --> 00:22:55,185
went to the hospital every other day.

403
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:58,305
You would cry as soon
as we entered the hospital.

404
00:22:59,025 --> 00:23:00,905
Seeing you in pain pained us just as much.

405
00:23:00,985 --> 00:23:02,265
But there was no other way.

406
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,145
Your brother was only a little boy.

407
00:23:07,305 --> 00:23:08,785
He didn't like having a new addition.

408
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:10,545
He felt that we neglected him

409
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:11,985
after you came along.

410
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:14,265
I remember he wrote in his diary,

411
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:15,785
"I would rather have a dog

412
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:17,225
than this sister."

413
00:23:18,225 --> 00:23:19,945
But when you were in the hospital

414
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:20,985
and he couldn't see you,

415
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:22,345
he kept following me around

416
00:23:22,425 --> 00:23:23,865
and asking me where you were.

417
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,545
One day, I told him

418
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,865
that we had gotten rid of you.

419
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:29,065
He was so scared that he cried.

420
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:33,265
That is an amusing memory.

421
00:23:33,865 --> 00:23:35,905
It feels like it happened yesterday.

422
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:39,305
And now, you and your brother
are grown-ups.

423
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,385
You're turning 20 next year.

424
00:23:42,985 --> 00:23:44,385
You've also started dating.

425
00:23:45,065 --> 00:23:46,025
In a few years,

426
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:47,945
you'll get married.

427
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:00,505
Yes.

428
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:02,945
Time flies like an arrow.

429
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,625
Zhizhi.

430
00:24:07,185 --> 00:24:08,865
I am not a snobbish person.

431
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:11,705
I don't think
that we're superior to others

432
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,945
simply because we are comfortably off.

433
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:16,825
I'm not saying that no one deserves you.

434
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:17,745
Of course,

435
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:19,305
if anyone wants to be your boyfriend,

436
00:24:19,385 --> 00:24:21,625
I am certain I can find his flaws.

437
00:24:22,465 --> 00:24:23,625
I'm not saying

438
00:24:23,705 --> 00:24:25,305
you are too fragile to undergo hardships.

439
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,265
But your mom and I

440
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:29,785
really hate to see you suffer.

441
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:32,585
We don't want you to have a hard life.

442
00:24:32,665 --> 00:24:34,865
We will always have that kind of worry.

443
00:24:35,945 --> 00:24:37,225
Don't worry, Dad.

444
00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:38,905
I am not suffering any hardships.

445
00:24:38,985 --> 00:24:41,465
I am very happy every day.

446
00:24:42,985 --> 00:24:43,905
I'm glad to hear that.

447
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:46,985
I think of myself as a normal parent.

448
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:48,025
I am the same

449
00:24:48,105 --> 00:24:49,385
as every other dad.

450
00:24:49,465 --> 00:24:51,385
I only hope that my daughter

451
00:24:51,465 --> 00:24:53,625
can have a smooth life free from any harm.

452
00:24:53,705 --> 00:24:56,145
I want you to be safe and happy.

453
00:24:58,625 --> 00:24:59,505
Zhizhi.

454
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:00,425
Thanks, Mom.

455
00:25:03,665 --> 00:25:04,905
I wasn't going

456
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:06,065
to tell you this

457
00:25:06,865 --> 00:25:08,945
because I was afraid you might get upset

458
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:09,985
and hold it against us.

459
00:25:11,065 --> 00:25:11,985
Today,

460
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:14,345
I asked Jiaxu to come here

461
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:15,745
while you were away.

462
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:31,745
You mentioned

463
00:25:32,425 --> 00:25:35,145
that we would talk…

464
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:37,185
in person together.

465
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:38,585
Isn't that right?

466
00:25:40,145 --> 00:25:42,065
So what did you talk about

467
00:25:43,425 --> 00:25:45,065
while I was away?

468
00:25:46,385 --> 00:25:47,825
I told him the concerns

469
00:25:47,905 --> 00:25:50,225
that your mom and I were having.

470
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:52,025
What I told him

471
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:54,865
may have been hurtful in some ways.

472
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:57,145
But he said
that he would seriously consider

473
00:25:57,225 --> 00:25:58,065
your future together.

474
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,265
You might think

475
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:03,865
it's unnecessary
to think that far ahead right now.

476
00:26:04,825 --> 00:26:06,985
But if you want to be together
in the long run,

477
00:26:07,545 --> 00:26:09,025
I want you to think it through,

478
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,025
given his current family circumstances.

479
00:26:12,585 --> 00:26:14,345
If you think it's not the right fit,

480
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:16,865
it would be better to break up.

481
00:26:18,665 --> 00:26:19,585
Yes, Zhizhi.

482
00:26:20,185 --> 00:26:21,545
If you can't bring yourself

483
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:22,905
to tell Duan Jiaxu,

484
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:24,425
we can tell him on your behalf.

485
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,265
This…

486
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:49,025
I know you think I can't handle

487
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:52,105
the slightest challenge in life.

488
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:56,465
But he hasn't brought me any hardships.

489
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:03,065
And the thing is,

490
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:06,185
despite his family's circumstances

491
00:27:06,865 --> 00:27:08,385
and his bedridden dad,

492
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:10,825
I'm willing to face everything
with him together.

493
00:27:11,665 --> 00:27:12,905
I am willing to shoulder it.

494
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,545
Our relationship wasn't formed on a whim.

495
00:27:16,705 --> 00:27:18,985
We went through a lot of considerations.

496
00:27:21,065 --> 00:27:22,305
But can you please

497
00:27:23,265 --> 00:27:24,825
not hold a prejudice against him?

498
00:27:31,865 --> 00:27:34,785
What happened to his family
wasn't his choice.

499
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:38,585
He has suffered a lot of prejudices.

500
00:27:40,665 --> 00:27:41,985
I never imagined

501
00:27:43,505 --> 00:27:45,345
that you would…

502
00:27:48,665 --> 00:27:50,545
Your dad and I are just worried--

503
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,105
I'm tired.

504
00:27:52,185 --> 00:27:53,585
I'm going to my room.

505
00:27:58,265 --> 00:27:59,465
This…

506
00:28:22,145 --> 00:28:23,345
Xiaoduan.

507
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:24,945
You've always been good to Zhizhi.

508
00:28:25,025 --> 00:28:26,145
You've taken care of her.

509
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:28,065
Her mom and I are grateful for that.

510
00:28:28,585 --> 00:28:30,705
But if you want to be
in a relationship with her,

511
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:32,985
given the circumstances of your family,

512
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:34,985
her mom and I

513
00:28:36,305 --> 00:28:38,425
are indeed a bit concerned.

514
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:19,225
Why would they say those things to Jiaxu?

515
00:29:20,665 --> 00:29:22,785
He must feel a lot of pressure.

516
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,265
What should I say to him?

517
00:30:04,945 --> 00:30:05,985
Hello?

518
00:30:15,265 --> 00:30:16,145
Hello?

519
00:30:17,785 --> 00:30:18,865
Was it an accidental dial?

520
00:30:21,265 --> 00:30:22,105
No.

521
00:30:23,065 --> 00:30:23,985
What's wrong?

522
00:30:25,665 --> 00:30:27,865
Why aren't you saying anything?

523
00:30:31,385 --> 00:30:32,225
Sorry.

524
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,825
Whatever they said,

525
00:30:36,905 --> 00:30:39,225
don't take it to heart.

526
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:40,745
So

527
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:42,625
don't be upset.

528
00:30:48,065 --> 00:30:50,665
I'm not upset.

529
00:30:52,065 --> 00:30:54,225
Your parents didn't say anything hurtful.

530
00:30:54,305 --> 00:30:55,505
They were nice.

531
00:30:57,345 --> 00:30:58,305
But it's true.

532
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:01,145
They did express some of their concerns.

533
00:31:05,225 --> 00:31:06,585
What concerns?

534
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,865
They think I am too old.

535
00:31:08,945 --> 00:31:10,145
It will be embarrassing

536
00:31:10,225 --> 00:31:11,505
when we go out together.

537
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:14,625
Did you talk about this?

538
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:21,265
Stop joking around.

539
00:31:21,345 --> 00:31:22,785
I am serious.

540
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:24,305
It was nothing.

541
00:31:25,185 --> 00:31:27,785
Your dad told me a lot of things.

542
00:31:27,865 --> 00:31:30,665
I'm not sure which of them you mean.

543
00:31:32,425 --> 00:31:33,385
I mean

544
00:31:34,545 --> 00:31:37,145
the part where they told you
to reconsider.

545
00:31:46,385 --> 00:31:47,505
Well…

546
00:31:51,305 --> 00:31:53,265
Don't you have any questions for me?

547
00:31:54,865 --> 00:31:56,065
Or maybe

548
00:31:57,265 --> 00:31:59,025
is there something you would like to say?

549
00:32:03,425 --> 00:32:04,545
Sang Zhi.

550
00:32:06,065 --> 00:32:07,345
I'm just asking.

551
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,185
It doesn't matter anyway.

552
00:32:13,785 --> 00:32:15,225
I'm calling

553
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:17,505
because I want you to know

554
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:20,865
that you are great.

555
00:32:23,465 --> 00:32:24,465
As you know,

556
00:32:25,665 --> 00:32:27,745
they always think I am too young.

557
00:32:28,385 --> 00:32:30,185
That's why they are concerned.

558
00:32:32,065 --> 00:32:33,425
But thankfully, it's you.

559
00:32:35,345 --> 00:32:36,665
If it were anyone else,

560
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,985
they would have a lot more to say.

561
00:32:40,545 --> 00:32:41,425
I know.

562
00:32:42,825 --> 00:32:43,665
By the way,

563
00:32:44,305 --> 00:32:45,465
as I've told you,

564
00:32:45,545 --> 00:32:46,905
what happened to your family

565
00:32:46,985 --> 00:32:48,665
has nothing to do with you.

566
00:32:50,905 --> 00:32:52,105
Don't blame yourself.

567
00:32:53,545 --> 00:32:54,745
Besides,

568
00:32:54,825 --> 00:32:56,145
whatever happens to your dad,

569
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,945
we can shoulder it together.

570
00:32:58,625 --> 00:32:59,905
We can look after him together.

571
00:33:02,265 --> 00:33:03,905
I know all of that.

572
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,345
Don't say anything rash to them.

573
00:33:09,025 --> 00:33:10,745
You finally get to take a break.

574
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:12,225
Spend time with your parents.

575
00:33:12,905 --> 00:33:15,505
Do not let this matter affect your mood.

576
00:33:17,105 --> 00:33:17,985
All right.

577
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:19,385
Stop thinking about it.

578
00:33:19,945 --> 00:33:21,905
Go to sleep. Okay?

579
00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:25,185
-Okay.
-One more thing.

580
00:33:25,265 --> 00:33:27,385
I have to head back to Yihe

581
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:28,905
tomorrow morning.

582
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:30,585
Head back

583
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:32,305
to Yihe?

584
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,905
I just received a phone call.

585
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:37,465
I have to meet a client for work tomorrow,

586
00:33:37,545 --> 00:33:38,825
so I have to head back.

587
00:33:38,905 --> 00:33:39,745
Then

588
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:41,865
I'll go with you.

589
00:33:42,785 --> 00:33:44,865
Don't. The flight is tomorrow morning.

590
00:33:44,945 --> 00:33:45,865
It's very early.

591
00:33:46,345 --> 00:33:47,865
Stay home and sleep tight.

592
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:48,985
Let me see you off.

593
00:33:50,385 --> 00:33:51,785
You really don't have to.

594
00:33:52,345 --> 00:33:53,225
I'm a grown man.

595
00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:54,665
I can go to the airport on my own.

596
00:33:56,665 --> 00:33:57,825
All right.

597
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:59,545
Stop thinking about it. I mean it.

598
00:34:00,465 --> 00:34:02,265
Go to sleep. Okay?

599
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:06,505
Okay.

600
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:09,425
Good night.

601
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:14,264
Good night.

602
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:31,185
Why is he leaving all of a sudden?

603
00:34:34,025 --> 00:34:35,784
Is he avoiding me?

604
00:34:37,865 --> 00:34:39,945
Is he really considering

605
00:34:41,065 --> 00:34:42,385
breaking up with me?

606
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:48,545
What is on his mind?

607
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,385
Zhizhi, are you going out?

608
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:11,745
-Why is your suitcase--
-I'm heading back to Yihe.

609
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:14,305
Why are you going back all of a sudden?

610
00:35:15,185 --> 00:35:16,665
I'm going to talk to Jiaxu.

611
00:35:17,145 --> 00:35:18,385
I have something to tell him.

612
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:23,145
I already booked a plane ticket.

613
00:35:23,225 --> 00:35:24,105
Don't worry about me.

614
00:35:24,185 --> 00:35:25,185
Zhizhi.

615
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:28,065
Did what we said last night

616
00:35:28,145 --> 00:35:29,385
make you upset?

617
00:35:29,465 --> 00:35:30,385
Is that it?

618
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:32,865
No.

619
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,385
I understand your concerns.

620
00:35:35,465 --> 00:35:36,705
I know you mean well.

621
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:39,305
But I think…

622
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:43,465
I'm a grown-up now.

623
00:35:44,825 --> 00:35:46,025
I'm not a kid anymore.

624
00:35:46,585 --> 00:35:48,985
I am very sure of what I want.

625
00:35:51,145 --> 00:35:52,545
So I want to fight for it.

626
00:35:55,425 --> 00:35:56,305
Zhizhi.

627
00:35:57,425 --> 00:36:00,305
We are both very fond of Xiaoduan.

628
00:36:00,385 --> 00:36:02,265
But we have our concerns.

629
00:36:02,865 --> 00:36:04,385
Your dad and I have lived a long life.

630
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:07,185
We can see clearly

631
00:36:07,945 --> 00:36:10,345
about a lot of things
and people in this world.

632
00:36:10,425 --> 00:36:12,545
I know you don't trust Duan Jiaxu.

633
00:36:15,265 --> 00:36:17,385
But can you trust me for once?

634
00:36:27,025 --> 00:36:28,225
We'll drive you to the airport.

635
00:37:08,305 --> 00:37:09,465
Hello, Jiaxu.

636
00:37:09,545 --> 00:37:10,425
Zhizhi.

637
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,305
Your brother just told me

638
00:37:12,385 --> 00:37:13,585
that you're coming back today.

639
00:37:14,945 --> 00:37:17,705
Yes, I'm already at the airport.

640
00:37:17,785 --> 00:37:18,665
Okay.

641
00:37:19,145 --> 00:37:20,145
Wait there for me.

642
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:23,145
Okay.

643
00:37:38,185 --> 00:37:39,225
Sang Zhi.

644
00:37:39,305 --> 00:37:40,785
He did the right thing.

645
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,225
You're too young right now.

646
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:44,865
This isn't right. Got it?

647
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,225
But I will grow up.

648
00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:50,345
Then let's wait until you grow up.

649
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:51,585
But when I grow up,

650
00:37:51,665 --> 00:37:53,345
he'll fall for someone else.

651
00:38:05,025 --> 00:38:05,985
This time,

652
00:38:07,505 --> 00:38:08,945
I definitely won't cry.

653
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:14,785
Zhizhi.

654
00:38:18,105 --> 00:38:20,145
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming back?

655
00:38:25,745 --> 00:38:26,905
What's wrong?

656
00:38:29,345 --> 00:38:30,745
Do you remember

657
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,865
I came to Yihe when I was in 11th grade

658
00:38:38,225 --> 00:38:39,905
to meet up with my online crush?

659
00:38:43,505 --> 00:38:44,585
Actually,

660
00:38:45,225 --> 00:38:47,065
I didn't have an online crush.

661
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:51,745
I came to Yihe to see you.

662
00:39:01,225 --> 00:39:03,145
I heard from my brother

663
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:06,865
that you had a girlfriend.

664
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:10,625
That's why I came to Yihe.

665
00:39:13,345 --> 00:39:15,025
I wanted to see you.

666
00:39:19,905 --> 00:39:21,585
I didn't start liking you

667
00:39:21,665 --> 00:39:24,065
only after I came to Yihe for college.

668
00:39:25,985 --> 00:39:27,345
I lied to you.

669
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:31,785
I didn't want you to think…

670
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:34,705
To think that…

671
00:39:37,465 --> 00:39:38,585
What is it?

672
00:39:39,825 --> 00:39:41,585
That I was weird.

673
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:49,505
That…

674
00:39:56,745 --> 00:39:57,945
This is

675
00:39:58,945 --> 00:40:01,025
the secret I wrote when I was little.

676
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:02,545
It's inside.

677
00:40:24,345 --> 00:40:25,825
I have a secret.

678
00:40:26,345 --> 00:40:28,545
I don't want to admit it,

679
00:40:30,505 --> 00:40:31,625
but

680
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:32,905
I seem

681
00:40:32,985 --> 00:40:34,745
to have fallen for him.

682
00:40:35,425 --> 00:40:37,705
Duan Jiaxu.

683
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:41,265
Before I even knew how to spell your name,

684
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:46,745
I've already liked you.

685
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:48,585
DUAN JIAXU

686
00:40:48,665 --> 00:40:50,785
I've liked you for a very long time.

687
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:53,145
I HAVE A SECRET

688
00:40:53,225 --> 00:40:55,625
I DON'T WANT TO ADMIT IT,
BUT I SEEM TO HAVE FALLEN FOR HIM

689
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:56,865
DUAN JIAXU

690
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,425
Make a lot of money

691
00:41:08,505 --> 00:41:09,785
and help him pay off his debts.

692
00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:10,705
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY

693
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:11,985
AND HELP HIM PAY OFF HIS DEBTS.

694
00:41:25,105 --> 00:41:26,305
I am telling you

695
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:29,545
the secret I wanted to seal away forever.

696
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:31,785
Can you…

697
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:37,985
Can you believe

698
00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:39,785
that you are a great person?

699
00:41:42,905 --> 00:41:44,345
Seeing how much

700
00:41:45,145 --> 00:41:46,705
I like you,

701
00:41:48,345 --> 00:41:51,345
can you ignore what people say about you?

702
00:41:54,665 --> 00:41:57,025
Can you be with me forever?

703
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:04,985
Please?

704
00:42:26,705 --> 00:42:30,025
Are you referring
to the 118-square-meter unit?

705
00:42:30,785 --> 00:42:33,025
It's available for viewing
tomorrow morning, yes?

706
00:42:33,105 --> 00:42:34,305
Okay.

707
00:42:34,825 --> 00:42:36,425
I'll contact you then.

708
00:42:37,945 --> 00:42:39,185
Thank you.

709
00:42:55,185 --> 00:42:56,065
Hello?

710
00:42:56,145 --> 00:42:57,185
Hello? Where are you now?

711
00:42:57,665 --> 00:42:59,225
I'm on my way. I'll be there soon.

712
00:42:59,305 --> 00:43:00,785
How much longer, sir?

713
00:43:02,265 --> 00:43:03,145
Five minutes.

714
00:43:03,225 --> 00:43:04,545
As if I would believe you!

715
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,345
Sang Yan hasn't even picked you up yet!

716
00:43:06,905 --> 00:43:08,265
I'm here already.

717
00:43:08,345 --> 00:43:09,425
Just get here now!

718
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:10,425
Busted.

719
00:43:11,785 --> 00:43:12,945
Bye.

720
00:43:13,025 --> 00:43:13,865
Bye.
