ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

2
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:22,625
Here, let me help you.

3
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:08,265
Okay.

4
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:09,225
Sang…

5
00:04:18,145 --> 00:04:19,184
I guess

6
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:20,665
I'll take this one with me.

7
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:21,985
Okay.

8
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:23,345
Perfect. One for each of us.

9
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:27,225
Why don't we get something to eat?

10
00:04:30,865 --> 00:04:32,065
It's late.

11
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:34,065
Why don't we go back to campus?

12
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:37,065
Okay, let's go.

13
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:38,585
Okay.

14
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:44,665
I had fun today.

15
00:04:46,145 --> 00:04:47,065
Sang Zhi.

16
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,505
Do you want to get dinner at the canteen?

17
00:04:50,705 --> 00:04:52,465
I'll just order takeout.

18
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:53,425
You're back.

19
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:55,585
-Hi.
-Come on.

20
00:04:56,305 --> 00:04:58,265
We were just talking
about spending New Year's Eve

21
00:04:58,345 --> 00:04:59,825
at the Central Plaza.

22
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:02,305
Influencers recommend it.
We can get a lot of nice photos.

23
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,225
Central Plaza?

24
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:04,585
-Yes.
-It will be crowded.

25
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:06,425
Right? That's what I told her.

26
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:07,545
She wouldn't listen.

27
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,505
Then…

28
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:14,305
Why don't you join us, Jiang Ming?

29
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:15,345
It's New Year's Eve.

30
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:16,385
The more, the merrier.

31
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:17,345
Right?

32
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:18,265
Sure.

33
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:24,665
I have to go back to my dorm.

34
00:05:24,745 --> 00:05:25,585
You guys carry on.

35
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:26,505
Bye.

36
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,745
Did he win this for you

37
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:32,825
from the claw machine?

38
00:05:33,385 --> 00:05:34,705
I got this myself.

39
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:36,665
Well, what do you think about Jiang Ming?

40
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,465
I think he's a good guy.

41
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:41,665
He's handsome and nice.

42
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:43,585
That brother of yours
can't be much better.

43
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:54,185
Sangsang, I'll ask you one last time.

44
00:05:54,265 --> 00:05:55,825
Won't you spend New Year's Eve with us?

45
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:57,385
I am sure.

46
00:05:57,465 --> 00:05:58,585
It's cold outside.

47
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:00,065
But if you--

48
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:01,705
No more buts.

49
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:03,265
Sangsang already said no.

50
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:05,305
Besides, the place will be crowded.

51
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:07,545
We might see more heads than fireworks.

52
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,905
That's right. Weiwei.

53
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:10,345
You go ahead and enjoy yourself.

54
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:12,305
-Let's go.
-All right.

55
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:32,105
Wangwang.

56
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:37,025
Are you trying to compete with me?

57
00:06:37,825 --> 00:06:39,625
This won't do. I have to change my outfit.

58
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:41,985
No, Ning Wei. No need to change.

59
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:43,945
You are the prettiest.

60
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:45,865
You are the second prettiest.

61
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:46,865
Okay. Great. Let's go.

62
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:49,145
I think it's too short. I'll go change.

63
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:50,305
It's not short. It's fine.

64
00:06:50,385 --> 00:06:52,425
It's perfect for this occasion. Let's go.

65
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:54,385
-Let me get my coat.
-Okay.

66
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:55,745
Hurry.

67
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:56,905
-Sangsang.
-Let's go.

68
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:58,425
Remember to eat.

69
00:06:58,505 --> 00:06:59,905
I know. I'll order takeout.

70
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:01,745
We'll bring back tasty treats too.

71
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:03,745
Don't miss us too much.

72
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:05,105
Sangsang.

73
00:07:05,185 --> 00:07:06,665
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

74
00:07:07,465 --> 00:07:08,905
-We're off.
-Bye.

75
00:07:08,985 --> 00:07:10,705
-Bye.
-Bye. Remember to eat.

76
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:13,345
Be careful.

77
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:14,665
-Okay.
-There are a lot of people.

78
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:15,945
Okay. Bye.

79
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:34,985
There you are.

80
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:37,705
I want to give Weiwei a surprise,

81
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:40,465
but I don't want her to yell at me again.

82
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:43,025
Why? Just tell her.

83
00:07:43,105 --> 00:07:44,385
Last time, I ordered hot pot

84
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,905
and she yelled at me for three days.

85
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:48,145
It's fine. There's always a next time.

86
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:50,905
-Hello.
-Hi.

87
00:07:51,825 --> 00:07:52,985
Where's Weiwei?

88
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:53,985
Hey!

89
00:07:57,225 --> 00:07:59,305
-Hi.
-Hi.

90
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:01,065
You're not wearing glasses today.

91
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:03,425
What do you think?

92
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:05,385
Isn't she pretty without her glasses?

93
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:07,145
Yes.

94
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:10,465
Be more confident. Stand straight.

95
00:08:10,545 --> 00:08:12,025
Stop teasing me.

96
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:14,305
Enough. It will be really crowded today.

97
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,905
We won't get a spot if we don't go now.

98
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:17,225
-Let's go.
-Where's Sang Zhi?

99
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:18,505
Didn't she come with you guys?

100
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:19,505
No.

101
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:20,625
-She's not going.
-No.

102
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:22,345
Is she not coming?

103
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:24,025
Sangsang has never liked crowds.

104
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:25,945
She'll stay in and watch anime. Right?

105
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:27,305
-Yes.
-Yes.

106
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:28,705
So let's go.

107
00:08:28,785 --> 00:08:30,425
-We're going to be late!
-That's right.

108
00:08:30,505 --> 00:08:31,345
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

109
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:32,705
-Come on, Chen Qiang.
-Let's go.

110
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:34,664
Come on. Jiang Ming, let's go!

111
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:37,585
Okay, I'm the fifth wheel.

112
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:12,705
Jiaxu.

113
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:13,985
What are you doing?

114
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:16,465
Nothing.

115
00:09:17,745 --> 00:09:19,745
There's a company dinner tonight.

116
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,345
I can bring my family.

117
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:22,665
I'll bring you.

118
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:24,105
I'm not your family.

119
00:09:25,705 --> 00:09:27,065
I'll pass.

120
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:28,865
I'm about to eat the takeout I ordered.

121
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:30,465
Takeouts on New Year's Eve?

122
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,905
If you don't like crowds,

123
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:35,665
the two of us can have dinner.

124
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:41,265
I don't feel like going out.

125
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:44,465
You still owe me a meal.

126
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:45,585
Are you trying to back out?

127
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:49,385
I'll make a reservation right now.

128
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:51,105
You get ready to come out.

129
00:09:51,945 --> 00:09:53,665
-I--
-I'm almost at your university.

130
00:09:58,345 --> 00:09:59,505
I'll get changed.

131
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:02,825
Good. I'll call you when I get there.

132
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:16,705
CHAPTER 11, MOVED

133
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:18,625
IF THIS IS LOVE

134
00:10:31,385 --> 00:10:32,225
Try this.

135
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,985
Why didn't you go out with your roommates?

136
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:40,185
Do you guys not get along?

137
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:42,665
No.

138
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:45,865
We get along just fine.

139
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,265
But they're going to the Central Plaza

140
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:49,985
for the New Year's Eve countdown.

141
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:51,065
It's too crowded for me.

142
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:53,385
And Yihe is too cold.

143
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:54,425
I didn't want to go out.

144
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:56,785
But you said yes the minute I asked.

145
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:03,425
That's because…

146
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:06,945
That's because I owe you a meal.

147
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:08,785
If I didn't come,

148
00:11:08,865 --> 00:11:10,265
you would think I'm trying

149
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:11,905
to get out of treating you.

150
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:16,025
I was just kidding about that.

151
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:23,385
By the way,

152
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:25,865
I didn't mean

153
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:27,825
to tease you at the hospital.

154
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:34,985
So

155
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:39,305
I want to formally apologize to you today.

156
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:48,865
You don't have to do that.

157
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:50,705
It's not a big deal.

158
00:11:50,785 --> 00:11:52,585
Besides, that was a long time ago.

159
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:56,105
All right.

160
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:58,225
Eat more.

161
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,145
It's my treat.

162
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:01,345
Consider it my apology.

163
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:04,705
Didn't we agree that it is my treat?

164
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,185
I owe you a meal anyway.

165
00:12:07,745 --> 00:12:08,985
What do you mean?

166
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:12,345
Are you saying
that we don't have to meet again

167
00:12:12,425 --> 00:12:13,905
after this meal?

168
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:20,625
Have some sympathy
for this lonely old man.

169
00:12:21,185 --> 00:12:22,945
You won't even have a meal
with your brother.

170
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:27,945
Jiaxu.

171
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:31,105
Start digging in.

172
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:32,905
You're really talkative today.

173
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:37,265
It's not every day
that I get to have a meal with you.

174
00:12:37,345 --> 00:12:38,625
So what if I want to talk more?

175
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:41,825
Let's talk about you.

176
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:45,745
How are your classes?

177
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:48,105
Are you interested in them?

178
00:12:50,665 --> 00:12:51,865
The professor says

179
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:54,465
that freshmen don't have
many major courses.

180
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:57,265
But we will have many as sophomores.

181
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:01,065
Lame.

182
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,465
Let's sit here.

183
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:03,465
Okay, let's sit here.

184
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:12,585
That's what my professor said.

185
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:18,665
Why won't you answer my calls?

186
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,585
I've told you.

187
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:30,185
We don't need to stay in touch anymore.

188
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:33,945
Jiang Ying!

189
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:39,705
Who are you?

190
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,025
What's wrong with you?

191
00:13:41,105 --> 00:13:42,305
And what's wrong with you?

192
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:43,425
It's none of your business!

193
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:44,745
Do you know why I did that?

194
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,825
I don't care why.

195
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:49,065
Listen, if you had assaulted him,

196
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:50,465
I would've returned the favor.

197
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,225
Jiang Ying!

198
00:13:58,825 --> 00:14:00,025
What do you want, Jiang Ying?

199
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:02,985
Who is she, Duan Jiaxu?

200
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:04,705
Jiang Ying, don't! Let's go.

201
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:05,865
Sorry, miss. Please leave.

202
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,105
Do you think you're in the clear?

203
00:14:07,185 --> 00:14:09,865
Listen, you owe me
for the rest of your life!

204
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:11,905
-Please leave.
-Let's go.

205
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,785
-You think you don't owe me anymore?
-Leave!

206
00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:14,905
-Duan Jiaxu!
-Get out!

207
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,745
I will never let you off!

208
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:18,105
Let me go!

209
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:20,025
Jia…

210
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:22,465
Are you okay?

211
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:25,465
Let's leave, Jiaxu.

212
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:51,865
It's cold. Put your coat on.

213
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:26,865
So, Jiaxu.

214
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:29,025
Who is that woman?

215
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,265
Someone unimportant.

216
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,145
To be precise,

217
00:15:43,785 --> 00:15:45,665
I guess she's my dad's former creditor.

218
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:49,465
Wait!

219
00:15:49,985 --> 00:15:50,905
I'm going inside.

220
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:55,825
I ran into her once.

221
00:15:56,545 --> 00:15:57,625
Did you?

222
00:15:58,545 --> 00:15:59,745
When you were hospitalized,

223
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,385
I went to get your things at your place.

224
00:16:02,225 --> 00:16:03,705
We walked past each other.

225
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:05,385
Did she do anything to you?

226
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:13,705
So I guess

227
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,025
she was there

228
00:16:17,305 --> 00:16:18,465
to see you.

229
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:22,825
Does this happen every time she sees you?

230
00:16:25,505 --> 00:16:26,785
No.

231
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:40,745
Jiaxu.

232
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:43,545
As you said,

233
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,145
she's your dad's former creditor.

234
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:48,785
So it has nothing to do with you.

235
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:51,305
You shouldn't let her bully you.

236
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:54,985
I don't…

237
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:57,985
There's no way she can bully me.

238
00:17:04,505 --> 00:17:05,345
What's the matter?

239
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:17,265
I'm fine.

240
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:18,825
I don't need…

241
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:38,585
Does it hurt?

242
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:42,185
No.

243
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:06,985
I forgot to say this earlier.

244
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:13,305
Thank you, Sang Zhi.

245
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:14,745
I wish that all bad things

246
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:16,745
will stay away from Jiaxu.

247
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:19,985
I wish that someone could be with him.

248
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,785
I wish

249
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:23,785
that person is me.

250
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:34,945
Aren't you going to make a wish?

251
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,665
It's this year's first snowfall.

252
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:39,465
Yihe doesn't get snow often.

253
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:41,585
The last time it snowed

254
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:44,025
was when I was in tenth grade.

255
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,825
I guess

256
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:49,545
I'm quite lucky.

257
00:19:50,785 --> 00:19:51,865
I'm lucky too.

258
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:55,265
I get to see the snowfall with you.

259
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:04,545
A wish at the first snowfall

260
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,865
is said to come true.

261
00:20:16,985 --> 00:20:17,865
I wish

262
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,705
Sang Zhi will always be happy and healthy,

263
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:23,545
and so will I.

264
00:20:31,785 --> 00:20:33,225
What was your wish?

265
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:37,025
It won't come true if I say it out loud.

266
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:39,585
What did you wish for?

267
00:20:42,145 --> 00:20:43,985
It won't come true if I say it out loud.

268
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:15,505
I wish…

269
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:20,545
No, I can't let you guys hear it.

270
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:34,825
What did you guys wish for?

271
00:21:35,705 --> 00:21:37,105
Of course,

272
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,945
for us to be together forever.

273
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:43,505
Goodness, I wish

274
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:44,705
that I never have to listen

275
00:21:44,785 --> 00:21:46,105
to Ning Wei's mushy lines anymore.

276
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:47,625
If you're so jealous,

277
00:21:48,985 --> 00:21:50,745
you should get a boyfriend too.

278
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:51,665
That's right.

279
00:21:54,505 --> 00:21:55,545
Wangwang.

280
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,785
What did you wish for?

281
00:21:57,505 --> 00:21:58,385
Me?

282
00:21:59,265 --> 00:22:00,305
I…

283
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:03,105
There isn't anything I really want.

284
00:22:03,185 --> 00:22:04,985
There isn't?

285
00:22:05,065 --> 00:22:07,065
This is the first snow in Yihe in years.

286
00:22:07,145 --> 00:22:08,665
But you don't have any wishes!

287
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:10,625
You watch romance dramas, right?

288
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:12,865
They always say

289
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:14,265
that wishes at the first snowfall

290
00:22:14,345 --> 00:22:15,265
will come true.

291
00:22:17,065 --> 00:22:17,945
Really?

292
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:18,985
Of course.

293
00:22:19,065 --> 00:22:20,465
That's nonsense.

294
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:22,585
The first snow calls
for beer and barbecue.

295
00:22:22,665 --> 00:22:23,905
Don't stand around. Come on.

296
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:25,745
Good grief!

297
00:22:25,825 --> 00:22:27,425
She doesn't have a single romantic bone.

298
00:22:27,505 --> 00:22:29,385
You're single by your own virtue, Yu Xin.

299
00:22:29,465 --> 00:22:32,305
-Let's do it. Who will do it?
-Look, my boyfriend barbecues for me.

300
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:33,505
Please!

301
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,225
Let this year be over already.

302
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:44,625
Jiang Ming.

303
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:47,585
What did you wish for?

304
00:22:47,665 --> 00:22:48,785
Me?

305
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:52,745
It's all right.

306
00:22:52,825 --> 00:22:54,345
You don't have to tell me

307
00:22:54,425 --> 00:22:55,345
if you don't want to.

308
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:56,785
It's no big deal.

309
00:22:57,665 --> 00:22:59,465
I wished that the person I like

310
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,665
would make a wish today

311
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:03,225
and that her wish would come true.

312
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,825
The person you like is really lucky.

313
00:23:13,545 --> 00:23:14,465
The meat is done!

314
00:23:14,545 --> 00:23:15,745
Do you guys want some or not?

315
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:18,065
-Coming!
-Hurry!

316
00:23:18,145 --> 00:23:19,305
Let's head over.

317
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:44,385
Jiaxu, I'm sorry.

318
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:45,705
I was too impulsive today.

319
00:23:45,785 --> 00:23:47,265
Tell your friend that I apologize.

320
00:23:47,345 --> 00:23:48,225
I'm sorry.

321
00:23:49,985 --> 00:23:51,025
What's the point of this?

322
00:23:51,585 --> 00:23:53,465
Sorry, I won't do it again.

323
00:23:54,145 --> 00:23:55,225
Please move.

324
00:23:55,305 --> 00:23:57,265
I said I'm sorry, Duan Jiaxu!

325
00:23:57,345 --> 00:23:58,585
I already told you

326
00:23:59,065 --> 00:24:00,545
not to contact me anymore.

327
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:04,025
So you're cutting me off
after paying off the debt?

328
00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:05,385
What gives?

329
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:07,025
Don't you know that you owe me,

330
00:24:07,105 --> 00:24:08,345
Duan Jiaxu?

331
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:09,825
What do I owe you? Tell me.

332
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:11,385
Your dad killed my dad!

333
00:24:11,465 --> 00:24:12,385
You owe me!

334
00:24:12,465 --> 00:24:14,105
You know what you owe me!

335
00:24:17,985 --> 00:24:19,505
You just owe me.

336
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:23,065
I've repaid what I should.

337
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:26,385
My dad paid the price too.

338
00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:29,105
I don't owe you anything else.

339
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:31,545
Duan Jiaxu!

340
00:24:34,225 --> 00:24:35,905
Duan Jiaxu!

341
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:39,065
Don't forget what your mom promised us!

342
00:24:39,665 --> 00:24:42,705
She said you would always take care of me!

343
00:25:35,945 --> 00:25:37,825
Leave! You're not welcome here!

344
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:38,745
Sorry, Mrs. Jiang!

345
00:25:38,825 --> 00:25:40,225
Get out. Leave.

346
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,185
Leave now!

347
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:42,825
-I'm sorry, Mrs. Jiang!
-Get out!

348
00:25:42,905 --> 00:25:44,265
-Mrs. Jiang.
-Why are you here?

349
00:25:44,345 --> 00:25:45,425
I'm sorry.

350
00:25:45,505 --> 00:25:47,585
He's dead! What's the use of these things?

351
00:25:47,665 --> 00:25:50,305
You destroyed my sister's family!

352
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:51,585
Sorry.

353
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:53,345
It's our fault.

354
00:25:53,425 --> 00:25:54,945
What is the use of saying sorry?

355
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:57,665
Will that bring Xiaoying's dad back?

356
00:25:57,745 --> 00:26:00,145
What will Xiaoying and her mom do now?

357
00:26:03,585 --> 00:26:04,945
I want my dad.

358
00:26:07,585 --> 00:26:09,785
I just want my dad.

359
00:26:11,425 --> 00:26:12,345
Xiaoying.

360
00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:14,225
I'm sorry, Xiaoying!

361
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:15,465
Mom!

362
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:16,785
Mom, what are you doing?

363
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:18,505
We've done you wrong.

364
00:26:21,225 --> 00:26:22,145
Rest assured.

365
00:26:23,185 --> 00:26:25,225
-Mom.
-We will take responsibility.

366
00:26:25,305 --> 00:26:27,625
We will pay the compensation
decided by the court.

367
00:26:27,705 --> 00:26:29,065
Even if we have to sell our house,

368
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:29,985
take out a loan,

369
00:26:30,065 --> 00:26:31,225
or borrow money,

370
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:32,665
no matter what,

371
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:36,745
we will pay you on time.

372
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:39,305
My son and I

373
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,745
will look after you and your daughter

374
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,225
for life as well.

375
00:26:44,865 --> 00:26:48,505
SORRY

376
00:27:27,425 --> 00:27:28,665
Jiang Ying.

377
00:27:29,265 --> 00:27:31,265
You've been away from school for a while.

378
00:27:31,825 --> 00:27:33,585
You can ask me if you need help.

379
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:41,985
Did you know that Jiang Ying's dad died?

380
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:43,585
I've heard.

381
00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:46,945
Apparently, Duan Jiaxu's dad ran him over.

382
00:27:47,025 --> 00:27:48,825
-Seriously?
-Yes.

383
00:27:48,905 --> 00:27:50,145
What are you guys talking about?

384
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:52,785
Duan Jiaxu's dad ran over

385
00:27:52,865 --> 00:27:54,305
and killed Jiang Ying's dad.

386
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:55,705
He was still alive at the time.

387
00:27:56,225 --> 00:27:57,825
He died after Jiaxu's dad fled the scene.

388
00:27:58,465 --> 00:28:00,705
Doesn't that make him a murderer's son?

389
00:28:00,785 --> 00:28:01,665
That's right.

390
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:12,425
Doesn't that make him a murderer's son?

391
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,385
How can he still come to school?

392
00:28:15,465 --> 00:28:16,465
If I were him,

393
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:17,905
I wouldn't dare to show my face.

394
00:28:57,385 --> 00:28:58,505
I'm sorry, Mom.

395
00:29:02,545 --> 00:29:03,585
I can't do it.

396
00:29:18,905 --> 00:29:20,145
Jiaxu.

397
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,825
As you said,

398
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,265
she's your dad's former creditor.

399
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:27,025
So it has nothing to do with you.

400
00:29:27,785 --> 00:29:29,305
You shouldn't let her bully you.

401
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:33,985
Sang Zhi,

402
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:35,905
thank you.

403
00:31:16,545 --> 00:31:19,625
SANG ZHI

404
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:22,065
Happy New Year, Jiaxu.

405
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:23,385
May you be happy every day.

406
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:27,265
BROTHER NO. 2

407
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:28,305
Happy New Year.

408
00:31:35,265 --> 00:31:36,465
I'm watching the fireworks.

409
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:38,505
What about you?

410
00:31:45,665 --> 00:31:47,625
BROTHER NO. 2

411
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:48,985
Me too.

412
00:31:49,705 --> 00:31:50,745
They're beautiful.

413
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:14,865
EDIT CONTACT DETAILS

414
00:32:14,945 --> 00:32:15,945
SANG ZHI

415
00:32:17,905 --> 00:32:21,225
ZHIZHI

416
00:32:21,305 --> 00:32:22,465
So, Jiaxu.

417
00:32:23,505 --> 00:32:24,825
Who is that woman?

418
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:27,665
What do I owe you? Tell me.

419
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,185
Your dad killed my dad!

420
00:32:29,265 --> 00:32:30,225
You owe me!

421
00:32:30,305 --> 00:32:32,185
You know what you owe me!

422
00:32:34,145 --> 00:32:36,345
Your voice sounds young,

423
00:32:36,425 --> 00:32:38,025
but you can't fool anyone.

424
00:32:38,105 --> 00:32:39,665
You're not young anymore.

425
00:32:39,745 --> 00:32:41,225
He is not my partner.

426
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:43,745
He is too old.

427
00:32:43,825 --> 00:32:45,265
He is old enough to be my dad.

428
00:32:50,945 --> 00:32:52,745
SAVE CHANGES?

429
00:32:52,825 --> 00:32:53,705
SAVE

430
00:33:26,225 --> 00:33:27,825
DON'T SIT FOR TOO LONG

431
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,465
GET UP AND MOVE, BYE

432
00:33:40,945 --> 00:33:41,865
DON'T SIT FOR TOO LONG,
GET UP AND MOVE, BYE

433
00:33:53,585 --> 00:33:54,945
Let me tell you guys something.

434
00:33:55,025 --> 00:33:56,625
I am getting married!

435
00:33:57,185 --> 00:33:59,185
I'm getting hitched!

436
00:33:59,265 --> 00:34:01,185
QIAN FEI

437
00:34:01,265 --> 00:34:02,545
I bet you're pissed!

438
00:34:03,985 --> 00:34:04,865
What's up?

439
00:34:04,945 --> 00:34:06,145
Are you all asleep?

440
00:34:06,665 --> 00:34:08,545
Why are you ignoring me
when I'm so excited?

441
00:34:09,905 --> 00:34:10,905
Not yet.

442
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:17,585
DUAN JIAXU

443
00:34:20,264 --> 00:34:21,105
Well?

444
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:22,065
You're still up?

445
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:23,865
What? Did you miss me?

446
00:34:24,905 --> 00:34:25,784
I'm hanging up.

447
00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:27,105
Don't!

448
00:34:27,185 --> 00:34:29,025
If you're still up, chat with me.

449
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:30,425
Guess what? I proposed today.

450
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:31,625
Do you know how I proposed?

451
00:34:31,705 --> 00:34:33,264
When I saw her home today,

452
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,744
I told her I was thirsty

453
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:36,665
and to get me a bottle of water
from the trunk,

454
00:34:36,744 --> 00:34:37,985
so she did.

455
00:34:38,065 --> 00:34:39,185
The minute she opened it,

456
00:34:39,264 --> 00:34:40,425
she saw it filled with roses.

457
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:42,065
I went up to her and said,

458
00:34:42,145 --> 00:34:43,665
"Will you be my wife?"

459
00:34:43,744 --> 00:34:44,784
Guess what she said?

460
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:47,145
She said, "Won't that make me Mrs. Qian?"

461
00:34:47,225 --> 00:34:48,625
Isn't she cute?

462
00:34:49,744 --> 00:34:51,225
Nice.

463
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,304
But I'm sad to hear

464
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:55,784
that you're getting married.

465
00:34:56,465 --> 00:34:59,105
You always said
you were going to stay single with me.

466
00:34:59,185 --> 00:35:01,385
I only said that to make you feel better.

467
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:02,545
Did you take it seriously?

468
00:35:05,425 --> 00:35:06,265
All right.

469
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:08,265
Congratulations, buddy.

470
00:35:10,345 --> 00:35:12,505
Enough about me. What about you?

471
00:35:12,585 --> 00:35:15,425
Didn't you say
you were going on a blind date?

472
00:35:15,505 --> 00:35:16,665
Did you?

473
00:35:16,745 --> 00:35:18,785
What blind date? No way.

474
00:35:20,465 --> 00:35:21,985
Has anyone caught your eye?

475
00:35:22,065 --> 00:35:23,465
You must have feelings for someone.

476
00:35:36,105 --> 00:35:37,105
Jiaxu.

477
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:39,025
I think I've caught a trace of something

478
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:41,345
from your few seconds of silence.

479
00:35:41,425 --> 00:35:42,665
What's going on?

480
00:35:42,745 --> 00:35:44,185
Who is it?

481
00:35:44,265 --> 00:35:45,545
What do you…

482
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,665
Tell me.

483
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:47,985
Have you calmed down yet?

484
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:49,065
Hurry up and go to sleep.

485
00:35:49,145 --> 00:35:50,465
You're about to be a married man.

486
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:52,225
-No, tell me who it is.
-I'm hanging up.

487
00:36:02,985 --> 00:36:04,825
What am I thinking?

488
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:15,785
NO MILK OR EGGS

489
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:18,785
Kiddo.

490
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:24,785
CLEAR AMBITIONS, LEARNING,
SELF-CULTIVATION, AND DILIGENCE

491
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:27,665
Weiwei, what did you buy?

492
00:36:27,745 --> 00:36:28,745
That's a huge box.

493
00:36:28,825 --> 00:36:29,905
Two pairs of shoes.

494
00:36:29,985 --> 00:36:31,185
They were on sale.

495
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:32,505
I couldn't help it.

496
00:36:32,585 --> 00:36:34,105
-Jiaxu.
-What did you buy?

497
00:36:34,185 --> 00:36:35,745
-I have something for you.
-Stationery.

498
00:36:35,825 --> 00:36:36,745
Stationery?

499
00:36:36,825 --> 00:36:38,425
-I'll come to your office.
-How boring!

500
00:36:38,505 --> 00:36:39,745
Why buy stationery?

501
00:36:42,225 --> 00:36:43,665
-Weiwei.
-What did you buy, Sangsang?

502
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:44,625
I bought…

503
00:36:45,665 --> 00:36:46,545
Chen Qiang.

504
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:48,425
-Do you need help? I'll get that.
-I've got it.

505
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:49,985
You have a class later. I'll manage.

506
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:51,185
It's fine.

507
00:36:51,265 --> 00:36:52,505
Let's go eat after my class.

508
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,665
Sure.

509
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:56,825
Sang Zhi.

510
00:36:56,905 --> 00:36:58,785
You weren't there on New Year's Eve.

511
00:36:58,865 --> 00:37:00,385
Are you free this weekend?

512
00:37:00,465 --> 00:37:01,945
Let's decompress.

513
00:37:03,785 --> 00:37:05,065
But exams are around the corner.

514
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:07,065
Maybe after we finish our exams.

515
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:08,425
Exams?

516
00:37:09,225 --> 00:37:10,305
That's right.

517
00:37:10,385 --> 00:37:12,145
I have a friend who just opened up a bar.

518
00:37:12,225 --> 00:37:15,345
Why don't we all go there to celebrate
after our exams?

519
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:17,665
Let's talk about that after our exams.

520
00:37:17,745 --> 00:37:18,945
What should we eat for dinner?

521
00:37:19,665 --> 00:37:20,745
That's right!

522
00:37:20,825 --> 00:37:22,585
I heard a new place opened up.

523
00:37:22,665 --> 00:37:23,505
Let's try it.

524
00:37:23,585 --> 00:37:24,545
I heard it's good.

525
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:25,705
Tonight?

526
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,625
You guys try it first.

527
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:29,065
I'll pass tonight.

528
00:37:29,145 --> 00:37:30,345
Where are you going?

529
00:37:31,025 --> 00:37:33,665
I'm going to deliver a peephole camera

530
00:37:33,745 --> 00:37:34,585
to my relative.

531
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:36,825
All right.

532
00:37:36,905 --> 00:37:38,385
I'll be leaving now.

533
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:39,625
-Bye.
-Bye.

534
00:37:40,185 --> 00:37:41,705
Be careful. Come back early.

535
00:37:41,785 --> 00:37:42,825
Stay safe.

536
00:37:43,905 --> 00:37:45,625
For NPC feedback,

537
00:37:45,705 --> 00:37:47,585
if we program it this way,

538
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,225
every time the player runs into them,

539
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:51,945
it will trigger many event detections.

540
00:37:52,545 --> 00:37:54,545
If so, phones with lower specs

541
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:55,745
won't be able to process it

542
00:37:55,825 --> 00:37:57,065
and will lag.

543
00:37:57,145 --> 00:37:58,665
Can I write it with C instead?

544
00:37:59,545 --> 00:38:01,385
Stop it with the C.

545
00:38:01,465 --> 00:38:03,225
JAVA is the best.

546
00:38:05,105 --> 00:38:07,505
It's fine. It's not a huge issue.

547
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:08,825
We've had a long day.

548
00:38:08,905 --> 00:38:09,985
Let's end this meeting here.

549
00:38:10,065 --> 00:38:11,585
-Good work, Jiaxu.
-Good work.

550
00:38:12,185 --> 00:38:13,105
Let's go.

551
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:15,825
It's tough.

552
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:22,385
Clean up after yourself.

553
00:38:33,465 --> 00:38:35,945
ARE YOU BUSY? I CAN LEAVE IT
AT YOUR BUILDING'S RECEPTION DESK.

554
00:38:39,825 --> 00:38:41,105
Where are you?

555
00:38:45,065 --> 00:38:45,985
What should we do?

556
00:38:46,065 --> 00:38:47,185
Go downstairs and stop her.

557
00:38:47,265 --> 00:38:48,785
-Okay.
-Xiaoduan.

558
00:38:49,585 --> 00:38:50,465
Come here.

559
00:38:53,025 --> 00:38:53,865
What's the matter?

560
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:56,025
Jiang Ying is making a scene
again downstairs.

561
00:38:56,105 --> 00:38:57,745
I asked security to stop her.

562
00:38:57,825 --> 00:38:58,865
It should be fine.

563
00:39:26,705 --> 00:39:27,825
You cannot enter.

564
00:39:27,905 --> 00:39:29,225
Hold on. Wait at the entrance.

565
00:39:29,305 --> 00:39:31,185
-Listen! I'm looking for Duan Jiaxu!
-Wait.

566
00:39:31,265 --> 00:39:33,185
-He works here.
-I know what you're saying, miss.

567
00:39:33,265 --> 00:39:34,385
But you cannot enter yet.

568
00:39:34,465 --> 00:39:35,945
-I'm his friend.
-I'll help you.

569
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:37,185
We'll let him know now.

570
00:39:37,265 --> 00:39:39,305
-If he gives permission--
-I just need to talk to him.

571
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:41,145
Please wait here. Calm down.

572
00:39:41,225 --> 00:39:42,345
My colleague has--

573
00:39:42,425 --> 00:39:44,145
-Wait. You can't go inside.
-It's important!

574
00:39:44,225 --> 00:39:46,265
You can't enter. I know what you mean.

575
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:48,025
-Please!
-Miss, you can't just enter.

576
00:39:48,105 --> 00:39:50,185
-Wait. You can't enter.
-I just need to say something.

577
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:51,905
We're working. You cannot just go inside.

578
00:39:51,985 --> 00:39:52,945
-Please.
-Jiaxu.

579
00:39:53,025 --> 00:39:54,105
You cannot go inside.

580
00:39:54,745 --> 00:39:55,665
I'm his friend.

581
00:39:55,745 --> 00:39:57,345
My superior said we can't let you in.

582
00:39:57,425 --> 00:39:58,465
-Come.
-He must be upstairs.

583
00:39:58,545 --> 00:39:59,625
Mr. Duan isn't inside.

584
00:40:00,985 --> 00:40:02,425
Don't push me!

585
00:40:06,425 --> 00:40:07,585
Why didn't you pick up?

586
00:40:09,265 --> 00:40:11,145
Sorry, my phone ran out of battery.

587
00:40:11,225 --> 00:40:12,625
I forgot to charge it last night.

588
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:14,145
Why didn't you tell me you were here?

589
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:16,425
I did.

590
00:40:17,185 --> 00:40:19,065
I sent you a message. Didn't you see it?

591
00:40:19,145 --> 00:40:20,465
I was busy. I missed it.

592
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,265
It's okay.

593
00:40:22,825 --> 00:40:23,665
Sang Zhi.

594
00:40:24,425 --> 00:40:27,065
Don't come straight to my office
or my place anymore.

595
00:40:27,145 --> 00:40:28,905
If you do, let me know beforehand, okay?

596
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:36,705
Have you eaten?

597
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:46,305
I wanted to give you this.

598
00:40:48,505 --> 00:40:49,625
A peephole camera.

599
00:40:50,425 --> 00:40:52,785
That woman keeps harassing you.

600
00:40:53,945 --> 00:40:56,025
You can install this on your door.

601
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:57,425
It can connect to your phone.

602
00:40:57,505 --> 00:40:58,745
It's a smart camera.

603
00:40:58,825 --> 00:41:01,705
You can use it to call the police too.

604
00:41:01,785 --> 00:41:03,945
It will come in handy.

605
00:41:04,705 --> 00:41:06,265
That's all.

606
00:41:06,345 --> 00:41:07,505
Thank you.

607
00:41:08,105 --> 00:41:09,625
Go back to work.

608
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:10,825
I'm going back to class.

609
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,265
That woman keeps harassing you.

610
00:42:58,345 --> 00:42:59,185
SMART DOORBELL

611
00:42:59,265 --> 00:43:00,945
You can install this on your door.

612
00:43:01,785 --> 00:43:03,945
It will come in handy.
