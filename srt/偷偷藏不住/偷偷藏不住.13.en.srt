ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

2
00:01:51,385 --> 00:01:53,465
I don't usually drink much.

3
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:55,145
-So--
-Who did you go with?

4
00:01:58,145 --> 00:01:59,425
My roommates.

5
00:01:59,505 --> 00:02:00,905
They were all people I know.

6
00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:02,025
Roommates?

7
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:04,385
What about the guy who came out
with you yesterday?

8
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:05,905
The one who is 195 cm tall

9
00:02:06,705 --> 00:02:08,025
and just gave you a hamburger.

10
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:10,465
Is he also your roommate?

11
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:13,865
No, that is my roommate's
boyfriend's friend.

12
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:16,785
Is that him?

13
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:20,665
What do you mean?

14
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:23,065
The guy you like.

15
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:24,785
Is it him?

16
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,505
Is he?

17
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:36,145
No.

18
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:38,265
No?

19
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:40,185
So tell me.

20
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:42,145
If that isn't your type, what is?

21
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:43,105
I don't want to.

22
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:50,985
Jiaxu.

23
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:53,465
-The bubble--
-Is it a guy who is cute

24
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:56,305
and delicate-looking?

25
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,505
No.

26
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:03,305
He…

27
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:05,905
He's manly.

28
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:08,665
Manly?

29
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,465
So…

30
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:14,865
You like

31
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:17,345
muscular guys.

32
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:20,705
Is that it?

33
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:24,305
No.

34
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,025
No muscles but is manly.

35
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:30,465
Also, he's nice to everyone.

36
00:03:30,985 --> 00:03:32,545
But the guy you described

37
00:03:33,105 --> 00:03:34,945
sounds like a jerk.

38
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:36,025
He's not a jerk.

39
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:37,785
-He is.
-He isn't.

40
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:41,025
You're so nosy.

41
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:42,145
I'm nosy?

42
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:45,265
I've never met a guy like that in my life.

43
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:47,425
-Gosh.
-I'm just curious.

44
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:48,545
You're so nosy.

45
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,745
Can you stop asking?

46
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:51,305
Fine.

47
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:52,745
I won't ask anymore.

48
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:55,545
If you're curious,

49
00:03:56,265 --> 00:03:58,265
just look in the mirror.

50
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:05,985
Jiaxu.

51
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:08,545
Yes?

52
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,545
You…

53
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:12,905
You're in your twenties now.

54
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:14,625
Why don't you get a girlfriend

55
00:04:15,105 --> 00:04:16,184
instead of bothering me--

56
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:17,624
Where would I get a girlfriend?

57
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:19,184
Why don't you

58
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:22,305
introduce one to me?

59
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:25,545
That won't do.

60
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:28,025
I only know girls around my age.

61
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:30,385
Around your age?

62
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:35,825
I'm fine with that.

63
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:44,585
What do you mean?

64
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:46,705
The literal meaning.

65
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:56,705
Is he teasing me?

66
00:04:58,305 --> 00:05:01,305
He has never said
something like this to me before.

67
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,865
Pull over.

68
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:31,185
Mom!

69
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,425
Zhizhi.

70
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:34,865
Zhizhi.

71
00:05:34,945 --> 00:05:35,785
Zhizhi!

72
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:40,425
I've missed you so much.

73
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:41,465
You're finally home.

74
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:43,305
What took so long? Was the flight delayed?

75
00:05:43,785 --> 00:05:44,945
No.

76
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:46,385
It was Sang Yan.

77
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:48,945
Sang Yan made me wait
at the airport for so long.

78
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:50,225
Why?

79
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:51,945
Why did you make Zhizhi wait?

80
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:53,545
No, Mom. You told me to buy

81
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,585
her favorite crispy taro-crusted duck.

82
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:57,105
-Yes.
-I was in line for half an hour.

83
00:05:57,185 --> 00:05:58,465
You should've gone earlier.

84
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:00,625
-That's right.
-You made her wait alone.

85
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:01,625
That was so dangerous.

86
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:03,825
My sweetheart. You've lost weight.

87
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,865
I haven't.

88
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:06,545
I made your favorite dish. What is it?

89
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,905
-Steamed fish.
-Not only that.

90
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:09,465
-I bought strawberries.
-Strawberries?

91
00:06:09,545 --> 00:06:10,585
Big strawberries!

92
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:13,065
-White strawberries.
-Bring the luggage in.

93
00:06:13,145 --> 00:06:14,545
-I…
-Bring it all in.

94
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,065
When the little princess comes home,

95
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,305
I'm just a helper.

96
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,545
The door!

97
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:32,505
The little princess is home.

98
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:40,905
Mom.

99
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,025
Your New Year's gift.

100
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:44,065
You bought it for me?

101
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:46,265
You'll like it. Open it.

102
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:48,145
Careful, this is hot.

103
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:50,025
Is this it?

104
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:51,065
Yes.

105
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:52,145
And this too.

106
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:53,305
You bought two.

107
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:55,065
I saved up for a long while.

108
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:56,065
Thank you so much.

109
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,945
Dad, this is your New Year's gift.

110
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:01,945
-Thank you.
-It's hand cream.

111
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:04,145
Use it when you go to construction sites.

112
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:06,465
Then your hands
won't get chapped during winter.

113
00:07:06,545 --> 00:07:07,625
Thank you, Zhizhi.

114
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:09,745
-Good girl.
-She is so considerate.

115
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:11,585
-I've grown up.
-Only she would think of this.

116
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:12,825
I've become mature.

117
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:14,225
Thank you.

118
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:15,185
Don't worry about me.

119
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:17,385
-Don't worry.
-You give her too much allowance.

120
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:18,945
Stop funding her next semester.

121
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:20,385
Where is mine?

122
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,225
That's more like it.

123
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:25,265
It looks great.

124
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,065
-Really?
-Super cool.

125
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:28,585
Mom, look at him.

126
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:29,545
Isn't it?

127
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:32,265
-What's wrong?
-What is this? I don't want it. Take it.

128
00:07:32,345 --> 00:07:33,905
Why not?

129
00:07:33,985 --> 00:07:36,145
-It looks ugly.
-It's not.

130
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:37,945
I don't like it!

131
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:39,585
Dad, does this look good to you?

132
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:40,505
It's stupid.

133
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:43,025
It's nice.

134
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:45,145
I know you have a fine taste.

135
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:48,785
Asymmetric glasses are trendy this year.

136
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:50,585
-Don't you like it?
-No, I don't.

137
00:07:50,665 --> 00:07:52,625
-No?
-No.

138
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:53,745
-No?
-No!

139
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:54,665
Say you like it!

140
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:56,905
I like it!

141
00:07:56,985 --> 00:07:58,265
Say you like it wholeheartedly.

142
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,185
I wholeheartedly don't like it!

143
00:08:00,265 --> 00:08:03,025
-Then don't wear it.
-That's enough. I love this liveliness.

144
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:04,345
Eat this.

145
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:05,945
-Sit.
-Doesn't it taste good?

146
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:10,105
Little demon.

147
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:11,185
Let me tell you.

148
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:13,265
I waited in line for half an hour

149
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:15,505
to buy this crispy taro-crusted duck.

150
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:17,705
You had better eat it and…

151
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:19,225
Thank you, Sang Yan.

152
00:08:19,305 --> 00:08:20,945
Give my glasses back to me.

153
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:22,785
I'll take them since they're free.

154
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,465
Does it taste good?

155
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:36,105
Zhizhi.

156
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:38,264
Last time, you told me

157
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:39,745
that Xiaoduan had appendicitis.

158
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:41,385
How is he now?

159
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:43,585
He has recovered well.

160
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:46,745
The doctor said it was caused
by irregular meal timings.

161
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:48,305
He didn't eat properly.

162
00:08:48,385 --> 00:08:49,385
So you heard that too.

163
00:08:49,465 --> 00:08:50,385
You mustn't skip meals.

164
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:53,505
He had a tough life before.

165
00:08:53,585 --> 00:08:54,545
He was often working.

166
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,905
That probably impacted his health.

167
00:08:56,985 --> 00:08:58,105
How is he doing at work now?

168
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:01,465
Pretty well.

169
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:04,065
Many of my classmates know
about the game he designed.

170
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:05,705
It's very popular.

171
00:09:05,785 --> 00:09:06,905
That's good to hear.

172
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:08,665
The boy is pretty good.

173
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:12,465
Look at Sang Yan. He looks dumb.

174
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:19,385
Listen, Sang Yan.

175
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:20,505
Look at Xiaoduan,

176
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:21,465
then look at yourself.

177
00:09:22,705 --> 00:09:25,185
I set up a meeting for you
and Mrs. Zhang's daughter.

178
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,745
She waited for you all afternoon
and you didn't show up.

179
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:30,545
I told you.

180
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,865
I wouldn't go.

181
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:34,185
I set it up for you. Why didn't you go?

182
00:09:34,265 --> 00:09:36,465
You should've turned up out of courtesy

183
00:09:36,545 --> 00:09:37,905
and met with her.

184
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:39,545
Dad, Mom.

185
00:09:40,185 --> 00:09:42,105
Do I look like I need that?

186
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:44,425
Absolutely not.

187
00:09:44,505 --> 00:09:45,945
So stop setting up meetings.

188
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:47,385
I won't go.

189
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:49,465
Was it a blind date?

190
00:09:52,065 --> 00:09:52,985
Fine.

191
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:55,905
I've poked my meddling nose.

192
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,025
You're always doing nothing all day.

193
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:00,905
I thought you would have time for tea.

194
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:04,865
I didn't know you were so busy.

195
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:07,105
That was close.

196
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:10,305
You're so stubborn.

197
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:11,545
You'll end up old and alone.

198
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:16,425
Enough. Don't waste the strawberries.

199
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:18,465
I find that we've lost our dynamic.

200
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:19,625
I'll toss one. Open wide.

201
00:10:20,585 --> 00:10:21,745
Don't waste the strawberries.

202
00:10:22,785 --> 00:10:25,145
-Zhizhi, this steamed fish is for you.
-I'll toss the bowl.

203
00:10:25,785 --> 00:10:27,745
Zhizhi, I made this steamed fish for you.

204
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:29,225
Hurry and eat.

205
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:30,345
Come on. It will get cold.

206
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:31,345
-Okay.
-Hurry and eat.

207
00:10:31,425 --> 00:10:32,265
Come on.

208
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:44,305
I don't need this. Put it back.

209
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:45,665
I don't need this!

210
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,305
Are you trying to kill me?

211
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,785
Put it away.

212
00:10:58,905 --> 00:10:59,785
What's wrong with you?

213
00:11:00,705 --> 00:11:01,705
You must want something.

214
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:09,865
Are you going on blind dates?

215
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:11,625
Why do you care?

216
00:11:14,585 --> 00:11:17,425
No wonder you're suddenly so kind to me.

217
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:22,665
So did you not go on that blind date?

218
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:27,425
Do you think I need to go on a blind date?

219
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:29,585
Don't you need to?

220
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:32,305
What will you do
with the rest of your life

221
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:33,865
if you don't go on blind dates?

222
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:40,105
Was it because you felt embarrassed to go?

223
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:42,745
If you do feel that way,

224
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:43,825
you can

225
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,625
ask Duan Jiaxu to go with you.

226
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:56,625
Take him with you.

227
00:11:57,585 --> 00:11:58,745
You're single.

228
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:00,345
He's one year older than you

229
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:01,745
and he's single too.

230
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:02,865
Besides…

231
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,785
Besides, I think he may

232
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:09,825
want a girlfriend now.

233
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:12,025
Maybe you can go to him in Yihe.

234
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:15,105
Or he can come to you in Nanwu.

235
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,705
You two can go together.

236
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:18,665
Then you won't feel embarrassed.

237
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:24,305
Why?

238
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:25,865
Did Duan Jiaxu get on your wrong side?

239
00:12:26,785 --> 00:12:27,745
I just think

240
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:30,225
that he's not young anymore.

241
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:32,865
If he doesn't find a girlfriend, he might

242
00:12:33,465 --> 00:12:34,745
end up being pathetically alone.

243
00:12:35,705 --> 00:12:37,505
If he ends up pathetically alone,

244
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:38,865
that's his business.

245
00:12:39,505 --> 00:12:41,265
Don't compare me with him.

246
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:45,305
So are you going on blind dates or not?

247
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:46,225
I don't need to.

248
00:12:49,105 --> 00:12:50,945
In that case…

249
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,425
But Mom told you to go.

250
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:00,385
Do you know why?

251
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:04,945
Because there's a girl

252
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:06,425
trying to pursue me right now.

253
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:07,465
Got it?

254
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:18,265
What's with that look? I mean it.

255
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:19,985
So…

256
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:23,105
You can tell Duan Jiaxu

257
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:24,905
to go alone

258
00:13:25,665 --> 00:13:28,385
and enjoy the blind date

259
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:31,865
with his tacky pickup lines.

260
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:36,625
Open the gate.

261
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:37,745
Open it.

262
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:38,785
Climb over it.

263
00:13:41,105 --> 00:13:43,505
Open the gate! You're so childish!

264
00:13:43,585 --> 00:13:44,945
Call me handsome. Come on.

265
00:13:46,545 --> 00:13:47,665
Do it.

266
00:13:50,905 --> 00:13:51,745
You're handsome.

267
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:52,985
Louder.

268
00:13:53,985 --> 00:13:54,985
You're handsome.

269
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,505
Even louder.

270
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,225
What's wrong with you?

271
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,825
You're handsome. Open the gate now.

272
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:03,825
That's the way.

273
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,705
You're a good sister.

274
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:07,625
Please.

275
00:14:07,705 --> 00:14:08,785
Handsome, my foot.

276
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:15,465
Hey!

277
00:14:15,545 --> 00:14:16,785
I have to go out later.

278
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:20,745
Mom!

279
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:22,625
Mom!

280
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:26,145
Zhizhi, smell this.

281
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:27,785
Does it smell like the sun?

282
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:29,305
Why would it smell like the sun?

283
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:31,625
I've sunned the quilt all day.

284
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:36,185
That's why I'm just making the bed now.

285
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:37,145
All right.

286
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:39,265
Go and get the teddy bear blanket.

287
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:42,145
Is it still in the cabinet?

288
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:43,545
Yes, it's in there.

289
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,465
Okay.

290
00:14:57,945 --> 00:14:59,265
-Found it?
-Yes.

291
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:06,065
- I'll put it here.
-I'll do it.

292
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:07,705
Mom, go and get some rest.

293
00:15:07,785 --> 00:15:08,625
It's late now.

294
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:10,385
-Good night.
-Good night.

295
00:15:10,465 --> 00:15:12,145
All right. I'll go and wash this first.

296
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:13,625
-Go ahead.
-Okay. Good night.

297
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,025
-Bye.
-Bye.

298
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,505
SANG ZHI, HAPPY 18TH BIRTHDAY

299
00:16:08,225 --> 00:16:11,545
SANG ZHI, HAPPY 18TH BIRTHDAY

300
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:25,065
Where would I get a girlfriend?

301
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:27,065
Why don't you

302
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:28,425
introduce one to me?

303
00:16:30,225 --> 00:16:32,105
That won't do.

304
00:16:32,185 --> 00:16:34,105
I only know girls around my age.

305
00:16:35,185 --> 00:16:36,665
Around your age?

306
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:40,025
I'm fine with that.

307
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:42,945
Is he serious about that?

308
00:16:59,345 --> 00:17:00,185
SANG ZHI

309
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:01,145
Jiaxu.

310
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:04,025
I think Sang Yan has a girlfriend.

311
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:07,745
Really?

312
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:09,464
BROTHER NO. 2

313
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,865
I think she's a younger girl.

314
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,944
SANG ZHI

315
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:23,145
Don't tell me he likes a minor.

316
00:17:26,905 --> 00:17:28,464
Is it fine as long as she's an adult?

317
00:17:40,145 --> 00:17:42,545
An adult would be in college.

318
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,025
Doesn't that make her a grown-up?

319
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:47,505
So why not?

320
00:17:59,025 --> 00:18:02,985
She's only asking about Sang Yan, right?

321
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,105
It's acceptable when it happens
to someone else.

322
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:11,665
But if it were to happen to herself,

323
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,065
she would probably find it hard to accept.

324
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:16,505
After all, to her,

325
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:18,585
I'm just a big brother.

326
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,225
Had we not met each other until now,

327
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,425
I at 19 and he at 24,

328
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:31,665
he would've seen me as a peer.

329
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,345
Sadly, that didn't happen.

330
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:37,985
Perhaps in his eyes,

331
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:41,465
I will always be a 14-year-old girl

332
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,865
who is just his good friend's sister.

333
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:52,905
DON'T TELL ME HE LIKES A MINOR.
IS IT FINE AS LONG AS SHE'S AN ADULT?

334
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:11,585
CHAPTER 13, FEEL YOU OUT

335
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:13,905
I'M GUESSING YOU'RE FALLING TOO

336
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:19,025
I've been busy planning my wedding

337
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:20,665
and also had to come to Yihe for work.

338
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:22,145
If you hadn't called me,

339
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:23,705
I wouldn't have had much to eat today.

340
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:25,665
Then eat more.

341
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:26,825
Order more if you want.

342
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:28,905
I won't hold back with you.

343
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:32,985
Listen, Duan Jiaxu.

344
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:36,705
I won't ask you and Sang Yan
to be my groomsmen.

345
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:39,425
Why? Do you have a problem with me?

346
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:41,785
I have a problem with you and Sang Yan.

347
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:43,105
Picture my wedding.

348
00:19:43,185 --> 00:19:44,905
If you, Sang Yan, and I

349
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:45,905
are standing together,

350
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,105
people might think
you're there to steal my bride.

351
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:50,585
That's nonsensical.

352
00:19:51,865 --> 00:19:52,705
Duan Jiaxu.

353
00:19:52,785 --> 00:19:54,665
We haven't talked much
on the phone lately.

354
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:56,225
Why haven't you contacted me?

355
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:57,745
What has been keeping you busy?

356
00:19:57,825 --> 00:19:59,825
What else but work?

357
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:04,865
You haven't mentioned
the girl you like lately.

358
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:06,345
Let's talk about it.

359
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:08,185
Nothing has happened.

360
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:09,505
There isn't much to talk about.

361
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,545
Don't keep mum. Tell me. I'm so curious.

362
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,505
Please. What kind of girl is she?

363
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:18,305
She's a young lady.

364
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,505
She's a bit younger.

365
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:22,185
You don't know her.

366
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:23,425
What's wrong with being young

367
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:24,905
so long as she isn't a minor?

368
00:20:24,985 --> 00:20:26,745
Pursue her if she's of legal age

369
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:27,905
or I'll look down on you.

370
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,745
It's not like that.

371
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,665
I feel somewhat guilty about it.

372
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:36,745
Guilty? Aren't you worried
that she'll get taken?

373
00:20:37,585 --> 00:20:38,785
That's normal.

374
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,665
If she meets a good guy,

375
00:20:41,745 --> 00:20:42,905
I'll be happy for her.

376
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:45,545
Does that mean

377
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,905
she has someone she likes?

378
00:20:50,905 --> 00:20:52,785
This girl is impressive

379
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:54,265
to take no interest in you.

380
00:20:54,865 --> 00:20:56,025
Duan Jiaxu, don't be sad.

381
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:57,665
What kind of guy does she like?

382
00:20:57,745 --> 00:20:59,665
I'll analyze it and give you advice.
Tell me.

383
00:21:02,025 --> 00:21:04,265
Well, this guy

384
00:21:04,905 --> 00:21:05,865
is quite a flirt.

385
00:21:06,385 --> 00:21:08,025
He is a ladies' man and nice to everyone.

386
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:10,785
He might even be a bit shameless.

387
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,465
Isn't that you?

388
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:15,385
Are you insulting me?

389
00:21:15,465 --> 00:21:16,345
No.

390
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,345
Is there any chance

391
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:19,665
that she's talking about you?

392
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:21,745
Impossible.

393
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:23,145
I've met that guy before.

394
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:25,345
His image fits her description quite well.

395
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,345
He's quite flirty.

396
00:21:27,425 --> 00:21:28,785
He's just a jerk.

397
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:31,025
Maybe not.

398
00:21:31,745 --> 00:21:34,025
You see, one speaks contrary to their mind

399
00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:35,665
in front of their crush.

400
00:21:35,745 --> 00:21:37,425
When I was in college, I chased a girl,

401
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,065
Wan Ling in Foreign Languages.

402
00:21:39,145 --> 00:21:40,825
I was her rebound when she had a breakup.

403
00:21:40,905 --> 00:21:42,585
When they got back together, she told me,

404
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,465
"Qian Fei, what kind of girl do you like?

405
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:46,745
I can introduce one to you."

406
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:48,585
What could I say to her?

407
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:50,625
I simply made up someone based on her.

408
00:21:51,905 --> 00:21:54,225
You made up a girl based on her?

409
00:21:58,505 --> 00:21:59,705
It's not very likely.

410
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:05,185
But it's possible.

411
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,385
Right?

412
00:22:08,265 --> 00:22:10,065
Listen, I swear to you.

413
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:12,785
I haven't met many guys who fit
that description better than you do.

414
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:17,345
Miss, I want to order more!

415
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:24,705
Am I the guy she likes?

416
00:22:24,785 --> 00:22:26,265
Sir, what would you like to order?

417
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,905
-Chicken wings.
-All right.

418
00:22:27,985 --> 00:22:29,545
-And this too.
-Okay, right away.

419
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:47,545
I've arrived in Nanwu.

420
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,665
See you later.

421
00:22:55,505 --> 00:22:56,865
Okay.

422
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:01,345
Why did he tell me this?

423
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,265
-Do I leave the red packet here?
-No need.

424
00:23:11,345 --> 00:23:12,425
They're waiting. Hurry over.

425
00:23:12,505 --> 00:23:13,745
-No?
-It's fine.

426
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:14,745
-Come on.
-Let's go.

427
00:23:15,305 --> 00:23:17,225
What took you so long today?

428
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:18,305
The traffic was terrible.

429
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:20,385
Listen, Qian Fei is really nervous.

430
00:23:25,545 --> 00:23:26,505
Buddy!

431
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:27,825
Did you put on weight?

432
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:29,145
-A little.
-Not much.

433
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:30,185
Good, you're happy.

434
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:33,105
-Hi, Sang Zhi.
-Qian Fei.

435
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,865
Congratulations.

436
00:23:36,185 --> 00:23:38,385
I stopped her
from giving a red packet at the door.

437
00:23:38,465 --> 00:23:39,985
-You won't accept it, right?
-Right.

438
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:41,665
It's just a little something. Accept it.

439
00:23:41,745 --> 00:23:43,305
I can't. It's the thought that counts.

440
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:44,265
No need for this.

441
00:23:44,345 --> 00:23:45,505
Please take it.

442
00:23:45,585 --> 00:23:46,705
No.

443
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:48,705
You're so generous today.

444
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:50,825
Am I? I expect two packets from you.

445
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:55,425
Don't just drink by yourself.

446
00:23:55,505 --> 00:23:56,545
You and I are drinking

447
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,025
after the wedding, all right?

448
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:00,065
-Take your seats.
-Right, come on.

449
00:24:00,145 --> 00:24:01,505
-You'll sit here.
-Sit here.

450
00:24:01,585 --> 00:24:02,425
Let's go, Sang Zhi.

451
00:24:02,505 --> 00:24:03,545
-Sit.
-Look after them.

452
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:04,505
-You sit here.
-Sit.

453
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,625
If he doesn't want it, give it to me.

454
00:24:08,225 --> 00:24:09,265
Jiaxu!

455
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:11,105
-Jiaxu, over here!
-Over here.

456
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:12,345
What took you so long?

457
00:24:12,425 --> 00:24:14,665
I was going in circles outside.

458
00:24:15,185 --> 00:24:16,905
You cleaned up nicely today.

459
00:24:16,985 --> 00:24:17,905
He's handsome, right?

460
00:24:17,985 --> 00:24:20,225
Hey, man. Do you know what time it is now?

461
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:21,625
You nearly missed my wedding.

462
00:24:23,385 --> 00:24:24,985
I was going in circles.

463
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:28,545
-Okay, I'll go and get ready.
-Isn't that the tie I gave him?

464
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:30,185
Do your best.

465
00:24:30,265 --> 00:24:31,505
-I'll get ready now.
-Go ahead.

466
00:24:31,585 --> 00:24:32,665
-Sit there.
-Leave it to me.

467
00:24:32,745 --> 00:24:34,305
-Come on, take a seat.
-Sit.

468
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:40,665
You're so well-dressed today.

469
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:43,865
Jiaxu, say something nice.

470
00:24:43,945 --> 00:24:45,625
I'll give you a red packet for New Year.

471
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:49,745
It's hard to say something nice about you.

472
00:24:51,065 --> 00:24:52,905
Why don't I call you "darling brother"?

473
00:24:52,985 --> 00:24:53,825
Call me "brother."

474
00:24:53,905 --> 00:24:55,185
I'm fine with "brother."

475
00:24:57,425 --> 00:24:58,665
Darling brother.

476
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:03,545
Is he drunk already?

477
00:25:05,145 --> 00:25:06,385
Who are you trying to gross out?

478
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:08,665
Jiaxu, you two have become grosser
since university.

479
00:25:08,745 --> 00:25:10,185
Indeed.

480
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:12,145
Darling brother, they're badmouthing me.

481
00:25:12,225 --> 00:25:13,065
Gross!

482
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:16,825
This is mine now.

483
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:18,505
Starting today,

484
00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:21,105
Sang Yan is my darling brother.

485
00:25:21,705 --> 00:25:23,025
Are you insane?

486
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,345
Sang Yan, give in. It's okay.

487
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:25,265
Sure, okay.

488
00:25:25,345 --> 00:25:26,905
It makes me cringe.

489
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,465
I've got goosebumps all over.

490
00:25:28,545 --> 00:25:30,305
-Let's drink.
-Bottoms up.

491
00:25:30,385 --> 00:25:31,265
Brother.

492
00:25:32,025 --> 00:25:33,345
Don't call me that.

493
00:25:33,425 --> 00:25:34,745
Hearing that makes me sick now.

494
00:25:36,465 --> 00:25:37,385
Then…

495
00:25:37,465 --> 00:25:38,385
What?

496
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:40,945
Did something happen

497
00:25:42,305 --> 00:25:43,305
to him?

498
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:45,225
He seems weird today.

499
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:48,065
I'll tell you what happened to him.

500
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:51,545
Here.

501
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,625
Yihe Psychiatric Hospital.

502
00:25:56,945 --> 00:25:58,465
Go straight there when you get back.

503
00:25:59,865 --> 00:26:01,345
Darling brother, you're so considerate

504
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:02,905
to find a hospital for me.

505
00:26:02,985 --> 00:26:04,745
Man, stop calling me that. Okay?

506
00:26:04,825 --> 00:26:06,065
Why, my darling brother?

507
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:08,465
Scoot over, Sang Zhi. Let's switch seats.

508
00:26:08,945 --> 00:26:11,065
I'm going to puke even before I drink.

509
00:26:11,145 --> 00:26:12,145
Sit over there.

510
00:26:12,225 --> 00:26:13,785
Okay? Please, I beg of you.

511
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:16,865
What's wrong with you?

512
00:26:16,945 --> 00:26:18,225
Scoot over.

513
00:26:22,505 --> 00:26:24,465
-It has been a while!
-Maybe for you two.

514
00:26:24,545 --> 00:26:25,745
We just met up last week!

515
00:26:27,505 --> 00:26:30,425
-Next, let's welcome our groom,
-What should I say?

516
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,945
who's plump from love's nourishment,

517
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:33,785
but still looks handsome,

518
00:26:33,865 --> 00:26:35,065
Qian Fei,

519
00:26:35,145 --> 00:26:37,625
and his beloved bride, Shiwen!

520
00:26:37,705 --> 00:26:41,585
Let's welcome them to the stage!

521
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:47,305
I wonder if the staircase

522
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:49,425
can bear the weight of their love!

523
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:51,585
Let's give them a round of applause!

524
00:26:55,225 --> 00:26:56,305
Come on, Feifei.

525
00:26:56,385 --> 00:26:58,105
Look at this sturdy staircase.

526
00:26:58,185 --> 00:26:59,985
It's like the path of their future.

527
00:27:00,065 --> 00:27:01,785
With each and every step they take,

528
00:27:01,865 --> 00:27:03,385
they walk their way to their happiness

529
00:27:03,465 --> 00:27:04,345
and stability.

530
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:05,385
And this moment

531
00:27:05,465 --> 00:27:07,025
deserves cheering and applause

532
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:11,105
from all of you!

533
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:13,985
Qian Fei.

534
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,145
You have grown so chubby from love.

535
00:27:16,225 --> 00:27:17,345
I know

536
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:19,385
you must have much gratitude deep within.

537
00:27:19,465 --> 00:27:21,345
Why not take the mic

538
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:23,105
and say something to everyone?

539
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:25,105
I…

540
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:27,865
First of all, thank you
for coming to my wedding.

541
00:27:27,945 --> 00:27:29,345
I never thought

542
00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:31,065
that I would get married so soon.

543
00:27:31,145 --> 00:27:32,305
I…

544
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:33,665
I'm sure my buddies didn't expect

545
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:35,465
that I would get married so soon either.

546
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:38,105
I also want to thank my wife.

547
00:27:38,185 --> 00:27:39,945
My figure and height

548
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,145
aren't a problem for her.

549
00:27:41,225 --> 00:27:42,745
Even someone like me

550
00:27:42,825 --> 00:27:44,705
can marry such a beautiful wife.

551
00:27:44,785 --> 00:27:45,665
I…

552
00:27:47,585 --> 00:27:50,145
Guys, I've got a wife!

553
00:27:50,225 --> 00:27:51,545
Well done!

554
00:27:52,985 --> 00:27:54,505
Help me take a photo.

555
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:55,665
All guests,

556
00:27:55,745 --> 00:27:58,705
let's raise our glasses!

557
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,265
What are you doing?

558
00:28:02,345 --> 00:28:03,265
Raise your glasses.

559
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:04,585
Yes, right! Raise our glasses.

560
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:05,825
Buddies!

561
00:28:06,545 --> 00:28:07,745
Eat and drink your fill!

562
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:08,705
Cheers!

563
00:28:08,785 --> 00:28:10,025
-All right!
-Cheers!

564
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,305
Let's count down from three

565
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:12,825
and wish them a happy marriage!

566
00:28:12,905 --> 00:28:14,825
Three, two, one!

567
00:28:14,905 --> 00:28:17,985
-Have a happy marriage!
-Have a happy marriage!

568
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:19,425
Cheers!

569
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:23,625
Okay, as we watch the lovely newlyweds

570
00:28:23,705 --> 00:28:24,865
leave the wedding stage,

571
00:28:24,945 --> 00:28:27,425
this marks the start

572
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:31,145
of Qian Fei and Shiwen's wedding banquet!

573
00:28:31,225 --> 00:28:32,505
-Come on.
-May all of you eat up

574
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,145
-Let's dig in.
-and become as chubby as Qian Fei!

575
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:36,185
I want this one.

576
00:28:36,745 --> 00:28:38,145
It's so close to you.

577
00:28:38,225 --> 00:28:39,185
Fine.

578
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:41,425
You can have

579
00:28:42,225 --> 00:28:43,185
all the corn.

580
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:44,865
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY HI?

581
00:28:44,945 --> 00:28:46,225
Are you happy now?

582
00:28:49,505 --> 00:28:51,185
I can't take it anymore.

583
00:28:52,745 --> 00:28:54,385
BROTHER NO. 2

584
00:28:55,145 --> 00:28:56,465
Why didn't you say hi?

585
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:03,785
Zhizhi,

586
00:29:03,865 --> 00:29:05,425
I bought you a chocolate cake.

587
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:06,385
It's in the fridge.

588
00:29:06,465 --> 00:29:07,545
Remember to eat it.

589
00:29:12,265 --> 00:29:13,625
It's not important.

590
00:29:18,185 --> 00:29:19,105
Who is Zhizhi?

591
00:29:22,905 --> 00:29:24,065
Like you don't know.

592
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:25,025
It's my nickname.

593
00:29:25,745 --> 00:29:27,585
Why doesn't your brother call you that?

594
00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:32,185
He calls me that occasionally.

595
00:29:32,265 --> 00:29:33,265
When I don't tick him off.

596
00:29:33,345 --> 00:29:34,865
Who else calls you that?

597
00:29:36,945 --> 00:29:39,265
My dad, mom, aunt, uncle,

598
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:40,385
and eldest aunt.

599
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:43,305
Those who are close to me call me that.

600
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,825
And what's up with "Brother No. 2"?

601
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,145
Brother No. 1 and Brother No. 2.

602
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,225
Is there a problem with that?

603
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:06,905
Why am I your Brother No. 2?

604
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:09,265
You're older than Sang Yan.

605
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:11,225
So

606
00:30:12,345 --> 00:30:13,385
one and two.

607
00:30:18,545 --> 00:30:19,545
Fine.

608
00:30:27,345 --> 00:30:28,945
How old is the guy you like?

609
00:30:34,025 --> 00:30:36,025
Why is he bringing this up again?

610
00:30:36,105 --> 00:30:37,305
Why do you care?

611
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:40,265
Tell me.

612
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:41,985
Is he in the same year

613
00:30:42,065 --> 00:30:43,625
and same school as you?

614
00:30:43,705 --> 00:30:44,545
No.

615
00:30:45,585 --> 00:30:46,945
Who else do you know?

616
00:30:49,105 --> 00:30:50,825
I know people outside of school too.

617
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:52,585
How did you meet him?

618
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:54,545
We met while we hung out.

619
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:55,665
Where?

620
00:30:55,745 --> 00:30:57,505
A bar.

621
00:31:01,105 --> 00:31:02,145
That's not right.

622
00:31:02,745 --> 00:31:05,385
When you were drunk, you told me

623
00:31:05,465 --> 00:31:06,625
that you met him at a KTV.

624
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:14,105
Did I say that?

625
00:31:15,185 --> 00:31:16,705
What did I say?

626
00:31:18,905 --> 00:31:19,785
Yes.

627
00:31:20,665 --> 00:31:22,225
We met at a KTV.

628
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:25,025
I've met a lot of people,

629
00:31:25,585 --> 00:31:26,465
so I got confused.

630
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:32,785
What's wrong?

631
00:31:35,425 --> 00:31:36,425
Nothing.

632
00:31:38,025 --> 00:31:39,025
I just think

633
00:31:40,705 --> 00:31:41,945
that Qian Fei is quite smart.

634
00:31:44,505 --> 00:31:46,385
What does Qian Fei have to do with this?

635
00:31:55,345 --> 00:31:56,625
How did you fall for him?

636
00:31:58,105 --> 00:31:59,385
Give me a break, please.

637
00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:02,545
Why should I tell you?

638
00:32:04,345 --> 00:32:05,625
-Look at him.
-Let's switch seats.

639
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:07,825
No, I don't want to.

640
00:32:07,905 --> 00:32:09,185
-You…
-Sit over here.

641
00:32:09,265 --> 00:32:10,305
Just sit there.

642
00:32:11,385 --> 00:32:13,705
My darling brother, eat up. Have more.

643
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:15,505
No way.

644
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:17,025
You just sit there.

645
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:27,785
WE'VE TIED THE KNOT,
A HAPPY AND LASTING MARRIAGE

646
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:29,105
Top it off.

647
00:32:29,185 --> 00:32:30,105
What does this mean?

648
00:32:30,665 --> 00:32:31,705
Are you not drinking?

649
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:33,065
Is this how you respond

650
00:32:33,145 --> 00:32:34,825
to your challenge five years ago?

651
00:32:34,905 --> 00:32:36,865
Let me have a bite. Quickly.

652
00:32:36,945 --> 00:32:38,505
I'm starving.

653
00:32:38,585 --> 00:32:39,585
Here.

654
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:40,905
-I'm so hungry.
-Eat something.

655
00:32:40,985 --> 00:32:42,985
-Then we'll drink after this.
-All right.

656
00:32:43,065 --> 00:32:44,305
Okay, don't worry.

657
00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:46,465
-No problem.
-You didn't even take a sip.

658
00:32:46,545 --> 00:32:48,025
-I'll fill it up for you.
-Okay.

659
00:32:48,105 --> 00:32:48,985
Where is Qian Fei?

660
00:32:49,065 --> 00:32:50,305
He's seeing the guests off.

661
00:32:50,865 --> 00:32:52,545
They're such a sweet couple.

662
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:53,865
My goodness. I envy him so much.

663
00:32:53,945 --> 00:32:55,025
Envious?

664
00:32:56,345 --> 00:32:57,865
Lift your head. What's wrong?

665
00:32:59,225 --> 00:33:00,505
When are you leaving?

666
00:33:01,985 --> 00:33:03,745
I haven't seen them in a long time.

667
00:33:03,825 --> 00:33:06,105
-I want to drink with them.
-Okay.

668
00:33:08,105 --> 00:33:10,265
Here. Let's drink until we drop.

669
00:33:11,265 --> 00:33:12,785
Sang Yan, give up.

670
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,905
I'm heading home then.

671
00:33:13,985 --> 00:33:15,945
Sure. Go home first. Do you need a ride?

672
00:33:16,025 --> 00:33:17,545
No, I can go by myself.

673
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:18,825
I really can't stand those two.

674
00:33:18,905 --> 00:33:20,385
-Good idea.
-Okay.

675
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:21,705
Come on, guys.

676
00:33:22,345 --> 00:33:23,225
Let's drink.

677
00:33:24,025 --> 00:33:25,785
Jiaxu, I'm heading home first.

678
00:33:25,865 --> 00:33:27,865
Here, a toast to you.

679
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:29,585
I'm leaving, everyone.

680
00:33:29,665 --> 00:33:31,065
-Goodbye.
-Bye, little demon.

681
00:33:31,825 --> 00:33:32,825
Be careful.

682
00:33:32,905 --> 00:33:33,865
Little demon.

683
00:33:35,225 --> 00:33:36,065
Bye.

684
00:33:36,145 --> 00:33:37,345
Don't drink too much.

685
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:38,825
Don't worry. I'll take care of him.

686
00:33:41,385 --> 00:33:42,265
There he goes again.

687
00:33:55,345 --> 00:33:56,185
Sang Zhi.

688
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:59,145
Why are you walking so fast?

689
00:34:00,425 --> 00:34:01,625
Are you leaving too?

690
00:34:02,425 --> 00:34:03,665
No.

691
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:04,825
But it's late now.

692
00:34:04,905 --> 00:34:06,625
I'll drive you home in your brother's car.

693
00:34:06,705 --> 00:34:07,945
Didn't you drink…

694
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,304
You were sitting next to me all night.

695
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:13,665
Don't you know if I drank or not?

696
00:34:13,744 --> 00:34:15,065
I know you didn't.

697
00:34:15,145 --> 00:34:17,145
But you don't have to see me home.

698
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:18,505
I can go back by myself.

699
00:34:19,065 --> 00:34:21,185
Driving back and forth is troublesome.

700
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,744
Not at all.

701
00:34:24,865 --> 00:34:26,105
It might be troublesome

702
00:34:26,185 --> 00:34:27,145
if it were someone else.

703
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:38,585
What? Are you giving it back to me?

704
00:34:40,065 --> 00:34:41,665
I'm returning the red packet

705
00:34:41,744 --> 00:34:42,985
to our Zhizhi.

706
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:48,744
Wait.

707
00:34:48,824 --> 00:34:50,065
What did you just call me?

708
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:51,744
Zhizhi.

709
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:54,945
You said people close to you
call you that.

710
00:35:00,785 --> 00:35:02,465
You should keep this.

711
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:04,985
Since you've called Sang Yan…

712
00:35:05,905 --> 00:35:08,025
You should get something for that.

713
00:35:08,745 --> 00:35:10,545
It's for Zhizhi.

714
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:11,705
It's no loss.

715
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:15,145
Take it.

716
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:17,505
Let's go.

717
00:35:31,225 --> 00:35:32,905
When are you returning to school?

718
00:35:32,985 --> 00:35:34,305
Tomorrow morning.

719
00:35:34,385 --> 00:35:35,305
What time?

720
00:35:35,785 --> 00:35:37,145
The flight is just after 8:00 a.m.

721
00:35:38,025 --> 00:35:39,225
We're on the same flight.

722
00:35:41,425 --> 00:35:42,625
Tomorrow morning,

723
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:44,265
I'll come and take you to the airport.

724
00:35:55,265 --> 00:35:56,265
Thank you, Jiaxu.

725
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:50,145
I'll go inside then.

726
00:36:57,985 --> 00:36:59,145
It's your New Year's gift.

727
00:37:03,425 --> 00:37:04,425
Thank you, Jiaxu.

728
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:06,625
Open it.

729
00:37:41,465 --> 00:37:42,785
Are these my initials?

730
00:37:45,545 --> 00:37:46,465
Do you like it?

731
00:37:55,985 --> 00:37:56,945
Well…

732
00:38:03,025 --> 00:38:04,185
Go in and sleep soon.

733
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:07,225
All right.

734
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:09,425
Good night, Jiaxu.

735
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:14,025
Good night.

736
00:39:06,505 --> 00:39:08,865
A bracelet with my initials on it.

737
00:39:11,585 --> 00:39:12,545
What does that mean?

738
00:39:24,025 --> 00:39:26,545
What does a bracelet mean as a gift?

739
00:39:31,185 --> 00:39:32,665
"BRACELET" SOUNDS LIKE
"CHERISHED LOVE"

740
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,825

Is it for me?

Are you not eating it?

Watch yourself.

Don't take advantage of me.

759
00:41:58,745 --> 00:41:59,825
You're shameless.
