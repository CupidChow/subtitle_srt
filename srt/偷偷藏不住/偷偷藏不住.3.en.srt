{\an8}ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

2
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,560
-I couldn't stand it.
-Wait.

3
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,840
-What were you doing?
-Let me eat first.

4
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,600
What?

5
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,640
The three of us were in a ranked match.

6
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,240
Then I got a call.

7
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
You even scolded me.

8
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,760
-The day we almost won?
-Yes, that day.

9
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,960
I told you before, didn't I?

10
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,080
Her again?

11
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,640
Valentine's Day was around the corner,

12
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,760
so I bought her roses.

13
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,520
That's so tacky.

14
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Is buying roses tacky?

15
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,360
Yes, it's so tacky.

16
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,280
Man, you have no game. Seriously.

17
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,680
-All right. Eat.
-You don't get it.

18
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,960
No amount of flowers will work.

19
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,400
-Listen.
-What flowers did you give?

20
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,560
-Don't you know?
-And it's extremely tacky.

21
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,960
Do you know that he gave her red roses?

22
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
You still don't remember.

23
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,320
Can you pay more attention to me?

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,280
Let me tell you.

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,440
She posted on Weibo

26
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,840
that it would be nice

27
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,240
to receive red roses on Valentine's Day.

28
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,720
I liked the post.

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,200
Then I immediately went out
to get her red roses.

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,160
I ate too much.

31
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,480
We shouldn't have ordered so much food.

32
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,280
We had already ordered before you came.

33
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,320
<i>Did he do all that</i>

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,120
<i>because he didn't want me
to be embarrassed?</i>

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,840
One wanted your number.

36
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,600
Another wanted your number.

37
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,120
No one wanted mine.

38
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,480
Am I not your backup?

39
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,880
Just change your name to Sang Yan.

40
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,120
Wouldn't you be yourself then?

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,960
Or you can change it to Duan Jiaxu.

42
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,480
Okay, I'll get the car.

43
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,320
You two can wait for me at the entrance.

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,960
Follow them.

45
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,840
-Hurry.
-Let's go.

46
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,320
Sang Zhi.

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,960
Shall I take you to the claw machine?

48
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
Let's play.

49
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,320
No, thank you, Qian Fei.

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,320
It's fine. I promised you. Come on.

51
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,280
Listen, I'm the best.

52
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,560
I'll teach you step by step.

53
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,640
Sang Zhi.

54
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,960
Take a handful.

55
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,880
Thank you.

56
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,800
Take it.

57
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,520
This is enough.

58
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,360
Okay, come on. I'll teach you.

59
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
Here, let me help you.

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,080
The white one?

61
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,280
Give me two more.

62
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,040
I got you a plushie.

63
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,240
Don't cry anymore.

64
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,520
<i>Thank you, Jiaxu.</i>

65
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,480
<i>Have some candy.</i>

66
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,160
What do you think?

67
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,640
Wasn't I brave earlier?

68
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,800
Thank you, Jiaxu.

69
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,400
Come on. I'll see you home.

70
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,800
I can lecture you along the way.

71
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,760
Wait a second.

72
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,560
When Sang Yan met the teacher,

73
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,280
he didn't lecture me afterward.

74
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,280
-Really?
-Really.

75
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,440
I'll call your brother and ask him.

76
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,760
No! Wait a minute!

77
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,280
Won't he find out if you ask him?

78
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,280
Then you will have come here for nothing!

79
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,640
Kiddo.

80
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,080
You called me all the way here.

81
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,760
And now you're lying to me.

82
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,240
Won't that make me a sucker?

83
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,480
That again?

84
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,200
Fine, I won't tell your brother.

85
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,920
Kiddo.

86
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,720
Goodbye then.

87
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,360
Where are you going?

88
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,920
It's getting late.

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,840
If I'm not home yet,

90
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,120
my mom will worry about me.

91
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,200
I'll see you home.

92
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,120
Wait!

93
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,040
{\an8}The bus station is nearby.

94
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,640
{\an8}Besides, it's a short walk
after I get off the bus.

95
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,040
{\an8}Jiaxu, you must be very busy right now.

96
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,960
I've kept you long enough.

97
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,040
I'll get out of your hair.

98
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,800
You didn't care so much about me before.

99
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,520
I'll see you home no matter how busy I am.

100
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,680
Walk faster.

101
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,800
Jiaxu, it's getting dark.

102
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,320
Are you not returning to campus yet?

103
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,280
Don't worry, kiddo.

104
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,440
I will keep today's incident a secret.

105
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,800
Really?

106
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,600
Pinky promise?

107
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,360
You must also promise me

108
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,240
you'll pay attention in class

109
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,600
and not break the school rules.

110
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,040
-Okay?
-Okay.

111
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,560
I'm not joking.

112
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,360
If your teacher wants

113
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,640
to meet your parents again,

114
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,680
what happened today will be exposed.

115
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,720
I'll be in trouble.

116
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,520
You can come again next time.

117
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,480
Will there be a next time?

118
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,520
No.

119
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,680
I just think you're very nice to me.

120
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,480
You're nicer to me than my brother is.

121
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,440
So…

122
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,120
If something like this happens again,

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,280
can I ask you to pretend to be my brother?

124
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,440
Got it.

125
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,679
Go home.

126
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,840
There had better not be a next time.

127
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,720
Here.

128
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,600
By the way,

129
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,880
the light bulb in your kitchen burnt out.

130
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,720
After you get inside,

131
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,880
give this to your dad.

132
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,920
Okay. Thank you, Jiaxu.

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,240
Don't mention it.

134
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,200
Hurry inside.

135
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,800
-Goodbye, Jiaxu.
-Be good.

136
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,160
Bye.

137
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,640
Difficult kiddo.

138
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,760
Let's go.

139
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
CHAPTER THREE, CONSIDERATE

140
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,280
GET A LITTLE CLOSER

141
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,480
Why did you lie to me again?

142
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't want to go. I really don't.

143
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,840
We're already here. Let's go together.

144
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,440
Besides, I already bought a gift.

145
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's right. I didn't buy a gift.

146
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,920
It doesn't matter.

147
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,240
We'll say it's from both of us.

148
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,720
It's no big deal. Come on.

149
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,240
Just say it's from you.

150
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,000
I hardly know him anyway.

151
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,160
It's fine. Let's go together.

152
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,160
We agreed to meet here.

153
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,880
Welcome.

154
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,000
Sang Zhi?

155
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,240
Jiaxu.

156
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,560
Are you hanging out with your friend?

157
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,080
Hello.

158
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,040
Hello.

159
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,320
Do you work here?

160
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,360
Here.

161
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,640
See what you would like to eat.

162
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,760
You can order here later.

163
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,200
Find a table first.

164
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,240
He's so handsome.

165
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Who is he?

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,760
That doesn't look like your brother.

167
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,040
He's my brother's friend.

168
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,400
Your brother's friend?

169
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,600
He's handsome.

170
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,080
Your brother is handsome too.

171
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,760
Sang Zhi, you're so lucky.

172
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,280
See what you would like to eat.

173
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,760
I want…

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,240
Red beans

175
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,920
or milk custard with mango.

176
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,400
I think I'll get

177
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,200
the milk custard with red beans.

178
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,920
Saigon milk custard.

179
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,280
I don't think I can eat this.

180
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,480
I'll get the milk custard with red beans.

181
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,520
Milk custard with red beans then.

182
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,440
Have a look.

183
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,800
I will have

184
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,200
pearl sago with coconut milk.

185
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,040
-Is that all?
-Yes.

186
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,920
I'll go order.

187
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,200
Keep an eye on my phone.

188
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,160
Sure.

189
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,320
What do you want to order?

190
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,520
I want

191
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,360
one milk custard with red beans

192
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,160
and one pearl sago with coconut milk.

193
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,080
Okay.

194
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,440
Which one is yours?

195
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,360
The pearl sago with coconut milk.

196
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,200
You're one yuan short.

197
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
No, I'm not.

198
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,680
You stole so many glances at me.

199
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,120
I can't let you do that for free.

200
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
No wonder you have no customers.

201
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,200
It's because you're running a shady shop.

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,920
Only because I charged you an extra yuan?

203
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,600
I didn't steal glances at you.

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,240
Okay, I'm the one making stuff up.

205
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,440
Would I really charge you?

206
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,440
Keep it to buy yourself candy.

207
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,640
No way.

208
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,640
Don't you work here to make money?

209
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,800
If I don't pay you,

210
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,240
how will you make money?

211
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,800
Take back the money.

212
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,600
Treating you to dessert

213
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,760
won't put me in the red.

214
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,440
Your friend is waiting.

215
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,920
Sang Zhi, is your brother's friend

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,360
treating us to desserts?

217
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,200
-Yes.
-That's great.

218
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,080
I'm low on money after buying the gift.

219
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,320
I'll ask the others.

220
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,080
Where are you now?

221
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,520
Where are you guys?
We've been waiting for a long time.

222
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,200
Fu Zhengchu, hurry up.

223
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,720
All right.

224
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,440
Your milk custard.

225
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,960
Thank you.

226
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,000
Thank you, Jiaxu.

227
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,120
Yours is hot.

228
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,960
Try it.

229
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,080
It smells so good.

230
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,080
Do you want to try mine?

231
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,160
Xiaoduan.

232
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,160
Mr. Gao.

233
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,000
I have to run to the second store.

234
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,920
By the way,

235
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,520
how about I give you

236
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
half a month of your advance first?

237
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,200
-Thank you, Mr. Gao.
-Okay, get back to work.

238
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,160
-I'll take care of it.
-Okay.

239
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,600
<i>Does he keep working</i>

240
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,680
<i>because he is short on cash?</i>

241
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,280
Fu Zhengchu!

242
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,160
-Sang Zhi, sorry for being late.
-Hello.

243
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,720
Hello!

244
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,720
Hello.

245
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,480
Sang Zhi.

246
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,720
Does your brother work here?

247
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,600
But isn't your family rich?

248
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,480
Will you mind your own business?

249
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,640
It's late.

250
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
Let's go have fun.

251
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,520
Let's go.

252
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,800
We're not done yet.

253
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,720
Stop eating, Sang Zhi.

254
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,920
Let's go.

255
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,440
Everyone is waiting for us.

256
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,880
There is plenty of food there.

257
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,880
Let's go.

258
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,000
Sangsang, let's go.

259
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,960
What are you thinking?

260
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,440
Get ready. Hide.

261
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,480
Are you going out with your friends?

262
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,840
Be careful.

263
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,440
Make sure to go home before dark.

264
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,520
Leave her to us.

265
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,320
-Have fun.
-Goodbye.

266
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,280
-Bye.
-Bye.

267
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,040
Let's go.

268
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,600
Sangsang.

269
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,320
Why does your brother's friend

270
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,880
sound like my dad?

271
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,920
My dad said the same thing before I left.

272
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,360
We haven't hung out in a long while.

273
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,920
Just the thought of it makes me happy.

274
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,920
Wait, Zhenru.

275
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,440
Give me a minute.

276
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,880
Sangsang, where are you going?

277
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,000
They're already waiting for us.

278
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,200
Why did you come back?

279
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,040
Jiaxu, are you short on cash?

280
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,840
I heard from Sang Yan that you work.

281
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,960
Then I see you working today.

282
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,520
I wanted to say

283
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,040
that you don't have to treat me

284
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,920
if you're short on cash.

285
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,880
I can afford to buy you dessert.

286
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,160
Why are you worrying so much?

287
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,200
{\an8}This kid.

288
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,320
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

289
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,760
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

290
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,120
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

291
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,200
We wish you…

292
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,120
-Health!
-Good luck!

293
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,040
Great fortune,

294
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,280
and a happy family!

295
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,960
Enough.

296
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,200
-Come on.
-Let's have cake.

297
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,840
-Come on.
-Make a wish!

298
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,840
Make a wish.

299
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,400
Here. Make a wish.

300
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,520
This is my wish.

301
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,200
Sang Zhi--

302
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,160
Wait.

303
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,800
Do you have something to say to me?

304
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,920
I have something to tell you.

305
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,520
Is it okay

306
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,680
if I go home first?

307
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,320
I already spent your birthday with you

308
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,720
and sang the birthday song.

309
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,840
I really want to go home.

310
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,240
-Bye.
-Wait.

311
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,440
Carry on. Have fun!

312
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,640
Sang Zhi!

313
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,080
Fu Zhengchu, go after her.

314
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,520
Quick.

315
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,360
You guys can eat first. I'll be back.

316
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,400
-We'll cut the cake when you're back.
-Go.

317
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,520
Fu Zhengchu!

318
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,480
It's Fu Zhengchu's birthday,

319
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,600
but Sang Zhi left early.

320
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,000
He won't be happy.

321
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,000
Yin Zhenru, Sang Zhi is a lousy friend.

322
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,360
Sang Zhi!

323
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,520
Why did you follow me outside?

324
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,640
Aren't you partying?

325
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,520
I came out for some air.

326
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,080
You get your air.

327
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,440
I'm going home.

328
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,720
Let me see you off.

329
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,680
We know each other so well.

330
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,120
You don't need to do that.

331
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,760
Sang Zhi.

332
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,800
I don't believe you can't tell.

333
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,240
Can't tell what?

334
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,360
I studied so hard

335
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,000
to get into the same high school as you.

336
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,960
Don't you know?

337
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,920
I know.

338
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,920
That's why I think you should

339
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,240
focus on your studies.

340
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,000
Why do you keep telling me to study?

341
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,000
If, on the off chance,

342
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,720
I have a crush on you,

343
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,760
what would you think?

344
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,440
I can't imagine it.

345
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,840
No, what I mean is

346
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,880
that you should think about

347
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,240
how to study hard.

348
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,960
Don't make jokes like this.

349
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,960
I'm not joking with you.

350
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,200
Have you forgotten that you knocked out

351
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,840
one of my teeth when we were kids?

352
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,400
That was years ago.

353
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,480
Didn't I break my hand too?

354
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,520
You're right.

355
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,240
Well…

356
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,600
Sang Zhi--

357
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
No.

358
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,520
Let's not talk about it.

359
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,520
Sang Zhi!

360
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,000
It's my birthday today.

361
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,920
I chose today to tell you this.

362
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,200
You're always doing this to me.

363
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,280
-Couldn't you reject me another day?
-Why are you always like this?

364
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,960
You start crying before even saying much.

365
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,560
-You're always like this.
-I'm not.

366
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,760
You're crying!

367
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,560
What are you doing? Stop crying!

368
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,280
Fu Zhengchu, why are you always--

369
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,680
Am I interrupting?

370
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,280
Sang Zhi's brother, hello.

371
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,240
Goodbye.

372
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,320
Jiaxu, were you eavesdropping?

373
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,760
Yes.

374
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,320
You sound so righteous.

375
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,600
You're in high school.

376
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,000
You can't date so early.

377
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,920
I'm not.

378
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,960
I'm not dating.

379
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,640
Really.

380
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,440
Weren't you eavesdropping?

381
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,120
Didn't you hear me tell him

382
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,440
to study hard

383
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,880
and not think about other things?

384
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,920
Come to think of it,

385
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,640
it's normal to have these ideas
during adolescence.

386
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,840
But your task now

387
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,800
is to study hard and not get distracted.

388
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,680
I told you I didn't.

389
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,840
I really didn't.

390
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,320
I trust you.

391
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,280
But Sang Zhi,

392
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,080
it's nice to have people who like you.

393
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,240
You can thank him for liking you

394
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,080
before gently rejecting him.

395
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,520
But you can't hurt him.

396
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,480
I didn't hurt him.

397
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,400
I saw him crying.

398
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,080
He was crying

399
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,400
because he has always been a crybaby.

400
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,680
He and I grew up fighting.

401
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,960
He's always the first to cry.

402
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,760
Fighting?

403
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,440
No wonder your parents

404
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,880
got called to school every day.

405
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,240
It didn't happen every day.

406
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,840
It was just a couple of times…

407
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,400
Put out your hand.

408
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,520
Take it back.

409
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,640
Otherwise, people will say

410
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,480
I extorted a high school student.

411
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,760
It's not extortion.

412
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,440
I had dessert. I should pay for it.

413
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,320
What dessert costs this much?

414
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,720
Do you really think this is a shady shop?

415
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Jiaxu.

416
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,920
I just think it's a little hard for you

417
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,840
to work multiple jobs

418
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,320
because you're short on cash.

419
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,200
If I can help you…

420
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,640
But don't overthink it.

421
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,440
If it were my brother,

422
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,120
I would help him too.

423
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,680
I swear.

424
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,560
So do you feel bad

425
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,240
for me?

426
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,040
No.

427
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,520
Sorry.

428
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,880
Are you mad?

429
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,640
I'm not.

430
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,240
Thank you, Sang Zhi.

431
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,520
You know you need to be nice to me now.

432
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,640
I'm touched that you did this

433
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,000
and the thought behind it.

434
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,720
But I'm not that broke.

435
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,440
How about this?

436
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,480
When I'm so broke

437
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,320
that I can't afford to feed myself,

438
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,480
I'll borrow money from you.

439
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,960
Okay?

440
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,880
All right, I need to get back to work.

441
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,240
Do you know how to get
to the nearest bus stop?

442
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
Yes.

443
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,320
Can you go home by yourself?

444
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,640
Yes.

445
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,200
Goodbye then.

446
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,720
Zhenru.

447
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,520
What's the teacher's main focus?

448
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,000
It's this one.

449
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
15th century BC.

450
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
This question type.

451
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,000
Zhenru.

452
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,840
Zhenru.

453
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,520
For Sports Day,
what event did you sign up for?

454
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,800
The name list is ready.

455
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,800
Look over here.

456
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,200
The annual Sports Day

457
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,520
is about to begin.

458
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,160
This year, we have a lot of events.

459
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,480
The school decided to hold it
at Nanwu University as usual.

460
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,320
Is everyone participating?

461
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,840
-Yes.
-Yes.

462
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,360
Sang Zhi.

463
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,320
Why don't I see your name?

464
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,200
Sir, I'll be the record clerk this year.

465
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,800
That's not a sport.

466
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,920
You can do the high jump.

467
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,600
I can't jump.

468
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,360
I have bad knees.

469
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,720
You're 17 years old,

470
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,720
not 70!

471
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,120
Knee problems at such a young age

472
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,560
prove that you lack exercise.

473
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,040
You're doing this.

474
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,840
I'm scared I'll drag everyone down

475
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,840
with this flaw.

476
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
It doesn't matter.

477
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,080
Participate and show what you can do.

478
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,840
It doesn't matter whether you win.

479
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,640
What matters is participation,

480
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,880
not prizes.

481
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,640
What do I want?

482
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,840
I want you to be involved.

483
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,840
It's you then.

484
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,360
Also,

485
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,920
go to the class monitor

486
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,280
and report your clothing sizes.

487
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,400
I'm going to order class uniforms.

488
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,000
Sir, what is the style of the uniform?

489
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,120
It's a secret.

490
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,640
It will look very good.

491
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,520
It carries the vitality
of 17-year-old students like you.

492
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,200
-Really?
-Is that so?

493
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,280
The 100 m race.

494
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,960
Chen Liqiang.

495
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,760
Train hard with your three classmates.

496
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,920
Zhenru.

497
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,240
Zhenru.

498
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,040
Zhenru, where are you going?

499
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,480
I'm going to the store.

500
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,800
I'll go with you.

501
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,400
What do you want to eat? It's my treat.

502
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,360
No, thank you.

503
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,920
<i>Grade 11.</i>

504
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,760
<i>Men's 100 m sprint.</i>

505
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,080
Ready.

506
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,040
Get set.

507
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,240
-Go!
-Go!

508
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,720

00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,560
-Go!
-Go!

511
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,240
-Go!
-Go!

512
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,040
-Go!
-Go!

513
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,440
Fu Zhengchu, go! Fu Zhengchu!

514
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,160
Grade 11 students participating

515
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,680
in the women's high jump,

516
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,880
please report
to the registration area immediately.

517
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,800
Sang Zhi, it's your turn.

518
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,520
-Let's go.
-Zhenru, it's Sang Zhi's turn.

519
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,880
-Let's go.
-Let's go together.

520
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,120
I'm not going. You girls go ahead. Bye.

521
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,040
We'll leave first.

522
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
Yes, right over there.

523
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,040
Thank you.

524
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,080
It's so good-looking.

525
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
It looks nice.

526
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,040
Sang Zhi.

527
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Good luck.

528
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,320
Good luck.

529
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,680
I'm going to accept my award.

530
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,440
REGISTRATION AREA,
WOMEN'S HIGH JUMP QUALIFIER

531
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,720
Number 26.

532
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,400
Xie Jialu, okay.

533
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,360
You're disqualified from the competition.

534
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,440
-Go home.
-You're really annoying.

535
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,360
You're not tall enough, 120 cm won't do.

536
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,360
I'm already 155 cm. Here.

537
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,600
Class 1, Sang…

538
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,840
-Here.
-Sang Zhi.

539
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,840
Here. Turn around. Let me see.

540
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,280
-No.
-Turn around and show me.

541
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,480
No.

542
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,640
Turn around.

543
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,800
Turn around.

544
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,480
Turn around. Let me see.

545
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,240
-What are you doing?
-It's a match!

546
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,720
0155!

547
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,440
Are you worried nobody knows
that you're 155 cm?

548
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,920
-Seriously. Go.
-Sang Zhi.

549
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,320
What event are you participating in?

550
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,320
High jump.

551
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,160
155 cm, participating in the high jump.

552
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,240
The sunflower is cute.

553
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,280
I didn't choose it.

554
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,240
Do your best.

555
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,360
Good luck, little demon!

556
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,080
-It's hilarious!
-You're so loud.

557
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,120
I was napping.

558
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,560
-Go!
-Go!

559
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,440
Wear a hat.

560
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,080
Don't get sunburned.

561
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,240
How is your warmup?

562
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
Move more

563
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,240
so you don't get a sprain later.

564
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,480
GO

565
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,960
What are you doing?

566
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,520
Mom and Dad told me to take photos.

567
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,880
Can't you take it when I look good?

568
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,520
Why do you have to do it when I'm…

569
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,600
You have to tell me when you look good
or I won't know.

570
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,920
-Look at 155 cm here.
-Delete it.

571
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,880
-Give it to me.
-Delete it.

572
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,840
Don't touch it.

573
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,600
Stop bullying my sister all the time.

574
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,560
What do you mean?

575
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,800
Did you hear that?

576
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,240
My brother told you to stop bullying me.

577
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,360
Who is your brother?

578
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,960
What about it?

579
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,080
Fine, you can have her.

580
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,480
-Let me take some photos.
-Go away.

581
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,160
Take a few photos. You're handsome.

582
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
Fine, you can have her.

583
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,400
-Give me back my camera.
-Look.

584
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,040
Don't I look handsome?

585
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,520
-Grade 11.
-Do you really think so?

586
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,520
The women's high jump will begin soon.

587
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,560
Okay, competition time.

588
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,280
Do your best. You can do it.

589
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,480
Good.

590
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,440
Next, 0845.

591
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Mr. Chen,

592
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,920
the middle school isn't involved.

593
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,120
Why are you here?

594
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,480
I'm here to watch and learn.

595
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,680
The middle school's Sports Day
is next month.

596
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,640
Mr. Ling.

597
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,480
The high school is different this year.

598
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,440
How is it different?

599
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,800
Look at your class uniform.

600
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,200
What a great scene.

601
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,680
It's trendy and stylish.

602
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,920
Most importantly,

603
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,920
it's full of vitality.

604
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,760
Look at who chose it.

605
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,160
Next, number 0155,

606
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,120
Sang Zhi.

607
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,440
Starting height, 1,05 m.

608
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,160
-Go!
-Go!

609
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
-Go!
-Sang Zhi, good luck!

610
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,400
-Go!
-Go!

611
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,400
Go, Sang Zhi!

612
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,560
Go!

613
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,800
-Go, 0155!
-Good luck!

614
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,200
-Go!
-Go!

615
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,880
-Go!
-Go!

616
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,360
-Go!
-Sang Zhi, good luck!

617
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,080
-Go!
-Go, Sang Zhi!

618
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,600
-Go!
-Go!

619
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,600
If she had just jumped,

620
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,880
she would've gotten over.

621
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,000
What the heck?

622
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,200
-Sang Zhi, go!
-Sang Zhi, lift your legs.

623
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,800
-Do your best, Sang Zhi.
-Work on it.

624
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,240
-Go!
-Go!

625
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,080
-Go!
-Go!

626
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,040
-Go!
-Go, Sang Zhi!

627
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
-Go!
-Go!

628
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,000
Jump. Don't grab the rod, little demon.

629
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,200
-Sang Zhi, go!
-Go!

630
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
-Sang Zhi!
-Good luck!

631
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,920
-Go, Sang Zhi.
-Do your best, Sang Zhi!

632
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,040
Go!

633
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,240
-Go, Sang Zhi!
-Good luck, little demon!

634
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,520
-Go!
-Go!

635
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,840
Good luck. Do your best.

636
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,240
-Sang Zhi, go!
-Go!

637
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,080
-Go!
-Go!

638
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,240
Go, Sang Zhi.

639
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,639
Are you okay?

640
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,159
-Here. Make way.
-Are you okay?

641
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,719
Get up first. Come on.

642
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,760
-Be careful.
-Three, two, one, go.

643
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,679
-It hurts.
-What's wrong?

644
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,120
-This hurts.
-It's likely sprained.

645
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,280
Take Sang Zhi to the medical station.

646
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,600
-Yes.
-Sure.

647
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,719
I'll carry you. Get on.

648
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,520
-Be careful.
-Be careful.

649
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,040
Don't touch that leg.

650
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
I don't…

651
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,159
Let's go.

652
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,600
Aren't you Sang Zhi's brother?

653
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,400
Hello, sir.

654
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,159
-This is…
-My dad.

655
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,679
Let's go.

656
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,159
-Go.
-Hurry.

657
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,320
Is this your…

658
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,520
-It's all your fault.
-My dad.

659
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,440
I'm so sorry, sir.

660
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,800
Seriously.

661
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,320
Did you hurt your head or your leg?

662
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,520
Am I that old to be your dad?

663
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,880
Can you stop scolding me?

664
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,960
-You've nagged me all day.
-You're so bad at jumping.

665
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,560
You still insist on it. Gosh.

666
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,920
-Okay, stop it.
-I'll tell Dad.

667
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,720
Are you going to rat me out again?

668
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,360
-Stop moving!
-Watch out for her leg.

669
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,160
-I don't want you to carry me.
-How will you walk with a sprain?

670
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,320
Put me down.

671
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,840
-Stop moving.
-Let me carry her.

672
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,880
Sure. You can carry her.

673
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,120
Stop arguing. Watch out.

674
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,040
-Okay.
-Be careful.

675
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,040
-Here.
-Her leg.

676
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,800
Are you okay?

677
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,200
Why is the medical station empty?

678
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,160
Take her there first.

679
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,600
-I'll get someone.
-Okay.

680
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,520
You still talk so much when you're hurt.

681
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,720
XURI MIDDLE-HIGH SCHOOL,
TEMPORARY MEDICAL STATION

682
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,920
Sit down first.

683
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,120
Be careful.

684
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,520
Don't touch that leg yet.

685
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,120
Let me disinfect it for you first.

686
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,360
It might hurt a little.

687
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,440
Bear with it for a bit.

688
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,440
Does it hurt?

689
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,120
Hang in there. It will be over soon.

690
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,320
You're so badly hurt.

691
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,720
What about this hand?

692
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,000
Does it hurt?

693
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,040
Why are you looking at me like that?

694
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
What's the matter?

695
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,520
You're nice to me.

696
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,400
Unlike my brother.

697
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,760
All he does is yell at me.

698
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Do you think he isn't nice to you?

699
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,280
He doesn't love me at all.

700
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,160
He doesn't love you?

701
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,320
Didn't you see

702
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,480
how panicked he was when you fell?

703
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,680
He rushed over and carried you in no time.

704
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,760
He doesn't love you?

705
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,720
What's going on in your little head?

706
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,040
But he's always yelling at me.

707
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,200
I'm already hurt,
but he is still yelling at me.

708
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,920
It's an impossible task

709
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,640
to make him stop yelling.

710
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,080
It's all done.

711
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,000
Be careful

712
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,920
with these wounds.

713
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,880
Don't touch them.

714
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,120
Don't get water on them.

715
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,880
How are the wounds?

716
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,080
I've treated the abrasions.

717
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,640
But you had best take her to the hospital

718
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,120
to check the sprain.

719
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,480
Sure. Have a drink first.

720
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,240
Here.

721
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,440
Drink up. We'll go to the hospital.

722
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,840
By the way, hold onto the camera.

723
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,880
Here. Get on.

724
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,080
Your brother has a class in the afternoon.

725
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,960
Only your dad can take you
to the hospital.

726
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,000
I beg of you.

727
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,320
I'll also have to drop you off at school.

728
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,600
How troublesome.

729
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,680
It's fine.

730
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,280
If your dad can't take you to school,

731
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,200
I'll do it.

732
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,920
Listen to your brother.

733
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,400
Get on.

734
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,040
Be careful.

735
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,600
Be careful.

736
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,520
Don't strangle me.

737
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,840
I'll leave you to it.

738
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,800
Let's go.

739
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,320
Wait.

740
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,880
-Why?
-Wait.

741
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,800
Wait.

742
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,840
I can't see.

743
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,520
Help her up first. Be careful.

744
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,920
Proceed with the competition.

745
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,320
-Be careful.
-What are you doing?

746
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
Be careful.

747
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,240
XURI MIDDLE-HIGH SCHOOL,
TEMPORARY MEDICAL STATION

748
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,640
<i>He's nice.</i>

749
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,320
<i>He's very nice to me.</i>

750
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,360
<i>But he seems to be nice to everyone.</i>

751
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,160
<i>I'm not the most special one.</i>

752
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Well, that's all for my class today.

753
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,360
Class dismissed.

754
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,960
Sang Zhi, bye.

755
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,880
Bye.

756
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,120
Hello?

757
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,560
<i>Hello, little demon.</i>

758
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,080
<i>Duan Jiaxu will pick you up today.</i>

759
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,760
<i>He will be there in about 20 minutes.</i>

760
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,680
<i>Wait for him.</i>

761
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,200
Got it.

762
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,600
<i>Also, be good.</i>

763
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,200
<i>Don't cause him trouble.</i>

764
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,240
When have I caused him trouble?

765
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,240
<i>All right, I'm just saying.</i>

766
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,000
<i>I have to go. Bye.</i>

767
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,600
Why would I cause him trouble?

768
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,880
Sang Zhi.

769
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,760
Can you come with me to buy something?

770
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,080
I'm not going to tell Mom and Dad.

771
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,080
They're at work.

772
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,360
Coming here would be a hassle.

773
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,360
I already helped you take the day off.

774
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,280
Don't worry.

775
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,240
Here. Hold on tight.

776
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,720
Look at what this is.

777
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,120
I'll unwrap one for you.

778
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,320
Here.

779
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,120
So

780
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,280
did you purposely leave
to buy me some candy?

781
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,000
You wish.

782
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,520
I went to buy water for Duan Jiaxu.

783
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,720
I got one for you in passing.

784
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,880
It was all your fault today.

785
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,720
You call me ugly every day

786
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,760
-and I don't complain.
-That's different.

787
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,680
How so?

788
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,880
I'm speaking the truth.

789
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,240
Go!

790
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,880
I'm not a horse!
