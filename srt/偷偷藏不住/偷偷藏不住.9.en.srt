1
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:45,105
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

2
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:54,065
I'll go and focus on my great endeavors.

3
00:01:55,425 --> 00:01:56,705
Don't come back too late.

4
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:57,625
Okay.

5
00:01:58,425 --> 00:01:59,425
Be careful.

6
00:01:59,505 --> 00:02:00,705
-Bye.
-Stay safe.

7
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:01,625
Bye.

8
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:20,465
I forgot to tell you.

9
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:23,305
You should treat Duan Jiaxu to dinner

10
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:24,625
when you're free.

11
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:28,185
He's not snitching on you
but concerned about you.

12
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:30,585
Look.

13
00:02:30,665 --> 00:02:32,705
For the past two years, he kept asking

14
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,345
about your grades and life.

15
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:35,545
He didn't ask you directly

16
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:36,825
so you wouldn't feel pressured.

17
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:39,585
Whenever it was your birthday,

18
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:41,825
when you got good grades

19
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:43,825
or during the holidays,

20
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:45,825
he sent you all kinds of gifts.

21
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:48,025
He was flat broke himself,

22
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:49,345
but he still sent you gifts.

23
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:52,305
Remember, treat him to dinner.

24
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:05,465
IF YOU'RE EVER OUT SO LATE,
FIND SOMEONE TO ACCOMPANY YOU BACK

25
00:03:16,345 --> 00:03:17,985
I've been ignoring him.

26
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:20,385
Maybe that wasn't very nice of me.

27
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:24,505
After all, he hasn't done anything wrong.

28
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:28,305
From the start, he has been nice to me.

29
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:34,465
I feel like an ingrate now.

30
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:36,985
THE DREAM GAMES

31
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:38,905
Last year, A Dream of Jianghu's expansion,

32
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,905
Fury of Mount Guan hit the market.

33
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:42,065
The main theme was

34
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:43,585
an attachment to the homeland

35
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:44,945
and an underdog hero.

36
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:45,985
After it went online,

37
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:47,705
the reception was good.

38
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:49,625
The players also gave it stellar ratings.

39
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:51,025
So this year's expansion

40
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,585
is very important to us.

41
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,625
I mentioned this in past meetings.

42
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:56,905
I hope to see innovation and breakthroughs

43
00:03:56,985 --> 00:03:58,985
in all aspects.

44
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:02,385
Dawang, how are your preparations?

45
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:04,385
Everything is set.

46
00:04:04,465 --> 00:04:06,585
Unlike last year's Fury of Mount Guan,

47
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:08,345
we will be returning to the root

48
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:10,145
of martial arts fantasy and gameplay.

49
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:11,625
We will be releasing

50
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:14,105
unconventional martial arts playstyles.

51
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,465
They will serve as a mechanism

52
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:18,145
to create more novel stories and content.

53
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,785
I will now show you

54
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:21,865
the roadmap I came up with.

55
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:23,265
ROADMAP

56
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:26,065
I've designed updates to the maps,

57
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:28,105
characters, instances, and gameplay

58
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,945
around the main quest progression

59
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:31,825
of the new factions.

60
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:34,145
I also worked with colleagues
from the Art Department

61
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:35,545
to come up with a new solution

62
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,105
for the game art style.

63
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:40,225
I think this theme is pretty good.

64
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:41,465
It piques my interest.

65
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:44,265
We should make use of our time

66
00:04:44,345 --> 00:04:45,465
and conduct a player survey.

67
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:46,985
Now,

68
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:48,385
it has been over a year

69
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:51,345
since the last feature technical update.

70
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:53,385
Does anyone have any new ideas?

71
00:04:56,705 --> 00:04:57,585
Hold on.

72
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:01,465
I wonder if you still remember

73
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:04,145
the Celestial Progression System
that I proposed?

74
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:08,745
It uses an AI algorithm

75
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:10,345
for self-progression.

76
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:13,785
It makes the behavioral models
and feedback of our NPCs

77
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,905
a lot more life-like and logical.

78
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:19,345
It gives players the feeling

79
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:20,865
that every creation

80
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,145
has its own progression throughout time.

81
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:25,705
In other words, it recreates

82
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:27,545
a convincing martial arts world.

83
00:05:28,105 --> 00:05:30,905
But this proposal
had already been rejected.

84
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:31,945
I don't think

85
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:33,385
we have the technical prowess

86
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:34,545
to finish this plan.

87
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,745
That's true.

88
00:05:36,305 --> 00:05:38,625
Therefore, our team came up with a demo

89
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:39,825
based on pre-research

90
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:41,265
so we can show you.

91
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:46,385
You are now looking at the NPC

92
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:47,825
known as Fang Siming,

93
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:49,305
whom you're probably familiar with.

94
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:51,825
It's one of the popular characters
among the players

95
00:05:51,905 --> 00:05:52,905
of A Dream of Jianghu.

96
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,105
I'll now use him

97
00:05:54,185 --> 00:05:55,945
to demonstrate the pre-research effect

98
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:57,225
of our system.

99
00:05:57,305 --> 00:06:00,465
I will interact with the NPC as a player.

100
00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:03,545
Li Xun, help me with the feedback.

101
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,145
It's starting.

102
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:15,065
The NPC looks like
he's good at Wuchang chess.

103
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:16,105
Do you think so?

104
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:17,465
I bet he's better than Li Xun.

105
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:21,225
The NPC's reaction was quick.

106
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:22,145
He's agile.

107
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:24,905
It seems

108
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,985
that someone has failed to win a drink.

109
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:28,585
Instead, they owe me a drink.

110
00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:29,905
Li Xun lost!

111
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:32,185
All right.

112
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:34,665
I'll pay up next time. Put it on the tab.

113
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:35,665
Li Xun is backing out.

114
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:36,625
Fine, I owe you one.

115
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:39,265
-That's not cool, Li Xun.
-Put it on my tab. I'll pay next time.

116
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:40,865
A SWORD OF FROST

117
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:42,305
I'll remember this.

118
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:46,225
This drink is on me.

119
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:48,225
Do you care to accept it?

120
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:51,385
Not bad. He's even flirting with me.

121
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:55,145
During the design stage,

122
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:56,705
we set the character's interests

123
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:57,865
based on the game lore

124
00:06:57,945 --> 00:06:59,385
and the character's back story.

125
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:01,985
These NPCs are enthused when they interact

126
00:07:02,065 --> 00:07:03,585
with the players.

127
00:07:04,345 --> 00:07:06,105
They can react in a way

128
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:07,865
that forms a deeper connection

129
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:09,185
with the players.

130
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:12,785
But a different player

131
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,905
might not choose to play chess with him.

132
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:17,025
Is there a way for us to make the NPCs

133
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:20,065
flexibly handle any situation?

134
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:22,465
That involves the data

135
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:24,025
fed to the AI.

136
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:25,825
Our algorithm

137
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:28,985
will record every player's
experiences and behaviors

138
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:30,745
after they log into the game.

139
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,145
So the Celestial Progression System's NPCs

140
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:36,225
will come up with different reactions
and feedback

141
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:37,465
to different players.

142
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:39,385
We could give it a try right now.

143
00:07:39,465 --> 00:07:40,665
We can test it

144
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:43,585
with a more active account.

145
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:48,145
Fang Siming.

146
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:49,265
It has been a while.

147
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:51,185
Why are you drinking alone?

148
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:53,145
FOLLOW THE EGRET

149
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:54,945
I invited the moon to a drink.

150
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:56,305
My shadow, a second companion.

151
00:07:57,585 --> 00:07:59,705
There's no way
I can't get a drink from him.

152
00:07:59,785 --> 00:08:01,185
Laosan, get it for me.

153
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:02,145
Okay.

154
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:04,865
I don't care! I want it!

155
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,145
Bad footwork.

156
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,585
That won't get you a drink, my friend.

157
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:19,025
Fang Siming is an interesting guy.

158
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:22,705
Theoretically speaking,

159
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:25,705
when a large amount of data
is fed to the AI,

160
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:28,265
it will manifest its own behavior

161
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:30,625
when the amount of data
reaches a certain level.

162
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:32,144
This is the part

163
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:33,945
that AI researchers across the globe

164
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:35,664
are particularly interested in.

165
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,825
If we can have a technical upgrade

166
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:40,625
in this regard,

167
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:42,225
it could be a huge breakthrough

168
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:43,545
for our game.

169
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:46,825
But this is just a demo.

170
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:50,305
If we are to complete
this system successfully,

171
00:08:50,385 --> 00:08:53,465
we need to invest in a lot of NPCs
into the game.

172
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:57,345
Given our staff
and technical capabilities,

173
00:08:57,425 --> 00:08:59,345
I fear it might not be viable.

174
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:01,345
If we rush headlong into this,

175
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:04,345
we might add more risks to the project.

176
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:06,225
That is a problem.

177
00:09:08,985 --> 00:09:10,425
I need time

178
00:09:10,505 --> 00:09:11,665
to think this over.

179
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:13,945
Is there anything else

180
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:15,545
to present in this meeting?

181
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,945
No.

182
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:18,225
That's all for today.

183
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:19,145
Okay.

184
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,385
-Okay.
-Okay.

185
00:09:20,465 --> 00:09:21,585
Well done.

186
00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:23,785
You think that will be

187
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:25,185
a risky move, right?

188
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:27,785
I think it's a bit risky.

189
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:29,865
Jiaxu,

190
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,425
there are bound to be problems.

191
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,585
But there will also be solutions.

192
00:09:33,665 --> 00:09:34,905
Solutions outnumber problems.

193
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:37,265
Yes, Li Xun. Don't worry.

194
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:39,105
Keep at it.

195
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:45,625
It's all right.

196
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,105
We've just started.

197
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:48,145
This is normal.

198
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:51,265
I'll call for a meeting

199
00:09:51,345 --> 00:09:52,265
with our team.

200
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:53,985
Sure.

201
00:09:54,705 --> 00:09:55,945
-Keep at it.
-Keep at it.

202
00:09:56,505 --> 00:09:57,345
Your cup.

203
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:14,985
Jiaxu,

204
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,225
when might you be free?

205
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,145
If it is no trouble,

206
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:21,745
I would like to treat you to dinner

207
00:10:22,585 --> 00:10:24,185
as a thank you for taking me home.

208
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:33,025
If you are too busy at the moment,

209
00:10:33,105 --> 00:10:34,025
it is all right.

210
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,985
You can decide the time.

211
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:42,945
If you are not sure when you are free,

212
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:46,825
how about next weekend?

213
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:49,505
I would like to use this chance

214
00:10:49,585 --> 00:10:52,025
to express my gratitude to you.

215
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,385
"When might you be free?

216
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:30,425
If it is no trouble,

217
00:11:30,505 --> 00:11:32,385
I would like to treat you to dinner

218
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:34,585
as a thank you for taking me home."

219
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,665
Next weekend?

220
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:11,105
SANG ZHI

221
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:12,865
You may decide the time too.

222
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:14,745
How formal.

223
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,865
VOICE CALL INVITATION FROM JIAXU

224
00:12:23,425 --> 00:12:24,625
JIAXU

225
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:35,065
Hello, Jiaxu.

226
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:37,025
I'm free next weekend,

227
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:39,905
but I'm not sure about the specific time.

228
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:42,025
It's all right.

229
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:44,465
We can accommodate your schedule.

230
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:47,185
Okay.

231
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:48,185
By the way,

232
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:50,745
I'll take you
to a phone repair shop as well.

233
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,145
My phone?

234
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:54,585
Why would I repair it?

235
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:56,625
Isn't it broken?

236
00:12:56,705 --> 00:12:57,985
It's not.

237
00:13:00,065 --> 00:13:01,745
I thought it must be broken.

238
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:03,345
Your texts are so formal.

239
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:07,825
Where did that come from?

240
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,665
You were never so formal with me.

241
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:12,305
Your words are so polite.

242
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,785
I remember now.

243
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:18,745
Does this mean

244
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:21,065
I have a place in your heart?

245
00:13:29,705 --> 00:13:30,545
Jiaxu.

246
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:32,425
Here's the thing.

247
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:34,945
My dad told me

248
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:38,505
to be respectful to anyone older than me

249
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:39,825
by five years or more.

250
00:13:39,905 --> 00:13:42,105
If I remember correctly,
you're five years older than me.

251
00:13:42,665 --> 00:13:45,705
Your voice sounds young,

252
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:47,545
but you can't fool anyone.

253
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,505
You're not young anymore.

254
00:13:49,585 --> 00:13:51,265
-So--
-I'm hanging up now. Bye.

255
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:52,985
Wait.

256
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:54,385
Hello?

257
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,185
I have something else to tell you.

258
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:05,065
What is it?

259
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,745
I didn't mean to ignore you

260
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:12,305
by not replying or calling you back.

261
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:14,585
I was living on campus.

262
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:16,305
I didn't have my phone with me.

263
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:19,385
I know.

264
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:21,585
Your brother told me that.

265
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:22,545
You knew?

266
00:14:23,425 --> 00:14:25,185
Then why did you even ask?

267
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:28,825
Okay, that's it.

268
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:29,905
That's all for now.

269
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:30,865
I'm done.

270
00:14:30,945 --> 00:14:32,025
Bye.

271
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:26,865
CHAPTER NINE, UNDERCURRENT

272
00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:28,785
I CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE

273
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:35,665
Wait for me!

274
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:37,265
-Okay.
-Wait for me.

275
00:15:37,945 --> 00:15:38,985
-Hurry up.
-Where is Weiwei?

276
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:42,585
No idea. She left in a hurry this morning.

277
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:44,105
Maybe she went to a club meeting.

278
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:45,065
Who knows?

279
00:15:45,585 --> 00:15:46,505
Sang Zhi.

280
00:15:48,545 --> 00:15:49,585
Jiang Ming.

281
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:50,665
What are you doing here?

282
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:52,305
I'm here for Sang Zhi.

283
00:15:52,865 --> 00:15:54,185
Me?

284
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:55,985
What is it?

285
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:02,625
Everyone,

286
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:04,825
look at who's coming.

287
00:16:07,305 --> 00:16:08,825
Ning Wei!

288
00:16:09,425 --> 00:16:10,305
What's going on?

289
00:16:10,905 --> 00:16:12,185
The two of us

290
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:13,945
are dating.

291
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:16,025
Yes, we can see that.

292
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:17,745
Ning Wei.

293
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:20,305
You don't waste any time, do you?

294
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:22,545
Are those matching outfits?

295
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,545
Yes.

296
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:28,065
That's right.

297
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:30,265
You were here to see Sangsang.

298
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,745
I got premiere tickets last night.

299
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:34,665
Sang Zhi,

300
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,105
would you like to go with me?

301
00:16:38,745 --> 00:16:40,145
Are you inviting her only?

302
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,465
That's not nice.

303
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:42,465
Indeed.

304
00:16:42,545 --> 00:16:43,625
Shut it.

305
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:45,945
If you're all free, feel free to join us.

306
00:16:46,025 --> 00:16:47,265
-We're free.
-Yes.

307
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:48,505
-Yes.
-Okay.

308
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:49,825
This Sunday at 8:00 p.m.,

309
00:16:49,905 --> 00:16:51,065
meet at Joy City Cinema.

310
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:53,225
-Okay.
-Hold on. This Sunday?

311
00:16:53,865 --> 00:16:54,905
I probably can't make it.

312
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:56,265
I already have plans.

313
00:16:56,345 --> 00:16:57,465
What plans?

314
00:16:57,545 --> 00:16:58,705
No, Sangsang.

315
00:16:58,785 --> 00:16:59,705
Come with us.

316
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,185
-Come on.
-Let's go together.

317
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:02,985
It has been ages
since we've watched a movie.

318
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,665
If things get awkward

319
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:05,985
during dinner with him,

320
00:17:06,545 --> 00:17:07,905
I'll have an excuse to leave.

321
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:10,184
Come on.

322
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:12,105
We'll go. Sunday, 8:00 p.m.

323
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:13,224
Great.

324
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:14,745
-We'll go.
-See you at the cinema.

325
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,065
-Okay.
-See you there.

326
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,065
This is all thank you to you.

327
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:19,585
-Let's go to class.
-Thank you.

328
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:23,665
We have a class now.

329
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,505
Let's go.

330
00:17:28,265 --> 00:17:29,185
Come on.

331
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:30,425
-Bye!
-Chen Qiang!

332
00:17:30,505 --> 00:17:31,385
Let's go.

333
00:17:35,705 --> 00:17:36,585
I'm coming.

334
00:17:48,385 --> 00:17:49,905
Are you Mr. Duan Jiaxu?

335
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,345
-Yes.
-Your parcel.

336
00:17:51,425 --> 00:17:52,745
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

337
00:17:57,305 --> 00:17:59,265
TO DUAN JIAXU, FROM JIANG YING

338
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,865
Did you receive the parcel?

339
00:18:10,945 --> 00:18:12,665
I sent you some tonics

340
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:15,025
and an essential oil lamp
for stress relief.

341
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:16,665
Take care of yourself.

342
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:18,825
Let's have dinner sometime.

343
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:37,865
JIANG YING, TRANSFER AMOUNT: 8,000 YUAN

344
00:18:37,945 --> 00:18:39,105
WAITING FOR JIANG YING
TO CONFIRM TRANSFER

345
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:48,905
I've wired the last compensation payment.

346
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:50,305
Do not contact me again.

347
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:02,545
Okay.

348
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,825
It makes your skin look fair.

349
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:06,305
DUAN JIAXU

350
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:07,985
I'VE WIRED
THE LAST COMPENSATION PAYMENT.

351
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,545
DO NOT CONTACT ME AGAIN.

352
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:14,185
JIANG YING

353
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:23,905
Don't contact you again? What do you mean?

354
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:33,905
JIANG YING

355
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:43,785
Jiaxu, when will you be free?

356
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:45,185
Can we meet up?

357
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:08,465
JIANG YING

358
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:14,625
Come on, the meeting is starting.

359
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:15,745
In a moment.

360
00:20:24,545 --> 00:20:26,665
Have you only eaten half an egg today?

361
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:27,825
You also skipped lunch.

362
00:20:28,505 --> 00:20:30,225
I'll eat it during the meeting.

363
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:32,865
I'll bring it inside for you.

364
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:08,145
I've decided to employ Xiaoduan's idea.

365
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:11,585
The Celestial Progression System
will be the new feature.

366
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,505
However, the new storyline,

367
00:21:14,585 --> 00:21:17,025
instances, factions, and maps

368
00:21:17,105 --> 00:21:19,185
must remain the main focus.

369
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:22,065
If we are going down this path,

370
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:23,825
the Planning and Art Departments

371
00:21:23,905 --> 00:21:25,425
will fully cooperate.

372
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:28,505
But given the current circumstances,

373
00:21:28,585 --> 00:21:31,185
I can't come up with a way
to assign the work

374
00:21:31,265 --> 00:21:34,585
so that everyone
can deliver quality work on time.

375
00:21:35,105 --> 00:21:36,985
Whether the Celestial Progression System

376
00:21:37,065 --> 00:21:39,505
is compatible with most smartphones

377
00:21:39,585 --> 00:21:40,545
is also another problem.

378
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,545
Dawang's concern is justified.

379
00:21:43,305 --> 00:21:44,785
Jiaxu,

380
00:21:44,865 --> 00:21:46,425
do you have a solution for that?

381
00:21:48,705 --> 00:21:51,505
Well, my idea so far

382
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:53,665
is to take some workload off
other departments

383
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,905
with technical methods.

384
00:21:55,985 --> 00:21:57,665
For example,

385
00:21:57,745 --> 00:21:59,025
manual form filling and whatnot

386
00:21:59,105 --> 00:22:00,785
can be done with technology.

387
00:22:02,985 --> 00:22:04,305
Since it has been decided,

388
00:22:04,385 --> 00:22:06,065
let's give it our best.

389
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:07,825
We'll solve every problem along the way.

390
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:08,745
Okay?

391
00:22:08,825 --> 00:22:11,425
If you ever need coordination,

392
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:12,585
just let us know.

393
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:16,665
Dawang and Xiaoduan will be in charge

394
00:22:16,745 --> 00:22:17,825
of this new project.

395
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:21,465
Let's go.

396
00:22:26,385 --> 00:22:27,585
Let's go.

397
00:22:27,665 --> 00:22:28,745
Back to work.

398
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:29,705
All the best.

399
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,465
Hello, Jiaxu. I'm here.

400
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:08,705
Where are you?

401
00:23:10,865 --> 00:23:12,305
Sorry, Sang Zhi.

402
00:23:12,385 --> 00:23:14,265
I don't think I can make it tonight.

403
00:23:19,505 --> 00:23:20,825
Are you working overtime?

404
00:23:21,785 --> 00:23:22,785
Yes.

405
00:23:22,865 --> 00:23:24,385
Order something for yourself.

406
00:23:24,465 --> 00:23:25,625
Don't starve.

407
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:30,865
Your voice sounds off.

408
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:33,785
Are you not feeling well?

409
00:23:34,785 --> 00:23:35,705
Not at all.

410
00:23:40,225 --> 00:23:41,305
What's wrong?

411
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:44,945
It's just a little stomach pain.

412
00:23:45,585 --> 00:23:47,185
Maybe it's food poisoning.

413
00:23:47,265 --> 00:23:49,465
It's all right.
I'll just take some medicine.

414
00:23:49,545 --> 00:23:51,785
But shouldn't you go to the hospital?

415
00:23:53,345 --> 00:23:55,225
No need. This is nothing serious.

416
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:58,625
Why don't you go to the hospital?

417
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:00,345
Holding off the pain won't make it better.

418
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:02,745
Where is your office located?

419
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:05,905
Don't trouble yourself.

420
00:24:05,985 --> 00:24:06,865
I'm all right.

421
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:09,785
Where is your office located?

422
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:15,305
Gangbei Complex.

423
00:24:17,225 --> 00:24:18,665
Okay, I'll be right there.

424
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:22,465
Hello, sir.

425
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:23,385
Gangbei Complex.

426
00:24:36,905 --> 00:24:37,985
THE DREAM GAMES

427
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:44,425
Sang Zhi.

428
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,425
What are you doing here?

429
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:48,985
-You came.
-Are you feeling better?

430
00:24:49,065 --> 00:24:50,905
It's nothing. It's just a stomachache.

431
00:24:50,985 --> 00:24:52,665
Wait here. I'll get a taxi.

432
00:24:52,745 --> 00:24:54,225
I'll take you to the hospital.

433
00:24:54,305 --> 00:24:55,185
Sang Zhi.

434
00:24:56,265 --> 00:24:58,505
-I'll go with you.
-Just wait here for me.

435
00:24:58,585 --> 00:24:59,625
It's all right.

436
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,505
Let me take this.

437
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:04,745
Lean on me.

438
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:06,745
-I'm okay.
-Let's go.

439
00:25:07,665 --> 00:25:09,025
Come on. Watch your step.

440
00:25:12,305 --> 00:25:14,545
Are you helping an old man, kiddo?

441
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:16,705
Can you walk on your own?

442
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:20,465
I…

443
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:22,985
-Slowly.
-I'm not saying you're a kid.

444
00:25:23,545 --> 00:25:24,545
It's all right.

445
00:25:27,585 --> 00:25:28,505
Be careful.

446
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:31,585
Wait here for me.

447
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:32,505
Okay.

448
00:25:32,585 --> 00:25:33,425
Wait here.

449
00:25:37,785 --> 00:25:38,705
Hey.

450
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:45,025
Be careful.

451
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:46,625
Be careful.

452
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:52,905
I'll book a ride.

453
00:25:56,545 --> 00:25:57,385
What is the address?

454
00:26:21,905 --> 00:26:23,545
I didn't mean to do that.

455
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,185
I didn't mean to either.

456
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,225
Jiaxu, get in the car.

457
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:44,865
HAIXIA TAXI

458
00:26:44,945 --> 00:26:45,825
Watch out.

459
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:46,905
-I'm fine.
-Mind your head.

460
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:48,625
Hello.

461
00:26:50,585 --> 00:26:52,065
-Hello.
-Hello.

462
00:26:54,265 --> 00:26:56,425
Is he drunk or something?

463
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:59,065
-No.
-Is he going to throw up?

464
00:26:59,145 --> 00:27:00,545
No, sir.

465
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:02,545
Sir, I won't throw up.

466
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:03,505
I can hang in there.

467
00:27:03,585 --> 00:27:05,585
No, let me say this first.

468
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,105
If you throw up in the car,

469
00:27:07,185 --> 00:27:08,145
you pay 200 yuan.

470
00:27:08,225 --> 00:27:09,145
Okay?

471
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:10,505
He won't throw up.

472
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:11,705
He has stomach pains.

473
00:27:11,785 --> 00:27:12,665
Go to the hospital.

474
00:27:12,745 --> 00:27:14,025
Take us to the hospital.

475
00:27:14,105 --> 00:27:15,985
-Okay.
-Sir, please hurry.

476
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:16,905
Okay.

477
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:31,985
OUTPATIENT BUILDING

478
00:27:32,065 --> 00:27:33,585
Judging by the ultrasound,

479
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:34,665
it's acute appendicitis.

480
00:27:34,745 --> 00:27:36,865
And you waited to come in.

481
00:27:36,945 --> 00:27:38,825
Had you come any later,
it would've ruptured.

482
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:40,185
What do we do now?

483
00:27:40,265 --> 00:27:41,465
One is conservative therapy.

484
00:27:41,545 --> 00:27:43,625
-We admit you and ease the inflammation.
-I see.

485
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:44,585
The other method

486
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:45,945
is going straight to surgery.

487
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:48,145
-Then--
-Do the surgery.

488
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:49,265
Okay.

489
00:27:51,785 --> 00:27:52,865
It will be all right.

490
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:02,785
Sang Zhi.

491
00:28:04,945 --> 00:28:06,945
It's late. Head back to campus.

492
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:09,225
It will be unsafe later.

493
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:10,945
I'll wait for you outside.

494
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:14,225
It's not a major surgery.

495
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:16,305
-It's okay.
-I'll wait for you.

496
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:18,385
The surgery will take--

497
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:19,465
Stop talking.

498
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:22,745
Go and get yourself something to eat.

499
00:28:42,945 --> 00:28:45,585
Had we not had plans for dinner today,

500
00:28:46,585 --> 00:28:48,465
he would have just held it off

501
00:28:49,585 --> 00:28:50,985
and never come to the hospital.

502
00:29:01,225 --> 00:29:03,025
"Avoid overworking.

503
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:05,185
Avoid alcohol."

504
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:06,145
MOM

505
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:12,265
Hello, Mom.

506
00:29:12,905 --> 00:29:13,985
Hello, Zhizhi.

507
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:17,865
It's past ten. Why haven't you called me?

508
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:19,625
Are you at the dorm

509
00:29:19,705 --> 00:29:21,025
or hanging out with friends?

510
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:22,505
No.

511
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:27,425
Do you remember Sang Yan's classmate?

512
00:29:27,505 --> 00:29:29,825
He gave me physics lessons

513
00:29:29,905 --> 00:29:31,345
when I was in high school.

514
00:29:31,425 --> 00:29:32,305
Duan Jiaxu.

515
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:35,305
I remember. Xiaoduan, right?

516
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,185
We had plans to have dinner together,

517
00:29:40,265 --> 00:29:42,105
but he suddenly fell ill,

518
00:29:42,185 --> 00:29:44,025
so I took him to the hospital.

519
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:45,145
Is he sick?

520
00:29:45,865 --> 00:29:46,745
What is it?

521
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:47,865
Is it serious?

522
00:29:48,345 --> 00:29:49,865
Acute appendicitis.

523
00:29:49,945 --> 00:29:51,505
He's in surgery now.

524
00:29:55,265 --> 00:29:56,745
Poor thing.

525
00:29:56,825 --> 00:29:58,345
He doesn't have a family.

526
00:29:59,745 --> 00:30:01,825
What do you mean?

527
00:30:01,905 --> 00:30:03,745
His home is in Yihe, isn't it?

528
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:09,105
I never told you about his background.

529
00:30:12,025 --> 00:30:12,905
Mr. Sang.

530
00:30:14,425 --> 00:30:15,745
There are 6,000 yuan left

531
00:30:15,825 --> 00:30:16,665
after the funeral.

532
00:30:16,745 --> 00:30:18,305
I'm returning this to you.

533
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:20,265
I'll pay you the remaining balance

534
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:21,385
after I get a job.

535
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:24,105
Xiaoduan, keep the money for yourself.

536
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:25,425
Don't rush to repay us.

537
00:30:25,505 --> 00:30:28,105
No, you have to take the money.

538
00:30:28,185 --> 00:30:29,025
Keep it.

539
00:30:30,785 --> 00:30:31,985
Keep the money and use it.

540
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,825
You've been through a lot.

541
00:30:37,745 --> 00:30:38,865
I'm all right.

542
00:30:38,945 --> 00:30:40,305
It was nothing.

543
00:30:43,945 --> 00:30:44,905
Mr. and Mrs. Sang,

544
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:47,545
you should take the money.

545
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:50,305
There are other things I must attend to.

546
00:30:50,385 --> 00:30:51,385
I should get going.

547
00:30:52,305 --> 00:30:53,145
Thank you for your time.

548
00:30:54,985 --> 00:30:55,905
Xiaoduan.

549
00:30:56,785 --> 00:30:58,385
Dinner is ready.

550
00:30:58,465 --> 00:30:59,385
Eat before you go.

551
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:11,145
No, thank you, Mrs. Sang.

552
00:31:11,225 --> 00:31:12,105
Thank you

553
00:31:13,065 --> 00:31:15,585
for looking after me during this time.

554
00:31:16,065 --> 00:31:17,185
Without you…

555
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:20,105
Thank you so much.

556
00:31:20,185 --> 00:31:21,465
You don't have to do this, child.

557
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:24,505
Stand up.

558
00:31:26,265 --> 00:31:27,345
I'm going to go.

559
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:37,905
The poor child.

560
00:31:37,985 --> 00:31:40,625
He's just a college freshman
about 18 years old.

561
00:31:41,345 --> 00:31:43,065
Who knows what else he will face?

562
00:31:43,545 --> 00:31:46,345
Sang Yan, look after him in school.

563
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:48,425
Okay.

564
00:31:49,585 --> 00:31:51,145
In less than six months,

565
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:52,705
he paid us back the rest of the sum.

566
00:31:54,265 --> 00:31:55,465
But his mom

567
00:31:56,945 --> 00:31:58,185
had passed away.

568
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:02,425
Zhizhi.

569
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:06,025
Don't stay out too late.

570
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:08,345
Be safe on the way back.

571
00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:13,505
I'm hanging up now.

572
00:32:31,905 --> 00:32:33,505
He has to be hospitalized for seven days.

573
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,545
He can't have solid food for now.

574
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,585
He has to be on a liquid diet for a week.

575
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:39,905
Should anything come up, just let us know.

576
00:32:41,305 --> 00:32:42,185
Thank you.

577
00:32:42,265 --> 00:32:43,145
Thank you.

578
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:56,505
Jiaxu.

579
00:32:57,145 --> 00:32:58,425
I asked the nurses.

580
00:32:58,985 --> 00:33:00,305
They said these are what you need

581
00:33:00,385 --> 00:33:01,665
while you're in the hospital.

582
00:33:02,225 --> 00:33:04,105
But if you need anything else,

583
00:33:04,185 --> 00:33:05,345
let me know.

584
00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:06,945
I'll get it for you.

585
00:33:07,545 --> 00:33:08,745
Thank you, Sang Zhi.

586
00:33:09,785 --> 00:33:10,905
It's getting late.

587
00:33:10,985 --> 00:33:12,545
You should head back to campus.

588
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:17,785
Get a taxi when you leave.

589
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:19,905
Send the plate number to me.

590
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,505
Let me know when you reach the dorm.

591
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:23,425
Okay?

592
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:24,465
Jiaxu.

593
00:33:25,705 --> 00:33:26,905
I'm not a kid anymore.

594
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:27,905
Don't worry about me.

595
00:33:27,985 --> 00:33:29,225
I know what to do.

596
00:33:30,665 --> 00:33:31,585
Okay.

597
00:33:31,665 --> 00:33:32,625
Leave the things here.

598
00:33:32,705 --> 00:33:33,905
I'll put them away later.

599
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:40,545
Did the wound hurt?

600
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:43,105
I got anesthetics,

601
00:33:43,665 --> 00:33:44,905
so it doesn't hurt at all.

602
00:33:44,985 --> 00:33:45,865
I don't feel a thing.

603
00:33:46,385 --> 00:33:47,585
Don't worry.

604
00:33:47,665 --> 00:33:48,905
Go back now.

605
00:33:51,585 --> 00:33:53,105
I'll visit you tomorrow.

606
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,705
Come when you don't have classes.

607
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:57,865
I'm an adult.

608
00:33:57,945 --> 00:33:59,825
Don't trouble yourself for me.

609
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,825
I'll be fine. Go on.

610
00:34:55,545 --> 00:34:56,945
Is she upset?

611
00:35:19,945 --> 00:35:22,545
She probably minds that.

612
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:39,625
Hello?

613
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:42,705
Hello, buddy.

614
00:35:43,545 --> 00:35:45,105
I heard you got your appendix cut out.

615
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:46,745
How does that feel?

616
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:50,785
Not bad. Would you like to try it?

617
00:35:52,345 --> 00:35:53,425
No, thank you.

618
00:35:53,505 --> 00:35:55,145
But I heard my sister took you there.

619
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:56,785
Yes.

620
00:35:57,545 --> 00:35:59,545
Did you have to trouble her
for such a small problem?

621
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,345
Couldn't you go to the hospital yourself?

622
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,385
Did you call just to tell me that?

623
00:36:04,025 --> 00:36:06,625
No, I had dinner with my parents.

624
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:08,145
They told me you were sick,

625
00:36:08,225 --> 00:36:09,545
so I called to celebrate.

626
00:36:10,265 --> 00:36:11,945
If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up.

627
00:36:12,025 --> 00:36:13,145
I'll carry on with my game.

628
00:36:15,185 --> 00:36:16,105
Hold on.

629
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:18,505
I want to tell you something.

630
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:20,905
What is it?

631
00:36:23,385 --> 00:36:25,025
Forget it. It's nothing important.

632
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:28,025
Buddy, can you not do this every time?

633
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:30,905
Just spill it like a real man!

634
00:36:31,505 --> 00:36:32,865
It's nothing. Bye.

635
00:36:34,345 --> 00:36:35,385
Hey!

636
00:36:50,265 --> 00:36:51,625
Why did you come back?

637
00:36:56,385 --> 00:36:57,305
Jiaxu.

638
00:36:58,185 --> 00:36:59,385
I gave it some thought.

639
00:37:01,265 --> 00:37:03,545
I should stay and look after you.

640
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:07,385
If I were to fall sick
and had no one by my side,

641
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:09,785
you would do the same for me.

642
00:37:10,745 --> 00:37:11,785
Right?

643
00:37:24,265 --> 00:37:25,425
Did you have dinner?

644
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:31,065
I brought dinner.

645
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:43,025
You haven't eaten.
Are you only having bread?

646
00:37:43,905 --> 00:37:44,905
Forget this.

647
00:37:44,985 --> 00:37:45,985
I'll order takeouts.

648
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:48,505
Don't do that. I'm not hungry.

649
00:37:49,065 --> 00:37:50,585
You haven't eaten all day.

650
00:37:50,665 --> 00:37:51,945
You must be starving.

651
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:53,025
I'm not hungry at all.

652
00:37:53,785 --> 00:37:55,945
If I were, I would get something to eat.

653
00:37:56,705 --> 00:37:57,825
I'm not a kid anymore.

654
00:37:58,465 --> 00:38:00,305
I don't need you to worry.

655
00:38:39,745 --> 00:38:41,545
She is stuffed like a pufferfish again.

656
00:38:58,865 --> 00:39:00,225
Jiaxu, what's so funny?

657
00:39:01,545 --> 00:39:02,825
Nothing.

658
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:12,065
Where are you going?

659
00:39:12,905 --> 00:39:14,545
I'm going to freshen up.

660
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:16,865
Go on.

661
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:51,425
He can't get out of bed today.

662
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,545
So he can't clean himself.

663
00:39:54,705 --> 00:39:56,105
Maybe I should help him wipe…

664
00:40:11,145 --> 00:40:12,385
Jiaxu.

665
00:40:12,465 --> 00:40:14,545
The doctor said you can't shower today.

666
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:16,065
Do you want to wipe your face?

667
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:17,105
Sure.

668
00:40:18,985 --> 00:40:19,905
I can help you.

669
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:21,825
It's okay. I'll manage.

670
00:40:21,905 --> 00:40:23,905
What if you open up your wound?

671
00:40:25,705 --> 00:40:27,625
You'll have to spend even more days here.

672
00:40:30,545 --> 00:40:31,425
All right.

673
00:42:05,705 --> 00:42:07,865
I don't have a nice outfit
to wear to the movie!

674
00:42:08,505 --> 00:42:09,865
It's just across from campus.

675
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:11,385
You still spent ages on your makeup.

676
00:42:11,465 --> 00:42:12,305
Let's go.

677
00:42:12,385 --> 00:42:13,905
Of course it's necessary!

678
00:42:13,985 --> 00:42:15,545
Girls want to look their best

679
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,705
when meeting someone they like.

680
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,105
You don't get it.

681
00:42:19,185 --> 00:42:20,425
Okay, I don't get it.

682
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:22,265
Ning Wei is a love expert.

683
00:42:22,345 --> 00:42:23,505
Come on.

684
00:42:25,345 --> 00:42:26,625
Wait for me.

685
00:42:26,705 --> 00:42:28,545
You look good enough. Let's go.

686
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:30,105
Just wait for a second!

687
00:42:30,185 --> 00:42:31,265
Hurry up.

688
00:42:31,345 --> 00:42:32,545
I know. Stop rushing me.

689
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:33,585
Bye, Sangsang.

690
00:42:33,665 --> 00:42:34,505
Bye.

691
00:42:35,105 --> 00:42:36,025
Hurry up!

692
00:42:36,505 --> 00:42:37,345
I'll be right there.

693
00:42:37,425 --> 00:42:38,665
We're leaving. Bye!

694
00:42:38,745 --> 00:42:39,865
-Hurry up!
-See you later.

695
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:41,705
Bye!

696
00:42:58,505 --> 00:42:59,625
It has been so long.

697
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:01,345
You've learned how to put on makeup.

698
00:43:01,425 --> 00:43:02,865
You're indeed different from before.
