ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

2
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:53,625
Jiaxu, what will you be doing

3
00:01:54,105 --> 00:01:55,185
while I study?

4
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:57,585
I will

5
00:01:57,665 --> 00:01:58,865
just be sitting here.

6
00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:02,185
You'll just be sitting here?

7
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:05,265
I want to look at you more.

8
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:37,465
Is that enough for you?

9
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:40,425
If you don't leave,
I won't be able to focus.

10
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:56,745
Can't I stay here

11
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,305
without saying a word?

12
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:04,825
You said you won't

13
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:06,345
get in the way of my studies.

14
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:18,745
All right then.

15
00:03:21,425 --> 00:03:23,145
You're such a cruel girlfriend.

16
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:27,505
Go ahead and study.

17
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:35,225
What do you want to eat?

18
00:03:35,305 --> 00:03:36,505
I'll make you something tasty.

19
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,225
Zhizhi has been studying hard.

20
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,625
I'm fine with anything

21
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:47,505
as long as you make it.

22
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:51,025
Okay.

23
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,345
Then let me know if you need anything.

24
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:56,505
Jiaxu.

25
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:58,985
Why does it feel like
you're taking care of a kid?

26
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:00,665
That's what I'm doing.

27
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,825
I'm afraid

28
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:04,745
someone might steal my kiddo.

00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:25,185
CHAPTER 18, CAPTIVATED

30
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,825
THE TASTE OF FIRST LOVE

31
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:45,545
Jiaxu.

32
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,185
I think your cooking is really delicious.

33
00:04:49,585 --> 00:04:50,585
Do you like it?

34
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,185
Not just anyone gets to taste it.

35
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:54,905
You're the first one.

36
00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:09,305
-Are you full?
-I'm full.

37
00:05:12,185 --> 00:05:13,545
Are you full?

38
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:15,545
Are you full too?

39
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:17,905
Give it to me. I'll do the dishes.

40
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,665
Get some rest. I can do the dishes.

41
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:22,065
Let me help you with something.

42
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:23,425
You already cooked.

43
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:24,825
So I'll do the dishes.

44
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:26,665
You can rest.

45
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:30,545
Okay.

46
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,385
-I'll bring you the dishes.
-Okay.

47
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,105
Just leave them here.

48
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:49,465
Here.

49
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:12,545
Don't you know how to do housework?

50
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,025
Why don't I take over?

51
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,465
I'll learn after doing it a few times.

52
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:18,585
Why do you need to learn?

53
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:20,985
I never said you have to learn.

54
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:23,545
I can't let you do everything yourself

55
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,505
in the future.

56
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:30,185
I am thinking

57
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:32,385
too far ahead.

58
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:33,865
I know.

59
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:36,825
So after this,

60
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:39,225
do you want to chat with me

61
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:40,545
or rest for a while?

62
00:06:43,385 --> 00:06:45,185
I haven't finished studying.

63
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:46,785
You'll study?

64
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:48,905
Aren't you sleepy? Take a nap.

65
00:06:48,985 --> 00:06:50,105
I'm not sleepy.

66
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,425
You sure are serious about your studies.

67
00:06:57,185 --> 00:06:58,705
I'm aiming for a scholarship.

68
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:01,465
Okay.

69
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:03,225
Zhizhi is the most ambitious.

70
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:05,665
I'll help you with the dishes.

71
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,705
I'm sleepy.

72
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:36,985
Why am I so sleepy?

73
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:09,465
Hello.

74
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,745
It has been a long time.

75
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:26,705
I'll nap for five minutes.

76
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:28,225
I should take a five-minute nap.

77
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:30,105
Five minutes will do.

78
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:43,145
Do you want water, Zhizhi?

79
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:44,825
I'm coming in.

80
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:02,105
Where is she?

81
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:03,625
Where did she go?

82
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:14,825
What are you doing?

83
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,625
I am

84
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:21,145
memorizing vocabulary.

85
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,465
Why are you doing it on the floor?

86
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:26,185
This is more exciting,
so I won't feel sleepy.

87
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:28,105
Exciting?

88
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:49,665
Do you like excitement?

89
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:55,625
Then let's make it exciting.

90
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:09,625
Duan Jiaxu, why are you being naughty?

91
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:14,425
We're already together.

92
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,665
How can it be called naughty?

93
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:32,865
Tell me.

94
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:35,345
How did you end up on the floor?

95
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:39,785
I was studying.

96
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:43,105
Then I got sleepy and wanted to nap.

97
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:47,345
But I was adamant earlier about studying.

98
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:48,265
I…

99
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:51,185
If you saw me sleeping,

100
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:54,105
I was afraid you would think
I was ignoring you, so…

101
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:57,025
I'm not that petty.

102
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:58,945
Take a nap.

103
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:00,065
I'll wake you up later.

104
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:07,145
Lie down.

105
00:12:12,185 --> 00:12:14,825
Well, won't you feel bored?

106
00:12:16,705 --> 00:12:17,865
A little bit.

107
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:21,865
But

108
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:25,545
I'm already happy
that you came here to study.

109
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:31,105
Take your nap now.

110
00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:43,545
What's the matter?

111
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:46,945
Jiaxu.

112
00:12:48,905 --> 00:12:49,945
It's not

113
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:52,465
that I don't like you

114
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:53,905
being like this.

115
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:56,385
It's because I get nervous

116
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:57,545
when you get close to me.

117
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,105
I don't know why either.

118
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:00,625
So…

119
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:04,105
I just want to tell you

120
00:13:04,185 --> 00:13:05,985
that it's not that I don't like you.

121
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,065
That means you like me.

122
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:24,625
Well…

123
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:27,865
I just don't like being too…

124
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:32,985
I get it.

125
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:35,065
If so,

126
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:37,625
we'll see how it goes.

127
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:42,385
Take your nap.

128
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:57,105
Call me if you need anything.

129
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:35,065
You eat it.

130
00:14:41,305 --> 00:14:43,065
Maybe I should have one.

131
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:47,065
What flavor do you want?

132
00:14:47,145 --> 00:14:48,385
Any flavor will do.

133
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,465
This one then.

134
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:04,625
Giving candy or holding hands?

135
00:15:17,145 --> 00:15:19,025
Holding hands or holding hands?

136
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:28,825
Well, holding hands it is.

137
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:36,945
Why are you asking this so seriously?

138
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,625
Can I hold your hand?

139
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:32,905
Have you been

140
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,105
applying for internships?

141
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:40,945
I've sent my resume to several companies,

142
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:42,745
but I haven't received any replies.

143
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:45,305
Why do you suddenly want an internship?

144
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,225
Well…

145
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,545
I want to give it a try.

146
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:03,625
Thank you.

147
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,105
Jiaxu.

148
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:18,305
When people hold hands,

149
00:17:19,224 --> 00:17:21,545
they either do it when crossing the street

150
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,385
or by accident.

151
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:25,265
No one would do what you did

152
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:27,145
and ask to hold hands.

153
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:29,625
That was so strange.

154
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:34,545
I chose to do that

155
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:35,945
because I made you upset

156
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:37,705
when I kissed you

157
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:38,865
without asking.

158
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:40,345
I wasn't upset.

159
00:17:43,305 --> 00:17:44,265
I was

160
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:47,105
nervous.

161
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:51,945
I know.

162
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:53,905
Now,

163
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:56,385
you suddenly became my girlfriend.

164
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:58,745
Do you find it hard to get used to?

165
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,545
Not at all.

166
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,105
Don't imagine things.

167
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:17,185
Have I not told you this?

168
00:18:22,345 --> 00:18:23,745
I really like you.

169
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:33,305
I do like you a lot.

170
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:05,385
Me too.

171
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:08,305
I like you a lot.

172
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:44,745
DUAN JIAXU

173
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,185
You have to wake up early tomorrow,

174
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:47,345
so go to bed early.

175
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:48,825
Good night.

176
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:12,385
Hello?

177
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:13,505
Hey, Duan Jiaxu.

178
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:16,265
I'm going to Yihe
for work again next week.

179
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:18,065
Treat me to something delicious this time.

180
00:20:18,145 --> 00:20:19,945
Don't give me fried chicken and milk tea.

181
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:21,825
Okay, no problem.

182
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:23,665
I'll give you a seafood feast this time.

183
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:24,825
How about that?

184
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:26,825
Why are you suddenly so generous?

185
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,945
There must be a reason
for this abnormal behavior.

186
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:32,705
Buddy, could it be

187
00:20:33,985 --> 00:20:35,065
that you've gotten the girl?

188
00:20:37,865 --> 00:20:38,705
Yes.

189
00:20:38,785 --> 00:20:40,545
Way to go!

190
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:43,105
You have to thank me for this.

191
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:44,945
You couldn't have done it without me.

192
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:46,785
Yes, so you can

193
00:20:46,865 --> 00:20:49,225
order anything you want to eat, okay?

194
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:53,025
How nice.

195
00:20:53,105 --> 00:20:56,065
That means you might get married
earlier than Sang Yan.

196
00:20:56,145 --> 00:20:57,465
We should rile him up a bit.

197
00:20:57,545 --> 00:20:58,825
I can't stand him anymore.

198
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:01,185
No, I'm going to do it now.

199
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:04,505
Hey, what are you doing?

200
00:21:04,585 --> 00:21:05,425
QIAN FEI

201
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:06,945
Jiaxu has a girlfriend now!

202
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:07,945
And I made it happen!

203
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:10,265
I require worshiping applause
and admiration now!

204
00:21:10,345 --> 00:21:11,305
To Sang Yan.

205
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:20,385
Buddy,

206
00:21:20,465 --> 00:21:22,385
I have to admit something to you.

207
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:24,185
I haven't been completely honest with you.

208
00:21:24,745 --> 00:21:25,945
What is it?

209
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,865
You know this girl too.

210
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:31,705
I know her?

211
00:21:32,745 --> 00:21:34,225
You're in Yihe and I'm in Nanwu.

212
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:35,265
How do I know her?

213
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:38,425
You didn't meet her in Yihe.

214
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,825
Not in Yihe?

215
00:21:40,905 --> 00:21:43,425
Do we have any juniors who work in Yihe?

216
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:44,985
I don't recall any.

217
00:21:45,065 --> 00:21:47,105
She's studying at a university in Yihe.

218
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:53,505
Studying?

219
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,105
Don't tell me

220
00:21:56,825 --> 00:21:57,985
it's Sang Zhi.

221
00:22:01,865 --> 00:22:03,225
Okay, that's all. Bye.

222
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:04,145
What?

223
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:07,785
Seriously, man.

224
00:22:07,865 --> 00:22:09,825
I really have to thank you for this.

225
00:22:09,905 --> 00:22:11,145
Why are you thanking me?

226
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:12,825
Did I help you with anything?

227
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:14,185
When you first met Sang Zhi,

228
00:22:14,265 --> 00:22:15,985
she was a short 14-year-old kid.

229
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:17,065
How could you…

230
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:20,785
Tell me.

231
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:22,785
Have you told Sang Yan about this?

232
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:25,705
I haven't told him yet.

233
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:28,465
When are you planning to tell him?

234
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:30,905
I plan to go to Nanwu
and tell him in person.

235
00:22:32,505 --> 00:22:33,865
I think it's better

236
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:36,905
to tell him in person about this.

237
00:22:36,985 --> 00:22:38,065
That's right.

238
00:22:38,145 --> 00:22:39,345
I have to recall that message.

239
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,825
He'll keep asking me if he sees it.

240
00:22:41,865 --> 00:22:42,865
Hey.

241
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,465
Sang Yan is calling me.

242
00:22:45,545 --> 00:22:46,865
Why did you even send that text?

243
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:48,745
Answer it.

244
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,225
If you don't,
there's no way to explain it.

245
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:52,865
Listen, I have nothing to do with this.

246
00:22:52,945 --> 00:22:54,545
You need to be honest with him. Bye now.

247
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,625
How about this? Do it with me.

248
00:22:56,705 --> 00:22:57,665
If you're not there,

249
00:22:57,745 --> 00:22:59,985
I really might say the wrong thing.

250
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:02,905
SANG YAN INVITES YOU TO A GROUP CALL

251
00:23:02,985 --> 00:23:04,545
OTHERS JOINING THE CALL

252
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,065
Hey, Duan Jiaxu.

253
00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:08,265
Did you lose your marbles somewhere

254
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,265
for you to ask Qian Fei
to help you get a girl?

255
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:12,665
What's wrong with asking me?

256
00:23:13,385 --> 00:23:15,545
No, you should ask me about these things.

257
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:16,585
How could you go to him?

258
00:23:16,665 --> 00:23:18,305
But then again, I don't go after girls.

259
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:20,465
Usually, the girls go wild for me.

260
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:22,745
Qian Fei is an expert at pursuing girls.

261
00:23:22,825 --> 00:23:24,185
Get lost.

262
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:25,785
Tell me

263
00:23:25,865 --> 00:23:28,025
who the unlucky girl is.

264
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:33,785
She is indeed pretty unlucky.

265
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:36,585
But I still need to thank Qian Fei

266
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,665
for his help this time.

267
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:39,545
What does it have to do with me?

268
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:40,505
I…

269
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,425
Duan Jiaxu, how could I have helped?

270
00:23:43,025 --> 00:23:44,785
Besides, I didn't pursue my wife.

271
00:23:44,865 --> 00:23:46,145
My wife pursued me.

272
00:23:47,105 --> 00:23:48,625
Did you really not help him with it?

273
00:23:49,545 --> 00:23:51,225
Qian Fei, why are you so worked up?

274
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,985
Am I?

275
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,985
Why would I be? I don't know anything.

276
00:23:56,105 --> 00:23:58,185
Qian Fei, you're acting a bit strange.

277
00:23:58,265 --> 00:24:00,145
You could brag about this for three years,

278
00:24:00,225 --> 00:24:01,745
but you're actually denying it.

279
00:24:02,545 --> 00:24:04,385
Maybe I've become mature tonight.

280
00:24:04,465 --> 00:24:05,505
I can't believe you two.

281
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:07,265
Are you shutting me out? Fine.

282
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:08,545
Sang Yan.

283
00:24:09,025 --> 00:24:10,505
I'll be back in Nanwu in a while.

284
00:24:10,585 --> 00:24:11,585
I'll tell you in person.

285
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:13,985
Okay. The little demon
will be on summer break too.

286
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:16,305
You two must help me cart her home, okay?

287
00:24:17,785 --> 00:24:18,945
Okay.

288
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,785
Qian Fei!

289
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,705
That's my wife. I have to go now. Bye.

290
00:24:22,785 --> 00:24:23,785
This…

291
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:27,865
What was that?

292
00:24:36,105 --> 00:24:37,265
I was in the shower,

293
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:38,705
so I didn't see your text.

294
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:39,625
SANG ZHI

295
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:41,025
I'm going to bed now.

296
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:41,945
Good night.

297
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:46,185
Good night.

298
00:25:01,305 --> 00:25:02,425
Is it recording?

299
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,025
Don't be so nervous.

300
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:05,945
Relax a bit.

301
00:25:06,025 --> 00:25:08,585
Just treat it like a normal chat.

302
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:11,065
I'll be editing these materials,

303
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:12,425
so don't worry.

304
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:13,345
Okay.

305
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:15,705
Let's get started.

306
00:25:18,025 --> 00:25:20,305
What qualities do you think

307
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,505
an athlete needs to possess?

308
00:25:23,985 --> 00:25:26,825
I guess it's perseverance and tenacity.

309
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:29,065
Every time we face any difficulties

310
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:30,465
in a competition,

311
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:32,265
we must grit our teeth and persist.

312
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:33,385
Every time we fall,

313
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,745
we have to work hard to stand up

314
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,745
and move towards our next goal.

315
00:25:37,785 --> 00:25:38,865
What do you think

316
00:25:38,945 --> 00:25:40,425
is the most difficult thing

317
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,105
in this process?

318
00:25:44,145 --> 00:25:45,905
It should be

319
00:25:45,985 --> 00:25:47,265
when I can't train.

320
00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:50,545
I remember playing basketball
with classmates in 11th grade.

321
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,505
I suffered an impact on the chest

322
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:53,745
and my ribs were fractured.

323
00:25:53,825 --> 00:25:54,785
The doctor told me

324
00:25:54,865 --> 00:25:56,305
that I had to rest for a long while.

325
00:25:56,385 --> 00:25:57,945
At that time, I kept thinking.

326
00:25:58,025 --> 00:25:59,905
What if I can't play sports anymore?

327
00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:01,585
What else can I do?

328
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:04,705
So did you come up with anything?

329
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:07,185
No.

330
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:09,025
I only know

331
00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:11,745
that doing sports is what I love the most.

332
00:26:13,145 --> 00:26:14,625
So for sports,

333
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:16,625
I must cherish my body more

334
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:18,025
and work hard in my training

335
00:26:18,105 --> 00:26:19,745
to prepare for the next competition.

336
00:26:20,785 --> 00:26:22,265
Actually,

337
00:26:22,345 --> 00:26:24,025
that is the life of an athlete.

338
00:26:24,105 --> 00:26:26,185
Being devoted to something you love.

339
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:32,665
It's pretty boring, isn't it?

340
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:35,145
Not at all.

341
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:37,265
I completely understand your feelings

342
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:39,905
about being devoted to something you love.

343
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:49,545
TERM PAPER

344
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,945
"At the beginning
of an intimate relationship,

345
00:26:52,025 --> 00:26:54,065
both of them are all smiles

346
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,385
and full of happiness.

347
00:26:55,465 --> 00:26:57,425
When they gaze into each other's eyes,

348
00:26:57,505 --> 00:26:59,785
there is always love in their eyes.

349
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:02,625
But once the dream starts to shatter,

350
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:04,825
the smile turns into a frown,

351
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:06,065
and the love in their eyes

352
00:27:06,145 --> 00:27:07,905
transforms into anger

353
00:27:07,985 --> 00:27:09,945
or even hatred.

354
00:27:11,545 --> 00:27:13,465
So what exactly happened here?

355
00:27:13,545 --> 00:27:14,665
Why--"

356
00:27:14,745 --> 00:27:16,145
Why aren't you writing your paper?

357
00:27:18,785 --> 00:27:20,465
You scared me.

358
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:24,065
We told you to write your paper here.

359
00:27:24,825 --> 00:27:26,785
You've only typed two words in two hours.

360
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:27,825
"Term paper".

361
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:29,345
Weiwei.

362
00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:30,705
Do you plan to submit nothing?

363
00:27:30,785 --> 00:27:32,425
-Get up.
-I'm really out of ideas!

364
00:27:32,505 --> 00:27:34,385
Tomorrow! I'll go to the library tomorrow.

365
00:27:34,465 --> 00:27:35,465
I'll read extensively.

366
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:37,185
I'll be able to write once I'm inspired.

367
00:27:37,265 --> 00:27:38,105
Come here.

368
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:39,865
I'm really going tomorrow.

369
00:27:39,945 --> 00:27:41,345
What time did you go that day?

370
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:42,465
Were there any seats left?

371
00:27:42,545 --> 00:27:43,425
I'll go tomorrow.

372
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:45,905
So what time?

373
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,745
Around nine is fine.

374
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:50,225
There will definitely be seats then.

375
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:53,705
I didn't go to the library that day.

376
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:55,625
You didn't?

377
00:27:56,105 --> 00:27:56,945
That's impossible.

378
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:59,265
You came back very late that day
from studying.

379
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:01,105
Where did you go that day?

380
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:03,385
I did study.

381
00:28:03,905 --> 00:28:04,905
But

382
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:07,305
I wasn't at the library.

383
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:09,385
Then where were you?

384
00:28:12,785 --> 00:28:14,625
I studied at his place.

385
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:15,905
-Look at this.
-Hold on.

386
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:18,545
His place?

387
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:21,505
Why would you even study at his place

388
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:23,825
when you two were alone together?

389
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,025
How sweet.

390
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:31,705
Now tell me.

391
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:34,145
Did you two kiss?

392
00:28:35,105 --> 00:28:36,065
Weiwei.

393
00:28:36,145 --> 00:28:37,065
Don't tell me.

394
00:28:38,225 --> 00:28:40,345
He made the move, right?

395
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:41,825
I knew it!

396
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:43,705
Older guys sure are more experienced.

397
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:44,945
I want to ask you something.

398
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:46,705
What is it?

399
00:28:47,905 --> 00:28:49,425
When you and Chen Qiang

400
00:28:49,505 --> 00:28:52,545
have intimate moments,

401
00:28:53,225 --> 00:28:55,825
do you get nervous?

402
00:28:56,905 --> 00:28:58,385
Nervous?

403
00:28:59,145 --> 00:29:01,105
Why would I be nervous?

404
00:29:01,185 --> 00:29:02,385
-True.
-He's the nervous one.

405
00:29:02,465 --> 00:29:04,545
Listen, when we first started dating,

406
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:06,425
he was afraid to even hold my hand.

407
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:07,865
It made me so frustrated.

408
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,065
But he's more at ease now.

409
00:29:10,145 --> 00:29:12,625
He even tries to blame me for his farts.

410
00:29:13,465 --> 00:29:14,465
Cute, right?

411
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:19,145
Wait a minute.

412
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,105
Don't tell me

413
00:29:22,185 --> 00:29:23,465
you were nervous.

414
00:29:27,585 --> 00:29:28,945
I was nervous.

415
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:31,065
I guess

416
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:32,785
I might look upset

417
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:34,465
when I get nervous.

418
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:36,945
I even explained it
in case he misunderstood.

419
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,025
I told him it wasn't that I disliked it.

420
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:41,985
But I still think that he…

421
00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:44,945
I don't think he would misunderstand.

422
00:29:45,505 --> 00:29:46,745
But when a couple are together,

423
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:48,465
they should get along as usual.

424
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:50,065
There's no need to be so cautious.

425
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:51,945
But if every little thing

426
00:29:52,025 --> 00:29:53,145
needs an explanation,

427
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,985
it can get annoying over time.

428
00:29:55,065 --> 00:29:56,585
But then again,

429
00:29:57,865 --> 00:30:00,065
are you getting nervous out of habit?

430
00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:02,585
What do you mean?

431
00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:05,665
I mean,

432
00:30:06,665 --> 00:30:08,545
are you always afraid that

433
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:11,105
he'll find out
that you've liked him for a long time?

434
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:17,345
There's a possibility.

435
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:19,785
But you two are together now.

436
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:21,105
It's common for normal couples

437
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:24,025
to have some physical contact

438
00:30:24,705 --> 00:30:26,985
when they spend time together.

439
00:30:27,465 --> 00:30:29,145
Besides, Sangsang,

440
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:33,345
I don't think you're that timid.

441
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:38,505
I don't know
if you're complimenting or mocking me.

442
00:30:38,585 --> 00:30:40,425
I'm encouraging you.

443
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,385
You should enjoy being in a relationship.

444
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,865
Savor the process of being in love.

445
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:47,105
Of course, this process

446
00:30:47,185 --> 00:30:48,785
includes physical contact.

447
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:50,625
Got it?

448
00:31:14,385 --> 00:31:18,505
But I've already reacted that way.

449
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,865
Won't he read into it?

450
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,145
Read into it?

451
00:31:23,105 --> 00:31:24,705
How about this?

452
00:31:24,785 --> 00:31:26,945
You can take the initiative

453
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:28,665
and show him through your actions

454
00:31:28,745 --> 00:31:30,425
that you don't dislike it.

455
00:31:30,505 --> 00:31:32,345
You actually quite like it.

456
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,945
I think this could work.

457
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,505
We're already dating.

458
00:31:42,545 --> 00:31:44,105
I'm his girlfriend.

459
00:31:44,825 --> 00:31:46,825
So intimate gestures are normal.

460
00:31:47,665 --> 00:31:48,545
That's right.

461
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:50,425
There's nothing to be nervous about.

462
00:31:50,985 --> 00:31:51,865
Exactly.

463
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:02,785
Write your paper.

464
00:32:05,305 --> 00:32:06,425
I really can't write.

465
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:07,865
I'll go to the library tomorrow.

466
00:32:07,945 --> 00:32:10,145
Spare me this time. Please spare me.

467
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:11,105
Spare me.

468
00:32:11,185 --> 00:32:14,305
Please spare me, Sangsang.

469
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:37,705
SANG ZHI

470
00:32:37,785 --> 00:32:40,145
Jiaxu, are you working this weekend?

471
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:42,185
Let's go on a date.

472
00:32:54,705 --> 00:32:56,665
Sure. Anything you want.

473
00:32:56,745 --> 00:32:59,425
DUAN JIAXU

474
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:16,225
Now we're all set.

475
00:33:18,865 --> 00:33:20,385
Let me fix your laces a bit.

476
00:33:21,425 --> 00:33:23,785
Did you not sleep well?

477
00:33:23,865 --> 00:33:25,505
You look exhausted.

478
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,025
How so?

479
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:30,825
You just look tired.

480
00:33:31,985 --> 00:33:33,145
I'm fine.

481
00:33:33,225 --> 00:33:34,505
I slept soundly last night.

482
00:33:38,105 --> 00:33:40,105
We don't have to do this.

483
00:33:40,705 --> 00:33:42,225
We can go out for a walk

484
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:43,985
or find something nice to eat.

485
00:33:44,825 --> 00:33:46,505
I thought you really wanted to do this.

486
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:48,585
Are you that worried about me?

487
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:53,025
I haven't done this in a long time.

488
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:54,745
I've been waiting to show off my skills.

489
00:33:56,545 --> 00:33:58,145
Let me help you with this.

490
00:34:04,305 --> 00:34:05,225
Slow down.

491
00:34:07,185 --> 00:34:08,545
Hold onto the railing.

492
00:34:12,304 --> 00:34:13,945
I want to warn you of something.

493
00:34:14,665 --> 00:34:15,744
What is it?

494
00:34:16,465 --> 00:34:19,145
I plan to kiss you today.

495
00:34:26,505 --> 00:34:28,065
I wasn't planning

496
00:34:28,145 --> 00:34:29,505
to tell you this.

497
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:31,985
But…

498
00:34:32,545 --> 00:34:34,545
I was afraid you would find it too sudden.

499
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:36,185
You're not nervous, are you?

500
00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:38,505
I'm okay too.

501
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:43,505
So…

502
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:45,865
Are you giving me a heads-up?

503
00:34:50,105 --> 00:34:53,625
If you don't want to do it today or…

504
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:55,945
I do.

505
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,825
So will you initiate it or should I?

506
00:35:08,185 --> 00:35:09,865
Of course that would be me.

507
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:21,865
Are you ready?

508
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:22,785
Yes.

509
00:35:23,585 --> 00:35:24,465
Okay.

510
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:26,065
Three.

511
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,625
-Two.
-Two.

512
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:29,185
One.

513
00:35:42,745 --> 00:35:43,665
Come.

514
00:35:44,345 --> 00:35:45,425
Come and get me!

515
00:35:51,865 --> 00:35:53,825
Skate with your left and right feet.

516
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:54,865
Slide outward.

517
00:35:55,505 --> 00:35:56,665
-Like this?
-Yes, correct.

518
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:58,345
Okay.

519
00:35:59,745 --> 00:36:00,945
That's it.

520
00:36:01,705 --> 00:36:02,705
You've got it.

521
00:36:03,905 --> 00:36:05,105
I'll teach you something hard.

522
00:36:05,185 --> 00:36:06,345
A figure-eight turn.

523
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:07,465
Skate backward like this.

524
00:36:07,545 --> 00:36:08,905
It's a bit more challenging.

525
00:36:08,985 --> 00:36:10,545
Move like this, a figure eight.

526
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:12,545
An eight.

527
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:15,185
This is harder.

528
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:20,865
You can do it.

529
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,585
Believe in yourself.

530
00:36:23,505 --> 00:36:24,385
Come to me.

531
00:36:32,705 --> 00:36:33,745
I'll protect you.

532
00:36:35,305 --> 00:36:36,225
Come toward me.

533
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:37,745
You can do it.

534
00:36:41,985 --> 00:36:43,025
That's it.

535
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:44,065
Just like that.

536
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,945
You can do this.

537
00:36:47,025 --> 00:36:48,345
Come to me.

538
00:36:53,225 --> 00:36:54,225
Move forward.

539
00:37:21,785 --> 00:37:23,465
I did tell you about this.

540
00:37:30,985 --> 00:37:33,625
I wasn't ready yet.

541
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:39,985
It doesn't count.

542
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:33,025
Okay, time is up.

543
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:34,545
Please stop writing.

544
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,145
Flip your exam papers over.

545
00:38:36,225 --> 00:38:37,985
Take your belongings
and exit the classroom.

546
00:38:41,225 --> 00:38:42,185
Yu Xin.

547
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,745
Let's go. Stop looking.

548
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:45,785
All right.

549
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,225
-That's great.
-Let's go.

550
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:52,345
-Where is Wangwang?
-Let's go.

551
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:54,025
Wangwang, come on.

552
00:38:54,745 --> 00:38:56,065
-What are you reading?
-What is it?

553
00:38:56,145 --> 00:38:57,505
For the last question

554
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,785
about the characteristics
of communication,

555
00:38:59,865 --> 00:39:01,065
how many points did you write?

556
00:39:01,145 --> 00:39:01,985
That one?

557
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,945
It was covered in the mock exam.

558
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:05,225
-Yes.
-Wait a minute.

559
00:39:05,305 --> 00:39:06,585
Why I didn't see this question?

560
00:39:06,665 --> 00:39:07,625
Where was it?

561
00:39:07,705 --> 00:39:10,145
Timeliness, audience reach,
and wide coverage.

562
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:11,345
It's okay, Weiwei.

563
00:39:11,425 --> 00:39:12,305
You see,

564
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:14,145
even if you saw the question,

565
00:39:14,225 --> 00:39:15,505
you wouldn't know the answer.

566
00:39:15,585 --> 00:39:17,065
The result would've been the same,

567
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:18,385
so it's okay.

568
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:20,945
Well, that's true.

569
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,705
Forget it. I'll retake it next semester.

570
00:39:22,785 --> 00:39:25,105
But tonight, everyone must celebrate.

571
00:39:25,185 --> 00:39:26,505
Everyone must go. Do you hear me?

572
00:39:26,585 --> 00:39:28,145
-Okay.
-Got it.

573
00:39:29,505 --> 00:39:31,625
Sangsang, did your parents agree

574
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:33,025
to let you stay to intern in Yihe?

575
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:34,945
No.

576
00:39:35,025 --> 00:39:36,225
Why not?

577
00:39:36,305 --> 00:39:37,585
Doing an internship is good.

578
00:39:37,665 --> 00:39:38,545
You can start working.

579
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,545
-That's right.
-They do want me to intern.

580
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:42,745
They just don't want me to do it in Yihe.

581
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:45,305
They found an internship in Nanwu for me

582
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:46,385
and want me to go back.

583
00:39:47,145 --> 00:39:48,985
Then go back to Nanwu.

584
00:39:51,905 --> 00:39:54,585
But I still feel that staying in Yihe

585
00:39:54,665 --> 00:39:57,545
may get me more opportunities.

586
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,865
Do you think Yihe
has more job opportunities

587
00:39:59,945 --> 00:40:02,625
or do you just prefer your boyfriend
who is in Yihe?

588
00:40:02,705 --> 00:40:04,065
Stop teasing me.

589
00:40:05,705 --> 00:40:06,905
Hello?

590
00:40:12,985 --> 00:40:13,865
Yes, that's me.

591
00:40:16,025 --> 00:40:16,865
All right.

592
00:40:17,505 --> 00:40:19,105
Okay, I see.

593
00:40:21,745 --> 00:40:23,145
-What is it?
-What's up?

594
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:26,785
I passed my interview.

595
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:46,225
I've looked at the file you sent.

596
00:40:46,305 --> 00:40:48,905
I'll work on it some more tonight.

597
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:50,585
Bye.

598
00:40:56,065 --> 00:40:57,385
Hi. Excuse me.

599
00:40:57,465 --> 00:40:59,425
Can you tell me where I can find a café?

600
00:41:00,465 --> 00:41:02,425
There's a nice café over there.

601
00:41:02,505 --> 00:41:03,745
Over there, right?

602
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:04,865
Okay.

603
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:08,225
Can I add you on WeChat?

604
00:41:16,305 --> 00:41:17,265
Sorry.

605
00:41:17,345 --> 00:41:20,465
If my girlfriend finds out,

606
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:22,105
I'll be dead meat.

607
00:41:23,425 --> 00:41:24,585
Sorry for bothering you.

608
00:41:24,665 --> 00:41:25,505
No problem.

609
00:41:41,545 --> 00:41:42,785
Are you angry?

610
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:45,385
No.

611
00:41:46,345 --> 00:41:47,185
Drink it.

612
00:41:50,545 --> 00:41:52,145
If not, why won't you look at me?

613
00:41:54,985 --> 00:41:56,305
And you're even pouting.

614
00:41:59,025 --> 00:42:01,025
It's just a WeChat request.
Why would I be angry?

615
00:42:02,385 --> 00:42:03,465
Are you really not angry?

616
00:42:05,985 --> 00:42:06,865
No.

617
00:42:06,945 --> 00:42:08,065
Are you jealous?

618
00:42:08,145 --> 00:42:09,385
No.

619
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:12,545
Seeing you like this,

620
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:13,785
I thought you were jealous.

621
00:42:17,385 --> 00:42:18,425
Are you really not jealous?

622
00:42:18,505 --> 00:42:19,505
I am.

623
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:21,585
Just now,

624
00:42:23,865 --> 00:42:25,425
I saw you flirting with her.

625
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:27,345
Me?

626
00:42:28,065 --> 00:42:29,865
How did I flirt with her?

627
00:42:29,945 --> 00:42:30,985
You did this.

628
00:42:34,305 --> 00:42:35,225
No.

629
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:37,465
She asked me

630
00:42:37,545 --> 00:42:39,025
the directions to a café.

631
00:42:39,105 --> 00:42:40,785
So I…

632
00:42:41,745 --> 00:42:42,625
I…

633
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:45,305
All I did was tell her it's over there.

634
00:42:47,185 --> 00:42:48,905
Couldn't you have told her properly?

635
00:42:48,985 --> 00:42:50,825
Did you have to do this?

636
00:42:54,185 --> 00:42:55,065
I'm not talking to you.

637
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:04,505
Okay.

638
00:43:08,425 --> 00:43:09,545
Sorry to bother you.

639
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:10,865
Can I add you on WeChat?

640
00:43:10,945 --> 00:43:13,145
Sorry, I have a boyfriend.

641
00:43:13,225 --> 00:43:14,625
Okay.

642
00:43:20,425 --> 00:43:21,905
This watermelon looks pretty good.

643
00:43:22,905 --> 00:43:25,105
-Let's go.
-What's wrong? Are you angry?

644
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,025
No.

645
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:28,905
Are you jealous?

646
00:43:29,825 --> 00:43:31,145
How is that possible?

647
00:43:31,225 --> 00:43:32,545
It's just a WeChat request.

648
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:33,865
Why would I be jealous?

649
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:38,665
Wait. I didn't give it to him.

650
00:43:39,585 --> 00:43:41,385
But I saw you flirting with him just now.

651
00:43:41,465 --> 00:43:42,785
When did I flirt with him?

652
00:43:42,865 --> 00:43:44,185
He didn't even ask for directions.

653
00:43:44,745 --> 00:43:47,465
You did this to him.

654
00:43:47,545 --> 00:43:48,785
What was that?

655
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:51,185
I said, "Sorry, I have a boyfriend."

656
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:53,545
-What do you have?
-A boyfriend.

657
00:43:55,025 --> 00:43:56,105
Present.

658
00:43:59,425 --> 00:44:00,505
Let's go.
