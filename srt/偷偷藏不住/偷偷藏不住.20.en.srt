ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:51,945
-To compromise
-To compromise

3
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:53,465
It's almost my dorm's curfew.

4
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:54,785
Good!

5
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:57,945
-I'll get going first.
-Next song.

6
00:01:58,025 --> 00:01:59,545
-Goodbye.
-Next song.

7
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:00,825
-Pick a song.
-Pass me the mic.

8
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:02,505
Pass the mic, Mingming. This is mine.

9
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:07,665
Jiang Ying?

10
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:10,144
How did you know I was here?

11
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:11,785
Wait.

12
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,025
Do you know that his dad is in a coma?

13
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:18,865
I just don't want a young girl like you

14
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:20,305
to be led astray.

15
00:02:21,865 --> 00:02:23,145
His dad's hospital bill

16
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:25,665
costs nearly 100,000 yuan per year.

17
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,545
No girl has the time and money

18
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,665
to waste on him.

19
00:02:28,745 --> 00:02:29,945
I do.

20
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:33,625
I can waste it on him.

21
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:37,065
Then do you know

22
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:39,345
that his dad killed someone while driving?

23
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:41,305
He's a murderer.

24
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:44,225
So what does that have to do
with Duan Jiaxu?

25
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,505
Fine.

26
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:48,385
You may not mind it.

27
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:50,385
But your parents will never agree

28
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:51,385
to your relationship.

29
00:02:57,025 --> 00:02:58,345
Don't bother worrying about me.

30
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:00,585
Do you really think he likes you?

31
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,985
Duan Jiaxu grew up without love

32
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:04,465
due to family reasons.

33
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:07,025
If anyone treats him well,

34
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:09,585
he will think it is love.

35
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:11,825
Do you treat him very nicely?

36
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:14,985
If you think he likes you,

37
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:17,665
then tell me what he likes about you.

38
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,865
You've fallen head over heels for him.

39
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:24,225
But what if you want to break up with him?

40
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,425
Guess what he will say.

41
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:29,825
Do you think he is pretty sensible?

42
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:34,865
In reality, he won't even care.

43
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:36,385
He couldn't care less

44
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:37,985
about breaking up with you.

45
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:39,465
He can find

46
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,065
thousands of other girls like you.

47
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:45,945
I hit the nail on the head, didn't I?

48
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,905
-Let go.
-Why do you think I pick on him?

49
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:49,465
-Why am I like this?
-Let go.

50
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:51,185
His dad killed my dad!

51
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,745
If your family experienced
something like this,

52
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:01,865
wouldn't you become like me?

53
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:08,585
I understand.

54
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:12,265
But it was his dad

55
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,065
who made the mistake.

56
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:15,945
His dad committed the crime.

57
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:18,585
He will bear legal responsibility.

58
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:21,265
-He will--
-Receive his just punishment?

59
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:32,185
Do you know that his dad
was a hit-and-runner?

60
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:33,905
He was afraid of imprisonment.

61
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:36,865
He was afraid of criticism.

62
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,585
He attempted suicide. But in the end?

63
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:40,945
His dad didn't die.

64
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:42,505
My dad died instead.

65
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:45,185
I was the one who was punished!

66
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:48,465
So do you think Duan Jiaxu

67
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:50,785
has nothing to do with this incident?

68
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:53,865
Jiang Ying.

69
00:04:57,065 --> 00:04:58,385
Hasn't Duan Jiaxu

70
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:02,785
already made up for his dad's sin?

71
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:06,105
I know you're innocent.

72
00:05:06,185 --> 00:05:07,265
But

73
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,825
isn't he innocent too?

74
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:14,025
What exactly has Duan Jiaxu done wrong?

75
00:05:17,545 --> 00:05:18,385
You see,

76
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:22,225
this isn't an excuse for you to hurt him.

77
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:44,585
His dad killed my dad!

78
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:46,945
So do you think Duan Jiaxu

79
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:49,505
has nothing to do with this incident?

80
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:52,785
If your family experienced
something like this,

81
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:57,785
wouldn't you become like me?

82
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:02,785
Let me tell you a secret.

83
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,785
I have

84
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:08,145
plenty of debtors out there.

85
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:10,345
Actually,

86
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:11,905
these aren't my debts.

87
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,145
You don't need to help me repay them.

88
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,585
In the past,

89
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:21,865
is this how she made Jiaxu

90
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:25,425
live in guilt?

91
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:32,385
Why are you drinking?

92
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:36,345
What's wrong?

93
00:06:39,385 --> 00:06:40,305
Are you in a bad mood?

94
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:46,345
So?

95
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:48,425
Did the gathering go well?

96
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:50,505
I bought dessert for you.

97
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:52,305
It's bread.

98
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:55,185
Do you want to try it?

99
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:57,145
It's adorable.

100
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,705
Did something happen?

101
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:03,425
Why are you sitting
by the riverside alone?

102
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:05,105
It's windy out here.

103
00:07:05,185 --> 00:07:06,545
You're even drinking beer.

104
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:11,745
Try it.

105
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:19,305
Is it tasty?

106
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:21,385
The ear is delicious.

107
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:23,425
Now try the nose.

108
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:33,385
Here you go.

109
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:39,025
What's the meaning of this?

110
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:41,425
I only bought you bread

111
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:42,745
and you gave me your bank card.

112
00:07:47,305 --> 00:07:49,185
There's 5,000 yuan on the card.

113
00:07:50,545 --> 00:07:52,465
If I successfully complete my internship,

114
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:53,665
I'll get another 3,000 yuan.

115
00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:56,185
In that case,

116
00:07:57,585 --> 00:07:58,865
there will be 8,000 yuan.

117
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:03,625
Why are you suddenly giving me this?

118
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:07,505
I just want to tell you

119
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:11,745
that I can be nice to you.

120
00:08:13,065 --> 00:08:14,705
I can be nice to you for life.

121
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:17,745
I'm serious.

122
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:32,185
So our little Sang Zhi wants

123
00:08:32,264 --> 00:08:33,664
to take care of me.

124
00:08:38,305 --> 00:08:39,625
Take this.

125
00:08:40,225 --> 00:08:41,144
What?

126
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:42,985
The PIN on my card is your birth date.

127
00:08:43,585 --> 00:08:44,985
You can use the money

128
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:46,545
to buy beautiful dresses for yourself.

129
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,225
As for this card,

130
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:51,105
it's mine now.

131
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:55,185
You have quite a lot of money.

132
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:57,505
So…

133
00:08:58,265 --> 00:08:59,105
Boss.

134
00:08:59,785 --> 00:09:01,185
What are your orders?

135
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,185
I can satisfy all of your desires.

136
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:11,825
What?

137
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:13,305
I know I'm corny.

138
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:16,745
Do you finally admit it?

139
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:18,745
I'm just joking. Am I really corny?

140
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:19,665
Yes, you are.

141
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:25,305
Take it back.

142
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:29,145
There's no use giving this back.

143
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:30,785
I won't return your card to you.

144
00:09:30,865 --> 00:09:32,145
I didn't ask you to.

145
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,785
This is truly unexpected.

146
00:09:36,665 --> 00:09:37,665
At my age,

147
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,425
there is still someone I can depend on.

148
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:40,385
However,

149
00:09:41,825 --> 00:09:43,505
you can't spend recklessly.

150
00:09:43,585 --> 00:09:45,305
It's mine to do with now.

151
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,025
Don't misspend. You need to save up.

152
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:48,625
For what? Your dowry?

153
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:50,185
Save up to buy a house.

154
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:53,745
I seriously looked into it.

155
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,025
For an approximately 100-square-meter unit

156
00:09:56,105 --> 00:09:57,545
located in downtown Yihe,

157
00:09:58,225 --> 00:10:00,825
the down payment is around 500,000 yuan.

158
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:03,585
But don't worry.

159
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:05,865
It will be quick.

160
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:08,225
We'll have enough money in 50 years.

161
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:14,585
Sure.

162
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:16,785
I'll wait

163
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:19,065
for you to buy a huge house,

164
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,905
so I can hide my mistress there.

165
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:23,025
What a headache.

166
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:35,105
Boss.

167
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:38,345
Keep this.

168
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:42,145
I told you I don't need it.

169
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:47,265
I already told you.

170
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:49,065
I'm depending on you now.

171
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,625
With you around,

172
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:52,505
I don't need to save money for myself.

173
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:55,425
I spend lavishly.

174
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:57,265
Can you spend as quickly as I earn it?

175
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:05,625
I guess I'll keep it for you.

176
00:11:06,345 --> 00:11:07,545
However,

177
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,065
if you need to use money,

178
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:10,225
just tell me.

179
00:11:10,305 --> 00:11:11,705
I'll give it to you, okay?

180
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:13,185
Okay.

181
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:30,585
Sang Zhi.

182
00:11:32,345 --> 00:11:34,065
If you're upset about something,

183
00:11:34,665 --> 00:11:35,985
you can talk to me about it.

184
00:11:36,065 --> 00:11:36,945
I'm not upset.

185
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:40,265
I'm already happy

186
00:11:40,345 --> 00:11:42,225
that you came to get me.

187
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,665
CHAPTER 20, SAFEGUARD

188
00:12:13,745 --> 00:12:15,265
ONE PATH, TWO PEOPLE

189
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:19,545
Sang Zhi, are you still working?

190
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,465
It's time to eat. Continue after eating.

191
00:12:21,545 --> 00:12:23,305
It's fine. I'll be done soon.

192
00:12:23,385 --> 00:12:24,385
I'll go after this.

193
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:25,385
You guys can go ahead.

194
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:26,345
Okay.

195
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:27,905
Let's go eat.

196
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:34,385
Media analysis…

197
00:12:35,785 --> 00:12:37,385
Sang Zhi, this is your order.

198
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,825
I brought it in on my way.

199
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:40,185
I didn't order any food delivery.

200
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:41,465
Isn't this your phone number?

201
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,945
SOMEONE SENT THIS
TO TELL YOU THAT THEY MISS YOU

202
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:46,225
PLEASE GIVE YOUR SWEETIE
A FIVE-STAR RATING AFTER RECEIPT!

203
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:49,265
I see. Thank you.

204
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:50,825
Thank you.

205
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,025
If you ever need to work late again,

206
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:21,305
just tell me.

207
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:22,265
I'll pick you up.

208
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,345
The campus is deserted during the summer.

209
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:27,105
It's dangerous, all right?

210
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:29,105
Working during the day is tiring enough.

211
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:30,585
You even work overtime at night.

212
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:31,905
If you pick me up,

213
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:33,185
won't it be exhausting for you

214
00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:34,425
to travel back and forth?

215
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:36,385
Yes.

216
00:13:36,945 --> 00:13:37,865
So what should we do?

217
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:41,065
Why don't you move in with me?

218
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:49,225
They check on me every night.

219
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:52,945
Hello, Mom.

220
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:53,865
Hello, Zhizhi.

221
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:55,625
Where are you?

222
00:13:56,265 --> 00:13:57,265
Are you still working?

223
00:13:58,665 --> 00:13:59,745
I'll reach the dorm soon.

224
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:00,745
I'm on my way back.

225
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,905
Are you only heading home now?

226
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:05,585
It's late. Is it safe to be alone outside?

227
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:08,945
I do worry since you're there alone.

228
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:10,745
It's fine.

229
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:12,985
I'm not the only one doing an internship.

230
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:14,985
Plenty of students here are interning.

231
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:16,345
You don't need to worry about me.

232
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:18,665
Give me a video call
after you reach the dorm.

233
00:14:19,945 --> 00:14:21,825
Be careful on the road. Bye.

234
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:22,945
Bye.

235
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:26,185
Did you see that?

236
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,225
That's fine.

237
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:28,825
I'll just put in a little extra effort

238
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:30,425
and pick you up after work every day.

239
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:32,785
Really?

240
00:14:32,865 --> 00:14:33,905
Just wait and see.

241
00:14:41,945 --> 00:14:42,865
Sang Yan?

242
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:47,065
Why is he calling me after blocking me?

243
00:14:48,265 --> 00:14:49,905
What is it?

244
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:53,145
Are you back at your dorm?

245
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:55,585
I'm almost there.

246
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:56,585
What's the matter?

247
00:14:58,385 --> 00:14:59,985
There's a girl holding hands

248
00:15:00,865 --> 00:15:02,905
with a guy on campus right now.

249
00:15:04,145 --> 00:15:05,025
That's you, right?

250
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:19,025
Did you come to Yihe?

251
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,865
Am I blind?

252
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:37,745
Why does your postgraduate boyfriend

253
00:15:39,465 --> 00:15:42,225
look just like Duan Jiaxu?

254
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:57,105
Why didn't you tell me
that you were coming?

255
00:15:57,745 --> 00:15:58,945
I could've picked you up.

256
00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:09,705
Well…

257
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:11,985
He has a generic face.

258
00:16:13,065 --> 00:16:15,665
They just look alike.

259
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:17,345
It's very common.

260
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,465
Sang Zhi.

261
00:16:20,545 --> 00:16:22,665
Do you really take me for a fool?

262
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,345
I'll help you come up with excuses

263
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:26,905
for why you're holding his hand.

264
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:29,865
Is Duan Jiaxu crippled, blind, or drunk?

265
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:30,945
Make your choice.

266
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:32,825
I guess he's drunk.

267
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:33,985
Is that okay?

268
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:35,505
So to support him,

269
00:16:35,585 --> 00:16:36,745
you have to hold his hand.

270
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:42,225
Will you believe that?

271
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:44,665
Come here.

272
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:47,505
Come here.

273
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:55,225
I don't think

274
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:58,065
I have a generic face.

275
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:12,785
I pursued her.

276
00:17:33,705 --> 00:17:34,585
It will be fine.

277
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:49,225
Sang Yan, what's wrong with you?

278
00:17:50,065 --> 00:17:51,585
I didn't hide it from you.

279
00:17:51,665 --> 00:17:53,065
I wanted to tell you.

280
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:56,305
I did tell you, but you blocked me.

281
00:17:56,385 --> 00:17:57,305
See for yourself.

282
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:00,025
Postgraduate student?

283
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:03,865
-Postgraduate student.
-Well…

284
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:05,985
I'm sorry.

285
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:08,105
I lied to you about that.

286
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:09,945
But I just wanted you

287
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:11,185
to be mentally prepared.

288
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:13,625
Mentally prepared for our age gap,

289
00:18:13,705 --> 00:18:16,345
even though Jiaxu
isn't too much older than me.

290
00:18:16,425 --> 00:18:17,945
How far is your dorm?

291
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:20,985
It's just up ahead.

292
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:26,705
It will be fine.

293
00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:28,065
I'll talk to your brother later.

294
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:33,945
Where will you be staying later?

295
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:35,465
Let me get a place for you.

296
00:18:36,105 --> 00:18:37,065
Mind your own business.

297
00:18:38,545 --> 00:18:40,825
Don't be like this. Come on.

298
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:42,265
If you like any one of my friends,

299
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:43,425
I'll introduce them to you.

300
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:45,545
-I wouldn't be angry like you.
-I don't need it.

301
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,465
Everyone eventually gets married.

302
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:48,665
Why don't you need it?

303
00:18:48,745 --> 00:18:50,505
Dating is a normal thing.

304
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:51,945
Don't you want to date?

305
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:52,905
Is it this building?

306
00:18:55,545 --> 00:18:57,025
It's right inside.

307
00:18:58,425 --> 00:18:59,345
Go in.

308
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:01,865
Go now.

309
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:03,945
You have to video call your mom.

310
00:19:07,665 --> 00:19:09,985
It's not like you don't know who Jiaxu is.

311
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,385
You know his character.

312
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:13,065
What do I know about his character?

313
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:14,025
Please enlighten me.

314
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:16,105
Don't be like this.

315
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:17,785
Go in.

316
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,985
Please go, okay?

317
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:25,425
Go on.

318
00:19:27,505 --> 00:19:28,625
It will be fine.

319
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:29,745
You should head back first.

320
00:19:42,065 --> 00:19:43,145
Can I--

321
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,065
Go.

322
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:50,585
Are you guys hungry by any chance?

323
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:51,665
Bye. Good night.

324
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,225
Of all the girls, why my sister?

325
00:20:47,065 --> 00:20:48,305
I'm not fooling around.

326
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:49,265
I'm serious about her.

327
00:21:08,425 --> 00:21:09,385
Come at me.

328
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:32,705
Come on. Don't stop.

329
00:22:01,985 --> 00:22:03,265
How long has it been going on?

330
00:22:06,865 --> 00:22:08,025
Two and a half months.

331
00:22:14,505 --> 00:22:15,945
Do you even have a conscience?

332
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:20,225
If you want to date a girl her age

333
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,345
or even younger than her,

334
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:25,065
I wouldn't object to it.

335
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,585
But this is my sister.

336
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:32,185
She met you in middle school
and took you as a brother.

337
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:33,865
How could you target her?

338
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:42,185
Last time,

339
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:44,665
I said I would visit you in Nanwu.

340
00:22:44,745 --> 00:22:45,985
It was for this.

341
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,545
I did handle this improperly.

342
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:53,825
Sorry, buddy.

343
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:54,985
Who's your buddy?

344
00:23:07,225 --> 00:23:08,505
I know you're upset.

345
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:10,865
How about this?

346
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:13,425
You can beat me up however you like.

347
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,305
Idiot.

348
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:18,265
Okay, my brother?

349
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:19,345
Don't call me that.

350
00:23:31,425 --> 00:23:32,305
My goodness.

351
00:23:45,185 --> 00:23:46,545
Forget it.

352
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,585
Go home and clean yourself up first.

353
00:23:57,905 --> 00:23:58,985
Thank you, my brother!

354
00:24:46,545 --> 00:24:48,705
SANG ZHI

355
00:25:07,785 --> 00:25:09,065
Aren't you answering, buddy?

356
00:25:20,345 --> 00:25:21,185
SANG ZHI

357
00:25:21,265 --> 00:25:22,825
Is everything okay between you two?

358
00:25:33,425 --> 00:25:35,865
DUAN JIAXU

359
00:25:37,585 --> 00:25:38,865
Everything is fine.

360
00:25:38,945 --> 00:25:39,785
Don't worry.

361
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:44,545
SANG ZHI

362
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:46,265
Call me when you can.

363
00:25:50,545 --> 00:25:51,425
Buddy.

364
00:25:52,665 --> 00:25:54,345
I've given serious thought to this matter.

365
00:25:54,825 --> 00:25:56,025
I will be good

366
00:25:56,865 --> 00:25:58,385
to my Zhizhi for the rest of my life.

367
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,385
You don't need to worry about that.

368
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:02,465
"My Zhizhi"?

369
00:26:04,025 --> 00:26:05,025
Your Zhizhi?

370
00:26:08,945 --> 00:26:09,825
Fine.

371
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:12,025
She's still yours for now.

372
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:17,225
Let me ask you something.

373
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:19,825
Are you sure that you're serious about it?

374
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:23,025
If not, I would be a total jerk.

375
00:26:30,225 --> 00:26:31,345
Let me ask you this.

376
00:26:32,865 --> 00:26:34,265
How far have you two taken it?

377
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,665
Don't tell me you've already…

378
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:42,185
Buddy.

379
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:45,625
Do you see me as someone like that?

380
00:26:46,865 --> 00:26:48,265
Do you wish to hear the truth?

381
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,265
You are someone like that in my eyes.

382
00:26:59,065 --> 00:27:01,545
Besides, you're already 26.

383
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,985
You went after a college freshman.

384
00:27:04,065 --> 00:27:05,345
Are there no limits

385
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:06,785
to your shamelessness?

386
00:27:06,865 --> 00:27:08,345
Buddy, I'm serious about her.

387
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:10,185
I'm serious about pursuing her.

388
00:27:10,265 --> 00:27:11,425
Moreover,

389
00:27:13,505 --> 00:27:14,865
we're only five years apart.

390
00:27:22,665 --> 00:27:24,065
If you're not satisfied yet,

391
00:27:25,265 --> 00:27:26,625
why don't you punch me more?

392
00:27:29,305 --> 00:27:30,865
I'm serious. Come at me.

393
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:35,785
I…

394
00:27:35,865 --> 00:27:37,345
Wait. We're in a cab.

395
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:42,065
You're really asking for a beating.

396
00:27:42,145 --> 00:27:43,305
I'm speechless.

397
00:27:43,945 --> 00:27:45,465
We can talk about it when we get off.

398
00:28:14,545 --> 00:28:15,585
You can wear my slippers.

399
00:28:27,025 --> 00:28:28,585
Change into my slippers.

400
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,745
You can mop the floor.

401
00:28:45,385 --> 00:28:46,465
Chicken breast.

402
00:28:47,305 --> 00:28:48,185
Strawberries it is.

403
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:54,825
What?

404
00:28:54,905 --> 00:28:55,945
It's like this.

405
00:28:56,505 --> 00:28:58,105
I hope you won't touch anything

406
00:28:58,185 --> 00:28:59,665
in the refrigerator.

407
00:29:00,945 --> 00:29:01,785
You're so petty.

408
00:29:03,945 --> 00:29:05,665
I bought them for my girlfriend.

409
00:29:07,665 --> 00:29:09,385
"Girlfriend".

410
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:12,785
I'll just take a bottle of iced tea.

411
00:29:12,865 --> 00:29:14,345
Is there gold in there?

412
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,185
Take a seat. I'm going to shower.

413
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:25,025
When did you take that photo?

414
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:20,065
DUAN JIAXU

415
00:30:20,145 --> 00:30:21,065
Are you asleep?

416
00:30:21,145 --> 00:30:22,465
VIDEO CALL

417
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:24,505
DIALING

418
00:30:39,585 --> 00:30:40,705
VIDEO CALL DECLINED

419
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:46,945
WHY DID YOU…

420
00:30:48,065 --> 00:30:49,185
I'm not wearing any clothes.

421
00:30:54,545 --> 00:30:55,505
VOICE CALL

422
00:31:03,345 --> 00:31:04,305
Hello?

423
00:31:05,145 --> 00:31:06,025
Hello.

424
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:09,545
You'll catch a cold
if you don't wear clothes.

425
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:11,265
Hurry and put on some clothes.

426
00:31:13,025 --> 00:31:14,745
I'm going to sleep soon.

427
00:31:14,825 --> 00:31:15,825
I can't be bothered.

428
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:20,225
Did something happen

429
00:31:21,665 --> 00:31:22,745
between you and Sang Yan?

430
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:24,065
No.

431
00:31:24,865 --> 00:31:26,545
He just told me off.

432
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:30,745
That's good.

433
00:31:30,825 --> 00:31:32,145
Wait, it's not good.

434
00:31:33,105 --> 00:31:34,625
Just let him tell you off first.

435
00:31:35,505 --> 00:31:37,825
I'll find a chance to tell him off later.

436
00:31:39,945 --> 00:31:41,145
Okay, I'll be waiting.

437
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,425
By the way, did he tell you

438
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,065
why he came here?

439
00:31:49,505 --> 00:31:50,665
Your brother

440
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:52,345
is just concerned about you.

441
00:31:52,905 --> 00:31:55,465
I think he's here to see
if you're cohabiting

442
00:31:56,265 --> 00:31:57,985
with your postgraduate boyfriend.

443
00:31:59,905 --> 00:32:01,425
He's so annoying.

444
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:02,745
I'm not that easy.

445
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,385
Did he say how long he is staying?

446
00:32:11,025 --> 00:32:13,105
He will probably stay for some time.

447
00:32:14,345 --> 00:32:15,745
All right, don't worry.

448
00:32:16,345 --> 00:32:18,185
I've already explained it to him.

449
00:32:19,945 --> 00:32:21,745
Don't you have work tomorrow?

450
00:32:21,825 --> 00:32:22,705
Sleep early.

451
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:25,585
You should sleep early too.

452
00:32:27,185 --> 00:32:28,225
Good night.

453
00:32:29,945 --> 00:32:31,105
Good night.

454
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:33,585
You can hang up.

455
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,185
Xiaoyu.

456
00:33:23,745 --> 00:33:25,305
I've already emailed you

457
00:33:25,385 --> 00:33:26,385
the modified proposal.

458
00:33:26,945 --> 00:33:29,185
That's right. Please take a look.

459
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:34,625
Bye.

460
00:33:36,785 --> 00:33:38,505
I got a cold. I don't want to infect you.

461
00:33:39,345 --> 00:33:40,585
Let's go.

462
00:33:40,665 --> 00:33:42,345
Why do you suddenly have a cold--

463
00:33:48,345 --> 00:33:49,745
I bumped into something last night.

464
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:55,345
Bumped into what?

465
00:33:55,425 --> 00:33:56,665
I bumped into

466
00:33:57,225 --> 00:33:59,465
the corner of the nightstand.

467
00:34:00,145 --> 00:34:02,185
-Let's go.
-Are you hurt anywhere else?

468
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,465
No. Only here.

469
00:34:07,785 --> 00:34:08,705
What about him?

470
00:34:09,865 --> 00:34:10,744
Who?

471
00:34:11,705 --> 00:34:12,585
Sang Yan.

472
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:23,465
Calm down.

473
00:34:25,945 --> 00:34:26,824
That's all.

474
00:34:26,905 --> 00:34:28,264
-Okay, sir. Please wait.
-Sang Zhi.

475
00:34:29,744 --> 00:34:30,625
-Come out.
-What?

476
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:31,905
-Come!
-What are you doing?

477
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:34,145
-Come out!
-What are you doing? This is a restaurant.

478
00:34:34,225 --> 00:34:35,185
What are you doing?

479
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:37,705
Why did you hit him?

480
00:34:38,264 --> 00:34:39,824
Why can't I hit him?

481
00:34:39,905 --> 00:34:42,264
I would've called the cops
if I were there.

482
00:34:42,344 --> 00:34:44,105
I would've told the cops to arrest you!

483
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:46,344
Go ahead. Call the cops on me if you dare!

484
00:34:59,105 --> 00:35:00,105
I'm cutting ties with you.

485
00:35:01,425 --> 00:35:02,345
You're done for.

486
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:04,265
From now on,

487
00:35:04,345 --> 00:35:05,945
you're no longer my brother!

488
00:35:06,825 --> 00:35:08,025
Wait.

489
00:35:09,905 --> 00:35:10,785
Sang Zhi.

490
00:35:38,185 --> 00:35:39,145
Is she okay?

491
00:35:39,225 --> 00:35:40,385
She's fine.

492
00:35:40,465 --> 00:35:41,505
She went to the restroom.

493
00:35:44,905 --> 00:35:47,025
Have you been spoiling her rotten?

494
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:49,745
Her temper has gotten even worse.

495
00:35:50,825 --> 00:35:52,665
Listen. Don't try to stop me later.

496
00:35:52,745 --> 00:35:54,145
I have to teach her a lesson today.

497
00:35:54,225 --> 00:35:55,145
I have to stop you.

498
00:35:55,225 --> 00:35:57,265
Why are you squabbling with a young girl?

499
00:35:58,025 --> 00:35:58,905
Cut it out.

500
00:36:03,825 --> 00:36:06,385
Buddy, tell me when you're free.

501
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:07,745
Why?

502
00:36:07,825 --> 00:36:09,145
So you can beat me up again.

503
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:19,345
To be honest,

504
00:36:21,785 --> 00:36:22,745
having my girlfriend

505
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:25,145
defend me just now

506
00:36:28,465 --> 00:36:29,625
was pretty touching.

507
00:37:03,065 --> 00:37:03,985
Sit.

508
00:37:18,385 --> 00:37:19,585
Do you know how old you are?

509
00:37:19,665 --> 00:37:21,385
Who says "cutting ties" anymore?

510
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:27,065
Then I'm severing ties,
effective immediately.

511
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:29,745
Sure. Sever it if you can.

512
00:37:32,465 --> 00:37:33,985
Excuse me.

513
00:37:34,065 --> 00:37:35,225
Sorry for the interruption.

514
00:37:36,305 --> 00:37:38,705
I'm starving. Can we order first?

515
00:37:38,785 --> 00:37:40,145
I already ordered.

516
00:37:43,505 --> 00:37:45,185
You only started dating not long ago,

517
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:47,225
yet you're already siding

518
00:37:47,305 --> 00:37:48,505
with an outsider.

519
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:57,105
Sang Yan.

520
00:37:57,185 --> 00:37:58,065
Sang Zhi.

521
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:02,825
Do you know how to communicate reasonably?

522
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,465
You were born with a mouth.

523
00:38:04,545 --> 00:38:06,025
Can't you talk things over?

524
00:38:06,105 --> 00:38:07,425
Must you get physical?

525
00:38:08,545 --> 00:38:09,945
Be reasonable?

526
00:38:10,025 --> 00:38:12,825
I never resolve issues
with such unproductive methods.

527
00:38:12,905 --> 00:38:13,825
I'm not like you,

528
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:15,545
never understanding the point.

529
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,385
What do you mean by that?

530
00:38:17,465 --> 00:38:19,265
Since when have I not understood?

531
00:38:21,785 --> 00:38:22,705
I…

532
00:38:23,785 --> 00:38:24,865
I can't imagine

533
00:38:24,945 --> 00:38:27,905
how anyone can get along with you.

534
00:38:27,985 --> 00:38:29,745
You're truly irritating.

535
00:38:29,825 --> 00:38:30,785
Miss,

536
00:38:30,865 --> 00:38:32,425
I was fighting with my buddy.

537
00:38:32,505 --> 00:38:34,185
How is that any of your business?

538
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:39,625
How is it not my business?

539
00:38:39,705 --> 00:38:41,785
Don't you think
you're wrong for hitting him?

540
00:38:41,865 --> 00:38:43,145
Sang Zhi, calm down.

541
00:38:43,225 --> 00:38:44,425
Being violent is okay?

542
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:45,585
Have some water.

543
00:38:45,665 --> 00:38:46,905
Sang Zhi, here.

544
00:38:48,185 --> 00:38:50,345
Sang Zhi, calm down.

545
00:38:50,425 --> 00:38:51,945
Why are you arguing with your brother?

546
00:38:52,025 --> 00:38:53,065
You know how he is.

547
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:54,505
I'm not trying to argue with him.

548
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:55,745
Just listen to him.

549
00:38:55,825 --> 00:38:57,105
He doesn't think he's wrong.

550
00:38:58,385 --> 00:38:59,505
Look at his lips.

551
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:01,465
I did that to him.

552
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:05,905
I also hit him.

553
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:10,305
But he started the fight, right?

554
00:39:10,385 --> 00:39:12,905
So it was self-defense.

555
00:39:14,025 --> 00:39:15,825
That's really not true.

556
00:39:15,905 --> 00:39:17,665
Last night, he stood without moving

557
00:39:17,745 --> 00:39:18,665
and let me hit him.

558
00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:21,025
So we're already even.

559
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:23,705
Wait, why did you hit him?

560
00:39:24,505 --> 00:39:25,905
Are both of you this childish?

561
00:39:25,985 --> 00:39:27,065
Can't you two talk it out?

562
00:39:27,145 --> 00:39:28,385
Must you two fight?

563
00:39:28,905 --> 00:39:30,265
Why did you fight?

564
00:39:30,865 --> 00:39:32,465
Couldn't you reason with him?

565
00:39:33,305 --> 00:39:35,385
-You two--
-The little demon does have a conscience.

566
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:36,345
Tell him.

567
00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:37,545
Teach him how to reason.

568
00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:40,265
I'll eat first.

569
00:39:40,785 --> 00:39:41,625
Let's eat.

570
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:43,425
You must be hungry.

571
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:47,785
So did you two immature brats

572
00:39:47,865 --> 00:39:48,945
treat your wounds?

573
00:39:49,025 --> 00:39:50,225
-Yes.
-Yes.

574
00:39:53,145 --> 00:39:54,665
I think there's a bruise here.

575
00:39:55,425 --> 00:39:56,585
Does it hurt?

576
00:39:56,665 --> 00:39:57,665
No.

577
00:39:57,745 --> 00:39:58,905
It's much better now.

578
00:39:59,585 --> 00:40:01,465
No, it must hurt.

579
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:03,545
-Look at it.
-His is worse.

580
00:40:05,545 --> 00:40:06,705
Look at him.

581
00:40:07,385 --> 00:40:09,105
Someone is doting on Duan Jiaxu now.

582
00:40:09,185 --> 00:40:11,985
Younger sisters

583
00:40:12,065 --> 00:40:13,265
are useless indeed.

584
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:14,865
I would rather get a girlfriend.

585
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,265
At least a girlfriend

586
00:40:16,345 --> 00:40:18,905
would care about me and feel sorry for me.

587
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:31,705
Do you want some water?

588
00:40:33,785 --> 00:40:35,025
No.

589
00:40:42,705 --> 00:40:44,065
Since you're in Yihe,

590
00:40:44,865 --> 00:40:46,625
is there any place you want to visit?

591
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:48,745
I'm busy for the next few days.
I have work.

592
00:40:49,305 --> 00:40:50,745
I'm free on the weekend.

593
00:40:51,305 --> 00:40:53,105
I'm here to visit my buddy.

594
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:54,585
I don't need your company.

595
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:55,825
I want my buddy's company.

596
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:57,705
I'll keep you company.

597
00:40:58,745 --> 00:41:00,825
But I'm bringing my girlfriend.

598
00:41:01,385 --> 00:41:02,545
Suit yourself.

599
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:03,945
I'll bring her with me then.

600
00:41:07,025 --> 00:41:08,225
Try this shrimp.

601
00:41:09,225 --> 00:41:11,505
I want some shrimp too.

602
00:41:14,945 --> 00:41:16,745
-Are you a thief?
-Aren't you?

603
00:41:18,945 --> 00:41:20,265
You're so irritating.

604
00:41:23,665 --> 00:41:24,585
Try this.

605
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:28,345
Enough already!

606
00:41:28,425 --> 00:41:29,865
Stop peeling it for her.

607
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,425
Who are you guys trying to show off to?

608
00:41:32,505 --> 00:41:34,185
It's not like I'm peeling it for you.

609
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:39,145
Isn't it tasty?

610
00:41:39,945 --> 00:41:41,545
-Isn't it yummy?
-It's delicious.

611
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:42,905
Enough already. Stop!

612
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:10,865
Do you want to take a shower?

613
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:12,905
Later.

614
00:42:17,265 --> 00:42:18,785
There isn't another pair of slippers!

615
00:42:27,385 --> 00:42:28,425
Nutcase.

616
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:45,665
Did you find out about my appendicitis
some time ago?

617
00:42:46,345 --> 00:42:47,185
Yes.

618
00:42:47,825 --> 00:42:49,105
Did you kick me there on purpose?

619
00:42:51,745 --> 00:42:52,985
That kick will fix you.

620
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:54,825
Look at you.

621
00:42:55,465 --> 00:42:57,065
You should've watched where you hit me.

622
00:42:57,865 --> 00:43:00,185
How am I going to explain my bruise
to her tomorrow?

623
00:43:03,345 --> 00:43:04,625
Applying ointment now is useless.

624
00:43:04,705 --> 00:43:06,265
She will still see it tomorrow.

625
00:43:06,825 --> 00:43:07,665
You're so delicate.

626
00:43:11,865 --> 00:43:12,785
You do have a point.

627
00:43:14,065 --> 00:43:16,025
If the little demon sees you
like this tomorrow,

628
00:43:16,105 --> 00:43:17,505
she'll say that I bullied you.

629
00:43:21,505 --> 00:43:22,385
What about this?

630
00:43:22,905 --> 00:43:23,865
You know me.

631
00:43:23,945 --> 00:43:24,785
I'm a fair person.

632
00:43:25,745 --> 00:43:26,745
Come on. Punch me.

633
00:43:32,585 --> 00:43:34,065
I've never punched someone before.

634
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:35,025
I don't know how.

635
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:37,985
Just punch me already.

636
00:43:38,065 --> 00:43:38,985
Stop hesitating.

637
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:44,625
I have no idea how to.

638
00:43:46,545 --> 00:43:47,585
Stand up.

639
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:51,625
Make it quick.

640
00:43:55,305 --> 00:43:56,265
Are you okay?

641
00:43:59,105 --> 00:44:01,105
I told you I don't know how to fight.

642
00:44:02,425 --> 00:44:04,145
Here, put some ointment on it.

643
00:44:05,385 --> 00:44:07,185
I'm not as fragile as you.

644
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:09,425
Put on some ointment.

645
00:44:09,505 --> 00:44:10,425
No, thank you.

646
00:44:11,865 --> 00:44:13,465
Do you need me to apply it for you?

647
00:44:15,425 --> 00:44:16,305
Hurry up.

648
00:44:29,465 --> 00:44:30,745
That's just like you.

649
00:44:31,865 --> 00:44:32,705
Come.

650
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:42,265
You're a man. Don't be so fragile.

651
00:44:47,665 --> 00:44:48,785
Fine.

652
00:44:48,865 --> 00:44:49,825
Come here.

653
00:44:54,585 --> 00:44:55,505
Do it yourself.

654
00:45:20,025 --> 00:45:21,945
Here's a towel, some clothes,
and a toothbrush.

655
00:45:23,745 --> 00:45:24,905
I have work tomorrow.

656
00:45:24,985 --> 00:45:26,025
I'm going to sleep.

657
00:45:26,105 --> 00:45:27,305
Tell me if you need anything.

658
00:45:28,665 --> 00:45:30,025
Wait. Where do I sleep?

659
00:45:34,545 --> 00:45:36,185
Do you make your guests sleep on the sofa?

660
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:42,785
Duan Jiaxu!

661
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,145
Duan Jiaxu!

662
00:45:44,905 --> 00:45:45,745
Hey!

663
00:45:45,825 --> 00:45:46,745
What?

664
00:45:47,385 --> 00:45:49,185
You should be the one
sleeping on the sofa!
