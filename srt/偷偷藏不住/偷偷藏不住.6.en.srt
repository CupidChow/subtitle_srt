00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:45,105
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

2
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,545
But I can't resist temptation.

3
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:56,145
What kind of temptation?

4
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:59,865
If someone is dating in front of me,

5
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:01,425
I'll also want to date.

6
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,865
Who is dating?
You watch too many idol dramas.

7
00:02:04,945 --> 00:02:05,865
The people close to me.

8
00:02:06,665 --> 00:02:08,065
Those around me.

9
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,345
Are you talking about me?

10
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:14,025
Kiddo.

11
00:02:14,505 --> 00:02:16,665
Why are you so petty?

12
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:19,105
You can't stop others from dating
just because you can't date.

13
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:21,265
Isn't it a provocation

14
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:22,385
to date in front of me?

15
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,425
Fine, let's say you're right.

16
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:28,945
I won't talk about the future for now.

17
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:31,225
But we're going to talk

18
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:33,345
about your old boyfriend

19
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:35,825
who told you to go to Yihe to meet him.

20
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:38,025
It's quite a coincidence

21
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:40,265
because I'm from Yihe.

22
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:43,705
So if I ever find out

23
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:46,225
that you went to see him
while you're still a minor,

24
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:50,465
then I'm afraid

25
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:54,225
you won't live to become an adult.

26
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:02,145
Let's begin the lesson.

27
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:27,145
How was the last exam?

28
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,705
Take point M
as the intersection on side AB.

29
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:31,625
I explained it before. Like this problem.

30
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:33,465
Then try to recall the formula.

31
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,065
I'll explain static electricity first.

32
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:41,065
You got this problem correct.

33
00:03:58,585 --> 00:03:59,465
This problem.

34
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:01,225
I was originally going to choose C.

35
00:04:02,505 --> 00:04:03,425
C, you say?

36
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:05,265
I meant D.

37
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:09,585
D is the answer to this problem.

38
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:11,385
Pay more attention next time.

39
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:22,064
One incorrect multiple-choice problem.

40
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:24,385
You got 97 points.

41
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:27,305
Not bad.

42
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:28,385
You've improved a lot.

43
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,225
So,

44
00:04:31,465 --> 00:04:32,985
you have no problem with physics now.

45
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,145
I won't come to tutor you anymore.

46
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:37,585
If there is anything you don't understand,

47
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:38,745
you can ask your brother

48
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:39,745
or your teacher.

49
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:40,665
You can ask me too.

50
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:43,465
Just send me a picture
of what you don't understand.

51
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:44,945
I'll reply after I go through it.

52
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:46,185
My phone was confiscated.

53
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:50,625
Your brother will talk to your parents.

54
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:56,585
Don't worry.

55
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:00,105
Cheer up.

56
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:02,905
You've improved so much now.

57
00:05:04,545 --> 00:05:05,825
So did I teach well?

58
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,025
All right then.

59
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:14,545
So will you have more exams
after school starts?

60
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:16,025
Yes.

61
00:05:16,105 --> 00:05:19,585
Then send me each exam's result.

62
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:21,585
You had better get high scores.

63
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:24,145
As long as there's an improvement,

64
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:25,625
I'll give you a gift.

65
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:33,025
Let's stop here for today.

66
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:52,585
HAPPY LUNAR NEW YEAR

67
00:05:58,465 --> 00:05:59,585
Are you doing housework?

68
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:00,825
Is the lesson over?

69
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:02,465
-Yes.
-Come and have some fruit.

70
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:05,225
-Thank you, Mrs. Sang.
-Have some fruit.

71
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:09,505
I was just talking to my husband.

72
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:11,385
Let's celebrate
Lunar New Year's Eve together.

73
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:12,345
Come and join us.

74
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:13,625
Thank you for inviting me.

75
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:16,465
But I think I'll stay on campus.

76
00:06:16,545 --> 00:06:18,065
It's amazing at school now.

77
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,265
They host a holiday dinner

78
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,385
and give us red packets.

79
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:22,585
Don't go back.

80
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:24,105
It will be boring being alone.

81
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,745
In that case,

82
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:26,785
all right then.

83
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:28,865
Let me help you, Mr. Sang.

84
00:06:28,945 --> 00:06:30,305
Okay. Sang Zhi, pass that to me.

85
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:32,305
This one.

86
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:35,265
Let's stick it here.

87
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:37,745
This one needs to be upside down.

88
00:06:37,825 --> 00:06:39,265
Is this one good, dear?

89
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:40,385
Should it be bigger?

90
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,105
If I give him a red packet,

91
00:06:56,585 --> 00:06:58,025
it will seem a bit strange.

92
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:00,345
He definitely won't accept it.

93
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:28,105
Jiaxu,

94
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,025
Happy Lunar New Year.

95
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:55,665
PROSPERITY

96
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,345
Sang Yan said

97
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:09,385
you'll stay in Nanwu after graduation.

98
00:08:09,465 --> 00:08:10,505
Have you found a job?

99
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:14,265
Yes, I plan to work at the game company

100
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:15,465
where I interned.

101
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:17,105
That's great.

102
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:19,625
Keep it up.

103
00:08:19,705 --> 00:08:20,665
Okay, let's put it up.

104
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:22,265
Allow me.

105
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:24,425
Having it up there will be good.

106
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:25,705
At the top.

107
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:26,825
-A bit higher.
-Higher.

108
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,185
-Zhizhi.
-Perfect. All right.

109
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:30,705
Help me clear the table.

110
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:31,705
Right here.

111
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:34,425
Stop sweeping already.

112
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:36,264
Wash the rag and wipe the table.

113
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:37,225
Okay.

114
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:44,705
-It's all done.
-Okay, thank you.

115
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:46,305
Of course.

116
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:00,305
GOOD FORTUNE

117
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:40,665
GOOD FORTUNE

118
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:41,665
How does it look?

119
00:09:54,505 --> 00:09:55,505
Okay.

120
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:57,665
-That's enough.
-So little?

121
00:09:57,745 --> 00:09:59,025
That's enough for me. Thank you.

122
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:01,265
Okay. It's time to toast.

123
00:10:01,345 --> 00:10:02,505
Happy Lunar New Year!

124
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:05,785
-Happy Lunar New Year!
-Happy Lunar New Year!

125
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:07,345
-Dear, Happy Lunar New Year.
-Cheers.

126
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:09,105
I dare you to finish all of this.

127
00:10:09,185 --> 00:10:11,025
-Cheers.
-Go away!

128
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:12,985
-He won't clink glasses.
-It's such a big bottle.

129
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:18,225
The most exciting part

130
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:19,945
is yet to come.

131
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:23,505
Dear, you'll be the first to get this.

132
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:25,065
Do I get a red packet too?

133
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,185
Perfect.

134
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:28,745
Thank you, dear.

135
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:30,065
I love you.

136
00:10:32,825 --> 00:10:36,465
-Dad and Mom, Happy New Year!
-Dad and Mom, Happy New Year!

137
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:37,865
-May your wishes come true!
-May your wishes come true!

138
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:39,185
-Be happy…
-Stay healthy…

139
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:40,625
"Be happy" comes first.

140
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:41,545
It's "stay healthy".

141
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,665
No, it's "be happy"!

142
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:44,945
Fine.

143
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:46,705
-Be happy every day!
-Be happy every day!

144
00:10:46,785 --> 00:10:49,065
-Stay healthy!
-Stay healthy!

145
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:50,745
-I like it.
-Good. Here you go, Sang Yan.

146
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:52,105
Thank you, Dad.

147
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,585
Sang Zhi, this is yours.

148
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:56,665
Thank you, Dad.

149
00:10:56,745 --> 00:10:58,145
-Dad.
-Thank you, Mom.

150
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,905
You're being so unfair.

151
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:01,865
You're almost a university graduate.

152
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:03,265
You're lucky to even receive one.

153
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:04,705
Sang Zhi.

154
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,665
What should you do
after getting your phone?

155
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:10,585
I'll uninstall the games.

156
00:11:10,665 --> 00:11:11,505
What else?

157
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:13,865
What about your online dating prospect?

158
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:19,945
I already deleted it long ago.

159
00:11:21,505 --> 00:11:22,745
What about his phone number?

160
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:24,665
I don't have his number.

161
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:26,305
Online dating doesn't use phone numbers.

162
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,545
I'm telling the truth.

163
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:30,385
Really?

164
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:33,185
You can see for yourself.

165
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:36,865
You don't even have enough money

166
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:38,505
to afford game currency.

167
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:40,705
-Why are you dating online?
-Stop talking already.

168
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:42,865
-All right.
-Cut it out. Stop arguing.

169
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:44,785
-Let's eat.
-Eat up.

170
00:11:44,865 --> 00:11:46,665
I have something to say before we eat.

171
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:47,665
I hope

172
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:50,985
my two lovely children will grow up

173
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:53,425
and behave a bit more

174
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,225
in this new year.

175
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:56,585
And you.

176
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:57,945
-Be more mature.
-He means you.

177
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:02,465
-All right, let's eat.
-Okay, let's dig in.

178
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:06,425
By the way, Zhizhi.

179
00:12:06,505 --> 00:12:08,305
Didn't you want

180
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:09,865
to buy a set of anime merchandise?

181
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:12,065
Now that your brother has money,

182
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:13,385
ask him to buy it for you.

183
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:15,785
Why should I? No way.

184
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:17,585
Thank you, Sang Yan. Thank you.

185
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:25,785
Sang Yan is the most generous.

186
00:12:26,265 --> 00:12:27,585
Sang Yan, have some of this.

187
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:28,705
A toast to Sang Yan.

188
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:30,465
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

189
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:33,105
This is for you.

190
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:36,585
At least you have a conscience.

191
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:38,545
-But it's not much.
-You like eating this.

192
00:12:41,265 --> 00:12:42,705
-It's delicious.
-Really?

193
00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:44,985
I want this one.

194
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:49,865
JIAXU

195
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:57,745
It's from Jiaxu.

196
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:03,185
Sang Yan, you did well. Have more.

197
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:04,745
-Thank you, Mom.
-Should we go on a trip?

198
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:07,585
Sang Zhi, I wish you happiness every day

199
00:13:07,665 --> 00:13:08,905
and find your dreams soon.

200
00:13:08,985 --> 00:13:10,025
Happy Lunar New Year.

201
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,025
-Sure.
-Zhizhi.

202
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:14,465
How about going skiing in a few days?

203
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:17,265
Skiing? Sure.

204
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:19,545
Okay, then make up an itinerary for us.

205
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,545
-Okay.
-It's busy during the holidays.

206
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,865
-So book early.
-That's right.

207
00:13:29,585 --> 00:13:31,585
-Next to number three.
-Forget about numbers.

208
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:32,865
How about salt with vinegar?

209
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,785
-Footsteps.
-Listen to my upper couplet.

210
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:36,145
It starts with "Perfectly."

211
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:37,665
-Damn.
-"Perfectly matched."

212
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:39,025
-What matched?
-Behind the bridge.

213
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:41,505
Perfectly matched, matched as in paired.

214
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:42,505
That's a good start.

215
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:44,025
I follow that with Minister.

216
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:45,545
-Move.
-Minister against Cannon.

217
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:48,945
Why is it Minister against Cannon?

218
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:51,545
You move the Minister,
and I counter with the Cannon.

219
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:53,945
It's Chinese chess. Get it?

220
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:55,345
I'll put it this way.

221
00:13:55,425 --> 00:13:57,265
I structured
these five characters together.

222
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:03,825
Thank you, Jiaxu.

223
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:06,185
Happy Lunar New Year.

224
00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:22,065
YIHE CITY NURSING HOME

225
00:14:32,745 --> 00:14:33,785
ANSWER

226
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:34,905
YIHE CITY NURSING HOME

227
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:37,945
Hello?

228
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:39,945
Hello. Are you Mr. Duan Jiaxu?

229
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:41,185
Yes.

230
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:44,425
Your dad has severe pulmonary edema
caused by a lung infection

231
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:46,385
and must be transferred immediately
for drainage.

232
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:49,785
The current condition is quite urgent.

233
00:14:49,865 --> 00:14:52,425
Please come as soon as possible
to sign the consent form.

234
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:54,865
Okay, I understand. Thank you.

235

CHAPTER SIX, DISTANCE

236
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:31,425
WHEN YOU ARE IN ANOTHER CITY

237
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:35,505
Mr. Sang, your package.

238
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:36,425
Okay, thank you.

239
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:43,745
Hey, silly dog.

240
00:15:46,185 --> 00:15:48,025
It has a name. It's Winner.

241
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:50,505
Silly dog, come here.

242
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:52,345
Come here. Let me tell you.

243
00:15:52,425 --> 00:15:53,425
Come here.

244
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:55,185
Listen. Look.

245
00:15:55,865 --> 00:15:58,105
You look so similar to him.

246
00:15:58,185 --> 00:15:59,745
You two look exactly alike.

247
00:16:09,665 --> 00:16:10,585
Wait right there.

248
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:13,105
Duan Jiaxu sent this to you.

249
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:14,865
It's your reward for ranking 20th

250
00:16:14,945 --> 00:16:16,185
in the placement test

251
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:17,785
and scoring 95 on the physics exam.

252
00:16:19,865 --> 00:16:22,185
Why didn't he give it to me himself?

253
00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:23,105
Didn't he tell you?

254
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:24,425
He went back to his hometown.

255
00:16:24,905 --> 00:16:26,025
He's back in Yihe.

256
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:27,825
He said something came up at home.

257
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:30,225
Why don't you ask him yourself?

258
00:16:34,465 --> 00:16:35,305
Wait.

259
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:38,305
Then will he come back
for the graduation ceremony?

260
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,305
Of course he will.

261
00:16:43,865 --> 00:16:46,625
Why did he leave without saying goodbye?

262
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:08,265
XURI MIDDLE-HIGH SCHOOL
TO NANWU UNIVERSITY

263
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:13,184
2 HOURS AND 33 MINUTES

264
00:17:17,105 --> 00:17:19,265
Sang Yan, are you coming home today?

265
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:30,945
SILLY DOG

266
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:32,385
What does this mean?

267
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,705
Why are you taking your time
when class is over?

268
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:39,585
My sister is probably in trouble again.

269
00:17:39,665 --> 00:17:41,145
She asked if I'm going home.

270
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:42,385
Is she in trouble again?

271
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:03,825
It was awesome just now,

272
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:05,825
tossing the basketball with this pose.

273
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:07,945
I was off my game today.

274
00:18:13,105 --> 00:18:14,025
Hello?

275
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:16,065
Sang Yan, it's already Friday.

276
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:17,225
Why aren't you coming home?

277
00:18:18,105 --> 00:18:19,665
There's a BOGO promotion on candy

278
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:20,985
at the convenience store today.

279
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:23,145
I bought an extra pack.
I can share it with you.

280
00:18:24,065 --> 00:18:25,505
If I want candy, I can buy it myself.

281
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:27,425
Just tell me what you want.

282
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:30,305
Nothing. I'm just asking.

283
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:32,745
Well, I can just not go home.

284
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:34,145
-Right?
-It was cheap.

285
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:35,985
-You can invite friends over.
-Duan Jiaxu!

286
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:39,665
Where are you going?

287
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:40,785
Where are you guys going?

288
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:41,865
I'm going home for a bit.

289
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:44,345
I happen to be going to your area.

290
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:45,425
Let's go together.

291
00:18:45,505 --> 00:18:47,785
Sure. Come over for dinner if you're free.

292
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:48,705
Okay.

293
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:51,145
I'm not joining you.

294
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:52,505
I'm going back to the dorm.

295
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:53,585
-Okay.
-Bye.

296
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,625
Bye.

297
00:18:54,705 --> 00:18:56,665
-Hello, little demon.
-Suspicious.

298
00:18:57,465 --> 00:18:58,345
What's wrong?

299
00:18:58,865 --> 00:18:59,705
She hung up on me.

300
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:00,665
Let's go.

301
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:25,465
Why don't I call Sang Yan

302
00:19:25,545 --> 00:19:27,105
and ask where they are?

303
00:19:34,585 --> 00:19:35,425
Forget it.

304
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:37,385
They should be here soon.

305
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:42,585
Don't worry. What's the situation?

306
00:19:47,225 --> 00:19:49,145
-Again, Chen Junwen?
-He's finally home!

307
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:52,065
How many times
have you forgotten your keys?

308
00:19:53,785 --> 00:19:54,945
I can't bring it to you.

309
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:56,185
You come to get it yourself.

310
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,505
Did you forget to bring your brain too?

311
00:20:00,585 --> 00:20:02,385
I'm already home.
How can I open it for you?

312
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:05,105
Why is he alone?

313
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,505
Little demon!

314
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:10,985
Why didn't you close the door?

315
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:12,105
There are mosquitoes!

316
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,825
Duan Jiaxu was supposed to come with me,

317
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:16,385
but the library gave him a call,

318
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,625
so he had to go back to work.

319
00:20:17,705 --> 00:20:19,825
As you know,
he's crazy about making money.

320
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:22,545
All right, that's all.

321
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,505
I'm hanging up now.

322
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:25,465
Bye.

323
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:27,265
Little demon.

324
00:20:28,745 --> 00:20:30,025
Why did you want me home?

325
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:33,505
Dad and Mom wanted

326
00:20:33,585 --> 00:20:35,185
to have dinner together this weekend.

327
00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:37,105
Have dinner together?

328
00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:40,985
Couldn't you tell me over the phone?

329
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,265
Dad! Mom!

330
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:45,865
Sang Yan? Sang Yan is back.

331
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:48,425
I thought you were coming home tomorrow.

332
00:20:52,545 --> 00:20:54,425
Let's have dinner together this weekend.

333
00:20:55,945 --> 00:20:57,145
You're getting more thoughtful.

334
00:20:58,345 --> 00:21:00,105
We're sweaty from a day of work.

335
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:01,025
We'll shower first.

336
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:01,945
-Okay.
-Okay.

337
00:21:02,025 --> 00:21:03,145
Afterward, I'll make dinner.

338
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:04,345
Okay.

339
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:06,825
Mom, why not let Sang Yan make dinner?

340
00:21:06,905 --> 00:21:08,225
Let him make dinner?

341
00:21:08,305 --> 00:21:09,385
That would work too.

342
00:21:09,465 --> 00:21:10,665
Cook the rice first.

343
00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:11,905
Wash the vegetables too.

344
00:21:11,985 --> 00:21:13,585
Cooking rice is too simple.

345
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:15,425
It's okay. Let him cook the rice.

346
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:16,465
I'll cook the rest.

347
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:30,345
Sang Yan.

348
00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:32,585
Which library is Jiaxu working at?

349
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:34,065
Is it the university's library?

350
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:37,785
Why are you asking me this?

351
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,705
Nothing. I'm just curious.

352
00:21:40,785 --> 00:21:42,465
Are all university students so busy?

353
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,025
What are you usually busy with?

354
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:47,705
I'm busy trying to get away
from a little demon like you.

355
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:49,625
Busy sleeping in class.

356
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:53,025
Isn't that the same
as middle school students?

357
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:56,025
How can it be the same?

358
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:58,145
University students
have one more thing to do,

359
00:21:58,225 --> 00:21:59,105
which is dating.

360
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:00,825
Dating?

361
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:03,825
Well, I should've known.

362
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,345
A kid like you wouldn't understand this.

363
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,705
How is that possible?

364
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,305
Why would any girl like you?

365
00:22:10,465 --> 00:22:12,745
Listen, plenty of girls chase after me.

366
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:14,945
Not even a high-speed train
can fit them all.

367
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:18,625
What's wrong with you?

368
00:22:19,265 --> 00:22:20,625
It has been so long

369
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:22,025
since I've heard anyone

370
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:23,985
tell such a tall tale.

371
00:22:24,985 --> 00:22:25,825
You don't believe me?

372
00:22:26,665 --> 00:22:28,185
Okay, listen.

373
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:30,505
Do you know why

374
00:22:30,585 --> 00:22:33,265
none of my roommates have girlfriends?

375
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:37,705
None of them have girlfriends?

376
00:22:37,785 --> 00:22:39,465
It's because those girls

377
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:40,985
are lining up to pursue me.

378
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,265
Who would believe that nonsense?

379
00:22:58,385 --> 00:22:59,785
SENDER, DUAN JIAXU

380
00:23:01,865 --> 00:23:04,305
Another reward from Jiaxu
for my exam scores.

381
00:23:59,465 --> 00:24:00,305
Hello?

382
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:02,065
Hello, Jiaxu.

383
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:06,065
I received the package you sent.

384
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,225
It's a black dog plushie.

385
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:12,305
So? Do you like it?

386
00:24:14,385 --> 00:24:17,945
It looks a bit familiar to me.

387
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,025
Is that so?

388
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,705
Does it look like Sang Yan?

389
00:24:26,185 --> 00:24:28,025
You still remember my essay.

390
00:24:28,105 --> 00:24:29,265
Of course I do.

391
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:32,025
I was walking on the street one day

392
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:33,345
and saw this dog.

393
00:24:34,345 --> 00:24:36,345
It reminded me of your drawing back then.

394
00:24:37,465 --> 00:24:38,905
So I thought

395
00:24:38,985 --> 00:24:40,425
it would be a perfect gift for you.

396
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:42,425
Congratulations on scoring 95 points

397
00:24:42,505 --> 00:24:43,665
on the physics exam this time.

398
00:24:46,505 --> 00:24:47,825
By the way, Jiaxu.

399
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:49,665
Give me your address.

400
00:24:50,385 --> 00:24:51,785
I want to send you something.

401
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,185
Do you want to send me something?

402
00:24:55,265 --> 00:24:56,745
I'm just exchanging favors.

403
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,665
No need.

404
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,305
Why? It's important.

405
00:25:03,425 --> 00:25:05,265
What is your monthly allowance?

406
00:25:05,745 --> 00:25:07,425
Keep the money

407
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,945
and spend it on yourself, okay?

408
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:10,265
No need to send me any gifts.

409
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:12,025
Let me send you something.

410
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:14,505
You really don't have to.

411
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:15,745
The fact that you want to

412
00:25:15,825 --> 00:25:17,345
already makes me happy.

413
00:25:19,305 --> 00:25:22,025
So Sang Yan said

414
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:25,345
you will come back
for your graduation ceremony.

415
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:26,265
Is that true?

416
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:27,465
Yes.

417
00:25:27,945 --> 00:25:29,025
Will you be going?

418
00:25:30,385 --> 00:25:31,425
Yes.

419
00:25:32,185 --> 00:25:33,185
That's great.

420
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,585
We'll see each other then.

421
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:38,105
I have to go now.

422
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:39,705
Bye.

423
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:41,145
Bye.

424
00:25:56,585 --> 00:25:58,705
Then consider it your graduation gift.

425
00:26:13,825 --> 00:26:14,785
Who's there?

426
00:26:21,585 --> 00:26:22,665
It has been a long time.

427
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,665
Why are you here?

428
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:30,185
Aren't you inviting me in?

429
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:33,665
It's not a good time.

430
00:26:34,265 --> 00:26:35,305
Sorry about that.

431
00:26:41,305 --> 00:26:42,345
Here.

432
00:26:44,025 --> 00:26:46,385
Isn't that person in a bad condition?

433
00:26:46,865 --> 00:26:48,065
Don't worry

434
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:49,585
about returning the money this month.

435
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:51,905
It's fine.

436
00:26:52,385 --> 00:26:53,545
I can figure it out myself.

437
00:26:54,505 --> 00:26:56,545
I just don't want you to have a hard time.

438
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,425
It's really not necessary. Thank you.

439
00:27:02,025 --> 00:27:02,865
By the way,

440
00:27:02,945 --> 00:27:05,385
has the time for your graduation ceremony
been set yet?

441
00:27:05,465 --> 00:27:06,985
Can I go too?

442
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:11,585
No need.

443
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:19,705
It's all right.

444
00:27:19,785 --> 00:27:21,305
Since you're returning to Yihe,

445
00:27:21,385 --> 00:27:23,025
we'll get a chance to meet up.

446
00:27:24,145 --> 00:27:25,585
Then

447
00:27:25,665 --> 00:27:27,585
I wish you an early happy graduation.

448
00:27:27,665 --> 00:27:28,785
Thank you.

449
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:32,025
I'll be in touch.

450
00:27:59,465 --> 00:28:01,185
-Three, two, one!
-Three, two, one!

451
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:02,865
-Cheese!
-Cheese!

452
00:28:02,945 --> 00:28:04,265
Smile a little.

453
00:28:04,345 --> 00:28:05,225
A bit lower.

454
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:07,265
Okay, smile.

455
00:28:07,345 --> 00:28:09,425
-Three, two, one.
-Hi, Sang Yan.

456
00:28:09,505 --> 00:28:10,625
Your classmate?

457
00:28:10,705 --> 00:28:11,785
Actually, I don't know him.

458
00:28:11,865 --> 00:28:13,225
-Sang Yan!
-Sang Yan, come here!

459
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:14,225
Over there.

460
00:28:23,305 --> 00:28:24,625
-Hello, Mr. Sang.
-Hello, Mr. Sang.

461
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:25,865
Congratulations on graduating.

462
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:28,105
Thank you, Mr. Sang.

463
00:28:32,105 --> 00:28:33,785
Mr. Sang, where is Mrs. Sang?

464
00:28:33,865 --> 00:28:36,665
She's sick with a cold and fever.

465
00:28:36,745 --> 00:28:37,985
I told her to rest at home.

466
00:28:38,065 --> 00:28:40,345
-Many people have fallen sick lately.
-Yes.

467
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:41,385
Sang Yan, you're late.

468
00:28:41,465 --> 00:28:43,025
We need to take a picture together.

469
00:28:43,105 --> 00:28:44,505
Okay, come on.

470
00:28:44,585 --> 00:28:46,825
-Let me help you take it.
-Thank you, Mr. Sang.

471
00:28:46,905 --> 00:28:47,905
No problem.

472
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:50,625
Look this way.

473
00:28:50,705 --> 00:28:53,225
One, two, three.

474
00:28:53,305 --> 00:28:54,305
Make a different pose.

475
00:28:55,545 --> 00:28:57,865
Ready? One, two, three.

476
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,185
It's all done. Take a look.

477
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,545
-Thank you, Mr. Sang.
-Qian Fei!

478
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,145
-Take pictures with us!
-Come, Qian Fei!

479
00:29:04,225 --> 00:29:05,065
-Come on!
-Let's go.

480
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:06,465
-Come!
-Dad, I'm going over there.

481
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:07,745
Jiaxu, come and join us.

482
00:29:07,825 --> 00:29:08,705
-Come!
-I'm coming!

483
00:29:08,785 --> 00:29:10,825
I heard you'll work in your hometown.

484
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:13,345
Yes. I've already found a job.

485
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:15,945
That's not a bad idea either.

486
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:17,665
After all, you're familiar with the area.

487
00:29:19,065 --> 00:29:20,185
If you ever visit Nanwu,

488
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:21,465
come to my house for a meal.

489
00:29:21,545 --> 00:29:22,745
Okay, that's for sure.

490
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:23,785
Good.

491
00:29:23,865 --> 00:29:25,665
Let's go take a photo with your brother.

492
00:29:25,745 --> 00:29:26,985
-Let's take it together.
-Okay.

493
00:29:30,465 --> 00:29:31,865
It has been a long time, Sang Zhi.

494
00:29:37,105 --> 00:29:38,425
This is for you.

495
00:29:39,585 --> 00:29:40,625
For me?

496
00:29:42,785 --> 00:29:44,505
I thought it was for your brother.

497
00:29:45,585 --> 00:29:47,505
He already has one.

498
00:29:48,425 --> 00:29:50,625
This one is for my physics tutor.

499
00:29:51,385 --> 00:29:52,505
I wish you

500
00:29:52,585 --> 00:29:53,785
a happy graduation

501
00:29:53,865 --> 00:29:54,865
and happiness every day.

502
00:29:56,145 --> 00:29:56,985
Thank you.

503
00:29:57,865 --> 00:29:58,705
I like it very much.

504
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:02,265
Then I wish my student

505
00:30:02,345 --> 00:30:03,505
a bright future

506
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:04,745
and smooth academic progress.

507
00:30:06,945 --> 00:30:08,985
The graduation ceremony is about to begin.

508
00:30:09,065 --> 00:30:10,185
All graduating students,

509
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:11,785
please gather in the auditorium.

510
00:30:13,665 --> 00:30:15,025
Jiaxu, you should go ahead.

511
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,065
I'll go and find my brother by myself.

512
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:18,985
It's okay. I'll take you there.

513
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:20,225
I'll text your brother.

514
00:30:22,305 --> 00:30:23,345
Come on.

515
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:35,465
-Jiaxu.
-Jiaxu.

516
00:30:35,545 --> 00:30:36,985
-Hey, Jiaxu.
-Come and join us.

517
00:30:37,065 --> 00:30:38,385
-Come take a picture.
-Okay.

518
00:30:38,465 --> 00:30:39,985
I'll take a picture with them.

519
00:30:40,065 --> 00:30:41,385
Jiaxu, who is this?

520
00:30:42,345 --> 00:30:43,945
My sister.

521
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:46,025
Hi. Can you help us take a photo?

522
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:47,465
Sure.

523
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,985
-Thank you. Just press this.
-Okay.

524
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:50,905
Come on, everyone.

525
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:52,025
-Come on.
-Picture time.

526
00:30:52,105 --> 00:30:52,985
-Okay.
-This is it.

527
00:30:53,065 --> 00:30:54,385
-Stand there.
-Okay.

528
00:30:54,465 --> 00:30:55,385
Okay.

529
00:30:55,465 --> 00:30:56,465
Three.

530
00:30:56,545 --> 00:30:57,745
Two.

531
00:30:57,825 --> 00:30:58,665
One.

532
00:30:59,865 --> 00:31:00,785
Good.

533
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:01,785
Okay, thank you.

534
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:03,545
-Jiaxu.
-It's a great picture.

535
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:05,785
Professor Zhang, thank you for your help.

536
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,785
I hope to see you shine and excel

537
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:10,985
in the gaming industry.

538
00:31:11,065 --> 00:31:12,785
-I'll do my best.
-I believe in you.

539
00:31:12,865 --> 00:31:13,745
Thank you.

540
00:31:13,825 --> 00:31:15,665
Okay, I'm going inside first.

541
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:16,945
-Okay.
-Okay, Professor.

542
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:18,505
Jiaxu.

543
00:31:19,385 --> 00:31:21,985
Participating in competitions
and research projects with you

544
00:31:22,065 --> 00:31:23,865
was the most painful
and happiest thing for me

545
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:25,305
in these four years.

546
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:26,585
Both painful and happy?

547
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:28,385
-Yes.
-It sounds complicated.

548
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:29,785
Do you remember

549
00:31:29,865 --> 00:31:31,305
when we stayed up late every night?

550
00:31:31,385 --> 00:31:33,225
-Seriously.
-We could only eat instant noodles.

551
00:31:33,305 --> 00:31:34,945
Those were hard times.

552
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:36,025
But it will all pay off.

553
00:31:36,785 --> 00:31:38,425
I'll be returning to my hometown tomorrow.

554
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:39,625
Are you leaving tomorrow?

555
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,785
-What about you two?
-I'll probably leave tomorrow too.

556
00:31:43,865 --> 00:31:45,785
I wonder if we'll see each other again.

557
00:31:46,465 --> 00:31:47,345
It's okay.

558
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:48,865
We will get a chance to meet again.

559
00:31:50,145 --> 00:31:51,065
I'm heading inside.

560
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:52,425
-Okay.
-Okay, I'll see you later.

561
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:01,825
Jiaxu.

562
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:06,425
Does that mean it'll be difficult

563
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:09,785
to see your classmates after graduation?

564
00:32:09,865 --> 00:32:10,905
Two, one.

565
00:32:10,985 --> 00:32:12,145
I guess so.

566
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,305
How do I explain this to you?

567
00:32:15,305 --> 00:32:17,545
We majored in the same discipline,

568
00:32:18,065 --> 00:32:19,465
but after we enter society,

569
00:32:19,985 --> 00:32:22,185
everyone will make their own choice.

570
00:32:23,465 --> 00:32:25,905
Gradually, we'll take different paths.

571
00:32:26,665 --> 00:32:27,625
It could be

572
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:30,905
that it will be really hard to meet again.

573
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:42,105
Then what about me?

574
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:43,545
You?

575
00:32:45,985 --> 00:32:48,385
You're not the same as them.

576
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,825
They won't be like my dear sister

577
00:32:53,465 --> 00:32:54,985
who snuck me a red packet

578
00:32:55,065 --> 00:32:56,545
during Lunar New Year

579
00:32:59,865 --> 00:33:01,105
and even came to give me flowers

580
00:33:01,985 --> 00:33:03,185
on my graduation day.

581
00:33:09,585 --> 00:33:10,785
Don't worry.

582
00:33:11,585 --> 00:33:12,545
After I leave,

583
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:14,345
I'll come back to see you
whenever I'm free.

584
00:33:15,865 --> 00:33:18,425
When will you be free?

585
00:33:20,305 --> 00:33:22,185
I'll let you know in advance

586
00:33:22,265 --> 00:33:23,105
before I come back.

587
00:33:23,825 --> 00:33:24,745
Okay?

588
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:34,785
Xiaozhou, can you do me a favor?

589
00:33:34,865 --> 00:33:36,065
Sure.

590
00:33:38,545 --> 00:33:40,305
Help me take a photo with my sister.

591
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,505
Okay.

592
00:33:43,465 --> 00:33:44,425
Hold this.

593
00:33:46,185 --> 00:33:47,065
Come on.

594
00:33:47,585 --> 00:33:48,945
Both of you look at the camera.

595
00:33:52,105 --> 00:33:53,945
Okay, smile a bit more.

596
00:34:09,185 --> 00:34:12,025
-Happy graduation!
-Happy graduation!

597
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:17,744
Enough. Don't drink too much.

598
00:34:18,705 --> 00:34:19,865
You can't hold your alcohol,

599
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:21,304
so don't drink too much.

600
00:34:21,385 --> 00:34:22,905
We're celebrating today.

601
00:34:23,665 --> 00:34:24,985
You two are inseparable again.

602
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:26,945
I have to get to the bottom of this today.

603
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:28,425
You two always stick together

604
00:34:28,505 --> 00:34:29,705
and never find a girlfriend.

605
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:32,065
I understand if it's Sang Yan.

606
00:34:32,145 --> 00:34:33,304
With his temper,

607
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:34,545
who would like him?

608
00:34:35,105 --> 00:34:36,585
Shut up.

609
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:37,824
Jiaxu, what about you?

610
00:34:37,905 --> 00:34:39,465
Yes. Why don't you have a girlfriend?

611
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,025
What do we say?

612
00:34:45,465 --> 00:34:46,344
See?

613
00:34:46,905 --> 00:34:48,264
That's why we're best buds.

614
00:34:48,344 --> 00:34:49,465
What? Is there a problem?

615
00:34:55,985 --> 00:34:57,345
Duan Jiaxu!

616
00:34:57,985 --> 00:35:00,105
I thought I was your best friend!

617
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,985
How could you have a change of heart?

618
00:35:03,065 --> 00:35:04,825
You are. Of course you are.

619
00:35:04,905 --> 00:35:06,465
Let him be. He's such a crybaby.

620
00:35:06,545 --> 00:35:08,265
-He's ignoring me.
-It's okay.

621
00:35:08,345 --> 00:35:09,585
I'll take care of you. Come.

622
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:10,625
Are you really crying?

623
00:35:10,705 --> 00:35:12,105
How can you cry for real?

624
00:35:12,185 --> 00:35:13,185
You're a grown-up!

625
00:35:14,185 --> 00:35:15,465
Can someone open a bottle for me?

626
00:35:15,545 --> 00:35:16,705
Give it to me.

627
00:35:16,785 --> 00:35:17,705
Thank you.

628
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:20,585
Jiaxu, come and have a drink.

629
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:21,745
-Cheers!
-Cheers, guys.

630
00:35:21,825 --> 00:35:22,745
Happy graduation.

631
00:35:22,825 --> 00:35:24,745
We've graduated, and you're drinking cola?

632
00:35:24,825 --> 00:35:26,265
-Drink beer.
-I can't drink alcohol.

633
00:35:26,345 --> 00:35:27,225
No way.

634
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:28,985
You're spoiling the fun. Come on.

635
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:30,105
Give it to me.

636
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:31,145
Okay, cheers!

637
00:35:31,225 --> 00:35:32,145
Come on, guys.

638
00:35:32,225 --> 00:35:33,065
There they go again.

639
00:35:33,145 --> 00:35:34,425
Are you drinking on his behalf?

640
00:35:35,025 --> 00:35:36,545
Stop wasting time and drink up.

641
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:37,465
-Drink up!
-Cheers!

642
00:35:37,545 --> 00:35:39,705
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

643
00:35:39,785 --> 00:35:40,745
Jiaxu, drink up.

644
00:35:57,825 --> 00:35:59,305
Don't stop drinking. Finish it.

645
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:00,825
Is it for the whales or the sharks?

646
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:02,625
I can finish it. I'll drink first.

647
00:36:02,705 --> 00:36:04,225
Listen. Wait a moment.

648
00:36:04,305 --> 00:36:05,385
I want to ask you something.

649
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:06,985
-I'll ask you first.
-No, I'll ask you.

650
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,865
-Do you have a crush on her?
-Me?

651
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:11,105
Do you have a crush on her?

652
00:36:11,185 --> 00:36:12,225
Do you?

653
00:36:12,305 --> 00:36:13,505
Let me finish this drink first.

654
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:15,825
Today is the last day.

655
00:36:15,905 --> 00:36:16,985
It's the last day, right?

656
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:17,985
It's the last day.

657
00:36:18,065 --> 00:36:20,385
If you don't tell the truth,
you won't get another chance.

658
00:36:20,465 --> 00:36:21,345
JIANG YING

659
00:36:21,425 --> 00:36:23,305
I'm happy you're coming back to Yihe.

660
00:36:23,385 --> 00:36:24,545
Happy graduation.

661
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:26,545
CALL CANCELED

662
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:29,025
I'M HAPPY YOU'RE COMING BACK TO YIHE.
HAPPY GRADUATION.

663
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,065
-What's wrong?
-Jiaxu.

664
00:36:35,545 --> 00:36:36,705
I can't bear to part with you.

665
00:36:38,985 --> 00:36:40,025
Are you drunk?

666
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:40,945
No.

667
00:36:41,905 --> 00:36:42,785
Why are you alone?

668
00:36:42,865 --> 00:36:43,785
He's drunk.

669
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:45,705
I'm not.

670
00:36:45,785 --> 00:36:47,185
You are. Stop denying it.

671
00:36:47,265 --> 00:36:48,625
Come. Let's drink.

672
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:51,025
-Who turned Qian Fei into this?
-Come on, drink.

673
00:36:51,505 --> 00:36:53,305
Come and drink. Qian Fei, here.

674
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:55,265
-Don't drink with him.
-This is our last time.

675
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:04,745
-Here.
-Happy graduation, guys!

676
00:37:04,825 --> 00:37:06,385
-Cheers.
-Drink up.

677
00:37:32,265 --> 00:37:33,625
You drank too much.

678
00:37:35,065 --> 00:37:36,905
Jiaxu, I want to ask you something.

679
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:38,865
When I'm no longer around,

680
00:37:38,945 --> 00:37:39,945
who will watch over you?

681
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:42,545
Don't worry.

682
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:44,465
Many people are eyeing me.

683
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:50,345
Duan Jiaxu.

684
00:37:50,865 --> 00:37:52,705
You and Chen Junwen are going back home.

685
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:55,425
Only Sang Yan and I will be in Nanwu.

686
00:37:56,305 --> 00:37:57,985
I don't know what is good about Yihe.

687
00:37:58,065 --> 00:37:59,105
Why do you have to go back?

688
00:38:00,385 --> 00:38:01,665
Enough. Let's keep drinking.

689
00:38:02,585 --> 00:38:04,145
You were so loud earlier.

690
00:38:04,225 --> 00:38:05,305
Look at you now.

691
00:38:06,105 --> 00:38:06,985
You're right.

692
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:14,465
You're home.

693
00:38:15,785 --> 00:38:16,705
Jiaxu.

694
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:20,185
Will you be okay in Yihe?

695
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:24,465
Promise me you'll live well in Yihe.

696
00:38:24,985 --> 00:38:26,505
Of course, I'll be fine.

697
00:38:28,825 --> 00:38:29,665
Sit.

698
00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:31,465
Jiaxu.

699
00:38:32,465 --> 00:38:34,625
You must come and visit us regularly.

700
00:38:36,985 --> 00:38:38,305
I'll come back often.

701
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:41,265
Sang Yan.

702
00:38:42,105 --> 00:38:43,385
Are you home?

703
00:38:43,465 --> 00:38:45,385
-Mr. and Mrs. Sang.
-Xiaoduan, you're here too.

704
00:38:45,465 --> 00:38:47,185
What's wrong? Did he drink too much?

705
00:38:47,265 --> 00:38:48,705
We celebrated our graduation.

706
00:38:49,545 --> 00:38:52,225
-Why did he drink so much?
-Thank you for bringing him home.

707
00:38:52,305 --> 00:38:53,145
Give him some water.

708
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:54,905
-Okay.
-I'll make hangover soup for him.

709
00:38:54,985 --> 00:38:55,825
Okay.

710
00:38:55,905 --> 00:38:57,705
Why did he push himself to drink so much?

711
00:38:57,785 --> 00:38:59,425
Sang Yan, have some water.

712
00:39:01,225 --> 00:39:02,985
-Move slowly.
-I'm going to go, Mrs. Sang.

713
00:39:03,065 --> 00:39:05,385
Wait. Where are you spending the night?

714
00:39:05,465 --> 00:39:07,785
There's an inn nearby.

715
00:39:07,865 --> 00:39:10,745
Don't waste money.
Just sleep in Sang Yan's room.

716
00:39:10,825 --> 00:39:11,865
Don't go to the trouble.

717
00:39:11,945 --> 00:39:13,225
Not at all.

718
00:39:13,305 --> 00:39:14,625
Zhizhi, you're here too.

719
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:15,905
Xiaoduan will spend the night.

720
00:39:15,985 --> 00:39:17,865
Get him a new towel and toothbrush.

721
00:39:17,945 --> 00:39:19,825
It's really okay, Mrs. Sang. I can manage.

722
00:39:20,385 --> 00:39:22,825
Stop turning me down. Go upstairs now.

723
00:39:23,585 --> 00:39:24,465
It's all right.

724
00:39:26,145 --> 00:39:27,185
Are you feeling better now?

725
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:29,025
-Thank you for having me.
-It's no problem.

726
00:39:30,945 --> 00:39:31,985
Bring him upstairs.

727
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:33,945
Are you feeling better now?

728
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:42,425
Little rascal. Go on now.

729
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,625
Okay, it's fine.

730
00:39:43,705 --> 00:39:45,145
Don't worry about it. I've got it.

731
00:39:45,225 --> 00:39:46,705
-Okay.
-Zhizhi, bring him upstairs.

732
00:39:48,105 --> 00:39:49,945
Why did you drink so much?

733
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:56,425
Dear, is the soup ready?

734
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:58,185
Just wait a little longer.

735
00:39:59,345 --> 00:40:00,665
