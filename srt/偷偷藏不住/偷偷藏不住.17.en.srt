ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

2
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:25,785
What's wrong?

3
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:29,345
What are you doing, Duan Jiaxu?

4
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:30,465
What did you call me?

5
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:33,345
I mean, what did you just do?

6
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:35,265
Given our current relationship,

7
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:37,225
you shouldn't be calling me Duan Jiaxu.

8
00:02:37,305 --> 00:02:38,785
You…

9
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:40,425
I wasn't asleep just now.

10
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:41,785
I knew what you were doing.

11
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,345
So you weren't asleep, were you?

12
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,265
What did I do just now then?

13
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:50,905
Tell me.

14
00:02:57,305 --> 00:02:59,425
Come closer. I won't say it out loud.

15
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:03,345
Closer.

16
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:06,505
Do you want to whisper it?

17
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:16,505
I don't know

18
00:03:17,225 --> 00:03:18,625
what I've done either.

19
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:26,385
That was unexpected.

20
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:33,425
Even though I did that just now,

21
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,705
it doesn't mean

22
00:03:35,825 --> 00:03:37,745
that I have feelings for you.

23
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:39,785
Got it? I mean…

24
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:41,225
I haven't agreed yet.

25
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:44,265
It doesn't mean you have feelings for me.

26
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:47,105
That means you took advantage of me.

27
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:52,905
Well, you took advantage of me first.

28
00:03:54,665 --> 00:03:56,745
Are you saying

29
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:58,865
that no matter what I do to you,

30
00:03:58,945 --> 00:04:00,145
you will do the same to me?

31
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:02,625
That's not what I meant.

32
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,465
If you do this again,

33
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:07,945
I will tell my brother.

34
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:08,905
Go ahead.

35
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:10,585
Tell him.

36
00:04:12,425 --> 00:04:13,865
After all,

37
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:16,184
we'll have to go public sooner or later.

38
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:17,825
It's better to do it sooner.

39
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:28,185
I haven't agreed yet.

40
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:32,185
I've successfully brainwashed you.

41
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,705
Jiaxu…

42
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:39,345
Stop looking at me.

43
00:04:43,945 --> 00:04:46,465
Jiaxu, you should leave.

44
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:48,025
I can't focus if you stay here.

45
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:51,585
Hi, everyone.

46
00:04:52,185 --> 00:04:53,385
-Hello.
-Hello.

47
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:54,305
I'm an alumnus.

48
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:55,865
-I'm Wang Lin.
-The speaker is here.

49
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:58,265
The topic of today's sharing session

50
00:04:58,345 --> 00:04:59,505
is future career planning.

51
00:05:00,465 --> 00:05:01,385
Nice!

52
00:05:05,425 --> 00:05:07,945
I know it seems early to talk about this

53
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:09,305
since you are only freshmen.

54
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:12,145
However, I believe in being prepared.

55
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:16,345
Left.

56
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:17,865
To the left. That's right.

57
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,465
What's wrong?

58
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:22,425
Yu Xin, look!

59
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:23,865
What is it?

60
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:26,185
Sangsang's crush attended her class!

61
00:05:26,265 --> 00:05:27,625
-Look.
-Seriously?

62
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:28,545
Yes.

63
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:31,665
They attract so much attention.

64
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:33,745
-I like it.
-I bet I know why.

65
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:35,345
He bailed on Sangsang several times,

66
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:37,345
so he specifically came

67
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:38,305
to make it up to her!

68
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,225
It feels nice to walk around

69
00:05:55,745 --> 00:05:56,785
on campus.

70
00:05:58,825 --> 00:05:59,785
Didn't you take walks

71
00:05:59,865 --> 00:06:01,265
during your time at university?

72
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:02,785
I didn't.

73
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:05,185
Why would I? I had no one to walk with.

74
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,025
Didn't my brother take walks with you?

75
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:09,225
Your brother taking walks with me?

76
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:11,905
Am I that desperate?

77
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:13,665
I'll tell him you said that.

78
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:17,945
If you enjoy taking walks,

79
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,865
I can keep you company today.

80
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:23,105
Chen Qiang, go for it!

81
00:06:23,185 --> 00:06:25,025
Chen Qiang, you've got this!

82
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:27,185
You are the best, Chen Qiang!

83
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:28,785
-It's Weiwei.
-Chen Qiang, go!

84
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:29,785
-Want to watch?
-Enough.

85
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:32,945
-Sure. Let's go.
-Everyone knows he's your boyfriend.

86
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:35,465
Go for it!

87
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:37,545
Chen Qiang, go for it!

88
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,225
-You startled me.
-You guys are here too.

89
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:40,305
-Hi.
-Hi, guys.

90
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:41,865
-Hello.
-Are you here to watch the game too?

91
00:06:42,545 --> 00:06:44,345
He said he wanted to watch.

92
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:45,265
Look at Chen Qiang.

93
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:51,065
Is that your boyfriend?

94
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:52,025
Yes.

95
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,425
Isn't he cool?

96
00:06:57,865 --> 00:06:59,665
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

97
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:01,545
-Are you okay, Jiang Ming?
-Jiang Ming!

98
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,785
Can you still play?

99
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:03,985
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

100
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:05,065
I'm okay.

101
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:06,185
Are you hurt?

102
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:08,465
-Are you okay?
-Did you sprain your ankle?

103
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:10,105
Yes.

104
00:07:10,185 --> 00:07:11,625
Elevate your foot.

105
00:07:11,705 --> 00:07:13,225
-Use this iced tea.
-Apply it here.

106
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:14,665
Thank you.

107
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,465
You should go to the infirmary.

108
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:18,945
It's okay.

109
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:19,985
This is an old injury.

110
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,465
I'll be better after resting.

111
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:23,185
Now we're down one player.

112
00:07:23,265 --> 00:07:24,785
Why don't you guys

113
00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:26,025
find someone to replace me?

114
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:29,625
Hey.

115
00:07:30,225 --> 00:07:31,305
Can you fill in?

116
00:07:33,505 --> 00:07:34,345
Can I?

117
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:37,145
Can you play?

118
00:07:39,705 --> 00:07:41,025
Come on. Let's play.

119
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:41,985
Let's go.

120
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:43,505
Get some rest.

121
00:07:43,585 --> 00:07:44,625
Hold this for me.

122
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:48,265
Wait here for me.

123
00:07:49,745 --> 00:07:50,745
You will defend him.

124
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,345
He's pretty good.

125
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:03,505
Hey! Nice shot!

126
00:08:03,585 --> 00:08:05,865
Sangsang, your crush is pretty good.

127
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:07,585
That's not just pretty good, okay?

128
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:09,625
He's perfect.

129
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:12,025
Sangsang is being pursued
by such a perfect guy.

130
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:13,225
She's so lucky.

131
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:17,145
Good job!

132
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:18,305
Good job!

133
00:08:18,385 --> 00:08:19,665
Nice game!

134
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:20,705
Shoot!

135
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:22,585
Come.

136
00:08:23,265 --> 00:08:24,225
Okay.

137
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:29,825
Yes! Nice job!

138
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:31,145
He's really good!

139
00:08:31,225 --> 00:08:32,585
-Nice!
-Impressive!

140
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,225
It went in!

141
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:52,865
He's quite good.

142
00:08:53,905 --> 00:08:55,985
Isn't that guy Sang Zhi's brother?

143
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:57,985
You misunderstood.

144
00:08:58,065 --> 00:08:59,705
They aren't related.

145
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:09,865
Have some iced tea after the game.

146
00:09:09,945 --> 00:09:10,785
Thank you.

147
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,705
-Here.
-Do you need a drink?

148
00:09:27,105 --> 00:09:29,385
CHAPTER 17, FALLEN

149
00:09:29,465 --> 00:09:31,425
I WANT US TO BE TOGETHER

150
00:09:34,305 --> 00:09:35,545
Girls.

151
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,585
Do you have any summer plans?

152
00:09:37,665 --> 00:09:39,705
Are you going home or traveling?

153
00:09:41,065 --> 00:09:42,425
I'm not going home for the break.

154
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:44,385
No?

155
00:09:44,465 --> 00:09:45,585
Where are you going then?

156
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:47,025
Chen Qiang and I have made plans.

157
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:48,985
We are going to travel

158
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:50,505
during the summer break.

159
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:51,865
Really?

160
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,705
That's so romantic.

161
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:56,665
-How nice.
-I previously made a game prototype.

162
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:59,065
A design company has shown interest.

163
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:00,345
I'm going to intern

164
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:01,985
at their company this summer.

165
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:05,025
-Really?
-Congratulations.

166
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:07,505
Interning during freshman year?

167
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:08,545
That's right!

168
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:10,225
It's a great company.

169
00:10:10,305 --> 00:10:12,305
I have to seize the opportunity.

170
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:14,905
Sangsang, are you going home
for the summer?

171
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:16,425
I…

172
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:19,145
Or are you staying here with your crush?

173
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:23,105
He's too busy.

174
00:10:23,185 --> 00:10:25,065
I don't think he has time for me.

175
00:10:25,945 --> 00:10:28,225
I don't want to go home
for the summer either,

176
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:31,065
so I want to talk to my mom about it.

177
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:32,865
I think getting a summer internship

178
00:10:32,945 --> 00:10:34,705
is better than staying at home.

179
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:36,585
Agreed. Totally agreed.

180
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:39,665
Yu Xin.

181
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:41,105
What do I need

182
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:43,025
to include in my resume?

183
00:10:43,105 --> 00:10:44,145
It's important

184
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:45,985
to highlight your specialty.

185
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,425
Let me take notes.

186
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,825
And don't forget.

187
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:51,985
Aren't you good at system maintenance?

188
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:53,785
Put your system maintenance portfolio on--

189
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:55,465
-The first page.
-Yes.

190
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:58,065
-The most visible section.
-Yes. And then…

191
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:00,865
SANG ZHI

192
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:01,905
Sang Yan.

193
00:11:09,305 --> 00:11:11,345
What do you want?

194
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:15,905
SILLY DOG

195
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:20,105
SILLY DOG

196
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:23,185
I don't want to go home for the summer.

197
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:26,865
I plan to get an internship here

198
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:29,025
to enrich my university life.

199
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:32,185
I don't want to waste my youth.

200
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:33,505
While I'm still young,

201
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:35,465
I want to try everything I can.

202
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:36,425
So

203
00:11:36,985 --> 00:11:39,785
can you help me talk
to Mom and Dad about this?

204
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:43,105
If Mom still pressures you

205
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:45,145
to get married during Chinese New Year,

206
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:47,065
I'll speak up for you.

207
00:11:49,785 --> 00:11:53,225
SANG ZHI

208
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,625
Let me ask you.

209
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:06,905
Is your postgraduate boyfriend going home?

210
00:12:08,465 --> 00:12:10,265
Listen, you're coming home for the summer.

211
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:12,545
Listen to yourself.

212
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,465
I'm embarrassed for you
even through the screen.

213
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,705
SILLY DOG

214
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:32,385
Don't call me. I'm busy right now.

215
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:46,665
Sang Yan.

216
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,025
I told you.

217
00:12:49,105 --> 00:12:51,385
I'm staying here for an internship,

218
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:52,785
for work.

219
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:54,545
It's not for dating.

220
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:56,265
Besides,

221
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:58,945
the person I'm interested in

222
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:00,865
is older than you,

223
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:03,545
but not older than Dad.

224
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,865
Don't be so petty.

225
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:08,705
Just because you didn't date in college

226
00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:10,185
and can't find a girlfriend now,

227
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:11,505
you can't be jealous of me.

228
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:13,665
You need to be more magnanimous.

229
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:17,425
Don't get it wrong.

230
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,145
I'm not jealous at all.

231
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:22,785
I have a girlfriend.

232
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:27,185
Also, let me tell you.

233
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,465
Don't become stupid after falling in love.

234
00:13:29,545 --> 00:13:31,505
When you met your online friend
during high school,

235
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:33,105
you were only young and rebellious.

236
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:35,985
You have to come home for the summer.

237
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:36,905
Listen.

238
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:39,825
I dare you to not come back.

239
00:13:39,905 --> 00:13:42,065
I'll fly there and drag you home myself.

240
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:49,225
Who…

241
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:52,785
Who would believe
that you have a girlfriend?

242
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:54,785
You are just lying to me.

243
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:56,825
And besides…

244
00:13:57,345 --> 00:13:59,225
Besides, I am staying

245
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,665
to work at an internship.

246
00:14:01,745 --> 00:14:03,225
If you don't agree,

247
00:14:03,305 --> 00:14:04,905
I will tell Mom.

248
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:08,745
You are so irritating!

249
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:14,705
Why didn't you invite Chen Qiang?

250
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:16,905
The professor told him to go

251
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:18,465
and retake the test.

252
00:14:19,385 --> 00:14:21,625
-Let's have dumplings again later.
-Noodles.

253
00:14:21,705 --> 00:14:23,305
-Dumplings!
-Let's have noodles again.

254
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:24,665
-Just once.
-It's really good.

255
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:25,945
Give me a minute.

256
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:27,025
Just a minute.

257
00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:29,145
Where are you going?

258
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:30,065
What are you doing?

259
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,505
Jiang Ming.

260
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:38,905
Hi, Wangwang.

261
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:41,185
This is for you.

262
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:42,785
My mom said this works well

263
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:44,065
for bruises and sprains.

264
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:46,625
Thank you.

265
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:49,225
What is going on?

266
00:14:50,865 --> 00:14:53,585
-At the basketball court yesterday,
-What is she doing?

267
00:14:53,665 --> 00:14:55,305
you asked about Sangsang's brother.

268
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:57,345
It's okay.

269
00:14:57,825 --> 00:14:59,385
Sang Zhi has found someone she likes.

270
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,505
I should be happy for her.

271
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:03,745
-Sang Zhi?
-I'm glad you're okay.

272
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,625
They are talking and smiling.

273
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:09,745
Thank you for the ointment.

274
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,985
I'll return it when I'm done with it.

275
00:15:12,065 --> 00:15:13,065
It's okay.

276
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,345
I'm leaving now.

277
00:15:14,425 --> 00:15:15,305
Okay.

278
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:17,625
-Bye.
-Bye.

279
00:15:20,305 --> 00:15:21,665
-What was that?
-What's going on?

280
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:23,145
-What's up?
-What's the situation?

281
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:24,745
I knew it!

282
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:26,185
I could tell that day at the court.

283
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:27,745
You rushed to him when he was injured!

284
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:29,945
You are quite something.

285
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,425
So what's your plan?

286
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:32,785
Well…

287
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:34,985
What? Go after him if you like him.

288
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:37,305
-Don't hesitate.
-Yu Xin, you're catching on.

289
00:15:37,385 --> 00:15:38,385
Get lost.

290
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:41,545
The video-editing course this semester

291
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,145
wants us to conduct an interview.

292
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:45,425
I was thinking of interviewing Jiang Ming.

293
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:47,265
Do you think

294
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:49,465
he will agree to it?

295
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:51,705
He's right there. Just ask him yourself.

296
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,065
-Right.
-It's a great opportunity.

297
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:55,505
The two of you
can spend some time together.

298
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:56,425
Good for you.

299
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:57,385
You've got some moves.

300
00:15:57,465 --> 00:15:58,865
-Impressive.
-You are good at this.

301
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:00,465
Stop teasing me.

302
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:04,105
THE DREAM GAMES

303
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:43,465
Are you still in class?

304
00:16:49,065 --> 00:16:50,345
Let's get beef noodles later.

305
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:51,305
Sure.

306
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:53,825
SANG ZHI

307
00:16:53,905 --> 00:16:55,385
Are you off work?

308
00:16:57,905 --> 00:16:58,745
Yes.

309
00:16:58,825 --> 00:16:59,665
DUAN JIAXU

310
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:01,345
Do you not have classes this evening?

311
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:02,745
DUAN JIAXU

312
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,944
I have plans tonight.

313
00:17:13,224 --> 00:17:14,265
What plans?

314
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,625
You said you have plans tonight.

315
00:17:43,705 --> 00:17:44,665
I do.

316
00:17:44,745 --> 00:17:46,345
I have to celebrate someone's birthday.

317
00:17:49,905 --> 00:17:51,625
Happy birthday.

318
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:56,545
I forgot that it's my birthday.

319
00:17:57,545 --> 00:17:58,465
I understand.

320
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,785
Old people don't like
celebrating their birthdays.

321
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:02,065
My dad is the same.

322
00:18:02,585 --> 00:18:04,945
Yes, I'm getting old.

323
00:18:06,105 --> 00:18:07,025
That's why

324
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:11,385
I hope you can help me get married
before I turn 27.

325
00:18:14,185 --> 00:18:15,545
When you are 27,

326
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:17,345
I won't have graduated yet.

327
00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:19,025
So who are you going to marry?

328
00:18:19,585 --> 00:18:20,825
From the sound of that,

329
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:23,105
I don't think you refused.

330
00:18:24,105 --> 00:18:25,385
So I'll take that as a yes.

331
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,385
You're so shameless.

332
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:28,465
Of course.

333
00:18:28,545 --> 00:18:29,985
I'm pursuing a young girl

334
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:32,145
and someone as difficult as you at that.

335
00:18:32,225 --> 00:18:33,505
Of course I have to be shameless.

336
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,265
So you think I'm difficult.

337
00:18:56,665 --> 00:18:57,505
By the way,

338
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:00,065
did my brother, Qian Fei, and the others

339
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:01,625
wish you a happy birthday?

340
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,825
They don't even remember
their own birthdays.

341
00:19:03,905 --> 00:19:05,025
Why would they remember mine?

342
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:07,465
So they haven't?

343
00:19:08,585 --> 00:19:10,385
What about your colleagues?

344
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:12,665
Did they celebrate your birthday today?

345
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:16,625
They are all so busy.

346
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:18,585
They don't have time for these things.

347
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:32,585
Do you know what day it is today?

348
00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:33,505
SILLY DOG

349
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:38,265
SENIOR

350
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,825
Remember to send me the design.

351
00:19:44,105 --> 00:19:45,585
Who are you texting?

352
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:48,785
A senior classmate.

353
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:51,505
A senior classmate?

354
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:52,905
What does he want?

355
00:19:54,265 --> 00:19:55,785
It's about a school event.

356
00:19:58,665 --> 00:19:59,865
Is he handsome?

357
00:20:01,945 --> 00:20:03,265
Morally upright?

358
00:20:03,905 --> 00:20:05,625
Is he a head taller than you?

359
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:09,065
He has a girlfriend.

360
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:11,705
I'm just asking.

361
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:18,625
SANG YAN

362
00:20:21,825 --> 00:20:24,465
Why is my brother suddenly calling you?

363
00:20:24,545 --> 00:20:25,465
That's strange.

364
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,945
You're right. I'll reject the call then.

365
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:31,065
Answer it.

366
00:20:35,225 --> 00:20:36,105
Hi.

367
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:38,185
Hello, Duan Jiaxu.

368
00:20:38,785 --> 00:20:41,265
I just remembered
that it's your birthday today.

369
00:20:42,905 --> 00:20:44,185
Yes. So?

370
00:20:44,265 --> 00:20:46,065
Congratulations, buddy.

371
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:48,425
Even at your age,
you still don't have a girlfriend.

372
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:50,785
By the way, let me ask you a question.

373
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:51,985
I'm hanging up.

374
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:53,465
No, hang on.

375
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,345
Did my sister give you the gift?

376
00:21:00,145 --> 00:21:01,425
Yes.

377
00:21:01,505 --> 00:21:02,945
That one is from me.

378
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:07,105
That's all.

379
00:21:07,185 --> 00:21:09,065
I'm just calling to wish you
a happy birthday.

380
00:21:09,545 --> 00:21:11,425
By the way, let me ask you something.

381
00:21:11,985 --> 00:21:13,665
Have you met my sister's boyfriend?

382
00:21:20,305 --> 00:21:21,345
Boyfriend?

383
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:25,345
I told you. It's a postgraduate student.

384
00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:30,305
I remember now.

385
00:21:30,385 --> 00:21:31,745
I think I've met him.

386
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:33,905
What kind of guy is he?

387
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:35,465
The little demon is quite infatuated.

388
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,545
She plans on staying in Yihe
and not coming home.

389
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,505
-I don't know what charm he has---
-Sang Yan.

390
00:21:42,545 --> 00:21:44,785
Was that my sister?

391
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,825
Are you two together?

392
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:51,945
Yes.

393
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:53,185
You…

394
00:21:53,265 --> 00:21:55,105
You've wished him a happy birthday,

395
00:21:55,185 --> 00:21:56,465
so you can hang up now.

396
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:59,185
Don't tell me you two--

397
00:21:59,265 --> 00:22:00,465
No.

398
00:22:00,545 --> 00:22:01,945
No.

399
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:03,505
Don't overthink it.

400
00:22:03,985 --> 00:22:06,065
You said no before I even finished.

401
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:07,505
Why are you so worked up?

402
00:22:07,585 --> 00:22:09,225
I know what you were going to say.

403
00:22:09,305 --> 00:22:10,465
That's enough.

404
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:11,465
You can hang up now.

405
00:22:11,545 --> 00:22:12,985
Are you two having dinner together?

406
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:15,465
Yes.

407
00:22:15,545 --> 00:22:18,345
I can't be a heartless friend like you.

408
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:19,865
Also,

409
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:22,065
why did you say

410
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:23,625
the gift was from you?

411
00:22:23,705 --> 00:22:26,225
I bought the gift for him.

412
00:22:27,865 --> 00:22:30,065
Isn't it a bit schmaltzy for a grown man

413
00:22:30,145 --> 00:22:31,545
to celebrate his birthday?

414
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,825
Little demon,

415
00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:34,625
don't stay out too late.

416
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:35,705
I'm hanging up now.

417
00:22:35,785 --> 00:22:36,905
Just hang up.

418
00:22:37,545 --> 00:22:38,665
Good night, buddy.

419
00:22:38,745 --> 00:22:39,585
Have an early night.

420
00:22:44,025 --> 00:22:46,145
Boyfriend?

421
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:49,425
What boyfriend?

422
00:22:53,225 --> 00:22:54,785
I told him

423
00:22:56,465 --> 00:22:58,225
that I'm about to start dating,

424
00:22:58,305 --> 00:22:59,625
not that I'm already dating.

425
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:01,065
He misunderstood.

426
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:03,665
A postgraduate student?

427
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:06,785
Is it too late for me to apply?

428
00:23:08,465 --> 00:23:10,265
How else will we explain it to Sang Yan?

429
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:12,705
Maybe we can tell him

430
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,145
that you broke up
with that postgraduate boyfriend

431
00:23:16,225 --> 00:23:17,585
and got together with me.

432
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:19,545
That might work.

433
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,625
That definitely won't work.

434
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:27,265
When did I get together with you?

435
00:23:27,345 --> 00:23:28,385
That's so weird.

436
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:31,785
You've already told your brother.

437
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:33,865
And you still won't admit to liking me?

438
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:40,465
Did you already know?

439
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:43,225
Know what?

440
00:23:53,705 --> 00:23:55,385
All right, jokes aside,

441
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:56,905
let me ask you something.

442
00:23:58,865 --> 00:24:00,345
Go on.

443
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:02,305
Do you really have no feelings for me?

444
00:24:11,705 --> 00:24:13,185
Maybe just a little bit.

445
00:24:17,185 --> 00:24:18,265
Okay.

446
00:24:22,745 --> 00:24:24,185
Why aren't you surprised?

447
00:24:31,065 --> 00:24:33,105
Don't you find it strange

448
00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:35,745
that I have feelings for you,

449
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:37,185
but won't agree to be with you

450
00:24:37,265 --> 00:24:38,745
and am making you pursue me?

451
00:24:39,985 --> 00:24:41,785
You said it's only a little bit.

452
00:24:41,865 --> 00:24:43,105
It's probably not strong enough

453
00:24:43,185 --> 00:24:44,425
for you to want to date me.

454
00:24:46,225 --> 00:24:47,825
What if I never agree

455
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:49,225
to be with you?

456
00:24:49,305 --> 00:24:51,545
Then I will pursue you every day.

457
00:24:52,705 --> 00:24:53,785
After all,

458
00:24:54,385 --> 00:24:57,065
this might be the only relationship
you'll have in your whole life.

459
00:25:00,105 --> 00:25:02,705
So whatever other young girls have,

460
00:25:02,785 --> 00:25:04,065
Zhizhi

461
00:25:04,785 --> 00:25:06,185
has to have it too.

462
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:30,945
Ms. Sang, everything is ready for you.

463
00:25:31,025 --> 00:25:31,945
This way, please.

464
00:25:32,025 --> 00:25:34,865
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

465
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:37,145
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

466
00:25:37,225 --> 00:25:38,105
What is this?

467
00:25:38,185 --> 00:25:40,465
-Happy birthday to you
-What is this?

468
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:43,785
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

469
00:25:43,865 --> 00:25:45,025
Thank you.

470
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:53,825
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

471
00:26:03,265 --> 00:26:04,985
They are getting off work soon.

472
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,505
From here on, it's all on me.

473
00:26:08,465 --> 00:26:09,785
Wait for me here.

474
00:26:09,865 --> 00:26:12,305
I'll prepare a mysterious feast

475
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:13,705
for you.

476
00:26:14,265 --> 00:26:15,265
I will come with you.

477
00:26:15,745 --> 00:26:17,105
No need.

478
00:26:17,185 --> 00:26:18,265
I'll go by myself.

479
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:19,625
It's very mysterious.

480
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:20,745
I'm making it myself.

481
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:31,825
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

482
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:38,545
Thank you for your help.

483
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:39,505
Go home now.

484
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:40,985
Good luck.

485
00:26:49,905 --> 00:26:54,585
MOM'S HANDMADE
LONGEVITY NOODLES RECIPE

486
00:27:12,145 --> 00:27:13,745
Mushroom.

487
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:15,785
Mushroom.

488
00:27:17,105 --> 00:27:18,945
Cut twice.

489
00:27:19,585 --> 00:27:22,025
Use a garnishing knife.

490
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:24,785
And then…

491
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:41,265
So is this my birthday feast?

492
00:27:41,345 --> 00:27:42,505
You…

493
00:27:42,585 --> 00:27:43,905
Why did you come inside?

494
00:27:43,985 --> 00:27:45,385
Wait outside.

495
00:27:45,465 --> 00:27:47,185
I'll be done soon. Very soon.

496
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,785
Are you sure you can do it by yourself?

497
00:27:49,305 --> 00:27:50,425
It's very simple.

498
00:27:51,225 --> 00:27:53,305
-You don't need any help?
-I really don't. Go out.

499
00:27:53,945 --> 00:27:54,825
Good luck.

500
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:56,105
It's very easy.

501
00:27:56,185 --> 00:27:57,825
It's fine. Don't worry about me.

502
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:11,345
Add these in.

503
00:28:19,225 --> 00:28:20,105
Add the noodles.

504
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:55,625
How is it?

505
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:58,185
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

506
00:28:59,465 --> 00:29:00,385
Let me try it.

507
00:29:01,425 --> 00:29:02,665
Don't try it.

508
00:29:02,745 --> 00:29:03,785
You can

509
00:29:03,865 --> 00:29:05,945
just take a photo for a memento.

510
00:29:06,025 --> 00:29:09,025
I haven't tasted it,

511
00:29:09,105 --> 00:29:10,065
so I think…

512
00:29:42,785 --> 00:29:43,945
Is it edible?

513
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:46,345
It's good.

514
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:49,905
It's good?

515
00:29:49,985 --> 00:29:50,865
Yes.

516
00:29:52,385 --> 00:29:53,265
No way.

517
00:29:53,345 --> 00:29:55,105
Let me try it.

518
00:29:55,185 --> 00:29:56,305
-No.
-Why?

519
00:29:56,385 --> 00:29:57,985
You made this for me.

520
00:29:58,945 --> 00:30:00,345
I have to finish it all by myself.

521
00:30:01,105 --> 00:30:02,545
It must taste awful.

522
00:30:03,305 --> 00:30:04,345
It's really good.

523
00:30:04,425 --> 00:30:05,585
Stop eating.

524
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:26,265
This year, you can make three wishes.

525
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:28,905
Two wishes can be spoken out.

526
00:30:28,985 --> 00:30:30,545
Keep the last one to yourself.

527
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:40,545
Wishes won't come true
if there are too many.

528
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:43,145
I only have one wish.

529
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:46,225
That's fine too.

530
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:15,185
Happy birthday.

531
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:17,545
-Thank you.
-What did you wish for?

532
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:21,065
You know what it is.

533
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:01,585
Well…

534
00:32:03,545 --> 00:32:05,905
Your wish is too easy to fulfill.

535
00:32:09,225 --> 00:32:10,825
The answer is yes.

536
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,305
Are you saying

537
00:32:21,785 --> 00:32:23,665
that you will be my girlfriend?

538
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:27,425
That's because I want

539
00:32:29,185 --> 00:32:30,705
to be by your side

540
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:33,785
for all your future birthdays.

541
00:32:38,105 --> 00:32:39,105
Can I?

542
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,465
Of course you can.

543
00:32:47,905 --> 00:32:49,225
Then

544
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:51,865
I will cut the cake for you.

545
00:33:11,105 --> 00:33:12,905
The birthday boy eats first.

546
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:22,025
What?

547
00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:11,185
I

548
00:34:12,304 --> 00:34:14,185
don't really know how to do this.

549
00:34:17,985 --> 00:34:19,665
You always call me old.

550
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,665
It's quite embarrassing

551
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:25,425
to admit this myself.

552
00:34:27,185 --> 00:34:29,185
This is also my first relationship.

553
00:34:31,344 --> 00:34:32,465
And it is also

554
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,105
my first time liking someone so much.

555
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,105
So

556
00:34:43,225 --> 00:34:45,105
don't even think about dumping me.

557
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,945
Why do you keep staring at me?

558
00:35:26,305 --> 00:35:27,705
I just didn't expect you

559
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,345
to say yes so soon.

560
00:35:31,265 --> 00:35:33,185
I feel that today is very special.

561
00:35:34,145 --> 00:35:35,145
How so?

562
00:35:39,465 --> 00:35:41,985
Firstly, this is your first birthday

563
00:35:42,065 --> 00:35:44,105
that I've celebrated with you.

564
00:35:45,945 --> 00:35:49,065
And it's also our first day together.

565
00:35:51,705 --> 00:35:52,945
From now on,

566
00:35:54,825 --> 00:35:56,825
I'll always be by your side.

567
00:36:11,385 --> 00:36:12,745
By the way,

568
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,625
there are some things

569
00:36:15,705 --> 00:36:17,425
I feel I should let you know.

570
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:21,505
I don't think I've told you

571
00:36:22,065 --> 00:36:23,905
about my family situation.

572
00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:25,985
The thing is,

573
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,825
my mom has passed away.

574
00:36:29,865 --> 00:36:30,945
And my dad

575
00:36:31,545 --> 00:36:32,545
is in a coma.

576
00:36:33,545 --> 00:36:35,905
He killed someone while drunk driving.

577
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:38,825
But I've paid off the compensation.

578
00:36:40,585 --> 00:36:41,745
Right now,

579
00:36:42,545 --> 00:36:43,545
I don't

580
00:36:44,105 --> 00:36:45,185
own a house,

581
00:36:45,265 --> 00:36:46,545
but I have a car.

582
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:48,105
I also have some savings.

583
00:36:54,105 --> 00:36:55,145
I'm sorry

584
00:36:56,945 --> 00:36:58,985
to bring this up out of the blue.

585
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:01,305
Please don't feel uncomfortable.

586
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,465
I'm not uncomfortable.

587
00:37:04,665 --> 00:37:07,105
I'm just worried
that talking about these things

588
00:37:08,705 --> 00:37:10,145
might make you sad.

589
00:37:11,865 --> 00:37:13,385
Why would I feel sad?

590
00:37:16,505 --> 00:37:17,785
But

591
00:37:19,745 --> 00:37:22,025
I admit that I might be a bit nervous.

592
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:25,905
Why?

593
00:37:31,985 --> 00:37:33,905
I'm worried that you will mind.

594
00:37:36,665 --> 00:37:38,025
I don't mind.

595
00:38:11,785 --> 00:38:13,665
Sang Zhi, is there a power outage?

596
00:38:13,745 --> 00:38:14,865
I think so.

597
00:38:14,945 --> 00:38:15,785
Okay.

598
00:38:19,705 --> 00:38:20,545
Hello.

599
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:23,065
Girlfriend, are you free later?

600
00:38:23,145 --> 00:38:24,225
Let's have lunch together.

601
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:27,025
I'm going to the library to study.

602
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:28,545
How about another day?

603
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:29,785
The library?

604
00:38:30,425 --> 00:38:31,505
Can't you keep me company?

605
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:33,145
Another day.

606
00:38:33,225 --> 00:38:34,145
All right then.

607
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:35,225
Bye.

608
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:51,785
What are you doing here?

609
00:38:52,385 --> 00:38:54,145
The power is out.
There's nowhere to study.

610
00:38:54,225 --> 00:38:55,305
Why didn't you tell me?

611
00:38:56,185 --> 00:38:58,145
I was just about to go to the library.

612
00:38:58,225 --> 00:38:59,825
I know which library you mean.

613
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:01,345
It's the one nearby.

614
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:02,625
There is very limited seating.

615
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:04,545
All seats will have been taken by now.

616
00:39:05,785 --> 00:39:06,705
Then…

617
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:09,945
-There is a café up ahead.
-Come to my place.

618
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:13,185
Your place?

619
00:39:14,865 --> 00:39:15,825
To study.

620
00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:22,545
You haven't eaten, right?

621
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:23,545
Perfect.

622
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:25,265
I'll make something tasty for you later.

623
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:26,665
You can cook too?

624
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,345
I have a lot of skills.

625
00:39:30,025 --> 00:39:30,945
Such as?

626
00:39:32,105 --> 00:39:33,305
Such as…

627
00:39:51,385 --> 00:39:52,665
Change into slippers.

628
00:39:56,705 --> 00:39:58,745
You can study in my room later.

629
00:39:59,505 --> 00:40:00,585
There's a desk inside.

630
00:40:02,465 --> 00:40:03,345
I…

631
00:40:04,145 --> 00:40:07,665
I can just study here.

632
00:40:07,745 --> 00:40:09,665
I don't need to go to your room.

633
00:40:09,745 --> 00:40:11,705
I'll be cooking here later.

634
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:13,505
Won't I disturb your studying?

635
00:40:17,385 --> 00:40:18,545
What are you thinking?

636
00:40:23,385 --> 00:40:25,225
I've already tidied up the desk for you.

637
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:31,985
Study well.

638
00:40:32,825 --> 00:40:36,665
Jiaxu, what will you be doing

639
00:40:36,745 --> 00:40:37,825
while I study?

640
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,225
I will

641
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:41,505
just be sitting here.

642
00:40:43,665 --> 00:40:44,825
You'll just be sitting here?

643
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:47,905
I want to look at you more.

644
00:41:19,225 --> 00:41:23,985
LUOKA BAKING

645
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,145
Welcome.

646
00:41:25,225 --> 00:41:26,865
-Hi.
-Hi.

647
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:28,225
Excuse me.

648
00:41:28,305 --> 00:41:29,865
Do you make personalized cakes?

649
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,185
Yes, we do.

650
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:33,065
I have a picture.

651
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,185
Can you make something like this?

652
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:36,665
Yes, we can.

653
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,505
When would you like to have it?

654
00:41:39,025 --> 00:41:40,465
Is next Monday okay?

655
00:41:41,345 --> 00:41:42,945
Yes. Let me take it down.

656
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:50,105
Miss, what is your surname?

657
00:41:50,185 --> 00:41:51,025
Sang.

658
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,625
An eight-inch cake.

659
00:41:56,705 --> 00:41:57,825
Miss, your phone is ringing.

660
00:41:58,385 --> 00:41:59,785
Have you taken a photo?

661
00:41:59,865 --> 00:42:01,185
Yes. Go ahead.

662
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:04,985
Hello, Mom.

663
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:06,225
Hi, Zhizhi.

664
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:09,105
I was outside just now.

665
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:10,465
I just got home.

666
00:42:10,545 --> 00:42:13,705
Did you say something
about the recipe for longevity noodles?

667
00:42:13,785 --> 00:42:15,385
Is it someone's birthday?

668
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:17,665
It's Jiaxu's birthday.

669
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:19,825
So it's Xiaoduan.

670
00:42:21,825 --> 00:42:24,465
I'm studying in Yihe

671
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:27,025
and Jiaxu has been taking care of me.

672
00:42:27,785 --> 00:42:29,545
He's all alone here.

673
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:32,145
So I thought

674
00:42:32,665 --> 00:42:35,745
I would make longevity noodles for him.

675
00:42:35,825 --> 00:42:36,745
But

676
00:42:36,825 --> 00:42:39,345
I'm sure you make the most delicious one.

677
00:42:40,785 --> 00:42:42,705
You're becoming more considerate.

678
00:42:43,905 --> 00:42:46,305
Okay, I'll write out the recipe
for longevity noodles

679
00:42:46,385 --> 00:42:47,425
and send it to you later.

680
00:42:47,505 --> 00:42:48,665
Okay.

681
00:42:52,785 --> 00:42:53,625
Bye.

682
00:42:56,145 --> 00:42:57,625
Miss, take a look.

683
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:59,225
It will be an eight-inch cake

684
00:42:59,305 --> 00:43:00,705
to be picked up next Monday.

685
00:43:00,785 --> 00:43:02,145
Will you be picking it up yourself?

686
00:43:02,225 --> 00:43:03,545
-Yes.
-Okay.

687
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,025
It's all set.

688
00:43:05,105 --> 00:43:05,945
Thank you.
