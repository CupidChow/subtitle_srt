ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

2
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:52,105
Go and get changed first.

3
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:54,385
It will be fine.

4
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:27,465
Sang Yan,

5
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:28,465
how is your sister?

6
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:29,705
She's okay.

7
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:31,785
Let's talk to her over dinner.

8
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:32,905
We don't need to.

9
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:34,105
She knows her mistake.

10
00:03:34,185 --> 00:03:35,305
She cried the whole way.

11
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:36,265
I already scolded her.

12
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:37,945
I think that's enough.

13
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:41,865
Do you think she's…

14
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:45,185
Duan Jiaxu said that guy
didn't make any promises.

15
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:46,465
It was her wishful thinking.

16
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:49,825
With her proud personality,

17
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:51,465
if she said it's over, it's really over.

18
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:54,665
She would see it through.

19
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:55,785
Think about it.

20
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:57,825
Whenever she said
she would stop binging anime,

21
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:58,785
she would stop.

22
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:00,905
Has she ever kept a plushie
that she dislikes?

23
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:02,705
You're right about that.

24
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:04,505
It's her teenage rebellion phase.

25
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:06,425
It's normal to rebel once.

26
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:09,065
How about not criticizing her then?

27
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:10,465
Okay.

28
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:12,705
We'll pretend nothing happened
during dinner.

29
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:15,905
As if she came home from school as usual.

30
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:20,985
We need to hold onto her ID card

31
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:23,385
and pay attention to what she does online.

32
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,465
We also need to take her phone.

33
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:27,305
Yes, we have to confiscate her phone.

34
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:32,785
Take this cold medicine upstairs
to her later.

35
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,585
She wore a short skirt.

36
00:04:34,665 --> 00:04:35,745
Don't let her catch a cold.

37
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:36,825
Okay.

38
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:32,265
YIHE UNIVERSITY

39
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:36,385
YIHE UNIVERSITY

40
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:48,505
NANWU, YIHE, MAP TO MY DREAM

41
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:25,465
PURE MILK

42
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,105
Jiaxu.

43
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:27,905
I finally found my dream.

44
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:32,065
My dream is to get into Yihe University.

45
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:37,065
MY DREAM, YIHE UNIVERSITY

46
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:46,865
YIHE UNIVERSITY

47
00:07:46,945 --> 00:07:53,545
YIHE UNIVERSITY

48
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:58,225
DUAN JIAXU

49
00:07:58,305 --> 00:08:03,385
DUAN JIAXU

50
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:08,625
DUAN JIAXU

51
00:08:13,305 --> 00:08:19,385
DUAN JIAXU

52
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:25,545
DUAN JIAXU

53
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:02,105
Jiaxu.

54
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:05,505
Goodbye.

55
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:11,985
NOVEMBER 5TH, SATURDAY

56
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:16,985
GOODBYE, JIAXU

57
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:23,785
TWO YEARS LATER

58
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:40,785
So I've fulfilled my dream

59
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:43,145
and been admitted into Yihe University.

60
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:47,105
I've started a new life here.

61
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:49,665
I've attended military training

62
00:09:50,185 --> 00:09:51,505
and I'm attending my lectures.

63
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:54,105
I've also made new friends

64
00:09:54,705 --> 00:09:56,305
and met my lovely roommates.

65
00:09:57,345 --> 00:09:58,385
Hello, everyone.

66
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,665
Welcome to my vlog.

67
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:02,305
Today, I want to show you

68
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:05,025
the most beautiful view at my university.

69
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:05,945
So what could it be?

70
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:08,345
Hello, sorry about that.

71
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:09,385
Hi.

72
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:11,665
He's so handsome!

73
00:10:12,705 --> 00:10:13,865
I'm so proud!

74
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:16,305
To the side is our lecture building.

75
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:17,465
Let me show you around.

76
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:21,265
Let's see who that cool girl is!

77
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:25,465
It's Yu Xin, the coolest girl on campus!

78
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:27,025
For her first cameo in my vlog,

79
00:10:27,105 --> 00:10:29,665
-this is embarrassing!
-You got in my way. Delete it.

80
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:36,665
Sorry about that!

81
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:41,625
I'll go and check on her.

82
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:45,905
Miss, are you okay?

83
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:46,985
I'm fine.

84
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:48,345
Let me help you.

85
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:50,665
Thank you.

86
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:52,785
Why are you carrying so many books alone?

87
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:54,825
My classmates are all busy.

88
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,345
I'm fetching books for my professor.

89
00:10:56,425 --> 00:10:58,145
Where are you headed? I'll carry them.

90
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,985
The Digital Media Department up ahead.

91
00:11:00,065 --> 00:11:01,425
Let's go then.

92
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:02,465
Thank you.

93
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:16,785
Sangsang!

94
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:18,545
Where's Wangwang?

95
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,585
Wangwang?

96
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:25,025
Let me show you my best friend.

97
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:28,225
-She's over there.
-Why are you talking like that?

98
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:30,945
-Hi.
-Who is this?

99
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:33,185
He's just--

100
00:11:33,265 --> 00:11:35,865
Hi, I'm Jiang Ming
in the long-distance running team.

101
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,305
I'm helping her carry these books.

102
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:38,905
So you're in the Sports Department.

103
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:40,185
We're in Digital Media.

104
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:41,465
We're all roommates.

105
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:42,665
Hello.

106
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:44,305
Hello.

107
00:11:44,385 --> 00:11:46,625
Since we've met,
let's add each other on WeChat.

108
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,105
It's my birthday tomorrow.

109
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:50,225
Invite your friends to come to my party.

110
00:11:50,705 --> 00:11:51,865
Sure, no problem.

111
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:52,985
Let me scan your QR code.

112
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:54,665
Sure, here you go.

113
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:55,665
Come on, scan his code.

114
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:57,625
She can forward it to us later.

115
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,545
Okay, I'll do that.

116
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,065
Then you can send me

117
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:02,865
the time and location later.

118
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:03,905
No problem.

119
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:07,305
I'll get that. Thank you for your help.

120
00:12:07,385 --> 00:12:08,265
But…

121
00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:09,225
It's okay.

122
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:10,585
Why don't you walk her there?

123
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:11,865
Go with her.

124
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:14,385
Okay, then…

125
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:17,225
It's that building.

126
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:19,385
Okay. Then we'll get going.

127
00:12:20,585 --> 00:12:21,625
-Bye.
-Yes, go ahead.

128
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:22,585
Bye.

129
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:24,945
-Come tomorrow. Bring your friends.
-We'll wait to eat with you.

130
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,185
-Cut it out, will you?
-What?

131
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:29,185
What are we having for lunch?

132
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:30,225
Anything will do.

133
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:34,465
Can you keep up with us?

134
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:36,025
No.

135
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:37,465
Yes, you can.

136
00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:43,905
This place is pretty spacious.

137
00:12:43,985 --> 00:12:45,625
-Yes.
-I think my lipstick is too bright.

138
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:46,985
-Let me wipe some off.
-Don't.

139
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:48,385
I think it's pretty.

140
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:50,385
I thought you weren't
wearing any lipstick.

141
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:52,625
-Really?
-It's this year's latest trendy color.

142
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:53,825
It looks good on everyone

143
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:55,105
Just look at her complexion.

144
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:56,745
It still can't be compared to mine.

145
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:57,785
Hey, Ning Wei.

146
00:12:58,545 --> 00:12:59,505
Hi, Jiang Ming.

147
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:01,385
-Hello.
-Hello.

148
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,705
This is my teammate, Chen Qiang.

149
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:04,625
Hi.

150
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:05,825
-Hi.
-These are my classmates.

151
00:13:05,905 --> 00:13:07,505
They're in the Sports Department.

152
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:08,425
-Hello.
-Hi.

153
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:10,425
These are my friends from a school club.

154
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:11,505
-Hello.
-Hello.

155
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:12,745
There are so many people here.

156
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,585
This is the birthday girl, Ning Wei.

157
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:15,785
These are her roommates.

158
00:13:15,865 --> 00:13:17,465
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

159
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:18,785
Thank you so much.

160
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,545
Since everyone is here, let's head inside.

161
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,025
-Okay, let's go.
-Come on.

162
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:23,305
Let's go inside.

163
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,265
Come on.

164
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:28,465
Sangsang, today is my first birthday party

165
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:29,705
at university.

166
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,025
-The first one?
-How do you want to celebrate?

167
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:33,025
I want

168
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:35,625
to eat well, have fun,

169
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:37,025
-and then party.
-Control yourself.

170
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,465
CHAPTER EIGHT, REENCOUNTER

171
00:14:11,545 --> 00:14:13,385
SAYING GOODBYE BEFORE MEETING AGAIN

172
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:18,825
Restless and fidgeting privileged guests

173
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:20,745
-Presumptuous and conceited…
-Jiaxu, come.

174
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,065
-Come here.
-Xiaoduan, sit here.

175
00:14:22,705 --> 00:14:23,705
Why are you so late?

176
00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:26,265
-I went to the restroom.
-Sit down.

177
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:27,225
Xiaoduan.

178
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:28,905
Let me do the introduction.

179
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:31,025
She's my best friend, Xiaoxu.

180
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:33,145
She works in HR at a foreign company.

181
00:14:33,225 --> 00:14:34,625
She was having dinner nearby,

182
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:36,465
so I asked her to join us.

183
00:14:37,065 --> 00:14:38,985
This is Duan Jiaxu,

184
00:14:39,065 --> 00:14:40,425
our company's chief programmer.

185
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,545
He's young and promising.

186
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,905
Isn't he handsome?

187
00:14:42,985 --> 00:14:43,945
He is indeed handsome.

188
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:45,065
It's nice to meet you.

189
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:47,385
Hello.

190
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:49,625
Hello.

191
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,505
Stop being awkward. Come.

192
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:57,065
Let's have a drink and become friends.

193
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:58,545
I know you don't drink.

194
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:01,905
We know you don't drink. Here.

195
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:02,945
Thank you, buddy.

196
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:04,545
Let's all have a drink together.

197
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,985
-Cheers.
-Cheers to Xiaoxu.

198
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:07,545
-Here.
-Cheers.

199
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,785
-Here, cheers.
-Cheers.

200
00:15:10,585 --> 00:15:11,825
Dear, what's the title

201
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:13,985
of the song that we just dueted?

202
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:16,345
-It's called…
-"Like Falling Into a Sea of Love".

203
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:17,865
-Yes, that's it.
-Don't stand around.

204
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:19,465
-Pick this song.
-Skip the rest.

205
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:22,265
Xiaoduan, our offices are close together.

206
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:24,105
You two can meet up for coffee sometime.

207
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:26,145
-Sure.
-I haven't heard you sing in a while.

208
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,385
Sing one for me.

209
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:28,425
The song is playing.

210
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:30,945
Xiaoxu, join in.

211
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:36,345
I want to live in your heart

212
00:15:54,785 --> 00:15:57,585
-They are also happy fruit people
-They are also happy fruit people

213
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:05,185
-They are also happy fruit people
-They are also happy fruit people

214
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:07,745
What do you usually like to do?

215
00:16:09,065 --> 00:16:10,585
What do you usually enjoy doing?

216
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:13,185
Read comics.

217
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:15,385
Do you have any recommendations?

218
00:16:16,705 --> 00:16:18,665
It depends on your preferences.

219
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:22,665
Do you like outdoor activities?

220
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:23,865
For example, hiking.

221
00:16:23,945 --> 00:16:25,025
No.

222
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:26,305
What about amusement parks?

223
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:28,105
No.

224
00:16:28,585 --> 00:16:29,985
-Next time, do you want to--
-Hey!

225
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:31,305
It's my birthday.

226
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:33,105
Why are the three of you flirting here?

227
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:34,865
Hurry and sing and dance for me!

228
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:36,665
Go quickly. Hurry up.

229
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:40,265
Weiwei, happy birthday!

230
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:41,785
Happy birthday!

231
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:46,265
I'm going outside for some air.

232
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:47,345
I'll be right back.

233
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:48,265
Okay.

234
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:54,145
-Treat it as a friend passing by
-Treat it as a friend passing by

235
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:09,025
Sang Zhi?

236
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:33,985
Did you start smoking?

237
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:37,185
I don't smoke. That's not mine.

238
00:17:38,145 --> 00:17:39,185
I clearly saw it fall out

239
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:40,545
from your pocket.

240
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:42,825
You've picked up bad habits.

241
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:43,825
I'm confiscating it.

242
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:46,585
No.

243
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:49,185
I told you it belongs to my friend.

244
00:17:49,905 --> 00:17:51,705
They may have misplaced it.

245
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:53,905
-If you don't give it back--
-You've even been drinking.

246
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:00,665
Just a little.

247
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:06,625
I'll put the rest aside.

248
00:18:06,705 --> 00:18:08,745
It has been a while.
You didn't even greet me.

249
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:19,825
Jiaxu.

250
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:23,225
Did you come here to have fun?

251
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:25,465
It's my roommate's birthday.

252
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:27,425
When did your military training end?

253
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:29,105
In the middle of last month.

254
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:31,225
You didn't visit me
during the Golden Week holiday.

255
00:18:31,305 --> 00:18:32,265
I had classes.

256
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:35,185
Classes during the holiday?

257
00:18:35,265 --> 00:18:36,345
My mistake.

258
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:38,545
My part-time job.

259
00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:40,905
I see. A part-time job.

260
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:42,985
Yes.

261
00:18:43,065 --> 00:18:44,385
I used to work part-time too.

262
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:46,625
Other than working part-time,

263
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:48,945
I had to meet your teacher,

264
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:51,105
do your homework, and take you to school.

265
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:56,225
Ungrateful thing.

266
00:18:58,465 --> 00:18:59,945
This kiddo has no conscience at all.

267
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:01,825
Well, it's fine.

268
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:04,145
Jiaxu.

269
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:06,105
You were already a senior back then.

270
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,705
I'm only a freshman.

271
00:19:08,185 --> 00:19:10,505
I might be a little busier than you were.

272
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:12,825
Are you calling me old now?

273
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:15,145
Sang Zhi.

274
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:16,865
Take a moment and reflect.

275
00:19:16,945 --> 00:19:18,545
What exactly did I do wrong to you?

276
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,905
I never said that.

277
00:19:22,265 --> 00:19:23,145
Also…

278
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:28,625
I'm a grown-up now.

279
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:31,185
If you keep calling me a kiddo,

280
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:32,385
don't you think

281
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:34,745
it's a little awkward?

282
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:36,305
How old can you be?

283
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:38,105
You're still a kid.

284
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:45,785
Yes.

285
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:48,105
I'm still a kid.

286
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:50,585
Two years…

287
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:53,025
After two years,

288
00:19:53,105 --> 00:19:54,745
you've indeed grown older

289
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:56,865
and weathered.

290
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:03,225
Sang Zhi, check your phone and see

291
00:20:03,305 --> 00:20:04,985
how many messages I've sent you.

292
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:07,305
You didn't reply even once. Why?

293
00:20:07,385 --> 00:20:10,105
It's like I said. I had classes.

294
00:20:10,185 --> 00:20:11,745
Did you need to isolate yourself?

295
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:12,945
Of course I had to.

296
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:14,145
If I didn't,

297
00:20:14,225 --> 00:20:16,225
how else could I get into Yihe University?

298
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:23,505
Fine.

299
00:20:25,705 --> 00:20:27,225
It's past nine and you're still out.

300
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:28,345
I'm leaving soon.

301
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:30,305
-Get your things. I'll see you back.
-It's okay.

302
00:20:30,385 --> 00:20:32,305
I can go back with my friends.

303
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:35,505
That works too.

304
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:43,065
Sang Zhi.

305
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:47,745
It has been so long.

306
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:49,265
You've learned how to put on makeup.

307
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:50,905
You're indeed different from before.

308
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:18,785
Okay, this looks good.

309
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:19,825
Don't move.

310
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,465
Okay, change your pose.

311
00:21:22,745 --> 00:21:24,345
I'll take a photo of you and the cake.

312
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:27,465
Sangsang, where were you?

313
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:28,825
We're all waiting for you. Come.

314
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:31,105
-That's right.
-We're about to cut the cake.

315
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:32,465
I'm so sorry.

316
00:21:32,545 --> 00:21:34,145
Come on, everyone. Gather around.

317
00:21:34,225 --> 00:21:35,465
Come here.

318
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:36,465
Time to cut the cake.

319
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,745
-Light it.
-Light the candle.

320
00:21:37,825 --> 00:21:39,185
-Take a picture.
-Take a picture.

321
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,425
Wait, hold on.

322
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:49,745
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

323
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:53,145
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

324
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:56,665
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

325
00:21:56,745 --> 00:21:59,625
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

326
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:02,585
Make a wish!

327
00:22:02,665 --> 00:22:03,665
Make a wish.

328
00:22:03,745 --> 00:22:04,705
Okay, here I go.

329
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:10,465
It's recording.

330
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:16,825
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

331
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:19,265
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

332
00:22:19,345 --> 00:22:20,985
-Cut the cake!
-All right.

333
00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:22,145
Let's move it over there.

334
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:23,465
There's more space there.

335
00:22:24,425 --> 00:22:25,905
Weiwei, what time are we leaving?

336
00:22:25,985 --> 00:22:28,065
I reserved this room until 11 p.m. Why?

337
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:29,185
Until 11 p.m.?

338
00:22:29,905 --> 00:22:31,865
My mom will call me.

339
00:22:32,705 --> 00:22:34,865
You're right. I've forgotten.

340
00:22:35,585 --> 00:22:37,065
Why don't you go first?

341
00:22:38,105 --> 00:22:39,625
How long will you guys stay?

342
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:41,585
We won't stay too late.

343
00:22:41,665 --> 00:22:42,785
Anyway, you should go first

344
00:22:42,865 --> 00:22:44,265
in case your mom calls.

345
00:22:44,345 --> 00:22:46,265
Okay, I'll go back first.

346
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:47,505
Don't stay out here too late.

347
00:22:47,585 --> 00:22:48,705
Okay, don't worry.

348
00:22:49,545 --> 00:22:50,425
I'm going back first.

349
00:22:50,505 --> 00:22:51,825
Remember to text us.

350
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:53,545
-Stay safe.
-Be careful on your way back.

351
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:54,585
Come back early.

352
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:55,545
-Okay.
-Okay.

353
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:57,265
-Okay, bye.
-Take care.

354
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,985
Bring the leftover cake back for me.

355
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:01,945
-Just go.
-A big slice.

356
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:03,945
Remember to text us when you get back.

357
00:23:04,505 --> 00:23:05,345
Be careful.

358
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:15,745
I'm a grown-up now.

359
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:17,185
I'm no longer a kid.

360
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:18,345
How old can you be?

361
00:23:19,025 --> 00:23:20,065
You're still a kid.

362
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:22,865
That old thing.

363
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,025
Do you mean me?

364
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,545
I suppose so.

365
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,705
I'm the only "old thing"

366
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:40,185
that you've met tonight.

367
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:44,945
I wasn't talking about you.

368
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:46,745
Then who were you referring to?

369
00:23:47,905 --> 00:23:50,145
I was just mumbling.

370
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,305
So tell me.

371
00:23:52,385 --> 00:23:53,985
Who crossed you and made you say that?

372
00:23:54,465 --> 00:23:55,465
I would like to know too.

373
00:23:58,585 --> 00:24:00,065
Jiaxu, the thing is…

374
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:03,585
You don't have to be nosy.

375
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:05,865
Wait.

376
00:24:08,465 --> 00:24:09,625
Didn't you say

377
00:24:09,705 --> 00:24:11,225
that you're leaving with your friends?

378
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:17,225
Let's go.

379
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:19,465
This old thing
will see you back to campus.

380
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:53,785
Are you still cold?

381
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:57,625
No.

382
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,465
Jiaxu.

383
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,545
Where do you live?

384
00:25:18,345 --> 00:25:19,505
Wenting Garden.

385
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:20,705
It's near the city library.

386
00:25:22,385 --> 00:25:24,265
That's in the opposite direction

387
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:25,505
of the campus.

388
00:25:26,105 --> 00:25:27,665
You will have to take a big detour.

389
00:25:28,545 --> 00:25:29,745
Actually,

390
00:25:30,825 --> 00:25:32,305
I could've gone to the metro station.

391
00:25:32,945 --> 00:25:33,825
Then…

392
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:41,305
Young lady,

393
00:25:42,065 --> 00:25:44,825
I just wanted to settle a score with you

394
00:25:45,425 --> 00:25:46,665
while driving you back.

395
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:54,665
Actually…

396
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:58,705
Actually, that term

397
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:01,105
is considered civilized

398
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:03,705
in young people's vocabulary.

399
00:26:04,785 --> 00:26:05,905
I think

400
00:26:07,185 --> 00:26:09,065
it's not considered offensive, right?

401
00:26:09,585 --> 00:26:11,025
How much beer did you have tonight?

402
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,065
One bottle.

403
00:26:17,665 --> 00:26:19,305
Be more careful when you go out.

404
00:26:20,305 --> 00:26:21,785
When you're out with strangers,

405
00:26:21,865 --> 00:26:23,345
it's best if you don't drink alcohol.

406
00:26:28,705 --> 00:26:30,465
They're not entirely strangers.

407
00:26:31,065 --> 00:26:33,345
We're all students
but in different departments.

408
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,065
Besides, my roommates were there.

409
00:26:36,865 --> 00:26:37,945
I know.

410
00:26:38,025 --> 00:26:39,505
I was just reminding you.

411
00:26:59,945 --> 00:27:00,865
Why don't we

412
00:27:01,545 --> 00:27:02,545
talk for a bit?

413
00:27:05,985 --> 00:27:07,265
Why do I get the feeling

414
00:27:07,345 --> 00:27:09,505
that you have something against me, kiddo?

415
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,185
I don't like it when you call me that.

416
00:27:27,705 --> 00:27:28,705
Kiddo?

417
00:27:32,705 --> 00:27:35,185
I am indeed five years older than you.

418
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:37,345
And after you're married,

419
00:27:38,505 --> 00:27:40,865
your parents will still see you as a kid.

420
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:42,545
So do you want to be my dad?

421
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:49,465
That's not it.

422
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:54,425
I mean,

423
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:56,905
I'm already a grown-up, so…

424
00:27:59,225 --> 00:28:00,385
If you keep calling me that,

425
00:28:00,465 --> 00:28:01,785
I'll feel very uncomfortable.

426
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,145
Okay.

427
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:07,985
I get it.

428
00:28:30,105 --> 00:28:30,985
Jiaxu.

429
00:28:31,705 --> 00:28:33,345
What do you do now?

430
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:36,585
Sang Yan said you're a programmer.

431
00:28:38,945 --> 00:28:40,945
Yes, I'm a game developer.

432
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:42,985
A game developer?

433
00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:47,145
One of my roommates is a hardcore gamer.

434
00:28:47,665 --> 00:28:48,665
What is your game called?

435
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:50,025
I can ask her about it.

436
00:28:50,705 --> 00:28:51,665
A Dream of Jianghu.

437
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:56,625
By the way,

438
00:28:57,345 --> 00:28:58,425
I just remembered something.

439
00:29:00,665 --> 00:29:02,185
Did you choose Yihe University

440
00:29:02,265 --> 00:29:03,905
because of your old online friend?

441
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:07,585
Am I right?

442
00:29:07,665 --> 00:29:08,625
No.

443
00:29:09,985 --> 00:29:10,945
No?

444
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:13,505
It's not because of that.

445
00:29:14,705 --> 00:29:16,265
Yihe University's Digital Media program

446
00:29:16,345 --> 00:29:17,865
is the best in the country.

447
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:20,825
And my scores were good enough,

448
00:29:20,905 --> 00:29:22,465
so of course I came to Yihe University.

449
00:29:26,425 --> 00:29:27,825
When I called your brother before,

450
00:29:28,345 --> 00:29:31,025
he seemed quite angry
about you coming to Yihe University.

451
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:33,505
I thought it was because
of that old online friend.

452
00:29:35,385 --> 00:29:36,305
No, it wasn't.

453
00:29:37,065 --> 00:29:37,905
I…

454
00:29:39,105 --> 00:29:40,505
I haven't contacted him

455
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:42,505
for a long time.

456
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:46,065
I'm glad to hear that.

457
00:29:56,105 --> 00:29:58,465
My brother was angry

458
00:29:59,305 --> 00:30:01,385
because I didn't tell him

459
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:02,385
when I applied.

460
00:30:03,305 --> 00:30:04,705
But I did tell my parents

461
00:30:05,185 --> 00:30:07,145
and they supported me in coming here.

462
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,865
I didn't know what kept him busy.

463
00:30:09,945 --> 00:30:11,305
He didn't ask me anyway.

464
00:30:11,785 --> 00:30:13,145
So I didn't tell him.

465
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:14,705
I thought he didn't care.

466
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:16,345
But after I finished applying,

467
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,065
he criticized me

468
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,305
and argued with me.

469
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,905
So of course, I argued back.

470
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:32,705
Besides…

471
00:30:36,305 --> 00:30:37,905
Besides, I'm an adult now.

472
00:30:38,705 --> 00:30:40,985
I know what I'm doing.

473
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:46,505
Yes,

474
00:30:47,705 --> 00:30:48,945
Sang Zhi is all grown up now.

475
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:57,025
But you still see me as a kid.

476
00:31:24,185 --> 00:31:26,425
You came all the way here by yourself

477
00:31:26,505 --> 00:31:27,385
to attend university.

478
00:31:28,225 --> 00:31:29,825
Come to me if you run into any problems.

479
00:31:30,745 --> 00:31:31,705
Got it?

480
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:40,785
I was just joking with you earlier.

481
00:31:41,465 --> 00:31:43,505
I know it's normal for people your age

482
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:45,385
to have your own activities.

483
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:47,825
I truly don't think
you have no conscience.

484
00:31:51,465 --> 00:31:54,465
But you did call me an old thing.

485
00:31:55,105 --> 00:31:56,625
How is that not considered offensive?

486
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,065
A young lady should speak more politely.

487
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:05,865
Sorry, I won't say that again.

488
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:08,865
It's good that you know you're wrong.

489
00:32:10,505 --> 00:32:11,785
When you have free time,

490
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:14,065
you can come to have a meal with me.

491
00:32:28,665 --> 00:32:29,625
Is it here?

492
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,065
Make some honey water to drink

493
00:32:34,145 --> 00:32:35,905
to avoid waking up with a headache.

494
00:32:39,865 --> 00:32:41,105
Thank you, Jiaxu.

495
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:45,665
By the way,

496
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:47,905
I'm alone over here.

497
00:32:48,585 --> 00:32:49,865
So when I heard your brother say

498
00:32:49,945 --> 00:32:51,625
that you were coming here for university,

499
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:53,785
I was really happy.

500
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:06,225
Okay, go inside.

501
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:11,945
I'll head inside then.

502
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:15,185
See you, Jiaxu.

503
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:17,225
Good night.

504
00:33:19,105 --> 00:33:20,065
Good night.

505
00:34:53,344 --> 00:34:54,385
By the way,

506
00:34:55,425 --> 00:34:56,905
I'm alone over here.

507
00:34:57,545 --> 00:34:59,025
So when I heard your brother say

508
00:34:59,105 --> 00:35:00,865
that you were coming here for university,

509
00:35:02,105 --> 00:35:03,185
I was really happy.

510
00:35:11,705 --> 00:35:13,665
Why would he be alone here?

511
00:35:15,785 --> 00:35:17,505
Isn't his home in Yihe?

512
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:21,745
Besides,

513
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:24,065
what about his girlfriend?

514
00:35:33,385 --> 00:35:34,345
JIAXU

515
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:36,505
If you're ever out so late,

516
00:35:36,585 --> 00:35:38,185
find someone to accompany you back.

517
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:52,985
SANG ZHI

518
00:35:53,065 --> 00:35:54,065
Okay.

519
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:00,705
JIAXU

520
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:03,545
Sang Zhi, check your phone and see

521
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,145
how many messages I've sent you.

522
00:36:05,225 --> 00:36:06,345
You didn't reply even once.

523
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:08,425
HAPPY NEW YEAR,
I SENT YOUR PARENTS GIFTS

524
00:36:08,505 --> 00:36:10,585
YOU GET ONE TOO,
BUT DON'T TELL SANG YAN

525
00:36:25,505 --> 00:36:26,505
Don't you find Chen Qiang

526
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:28,505
from the Sports Department a bit weird?

527
00:36:28,585 --> 00:36:29,625
He giggles when he sees me.

528
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:33,025
Jiang Ming is in that department too.

529
00:36:33,585 --> 00:36:34,705
He's a cheerful and nice guy.

530
00:36:34,785 --> 00:36:36,185
Do you find him weird?

531
00:36:36,265 --> 00:36:37,545
Well, he's not weird.

532
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:38,745
But Jiang Ming

533
00:36:38,825 --> 00:36:41,705
already likes someone else.

534
00:36:43,025 --> 00:36:45,265
-Is that so?
-Yes.

535
00:36:46,425 --> 00:36:47,905
Really?

536
00:36:47,985 --> 00:36:49,025
I don't know.

537
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:50,745
I know.

538
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:52,465
I didn't drink a lot.

539
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:55,105
Sang Yan, can you stop yelling at me?

540
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:06,705
What's so funny?

541
00:37:08,065 --> 00:37:10,305
Sangsang, after you left last night,

542
00:37:10,385 --> 00:37:12,585
Jiang Ming kept asking
if you would be safe.

543
00:37:12,665 --> 00:37:14,225
He's quite a nice person.

544
00:37:14,745 --> 00:37:16,905
Has he contacted you?

545
00:37:18,985 --> 00:37:20,665
I haven't checked my messages yet.

546
00:37:24,185 --> 00:37:25,425
JIANG MING

547
00:37:26,145 --> 00:37:27,545
If you're ever out so late,

548
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:28,905
I can accompany you back.

549
00:37:32,785 --> 00:37:33,665
JIAXU

550
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,905
If you're ever out so late,

551
00:37:36,985 --> 00:37:38,345
find someone to accompany you back.

552
00:37:41,945 --> 00:37:42,985
What did he text you?

553
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:45,265
Show me.

554
00:37:47,705 --> 00:37:48,905
He didn't say anything.

555
00:37:48,985 --> 00:37:50,505
Is there something that you can't share

556
00:37:50,585 --> 00:37:52,825
with the girls of Dorm 202?

557
00:37:56,945 --> 00:37:58,585
Well, there is actually something.

558
00:38:00,585 --> 00:38:01,945
But it's not about me.

559
00:38:03,705 --> 00:38:04,945
It's my friend.

560
00:38:10,305 --> 00:38:11,385
Sure, a friend.

561
00:38:13,345 --> 00:38:15,305
My friend liked her brother's friend

562
00:38:15,945 --> 00:38:17,425
when she was young.

563
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:20,985
Her brother's friend later started dating.

564
00:38:22,185 --> 00:38:23,265
Then she gave up on him.

565
00:38:25,785 --> 00:38:27,785
But they ran into each other recently.

566
00:38:28,825 --> 00:38:30,625
So she doesn't know what to do.

567
00:38:30,705 --> 00:38:32,145
Her brother's friend?

568
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:33,705
How old is he?

569
00:38:34,265 --> 00:38:36,345
He graduated
from university two years ago.

570
00:38:36,425 --> 00:38:37,905
That would mean

571
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,865
he's about 24 to 25--

572
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:40,905
He's 24.

573
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:42,745
What's his job?

574
00:38:43,225 --> 00:38:44,265
My brother said

575
00:38:44,345 --> 00:38:46,265
he's a programmer who develops games.

576
00:38:46,345 --> 00:38:47,385
Game development?

577
00:38:48,305 --> 00:38:49,705
I'm an expert in that.

578
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,665
That's right!

579
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:52,705
Yu Xin.

580
00:38:52,785 --> 00:38:55,145
Have you heard of a game
called A Dream of Jianghu?

581
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:58,265
A Dream of Jianghu
is this year's most popular game!

582
00:38:59,465 --> 00:39:00,465
And I'm playing it now.

583
00:39:01,545 --> 00:39:02,785
-Is it this?
-You're not a gamer.

584
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:04,385
I need to recommend it to you.

585
00:39:04,465 --> 00:39:06,465
This game can be considered

586
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:07,945
the hottest mobile game of the year.

587
00:39:08,025 --> 00:39:10,625
Whether it's the characters,
scenes, or plot design,

588
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:12,185
you can say they're all top-notch.

589
00:39:12,265 --> 00:39:13,145
Do you see that?

590
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:15,505
Did he develop it?

591
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:20,265
That means he is impressive.

592
00:39:20,345 --> 00:39:22,705
Wait a minute. This isn't the point.

593
00:39:24,105 --> 00:39:25,185
The point is,

594
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:27,225
does he have a girlfriend right now?

595
00:39:27,305 --> 00:39:28,385
That's right.

596
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:29,345
Does he?

597
00:39:32,785 --> 00:39:33,905
I don't think so.

598
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,825
You don't think so?

599
00:39:38,065 --> 00:39:40,785
So does your friend still like him?

600
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:43,985
I don't think so.

601
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:47,145
You don't think so?

602
00:39:48,145 --> 00:39:49,025
Then it's simple.

603
00:39:49,105 --> 00:39:50,065
If yes, go for it.

604
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:51,705
If not, treat him as an ordinary friend

605
00:39:51,785 --> 00:39:52,825
and chat once in a while.

606
00:39:52,905 --> 00:39:54,145
What's the fuss?

607
00:39:55,065 --> 00:39:57,385
What is your friend worrying about?

608
00:40:00,385 --> 00:40:01,625
She's worried

609
00:40:05,345 --> 00:40:06,505
that this guy

610
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,785
only sees her as a little girl.

611
00:40:11,665 --> 00:40:13,185
So how old

612
00:40:13,265 --> 00:40:14,825
was your friend

613
00:40:14,905 --> 00:40:16,105
when she had a crush on him?

614
00:40:17,905 --> 00:40:18,905
She was in high school.

615
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:23,225
That's normal.

616
00:40:23,305 --> 00:40:24,545
You were underage at the time.

617
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:25,945
If he liked you back then,

618
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:27,225
he's the one with a problem.

619
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:31,505
Don't interrupt.

620
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:34,985
Sangsang,

621
00:40:35,465 --> 00:40:37,945
describe this guy to us.

622
00:40:43,345 --> 00:40:44,225
He's handsome.

623
00:40:44,305 --> 00:40:45,345
He's handsome.

624
00:40:46,865 --> 00:40:47,865
He had good grades.

625
00:40:51,265 --> 00:40:53,105
He's very interesting to talk to.

626
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:54,585
He's…

627
00:40:56,585 --> 00:40:57,465
What?

628
00:40:58,945 --> 00:41:00,265
Very charismatic.

629
00:41:01,785 --> 00:41:03,945
He's handsome and charismatic.

630
00:41:05,385 --> 00:41:07,025
Then how did you two meet?

631
00:41:07,945 --> 00:41:09,185
He's my brother's best friend.

632
00:41:09,265 --> 00:41:10,745
He often came over to our house.

633
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:12,705
Based on your description,

634
00:41:12,785 --> 00:41:14,025
he definitely has a girlfriend.

635
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:15,785
It has to be so.

636
00:41:15,865 --> 00:41:16,785
Case closed.

637
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,185
You don't even know him.

638
00:41:19,265 --> 00:41:20,625
Don't go yet. Let's talk some more.

639
00:41:21,265 --> 00:41:22,225
Wangwang, come on.

640
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:23,385
Time to study.

641
00:41:27,025 --> 00:41:28,265
You guys are such mood spoilers.

642
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:30,385
Forget it.

643
00:41:32,065 --> 00:41:33,625
I'll go and focus on my great endeavors.

644
00:41:35,225 --> 00:41:36,465
Don't come back too late.

645
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:37,385
Okay.

646
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:39,025
Be careful.

647
00:41:39,105 --> 00:41:40,465
-Bye.
-Stay safe.

648
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:41,745
Bye.

649
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:19,625
Welcome.

650
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,305
Excuse me. Where is the honey?

651
00:42:22,385 --> 00:42:24,065
Sir, it's in the last aisle.

652
00:42:24,145 --> 00:42:25,265
Okay, thank you.

653
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:34,185
HONEY

654
00:42:48,225 --> 00:42:49,625
-Thank you.
-Have a good night.
