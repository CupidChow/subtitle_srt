{\an8}ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

2
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,600
<i>Forget it. I'm not waiting any longer.</i>

3
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,880
<i>That's it if he's not coming.</i>

4
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,120
Liar.

5
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
He won't help,

6
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,840
just the same as Sang Yan.

7
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,240
Liar.

8
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
Sang Zhi?

9
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,640
Get up.

10
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,640
Are you all right?

11
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,120
Are you hurt?

12
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,960
Why aren't you speaking?

13
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,320
No one comes so late.

14
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,360
When should I have come?

15
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,520
My class ended at 4:20 p.m.

16
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,520
It's way past that time.

17
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,160
I didn't know.

18
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,040
Then

19
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,040
I apologize to you.

20
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,280
Later,

21
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,880
I'll take the reprimand in your place.

22
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,120
{\an8}-All right?
-No need.

23
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,040
{\an8}Let's go.

24
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,360
<i>Will he show up today as well?</i>

25
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
Hello, Jiaxu.

26
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,600
<i>Are you awake?</i>

27
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,240
If you're late by too much,

28
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,600
you shall

29
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,600
never find a girlfriend.

30
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,640
Do you…

31
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,480
I got here long ago.

32
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,640
I went to buy milk for you.

33
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,120
You ingrate.

34
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,200
You can't say stuff like that.

35
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,720
If I never find a girlfriend,

36
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,120
you will be dead meat.

37
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,200
Let's go.

38
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,200
Do your homework
at the breakfast shop up ahead.

39
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,520
Come on.

40
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,520
Your essay booklet.

41
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,680
ESSAY BOOKLET

42
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,960
Start writing.

43
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,320
<i>I don't think he read it.</i>

44
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,040
Have you eaten breakfast?

45
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll buy some breakfast.

46
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,760
SWEET COCOA CAKE SHOP

47
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,960
What is good here?

48
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,160
This is our newest red bean bun.

49
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,280
-Do you want one?
-Sure.

50
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,600
Give me a bottle of that too.

51
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,840
Honey water?

52
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,000
Nothing for you?

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,080
Do you need anything else?

54
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,800
This is good too.

55
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,120
Yes, I'll have one of these.

56
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,680
-Okay.
-How much is it?

57
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,880
Just scan the QR code.

58
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,680
<i>Later,</i>

59
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,840
the teacher will complain to you.

60
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,760
You just need to agree with him.

61
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,960
I'm experienced in this.

62
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,320
By the way, don't say anything later.

63
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,920
If we get caught lying,

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,960
we'll be doomed.

65
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,560
That sounds very scary.

66
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,280
Be brave.

67
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,640
Is this it?

68
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,680
It will be fine.

69
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,400
I can do it.

70
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,360
Reporting, sir.

71
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,160
My brother is here.

72
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,360
Hello, sir.

73
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,920
I am Sang Zhi's brother, Sang Yan.

74
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,040
Sang Zhi's brother?

75
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,400
It's obvious he is my brother

76
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,560
since he is so good-looking.

77
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,920
Why is it you who came today?

78
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,920
My parents--

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Sorry, sir. It's like this.

80
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,160
My parents have to go to a work site today

81
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,800
for a meeting with a material supplier,

82
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,120
so they sent me.

83
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,640
Recently,

84
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,600
we noticed Sang Zhi hasn't been proactive

85
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,920
in doing her homework

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,400
when she gets home,

87
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,280
so I'm here to learn more
about her situation.

88
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,560
You must help us.

89
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes.

90
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Come and sit down.

91
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,640
What's your name, sir?

92
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,600
I'm Mr. Chen.

93
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,360
Sang Zhi's academic results

94
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,320
are not the problem.

95
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,920
Her grades

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,600
have always been top of the class.

97
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,120
Her foundational knowledge

98
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,800
is also very excellent.

99
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,200
However, one still needs

100
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,840
the right attitude toward studying.

101
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,800
She cannot be arrogant.

102
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,520
-Yes.
-Right?

103
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,920
In Mathematics…

104
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,640
He is so tall. Why are you so short?

105
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,360
What? Is there a problem?

106
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,560
All of it is linked.

107
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,840
If this lesson…

108
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,360
Your class teacher talks so much.

109
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,160
It's always the same speech.

110
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,360
The quality of study

111
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,400
and her mentality…

112
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,560
Look at him go.

113
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,960
Look at how obedient your brother is.

114
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,559
In our studies,

115
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,480
we must grasp

116
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,960
both aspects.

117
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,760
Sang Yan, take a seat.

118
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,280
I can grab a chair.

119
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,040
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

120
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,160
Sang Yan.

121
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
In truth,

122
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,120
I didn't want to trouble you

123
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,000
to come to school.

124
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,560
No, this is troubling you instead.

125
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,080
However, Sang Zhi

126
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,240
gives me a headache.

127
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,280
When I'm giving lessons,

128
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,160
{\an8}she is drawing.

129
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,040
{\an8}I called her up to answer questions

130
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,800
because I wanted her

131
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,520
to focus on the lesson.

132
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,440
Yes.

133
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,600
In the end,

134
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,840
she stood up and asked me,
"Where were you?"

135
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,440
As if she had every right.

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,600
How will her behavior

137
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,120
affect other students' studies?

138
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,640
That actually happened, Mr. Chen?

139
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,560
Yes.

140
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,440
Sang Zhi.

141
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,760
Come here.

142
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,840
How could you talk to Mr. Chen that way?

143
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
That's wrong.

144
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,520
You must respect your teacher.

145
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,320
Let's forget about this for now.

146
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,360
Last time,

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,440
I called your parents here

148
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,400
because of Sang Zhi's issue.

149
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,760
Yes.

150
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,760
Was it your mom

151
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,040
or your dad who came?

152
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,560
-It was--
-Your mom.

153
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,160
-That's right.
-Yes, your mom.

154
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,400
That's right.

155
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,320
I wasted a lot of your mom's time.

156
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,720
Yes.

157
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,760
In the end, time was wasted.

158
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,200
Yes.

159
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,600
But nothing changed.

160
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,680
Sang Yan.

161
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,840
When you get home,

162
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,760
you must tell your mom

163
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,840
about our conversation

164
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,560
without leaving anything out.

165
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,680
And your dad!

166
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,720
Tell your dad

167
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,440
so he can work on Sang Zhi's mentality.

168
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,760
Of course.

169
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,320
Sang Zhi is a very smart child.

170
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,520
Her grades

171
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,160
are outstanding.

172
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,160
No. What is so smart about her?

173
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,280
She is top of her class

174
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,520
because you taught her well.

175
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,120
All of us know it.

176
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,080
Mr. Chen, you are an excellent teacher.

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,320
I've heard a lot about you.

178
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,240
Sang Zhi has caused you a lot of trouble.

179
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,920
Hit and scold her as necessary.

180
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,320
No, I can't hit her.

181
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,240
It's fine. If you are strict,

182
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,720
we will be relieved.

183
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,680
Yes.

184
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,000
The kid is smart.

185
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,280
We want what is best for her.

186
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,440
-Yes.
-Right?

187
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,360
If she studies well,

188
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,960
I'm sure she can advance directly

189
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,440
to the high school.

190
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,480
I also believe Sang Zhi

191
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,800
will have a bright future

192
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,680
with you teaching her, Mr. Chen.

193
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,680
Sure.

194
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,840
This conversation

195
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,040
has been very successful.

196
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,840
Go home.

197
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,280
Sure.

198
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,880
Apologize to Mr. Chen.

199
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,680
Mr. Chen, goodbye.

200
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,240
Apologize.

201
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,560
Write it well.

203
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,120
There's cake when you're done.

204
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,680
ISAAC ASIMOV: THE END OF ETERNITY

205
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,080
Focus on your homework.

206
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,120
Drink the milk first.

207
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,360
It's better when it's warm.

208
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
What's wrong?

209
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,200
You act as if I'll take it from you.

210
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,360
Girl.

211
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,320
Are you angry at me because of my joke?

212
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,320
You haven't said anything.

213
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,480
I have to do my homework.

214
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,440
Fine. Do it.

215
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,720
Jiaxu.

216
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,800
Are you from Nanwu?

217
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,840
No.

218
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,120
I'm from Yihe.

219
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,240
Yihe?

220
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,240
Then

221
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,880
will you return to Yihe

222
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
during summer break?

223
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
No.

224
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,960
Why not?

225
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,200
Why do you care about that?

226
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,320
-Well--
-Do your homework.

227
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,600
Okay.

228
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,840
CHAPTER TWO, CLOSER

229
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,560
WHAT MADE ME MEET SOMEONE LIKE YOU

230
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,920
{\an8}XURI MIDDLE-HIGH SCHOOL

231
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm going in.

232
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,440
Wait.

233
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,080
What is this?

234
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,280
I stole a peek at your essay,

235
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,040
so I wrote a new one as compensation.

236
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,080
You…

237
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,000
You read my essay?

238
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,440
I wrote it for fun.

239
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,400
{\an8}A STRAY DOG

240
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,640
<i>When I saw this scene,</i>

241
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,480
<i>I stopped in my tracks.</i>

242
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,800
<i>My mood turned as foul as the weather.</i>

243
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,240
<i>When I saw the dog's face,</i>

244
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,080
<i>I became even more upset.</i>

245
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,200
<i>I couldn't help
but go over and talk to it.</i>

246
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,760
<i>When I saw it,</i>

247
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,760
<i>I was reminded of my brother</i>

248
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,760
<i>because its face looks</i>

249
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,080
<i>as if it was made from the same mold
as my brother.</i>

250
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,520
<i>It could even be my brother's son.</i>

251
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,840
Sleep early.

252
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,960
-Bye.
-What?

253
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,400
Last night…

254
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,160
HELPING MY BROTHER MOVE

255
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,840
HELPING MY BROTHER MOVE

256
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,880
<i>"Helping my brother move."</i>

257
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,120
Sang Zhi, what is this?

258
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,480
It's nothing.

259
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,160
Nothing? Is it a love letter?

260
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,480
No, it's yesterday's homework.

261
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,600
Homework?

262
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,560
It really is homework.

263
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,120
One, two, three, four,

264
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,000
five, six, seven, eight.

265
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,960
Sang Zhi.

266
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,680
Let's go.

267
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,600
One, two, three, four.

268
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,840
One, two, three, four.

269
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,160
Enough, Fu Zhengchu. That's enough.

270
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,960
What a coincidence.

271
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,000
A coincidence, Fu Zhengchu?

272
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,520
You dance every day.

273
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,640
Aren't you embarrassed?

274
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,920
I worked hard to get into this school

275
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
so I can run into you anywhere.

276
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,520
Both of you.

277
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,600
Sang Zhi.

278
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,400
Did I not dance well enough today?

279
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,040
I told you!

280
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,640
One, two, three, four.

281
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,960
Two, two, three, four. Rhythm.

282
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,560
One, two, three, four.

283
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,960
Two, two, three, four.

284
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,800
Three, four. Rhythm.

285
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,040
I heard there's an important day
next week.

286
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,160
Do you want to know what day it is?

287
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,079
I don't.

288
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
It is

289
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,560
my birthday.

290
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,839
Sang Zhi!

291
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,480
My birthday is next week! You must come!

292
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,680
Your birthday is next week?

293
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,599
I will think of a way

294
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,040
to ask Sang Zhi to come.

295
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,600
Really?

296
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,440
Leave it to me.

297
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,560
-Then I--
-You come too, Yin Zhenru.

298
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,040
Order anything you want.

299
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,040
Sure.

300
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,480
Sangsang, guess what?

301
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,600
Just now, Fu Zhengchu…

302
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,720
Aren't you allergic to milk?

303
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,200
Why are you drinking it?

304
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,720
-I'm not drinking it.
-Good morning.

305
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,400
-Good morning.
-Then why did you buy it?

306
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,200
Let's begin our lesson.

307
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,160
All rise.

308
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,000
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, sir.

309
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
Sit down.

310
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,840
Everyone, open your textbook to page 17.

311
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,320
SANG YAN IS A PIG

312
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,840
"Helping my brother move.

313
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,920
Today, I helped my brother
move into his dorm.

314
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,560
My brother has so many things.

315
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,120
I really don't know

316
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,800
why a guy like him

317
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,680
has so many useless things.

318
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,520
Dot, dot, dot.

319
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,120
Thankfully, I was there to help him."

320
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,400
It's so childish,

321
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,200
as if an elementary school child wrote it.

322
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,360
"Luckily,

323
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,320
the silver lining is

324
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,680
that I saw my brother's roommate
whom I had not seen

325
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,160
in years.

326
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,320
Although he called me a thief

327
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,360
upon seeing me,

328
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,240
I know

329
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,080
he was only joking with me."

330
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,200
Busted, thief.

331
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,760
<i>"Seeing that</i>

332
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,240
<i>he has helped me before</i>

333
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,400
<i>and wants</i>

334
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,280
<i>to help me again,</i>

335
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,400
I won't hold any grudges this time.

336
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,920
From now on,

337
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,040
I won't call him old either."

338
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,840
I will still do that.

339
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,080
"Also, the fox plushie he gave me

340
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,400
is not ugly at all.

341
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,480
However,

342
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
I still want

343
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,160
a brother like him.

344
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,440
As for my brother,

345
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,000
he can go anywhere he wants.

346
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,440
If anyone wants him,

347
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,720
just take my brother away.

348
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,320
P.S.

349
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,960
That boy told me

350
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,000
that he was also very happy

351
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,200
to see Sang Zhi again."

352
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,200
VERY HAPPY TO SEE SANG ZHI AGAIN

362
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,080
Zhizhi, have some grapes.

363
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,800
What are you doing? Drawing?

364
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,800
You…

365
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,760
You can't drink milk.

366
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,040
I'm not drinking it.

367
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,240
Why do you have it then?

368
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,160
Well…

369
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,520
I think the bottle looks nice.

370
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,760
I want to draw it.

371
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,000
You can't take one with milk.

372
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,840
I'll pour out the milk.

373
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,960
I won't drink it.

374
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,000
Honey, you're here.

00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,760

She…

377
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,040
She had a bottle of milk in her room.

378
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,320
I don't know where she got it.

Zhizhi, this weekend, your dad and I

381
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,000
are going to a friend's wedding.

382
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,640
-Do you want to come with us?
-No.

383
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,920
Then I'll tell Sang Yan to stay with you.

384
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,840
No way.

385
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,760
I don't want to be with Sang Yan.

386
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,560
I'll be worried if you are home alone.

387
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,640
I just don't want that.

388
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,400
Zhizhi, what is it that I always say?

389
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,680
"Listen to your mom.

390
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,920
Don't make your mom worry."

391
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,440
I'll deal with your brother.

392
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Don't worry. I won't let him bully you.

393
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,840
Otherwise, I'll cut off his allowance.

394
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,400
He won't listen to you.

395
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,760
I'll talk to him then.

396
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,560
Okay.

397
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,680
There's no problem with me around.

398
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,920
Enough drawing. Come down for dinner.

399
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,760
{\an8}ISAAC ASIMOV: THE END OF ETERNITY

400
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,560
PURE MILK

401
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,640
SEPTEMBER 17TH, THURSDAY

402
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,000
THAT BOY TOLD ME

403
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,360
HE WAS HAPPY TO SEE SANG ZHI AGAIN.

404
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,200
Little demon!

405
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,040
Why didn't you close the door?

406
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,360
Little demon!

407
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,920
Mom told me to eat with you.

408
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,680
Little demon!

409
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,360
Little demon!

410
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,200
Little demon!

411
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,720
Is she in my room?

412
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,240
Little demon!

413
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,120
Little demon!

414
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,000
Where is she?

415
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,800
Why didn't you answer me?

416
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,960
Who are you trying to scare?

417
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,680
Why should I answer?

418
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,600
Bring it here.

419
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,240
Give it to me.

420
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm having a hot pot later.
Are you coming?

421
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,280
No.

422
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,440
What do you want to eat?

423
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,880
Take a guess.

424
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,280
Little demon.

425
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,360
When I was your age,

426
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,520
I had to cook for myself

427
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,800
and for you

428
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,200
when Mom and Dad weren't home.

429
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,040
That was different.

430
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
How so?

431
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,080
Because you didn't have a brother
back then,

432
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,960
but I do.

433
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,160
Cut it out.

434
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,680
Give it to me.

435
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,400
Hello.

436
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,080
You're not in the dorm?

437
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,920
Sure.

438
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,960
I'll pick you up at your workplace.

439
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,240
Half an hour.

440
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,320
Don't worry. I won't forget about you.

441
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,360
Bye.

442
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,400
Sang Yan.

443
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,840
Who are you eating with?

444
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,160
Why do you care?

445
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,080
I even have to beg you to eat with me.

446
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,560
I'm going without you. Bye.

447
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,720
Hello, Mom.

448
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,600
Save it.

449
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,360
Hello, Dad.

450
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,920
You're overdoing it.

451
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,640
I was wrong!

452
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,680
That's right!

453
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,880
Right?

454
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,080
You should've just done that

455
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,200
instead of being naughty.

456
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,160
I'm telling you.

457
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,280
If you behave, I'll let you eat anything.

458
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
Let's go.

459
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
I'm going to freshen up.

460
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,800
Two minutes.

461
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,080
Three minutes.

462
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,320
Fine, 30 minutes. Go on.

463
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,320
Help me grab my phone.

464
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,720
It's inside the fort.

465
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,960
You're still making forts at your age?

466
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,080
Let me see how it is.

467
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,920
Little demon, why are you so quiet?

468
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,080
Sang Zhi.

469
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,240
Are you happy to see me?

470
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,800
Me too.

471
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,320
Cut the nonsense.

472
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,440
What are we eating?

473
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,480
Aren't we eating hot pot at the mall?

474
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,960
Is it too expensive for you now?

475
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,680
Do you think I'll complain about the cost?

476
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,960
You always do that.

477
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,240
When did I do that?

478
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,840
<i>Turns out the roommate he's picking up</i>

479
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,480
<i>is Qian Fei.</i>

480
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,080
Precious Duan Dog!

481
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,120
-Wake up!
-Duan Jiaxu!

482
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,680
Hurry up! Sang Yan is treating us!

483
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,400
Didn't you say ten minutes?

484
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,960
There was traffic.

485
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,120
-Look at the time.
-Aren't you hungry? Hurry up.

486
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,720
Why are you so sleepy?

487
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
He's lying to me again.

488
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
You're so sleepy.

489
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,480
Are you sacrificing your life for money?

490
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,840
Hurry up. I'm starving to death.

491
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,640
<i>He's working so hard,</i>

492
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,360
<i>yet I'm always troubling him.</i>

493
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,720
No, I should've lost weight.

494
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,600
Have you ever lost weight?

495
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,440
No, I weighed myself. I did lose weight.

496
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,520
Why haven't you greeted me
since I got in the car?

497
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Hey, you.

498
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,080
You what?

499
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,520
Just you.

500
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,560
"You are handsome."

501
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,600
No, you're not.

502
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,000
Am I not?

503
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,080
Then why did you blush

504
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,120
when you saw me?

505
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,360
You're shameless!

506
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,000
You are always like this.

507
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
Sang Yan.

508
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,480
Do you remember the physical test
when I ran 1,000 m?

509
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,120
I was out of breath when I completed it.

510
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,800
Then this guy came over and said,

511
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,240
"Why did you blush when you saw me?"

512
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,280
I almost fell in love with him.

513
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,760
He says that even to dogs,

514
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,640
not just humans.

515
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,760
Sang Zhi, ignore him.

516
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
He is not a good guy.

517
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,360
He is not a good guy indeed.

518
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,920
Why are you sowing discord?

519
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,440
Did I?

520
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,440
Sang Zhi, did I sow discord?

521
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,920
I don't think he is a good guy either.

522
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm not a good guy?

523
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,720
Fine.

524
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,120
I'm not a good guy.

525
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,120
Don't you know that?

526
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,760
At least he knows that he's a bad dog.

527
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,400
No good guy comes on so strong.

528
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,240
All right. You guys get off first.

529
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,440
I'm going to park the car.

530
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,960
Sure. I'm starving.

531
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,200
Can I wait for a while?

532
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,160
What for?

533
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,400
Just for a while. I'll stay with you.

534
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,360
No, I can't stop here.

535
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,880
I'll stay with you.

536
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,120
Are you going to pay the fine?

537
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,880
-No, I want to--
-Are you coming?

538
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,800
Take her.

539
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,280
Let's go.

540
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,320
Hurry up. I really can't stop here.

541
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,680
You are really annoying.

542
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,720
I really can't stop here!

543
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,640
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

544
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
A little.

545
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,960
I want to find a restroom first.

546
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,680
Do you have a stomachache?

547
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,080
Qian Fei, it's almost our turn.

548
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,600
-Go on ahead.
-Sure.

549
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,200
I'll find a restroom with you.

550
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,200
No need. I can go on my own.

551
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,640
I'll go with you.

552
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,680
Wait.

553
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,960
Did you bring a napkin?

554
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,840
It's fine.

555
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,000
Wait for me inside. I'll buy it for you.

556
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Go ahead.

557
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,560
<i>Does this mean</i>

558
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,639
<i>he saw it?</i>

559
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,199
{\an8}DON'T PLACE ITEMS UNDER THE SHUTTER

560
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,800
Did you order pig brains?

561
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,760
Tick it all.

562
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,360
-Do you eat it?
-I do.

563
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,000
Chen Junwen wouldn't eat it last time.

564
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,560
Hello.

565
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,200
<i>We've ordered. Why aren't you here yet?</i>

566
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,080
Your sister…

567
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,800
<i>What's wrong with my sister?</i>

568
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,400
It's that time of month for your sister.

569
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,600
What should I do?

570
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,120
<i>Why are you asking me?</i>

571
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,640
Buddy, do me a favor.

572
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,680
Help me buy it.

573
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,320
Me? Buddy, is she your sister or mine?

574
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,160
It's not necessarily a brother's job.

575
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,880
<i>I've never done it over the years.</i>

576
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,040
Enough nonsense.

577
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,640
I'm at the supermarket right now.

578
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
Come down immediately.

579
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,760
Fine. Buy it with me.

580
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,120
This one…

581
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,760
Okay, go.

582
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,480
"Nude S.

583
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,480
It feels like nothing at all--"

584
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,760
Lower your voice!

585
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,000
Then I'll just get the overnight one.

586
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,360
Sure.

587
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,880
This says 42.

588
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,880
-Are there different sizes?
-No idea.

589
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,120
-It's 42.
-Is 42 longer than 35?

590
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,720
Just buy the pocket pack.

591
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,720
Let's go.

592
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,840
Wait.

593
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,720
What is it?

594
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,880
Get a skirt too.

595
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,640
Is it on her skirt too?

596
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,320
Yes.

597
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,080
Okay, this one then.

598
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,040
Wait.

599
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,920
She is wearing a dark-colored skirt.

600
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,520
This is better.

601
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,840
Sure.

602
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,360
They're all the same. Let's go.

603
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,400
<i>It's so embarrassing.</i>

604
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,400
<i>He saw it.</i>

605
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,160
Hello, is Sang Zhi inside?

606
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,480
Yes.

607
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,120
Someone outside asked me
to give this to you.

608
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,760
Thank you.

609
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,440
It's fine.

610
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,680
This happens to all girls. Get changed.

611
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,840
Thank you, miss.

612
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,920
<i>How am I going to face him later?</i>

613
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,200
What's wrong?

614
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,040
It's embarrassing.

615
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,920
Who said so?

616
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,120
It's just embarrassing.

617
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,720
Let's go. Time to eat.

618
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,400
Come on.

619
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,920
Why are you angry? You're not a child.

620
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,480
Sang Yan.

621
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,720
Over here.

622
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,760
Why are you so late?

623
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,800
I was afraid to dig in
before you got here.

624
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,360
She went to play claw machines

625
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,360
and wouldn't come back.

626
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,440
You didn't win anything?

627
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,000
No. She even cried.

628
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,880
You even cried?

629
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,480
I'll help you after dinner.

630
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,720
It's not hard to get a prize.

631
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,000
Just use the claw and spin it around.

632
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,400
Forget it.

633
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,920
You'll get it when I show you later.

634
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,160
I'll order a few more dishes.

635
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,240
Sang Zhi, order something.

636
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,920
Tick a few dishes. It's my treat.

637
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,400
-Thank you.
-No problem.

638
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,240
What do you usually order?

639
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,360
What is nice here?

640
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,720
Order this.

641
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,200
Shrimp paste?

642
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,320
Forget it. I ordered it already.

643
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,360
-Do you want it or not?
-No, but it's auspicious.

644
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,000
Who eats sliced silkie chicken
for hot pot?

645
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,920
Order something expensive.

646
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,680
Eat chicken for hot pot

647
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,960
and also in video games.

648
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,720
CHAOSHAN BEEF BALLS

649
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,880
Know your own limits.

650
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,440
I don't need to remind you.

651
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,840
Eating one is fine.

652
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,240
If something happens,
I won't take care of you.

653
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,840
What's wrong with what she ordered?

654
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,800
I'm paying, not you.

655
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,920
Shut up.

656
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,440
She is allergic to beef and lamb.

657
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,440
Then let's not eat it

658
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,600
in case you get a reaction.

659
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,520
Give it to me.

660
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,680
Waiter.

661
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,080
Here. Help me place this order.

662
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,040
-Here.
-Thank you.

663
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,480
-Drink some warm water.
-Thank you.

664
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,200
Here.

665
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,560
Drink some beer.

666
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,840
I'm driving. I can't drink.

667
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,720
No one is drinking.

668
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,600
How can we have a hot pot without alcohol?

669
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,200
Don't you see this?

670
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,640
Iced tea with a hot pot
is the best combination. Understand?

671
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,880
Yes, sure.

672
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,720
I'm telling you.

673
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,960
I'm not drinking. I'm driving.

674
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,000
You've said it 100 times.

675
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,080
I'm sick of hearing it.

676
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,520
Fine. Just drink your tea.

677
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,680
Let me tell you something.

678
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,720
That day when you weren't in the dorm,

679
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,760
I played solo.

680
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,560
My stupid teammate was so useless.

681
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,840
Do you know how badly they played?

682
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,880
-I couldn't stand it.
-Wait.

683
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,280
-What were you doing?
-Let me eat first.

684
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,920
What?

685
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,440
The three of us were in a ranked match.

686
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,560
Then I got a call.

687
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,720
You even scolded me.

688
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,160
-The day we almost won?
-Yes, that day.

689
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,200
Excuse me.

690
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,520
Can you help me bring this
into the women's restroom?

691
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,920
There's a girl inside who might need this.

692
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,440
-Sure.
-Her name is Sang Zhi.

693
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,640
-Okay.
-Thank you.

694
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,680
-Thank you.
-No problem.

695
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,640
Wait for your sister here.

696
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,760
I'm going to find Qian Fei.

697
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,320
Nonsense.

698
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
Wait for her with me.

699
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,880
My sister is your sister.

700
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
Are you an idiot?

701
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,240
After what happened,

702
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,520
your sister will feel awkward

703
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,040
if she sees me when she comes out.

704
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,840
You're right.

705
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,320
You had better think of an excuse as well.

706
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,880
If Qian Fei asks,

707
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,520
she won't know what to say.

708
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,080
Just say she played with the claw machine

709
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,280
after using the restroom.

710
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,880
Sure.

711
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,560
Your gum.

712
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,000
Keep it for me.
