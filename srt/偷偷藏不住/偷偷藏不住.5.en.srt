ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

2
00:02:29,385 --> 00:02:30,865
Is the tutor not here yet?

3
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,825
Or

4
00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:35,585
is he already in Sang Yan's room?

5
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,585
He's not there.

6
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:53,025
Sang Yan, I want some instant noodles.

7
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:55,945
Add in two sausages and an egg!

8
00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:58,785
The tutor that Mom mentioned

9
00:02:58,865 --> 00:03:00,225
didn't come today, right?

10
00:03:00,985 --> 00:03:02,545
That means he's late.

11
00:03:03,105 --> 00:03:03,945
If that's the case,

12
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:05,785
his professional conduct is problematic.

13
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:08,225
You wouldn't be comfortable

14
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:10,065
with someone like that tutoring me, right?

15
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,545
So here's the deal.

16
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:13,265
Sang Yan.

17
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:16,065
How about you tell Mom

18
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:18,985
not to get me a tutor

19
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:21,785
during the New Year period?

20
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:24,185
Tutors are hard to find
during this time anyway.

21
00:03:24,265 --> 00:03:25,865
Let's talk about it after New Year.

22
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:27,545
Okay?

23
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,185
If you're willing to speak for me,

24
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:39,545
I'll give you 100 yuan this New Year.

25
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:45,665
How about 200 yuan then?

26
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:49,225
At most, five…

27
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:55,585
What are you yelling for in the morning?

28
00:03:58,705 --> 00:03:59,985
That's Duan Jiaxu.

29
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:01,985
Didn't Mom tell you?

30
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:02,985
He's your tutor.

31
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:08,665
Nonsense!

32
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:10,985
How could you wake up so late?

33
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:12,505
He has been waiting all morning!

34
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,025
Lower your voice!

35
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:15,065
Keep it down!

36
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:16,585
Don't make me hit you!

37
00:04:19,145 --> 00:04:20,064
Breakfast is ready.

38
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:22,705
Jiaxu.

39
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:25,385
There aren't enough eggs.

40
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,385
I'll add two more.

41
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:30,065
Sang Zhi.

42
00:04:30,945 --> 00:04:32,265
Didn't you want instant noodles?

43
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:35,105
Two sausages and one egg.

44
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,625
Eat up. The noodles will get lumpy soon.

45
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:42,745
Got it.

46
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:49,865
An egg and two ham sausages.

47
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,665
You were sleeping so soundly just now.

48
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:17,145
Your brother couldn't even wake you up.

49
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:20,505
I stayed up too late last night

50
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:21,465
working on homework.

51
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:23,145
Is that so?

52
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:24,905
I thought you pretended not to hear him.

53
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,865
No, I really didn't hear him.

54
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:30,185
Next time…

55
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:32,825
I'll set off firecrackers at your door!

56
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:35,665
Here.

57
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:39,065
Thank you, Jiaxu.

58
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:51,705
Is it tasty?

59
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:54,185
Yes.

60
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,785
Here.

61
00:05:56,865 --> 00:05:57,865
Have some more.

62
00:06:32,545 --> 00:06:35,185
Have you been secretly practicing at home?

63
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:36,625
Do I even need to do that?

64
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:38,785
SOCCER FIELD

65
00:06:48,985 --> 00:06:49,825
Sang Zhi.

66
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:02,305
Get out of the way!

67
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:05,505
Don't I have a tutoring session?

68
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,865
But we just finished breakfast!

69
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:09,625
Do your own reading first.

70
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:11,625
Am I the one getting tutored or are you?

71
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:14,505
Sang Zhi.

72
00:07:14,585 --> 00:07:15,665
Go and take a rest first.

73
00:07:15,745 --> 00:07:16,865
I'll come and tutor you

74
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:17,985
after this game, all right?

75
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:18,985
Sure.

76
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,185
Jiaxu, do you want some fruit?

77
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:28,145
No.

78
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,225
Just say so if you want some.

79
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:35,305
I'll cut it for you. Why all the hassle?

80
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:37,225
Don't be so mean to her all the time.

81
00:07:39,705 --> 00:07:40,705
How do we beat this level?

82
00:07:40,785 --> 00:07:41,665
Go to the left first.

83
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,545
Help me with this.

84
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:46,665
This is such a huge watermelon.

85
00:07:46,745 --> 00:07:49,065
You won't be able to cut it using this.

86
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:50,185
It will work.

87
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:53,145
You can't cut it with this.

88
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:54,585
I've only been playing for a while.

89
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:55,625
Now I have to serve you.

90
00:07:55,705 --> 00:07:56,545
I'm not cutting it!

91
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,145
-Sang Zhi.
-I won't do it!

92
00:07:58,225 --> 00:07:59,305
Take a look at this first.

93
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:01,545
I'll cut the watermelon after this game.

94
00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:06,105
I thought you'd question my credentials.

95
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,545
After accepting this resume,

96
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:09,825
you're not allowed to replace me, okay?

97
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:11,385
Don't worry.

98
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:13,545
No one is willing to tutor her except you.

99
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,785
She has no other option but you.

100
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,145
"Duan Jiaxu."

101
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:21,385
So this is how you spell it.

102
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:24,305
Why didn't he attach his photo?

103
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:25,385
That's wrong.

104
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:26,945
Do we go to the right first?

105
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:28,065
Jump!

106
00:08:28,905 --> 00:08:29,785
Awesome!

107
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:35,945
Okay, go up.

108
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:40,425
Isn't it upper right?

109
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:45,985
Should we go right or…

110
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,265
Lower right.

111
00:08:53,265 --> 00:08:54,425
That's not it either.

112
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:02,945
Try upper left. Try it.

113
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:04,985
Go up?

114
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:05,905
Upper left.

115
00:09:08,385 --> 00:09:09,225
We did it!

116
00:09:29,865 --> 00:09:30,945
What were you photographing?

117
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,545
Me?

118
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:36,465
Him?

119
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:38,425
Why would you take his photo?

120
00:09:39,785 --> 00:09:41,225
Is he as handsome as me?

121
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,305
Are you planning to show Mom and Dad

122
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:50,025
-that we're gaming?
-I…

123
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,505
I'm not.

124
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:58,785
I just have a classmate

125
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,665
who said my brother is very handsome.

126
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:02,145
I can't show her a photo of you.

127
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:04,465
-It would be humiliating for me.
-Hey!

128
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:06,025
I would prefer you rat us out!

129
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,025
Come back here!

130
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:09,345
Attention!

131
00:10:10,305 --> 00:10:11,745
At ease!

132
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:17,025
She's simply impossible.

133
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,025
Try to understand her.

134
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:20,905
Kids her age

135
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:22,345
naturally have some sense of pride.

136
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:25,545
That's nonsense!

137
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,745
It's all your fault!

138
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:29,105

I've cut the watermelon for you.

151
00:11:59,865 --> 00:12:01,025
Show me.

152
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:06,865
The photo you took just now.

153
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,705
What's wrong?

154
00:12:11,785 --> 00:12:13,705
I want to check if it's ugly or not.

155
00:12:13,785 --> 00:12:15,105
If so, you can snap a few more.

156
00:12:16,145 --> 00:12:17,305
Didn't you say

157
00:12:17,385 --> 00:12:20,185
that you want to show your classmate
a handsome brother?

158
00:12:20,265 --> 00:12:21,545
I can't make you look bad.

159
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:25,865
Don't we have a tutoring session?

160
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:26,905
Let's get on with it.

161
00:12:30,145 --> 00:12:32,425
I'm eager to learn today.

162
00:12:33,745 --> 00:12:35,545
And now you love learning?

163
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,865
Come, show me

164
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:42,985
your last physics final exam.

165
00:12:58,425 --> 00:12:59,945
Did you not pay attention in class?

166
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:01,585
How could you get this question wrong?

167
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:05,505
I did pay attention.

168
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:06,705
I just didn't understand it.

169
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:10,665
This question on conservation of energy
was a giveaway.

170
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:13,145
At first…

171
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,865
At first, I wanted to choose B.

172
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:18,265
That's right.

173
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,745
The correct answer is A.

174
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,585
Remember it.

175
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:31,225
Don't get problems
on conservation of energy wrong again.

176
00:13:32,785 --> 00:13:34,625
Maybe I didn't pay enough attention.

177
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:36,905
But even if I had paid full attention,

178
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:38,185
I wouldn't have understood it.

179
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:39,745
This is really difficult.

180
00:13:41,105 --> 00:13:42,665
Didn't I tell you last time

181
00:13:42,745 --> 00:13:43,825
to pay attention in class?

182
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:44,745
Have you forgotten?

183
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:47,345
That was such a long time ago.

184
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:48,665
Are you saying

185
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,345
that I need to remind you every day?

186
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:54,025
Can you?

187
00:13:57,825 --> 00:13:59,105
Give me your physics book.

188
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:03,905
I'll start off with Ampère's Law.

189
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:07,345
Do you know the Left-Hand Rule?

190
00:14:10,145 --> 00:14:11,025
Look.

191
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:14,185
Let's say
there is a uniform magnetic field.

192
00:14:14,265 --> 00:14:16,065
This is the direction of the current.

193
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:17,465
Now hold out your left hand.

194
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:49,185
Digest this first.

195
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:52,385
Work on this practice test.

196
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:53,345
I'll check it later.

197
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:58,585
I'll give you three lessons a week

198
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,265
during the winter break.

199
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,185
Is that too much for you?

200
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:08,825
No.

201
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:11,385
That's too little.

202
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:14,105
Can we have lessons every day?

203
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:16,905
I have my internship four days a week.

204
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:18,585
The remaining three days are all yours.

205
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:27,465
I thought you didn't want a tutor.

206
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:32,625
You're pretty good at teaching.

207
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:34,745
It's novel.

208
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,625
Of course.

209
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:41,225
You're unexpectedly eager to learn now.

210
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:42,225
Not bad.

211
00:15:45,705 --> 00:15:46,705
Focus!

212
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:49,985
Next time,

213
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:51,745
I can explain

214
00:15:52,505 --> 00:15:53,625
the Lorentz force to you.

215
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:58,105
By the way, Jiaxu.

216
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:01,265
Can I ask you a question?

217
00:16:01,345 --> 00:16:02,385
Go ahead.

218
00:16:05,345 --> 00:16:07,625
Why did you choose a university in Nanwu

219
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:09,145
instead of Yihe?

220
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:11,265
Isn't Yihe University also good?

221
00:16:13,745 --> 00:16:16,945
I didn't want to stay in Yihe.

222
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:19,465
Isn't it nice to explore other places?

223
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,105
Why did you choose Nanwu then?

224
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:26,825
How do I put this?

225
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,825
My dream

226
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,905
is to eventually work
in the gaming industry.

227
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:33,745
Nanwu is the city

228
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:35,865
with the biggest gaming industry.

229
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:37,025
That's why I came here.

230
00:16:39,385 --> 00:16:40,545
What are you thinking about?

231
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:43,345
Hurry up and do your work.

232
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:19,985
Sorry, I'm late.

233
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:24,424
So have you digested what I taught you

234
00:17:24,505 --> 00:17:25,545
in the last lesson?

235
00:17:27,704 --> 00:17:30,345
Jiaxu, did you not sleep?

236
00:17:31,665 --> 00:17:33,145
I was working late yesterday,

237
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:34,105
so I slept late.

238
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:36,385
Let's see.

239
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:41,705
Why don't I do my homework first?

240
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:43,985
You can check it after I'm done

241
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:45,585
and explain anything that is incorrect.

242
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,345
You have nothing to do
while I work on it anyway,

243
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,105
so you can go and rest for a while.

244
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:51,985
What do you mean?

245
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:53,145
Are you trying to slack off?

246
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:55,025
Or will you tell on me to your parents

247
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:56,345
so that they can replace me?

248
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:57,425
That's not it.

249
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,665
I was just kidding. How about this?

250
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:03,345
You can

251
00:18:05,425 --> 00:18:06,905
complete this set of problems.

252
00:18:09,265 --> 00:18:11,585
I'll go over it with you when you're done.

253
00:18:11,665 --> 00:18:12,625
Wake me up later.

254
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:14,585
I'm going to take a nap.

255
00:19:28,905 --> 00:19:29,745
Are you slacking off?

256
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:42,025
What were you up to?

257
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:45,025
Slacking off.

258
00:19:45,745 --> 00:19:46,825
Have you done the problems?

259
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:54,865
Show me

260
00:19:56,385 --> 00:19:58,785
the set of problems you worked on
over the weekend.

261
00:20:16,305 --> 00:20:17,705
This problem.

262
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,385
You got it wrong.

263
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:22,065
The electric charge is negative.

264
00:20:22,145 --> 00:20:23,345
So its direction of motion

265
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:25,145
is opposite to that of the current.

266
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:31,705
I guess I'm bad at tutoring.

267
00:20:31,785 --> 00:20:32,825
You're getting worse.

268
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:35,825
Jiaxu.

269
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,585
Be more confident.

270
00:20:38,665 --> 00:20:39,865
You've tutored me well.

271
00:20:39,945 --> 00:20:42,705
I just can't remember very well

272
00:20:42,785 --> 00:20:44,385
and I really don't understand it.

273
00:20:44,465 --> 00:20:46,505
I just don't find physics interesting,

274
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:48,945
so it's hard for me to remember things.

275
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:50,385
What do you find interesting then?

276
00:20:57,905 --> 00:20:59,825
In short, physics is boring.

277
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:15,105
I work so hard to tutor every day,

278
00:21:15,185 --> 00:21:16,345
but you have a leisurely time.

279
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,465
Yes, it's your tutoring session, not mine!

280
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:20,185
Let me play a few rounds.

281
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:22,865
My legs!

282
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:23,985
Go away!

283
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:25,065
Get off!

284
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:28,465
Come on. Let's play together.

285
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:29,945
Airdrops! Go that way.

286
00:21:31,265 --> 00:21:33,185
-I have something to tell you.
-What is it?

287
00:21:33,265 --> 00:21:34,585
Don't tell me you're quitting!

288
00:21:35,705 --> 00:21:37,065
Don't be ridiculous.

289
00:21:37,145 --> 00:21:38,585
I'm so good at tutoring.

290
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:41,705
I wanted to say
that I want to take the kiddo

291
00:21:41,785 --> 00:21:44,425
to the Science and Technology Museum
in the city when we're all free.

292
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:45,825
Why?

293
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,745
She currently has no interest in physics

294
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:48,785
and can't learn.

295
00:21:49,505 --> 00:21:51,785
So I thought
that maybe a visit to the museum

296
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:54,065
might be able to pique her interest.

297
00:21:54,785 --> 00:21:56,585
You're pretty responsible.

298
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:57,625
If I didn't know better,

299
00:21:57,705 --> 00:21:59,225
I would think you were her brother.

300
00:21:59,305 --> 00:22:00,945
Please also tell your parents for me.

301
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:03,065
No need.

302
00:22:03,145 --> 00:22:04,785
They're very busy at the end of the year.

303
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,425
As her backup brother, I can decide.

304
00:22:07,985 --> 00:22:09,385
When are we going?

305
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:10,665
I'll tell you when it's time.

306
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:13,425
-Hurry up! We're driving.
-There's nobody around. Don't worry.

307
00:22:21,865 --> 00:22:23,145
Have you been here before?

308
00:22:23,945 --> 00:22:25,145
No.

309
00:22:26,185 --> 00:22:27,505
This place is quite interesting.

310
00:22:27,585 --> 00:22:29,345
I used to love coming here.

311
00:22:32,505 --> 00:22:33,345
Only two tickets?

312
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:34,265
Are you not going in?

313
00:22:34,345 --> 00:22:37,025
Only brats would visit a science museum.

314
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,305
Of course I'm not interested.

315
00:22:38,385 --> 00:22:39,625
Who's the brat now?

316
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,185
That's enough.

317
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,145
I gave you money for three tickets.

318
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:47,505
Give me back my change.

319
00:22:48,265 --> 00:22:49,945
I'll use it on games at the cybercafe.

320
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:51,665
I'll pick you guys up later. Bye!

321
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,025
How pretentious!

322
00:22:56,105 --> 00:22:56,985
Let's go.

323
00:22:57,065 --> 00:22:58,265
I'll show you around inside.

324
00:23:08,105 --> 00:23:09,985
Don't you think this slide is interesting?

325
00:23:11,465 --> 00:23:13,425
There are a lot of physics concepts to it.

326
00:23:14,145 --> 00:23:17,025
The reason that this slide is curved

327
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,665
instead of being a straight line

328
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:21,385
is based on
the brachistochrone curve principle.

329
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:23,345
Therefore, although this slide looks high,

330
00:23:23,425 --> 00:23:24,425
when you slide down,

331
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:26,025
you'll go fast in the middle portion,

332
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:28,465
then slow down toward the end.

333
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:30,305
That also makes it safer.

334
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:32,545
Do you want to try it out?

335
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:34,465
Go and have some fun.

336
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:38,425
Let's go!

337
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:47,985
How was it?

338
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:49,025
Was it fun?

339
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:53,065
Wasn't the middle section
particularly exciting?

340
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:55,465
Yes, but it wasn't that fast.

341
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:57,465
That's the physics principle

342
00:23:57,545 --> 00:23:58,665
that I just told you about.

343
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:05,865
Here's a bonus geographical fact for you.

344
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:07,745
The tsunami.

345
00:24:07,825 --> 00:24:10,065
Did you know
that the definition of a tsunami

346
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:12,105
is a catastrophic wave,

347
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:14,665
usually caused
by an underwater earthquake?

348
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,825
It can reach a maximum wave speed

349
00:24:17,905 --> 00:24:19,425
of over 700 km per hour.

350
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:21,785
Also, look at the waves.

351
00:24:22,265 --> 00:24:24,865
They may be only 1 m high in the sea,

352
00:24:24,945 --> 00:24:26,265
but when they reach the shore,

353
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:27,665
they can be tens of meters high.

354
00:24:27,745 --> 00:24:29,105
Hence, it's a huge threat

355
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:30,385
to cities by the sea.

356
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:32,425
What?

357
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:33,425
Run!

358
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:38,025
Hurry up, Jiaxu!

359
00:24:38,105 --> 00:24:39,825
The tsunami is going to drown us!

360
00:24:39,905 --> 00:24:40,905
How is that possible?

361
00:24:40,985 --> 00:24:42,665
We've outrun the tsunami.

362
00:24:46,225 --> 00:24:47,185
Come and try this out.

363
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:50,505
Put both your hands

364
00:24:50,585 --> 00:24:52,345
on top of this flowerpot.

365
00:24:55,505 --> 00:24:56,385
Look at the screen.

366
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:04,465
This is incredible!

367
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,305
This is thermoelectric sensing technology.

368
00:25:06,985 --> 00:25:09,145
When the flowerpot senses
your palm's temperature,

369
00:25:09,225 --> 00:25:11,105
its thermoelectric sensor

370
00:25:11,185 --> 00:25:13,065
will convert the change in temperature

371
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,785
into a change in power,

372
00:25:14,865 --> 00:25:16,705
which triggers this animation.

373
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:18,825
-Look.
-That's so cool.

374
00:25:18,905 --> 00:25:20,785
The blooming flowers
are attracting butterflies.

375
00:25:20,865 --> 00:25:22,465
It's actually related to physics as well.

376
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:24,545
How amazing!

377
00:25:30,225 --> 00:25:32,145
Here's my suggestion, Sang Zhi.

378
00:25:32,785 --> 00:25:33,625
I know

379
00:25:33,705 --> 00:25:36,225
you may have your personal preferences,

380
00:25:36,305 --> 00:25:38,505
but try not to get sidetracked

381
00:25:38,585 --> 00:25:39,865
and study hard.

382
00:25:40,425 --> 00:25:41,905
It's because your future dreams

383
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:43,625
and the things
you want to do in the future

384
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:46,185
will probably need to be achieved
through studying.

385
00:25:50,745 --> 00:25:51,905
Jiaxu.

386
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:53,945
I think you were probably very rebellious

387
00:25:54,025 --> 00:25:55,185
when you were my age.

388
00:25:55,265 --> 00:25:56,305
Why?

389
00:25:56,385 --> 00:25:57,505
Because you play video games.

390
00:25:57,585 --> 00:25:59,625
Does that make me rebellious?

391
00:25:59,705 --> 00:26:01,505
My teacher said
that we can't play video games.

392
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,425
When I was your age,

393
00:26:05,505 --> 00:26:08,425
I would be overjoyed
if I could play video games

394
00:26:08,505 --> 00:26:09,785
for just one hour a week.

395
00:26:11,785 --> 00:26:13,025
Those were the moments

396
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:16,865
when I could escape

397
00:26:16,945 --> 00:26:18,625
from the negative realities of my life

398
00:26:18,705 --> 00:26:19,905
by playing video games

399
00:26:19,985 --> 00:26:20,985
and get a break.

400
00:26:30,985 --> 00:26:31,945
Well,

401
00:26:33,265 --> 00:26:34,785
I guess games

402
00:26:36,385 --> 00:26:37,705
aren't that bad.

403
00:26:39,825 --> 00:26:41,705
So,

404
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:44,185
you think video games can bring you

405
00:26:44,265 --> 00:26:46,265
joy and comfort, right?

406
00:26:46,345 --> 00:26:47,225
That's right.

407
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:50,545
Don't you find it very relaxing
to play video games?

408
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:53,385
So at that time,

409
00:26:53,465 --> 00:26:56,665
I dreamed of creating my own video game

410
00:26:56,745 --> 00:26:59,465
and spreading joy to more people.

411
00:27:08,865 --> 00:27:10,225
I'll study hard

412
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:14,225
and find my own dream.

413
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:17,625
But you have to work hard too, Jiaxu.

414
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:19,785
Because I think

415
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:24,665
you'll be able to achieve your dream soon.

416
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:27,865
Do you have such faith in me?

417
00:27:29,585 --> 00:27:31,985
Let's work hard together then.

418
00:27:32,065 --> 00:27:33,225
We can do it.

419
00:27:34,745 --> 00:27:35,665
Okay!

420
00:28:02,345 --> 00:28:03,225
Have some water.

421
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:13,385
I noticed you like to draw.

422
00:28:15,265 --> 00:28:17,785
Drawing is a hobby that you can keep up.

423
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:20,785
It takes imagination to draw.

424
00:28:21,505 --> 00:28:22,345
Besides,

425
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:25,305
I've always felt
that people who like to draw

426
00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:27,345
are full of kindness to the world.

427
00:28:27,425 --> 00:28:30,225
They can record
what they find beautiful in this world

428
00:28:30,305 --> 00:28:31,665
through their paintbrush.

429
00:28:31,745 --> 00:28:32,625
Jiaxu.

430
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:36,465
Can you not

431
00:28:38,545 --> 00:28:39,705
be in a relationship?

432
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:48,225
What do you mean?

433
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,945
Don't you have a dream too?

434
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:54,185
If you get into a relationship,

435
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,345
you'll delay your dream.

436
00:28:58,185 --> 00:29:00,025
I'm almost done with university.

437
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,825
Do I still need to avoid dating

438
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:03,225
for the sake of my studies?

439
00:29:03,905 --> 00:29:05,665
Why don't you say this to your brother?

440
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:06,585
I…

441
00:29:09,985 --> 00:29:11,345
I did.

442
00:29:11,425 --> 00:29:12,545
What did he say?

443
00:29:13,265 --> 00:29:14,985
He said, "Go away, little demon!"

444
00:29:17,265 --> 00:29:18,625
I'm saying this

445
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:20,505
because my classmate's brother

446
00:29:20,585 --> 00:29:21,945
had a girlfriend.

447
00:29:22,865 --> 00:29:25,545
But that girl treated
my classmate really badly.

448
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:27,225
How so?

449
00:29:27,745 --> 00:29:28,705
I don't know.

450
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:30,825
She treated your classmate badly?

451
00:29:32,265 --> 00:29:33,505
Moreover,

452
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:35,465
if you have a girlfriend,

453
00:29:36,745 --> 00:29:38,945
you won't be able to be so nice to me.

454
00:29:41,025 --> 00:29:42,665
Now you realize that I'm nice to you.

455
00:29:44,585 --> 00:29:46,545
Why are you thinking that far ahead?

456
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:48,425
If you don't see me for a couple of years,

457
00:29:48,505 --> 00:29:49,905
you might forget all about me.

458
00:29:53,945 --> 00:29:54,785
How about this then?

459
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:56,865
In the future,

460
00:29:56,945 --> 00:29:59,025
I'll find a gentle girlfriend

461
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:00,585
who treats you well.

462
00:30:01,225 --> 00:30:02,785
This way, you will have

463
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:04,785
one more person who is good to you.

464
00:30:04,865 --> 00:30:05,705
All right?

465
00:30:16,425 --> 00:30:17,345
Fine.

466
00:30:19,145 --> 00:30:21,025
When you find one,

467
00:30:23,105 --> 00:30:25,905
can you show her to me first?

468
00:30:27,105 --> 00:30:28,345
Sure.

469
00:30:28,425 --> 00:30:30,545
I'll show you when I find one.

470
00:30:33,585 --> 00:30:34,425
I'll remember that.

471
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:46,505
Is there anything else you want to see?

472
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:48,305
Your brother is here.

473
00:30:48,385 --> 00:30:50,145
Let's call it a day if you're tired.

474
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:52,065
Let's go.

475
00:30:55,745 --> 00:30:56,705
Sang Yan!

476
00:30:58,105 --> 00:31:00,105
-Hey.
-What's wrong with you?

477
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:02,745
How was it?

478
00:31:03,265 --> 00:31:04,705
Did you find the motivation to study?

479
00:31:07,905 --> 00:31:09,025
Yes.

480
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:10,545
Well?

481
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:13,185
We went on a slide

482
00:31:13,265 --> 00:31:14,785
and we went down like this.

483
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:16,545
-Weren't you there to learn?
-Hello, Li Xun?

484
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,305
-It also lit up.
-I've modified that.

485
00:31:18,385 --> 00:31:20,505
-I sent it to you this morning.
-And there was water.

486
00:31:20,585 --> 00:31:22,945
-A water screen.
-Does it need more revisions?

487
00:31:23,025 --> 00:31:25,625
-Were you just playing around?
-Okay, I have my laptop with me.

488
00:31:25,705 --> 00:31:27,905
I'll find a place to do the revisions
and send it to you.

489
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:29,705
-Okay, bye.
-I'm only telling you what I saw.

490
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:33,265
Take your sister home first.

491
00:31:33,345 --> 00:31:35,065
I'm going to do some work over there.

492
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:36,505
Okay.

493
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:39,105
Remember what I told you today.

494
00:31:40,505 --> 00:31:42,025
-Go home.
-Do you need a ride?

495
00:31:42,105 --> 00:31:42,985
No, thank you.

496
00:31:49,305 --> 00:31:50,785
Here, put on your ugly hat.

497
00:31:54,465 --> 00:31:55,305
Where's the strap?

498
00:31:56,585 --> 00:31:57,865
Go away!

499
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:04,305
Stupid little demon, I'm so nice to you

500
00:32:04,385 --> 00:32:05,705
and you didn't even wait for me.

501
00:32:15,425 --> 00:32:16,625
Sang Yan!

502
00:32:18,785 --> 00:32:20,225
My sketchbook is missing.

503
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,025
It's that book that I usually draw in.

504
00:32:22,585 --> 00:32:24,385
There was nothing in the car just now.

505
00:32:24,465 --> 00:32:26,585
Are you sure? Take me there and show me.

506
00:32:26,665 --> 00:32:27,505
Let's go!

507
00:32:27,585 --> 00:32:28,945
There's really nothing there.

508
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:30,505
I've told you.

509
00:32:30,585 --> 00:32:32,345
Just buy another one if you've lost it.

510
00:32:33,545 --> 00:32:35,305
Are you sure you've checked everywhere?

511
00:32:35,385 --> 00:32:36,545
Yes!

512
00:32:40,465 --> 00:32:42,105
From the Science and Technology Museum

513
00:32:43,385 --> 00:32:44,545
to here.

514
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:45,545
The car.

515
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:47,185
My room.

516
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,705
The museum.

517
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,825
Hello.

518
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:17,265
I visited
the Science and Technology Museum today

519
00:33:17,345 --> 00:33:19,665
and accidentally left my sketchbook there.

520
00:33:19,745 --> 00:33:21,185
It's a green sketchbook.

521
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,705
Did you pick it up?

522
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:23,905
Yes.

523
00:33:27,585 --> 00:33:30,145
We passed it to the boy who was with you.

524
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:31,425
Did he not give it to you?

525
00:33:36,865 --> 00:33:39,345
PURE MILK

526
00:33:39,425 --> 00:33:41,585
SLEEPY

527
00:33:49,705 --> 00:33:52,945
What should I do if Jiaxu sees it?

528
00:34:06,105 --> 00:34:08,025
Little demon, I have your sketchbook.

529
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:11,385
-I'm tossing it if you don't want it.
-Give it to me!

530
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:14,985
Duan Jiaxu dropped it off

531
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:16,105
on his way to work.

532
00:34:17,465 --> 00:34:18,425
Did he look inside?

533
00:34:19,105 --> 00:34:20,824
How would I know?

534
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:22,344
Why didn't you ask him?

535
00:34:23,705 --> 00:34:25,784
Is there anything shady in there?

536
00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:26,905
No.

537
00:34:26,985 --> 00:34:29,225
Fine. I'm going back to sleep.

538
00:34:45,945 --> 00:34:48,105
He could've just called me.

539
00:34:48,945 --> 00:34:50,985
Why did he ask Sang Yan to pass it to me?

540
00:34:52,304 --> 00:34:55,985
Doesn't that mean he has looked inside

541
00:34:56,985 --> 00:34:58,265
and felt awkward?

542
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:00,665
That's why
he didn't give it to me himself!

543
00:35:07,545 --> 00:35:11,665
Then what if…

544
00:35:28,825 --> 00:35:29,905
Why are you back?

545
00:35:31,705 --> 00:35:33,825
I can't stand it at home.

546
00:35:34,585 --> 00:35:36,305
Did you come back to keep me company?

547
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:38,025
By the way, Jiaxu, listen.

548
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:39,705
Don't come on Tuesday.

549
00:35:39,785 --> 00:35:40,785
Come on Thursday instead.

550
00:35:40,865 --> 00:35:41,745
Why?

551
00:35:41,825 --> 00:35:43,145
The little demon has puppy love.

552
00:35:43,705 --> 00:35:45,985
I gave her an earful
and confiscated her phone and laptop.

553
00:35:46,065 --> 00:35:47,585
She won't be in the mood to study,

554
00:35:47,665 --> 00:35:48,505
so forget it.

555
00:35:48,585 --> 00:35:49,505
Puppy love?

556
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:52,545
Is it with that classmate of hers?

557
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:55,425
No, it's online dating!
Can you believe it?

558
00:35:55,505 --> 00:35:57,105
What?

559
00:35:57,185 --> 00:35:58,985
That's right. She told me herself.

560
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:01,305
All right, I'll come next week then.

561
00:36:04,345 --> 00:36:06,185
It's normal for her to experience this

562
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:07,265
at her age.

563
00:36:07,825 --> 00:36:09,265
Anyway, just talk some sense into her

564
00:36:09,345 --> 00:36:10,985
and make sure she knows the limits.

565
00:36:11,065 --> 00:36:12,585
I'm sure she will get it.

566
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:14,305
Guess what?

567
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:15,825
I don't care about other people.

568
00:36:16,505 --> 00:36:18,465
But it's not allowed for my sister!

569
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:20,265
They must break up

570
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,105
or I'll beat that guy up!

571
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:05,425
He should alreadyknow

572
00:37:05,505 --> 00:37:08,345
about the online dating story
that I made up.

573
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:11,345
How should I face him

574
00:37:11,945 --> 00:37:13,985
during our lesson later?

575
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:16,465
He will no longer think

576
00:37:16,545 --> 00:37:18,465
that I drew him, right?

577
00:37:18,545 --> 00:37:21,825
How should a heartbroken person look like?

578
00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:24,785
Should I act sad,

579
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:26,265
upset, and miserable?

580
00:37:29,425 --> 00:37:31,105
Will he not believe it?

581
00:37:31,865 --> 00:37:33,145
-Or should I--
-Little demon!

582
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:35,385
Little demon!

583
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,745
Little demon.

584
00:37:50,305 --> 00:37:51,225
How have you been

585
00:37:52,185 --> 00:37:53,505
these past few days?

586
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:04,465
I'll take you for a ride

587
00:38:04,545 --> 00:38:05,745
when you finish your lesson.

588
00:38:10,585 --> 00:38:12,225
I won't tell Mom and Dad.

589
00:38:12,305 --> 00:38:13,665
I don't want to be scolded either.

590
00:38:39,105 --> 00:38:40,225
I heard from your brother

591
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,465
that you're dating online.

592
00:38:45,505 --> 00:38:46,705
How did you meet him?

593
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:47,745
Tell me.

594
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:52,505
You don't have to be so nosy.

595
00:38:52,985 --> 00:38:54,745
What's wrong with caring about you?

596
00:38:56,825 --> 00:38:58,505
You asked me not to date,

597
00:38:58,585 --> 00:38:59,945
but you did it yourself.

598
00:39:01,345 --> 00:39:02,985
From what he said,

599
00:39:03,065 --> 00:39:05,425
he likely believes that the one I like

600
00:39:05,505 --> 00:39:07,785
is the non-existent online friend.

601
00:39:07,865 --> 00:39:09,625
So was it your young boyfriend

602
00:39:09,705 --> 00:39:10,945
who asked you to meet him?

603
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:20,665
How old is he?

604
00:39:23,425 --> 00:39:24,985
He's graduating from university soon.

605
00:39:28,865 --> 00:39:29,985
How old did you say he was?

606
00:39:32,265 --> 00:39:33,305
Twenty-something.

607
00:39:39,465 --> 00:39:40,865
Where did he tell you to meet him?

608
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:44,185
In Yihe.

609
00:39:52,305 --> 00:39:53,505
Sang Zhi.

610
00:39:54,065 --> 00:39:55,065
Tell me.

611
00:39:56,425 --> 00:39:57,465
Does your old boyfriend

612
00:39:58,065 --> 00:39:59,545
know how old you are?

613
00:40:12,865 --> 00:40:14,105
What's his phone number?

614
00:40:17,985 --> 00:40:19,305
Are you covering up for him?

615
00:40:24,265 --> 00:40:25,385
Sang Zhi.

616
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:27,625
I don't want to lose my temper with you,

617
00:40:28,145 --> 00:40:29,345
but you need to know that

618
00:40:29,425 --> 00:40:31,265
your family has
your best interests at heart.

619
00:40:31,945 --> 00:40:33,145
They won't let you date online

620
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:35,305
because they believe it will harm you.

621
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:37,105
You can't be in a relationship

622
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,345
until you graduate from high school
and become an adult.

623
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,105
Once you're in college,

624
00:40:42,185 --> 00:40:43,385
you can do whatever you want.

625
00:40:43,465 --> 00:40:44,865
No one will stop you.

626
00:40:45,705 --> 00:40:46,585
Do you hear me?

627
00:40:53,545 --> 00:40:55,385
But I can't resist the temptation.

628
00:42:44,265 --> 00:42:47,105
SLEEPY
