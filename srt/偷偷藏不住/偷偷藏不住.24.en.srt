00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:45,105
ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

2
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:51,985
I am telling you

3
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,345
the secret I wanted to seal away forever.

4
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,705
Can you…

5
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:03,825
Can you believe

6
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:05,425
that you are a great person?

7
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:10,024
Seeing how much

8
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:12,345
I like you,

9
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:16,905
can you ignore what people say about you?

10
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:22,745
Can you be with me forever?

11
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:30,265
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
AND HELP HIM PAY OFF HIS DEBTS

12
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:35,025
Please?

13
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,665
How do you fold this star?

14
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:45,105
I can't fold it back after unfolding it.

15
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:47,465
After unfolding it, I…

16
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,745
These stars

17
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,025
will be in my safekeeping.

18
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:30,065
What should I do now?

19
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:32,145
Counting it now,

20
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:34,105
I've made you cry so many times.

21
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,905
Yet you deny that you're a crybaby.

22
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,465
Give me a hug.

23
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:01,385
All right.

24
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,745
I know it all now.

25
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:15,305
Why did you suddenly tell me this?

26
00:04:16,944 --> 00:04:18,384
I just wanted you to know.

27
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,064
But this time,

28
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:22,385
I don't have that rumored girlfriend

29
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:23,585
that your brother mentioned.

30
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,385
I have an official girlfriend now.

31
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,025
So did you come back to Yihe

32
00:04:35,145 --> 00:04:36,305
just to tell me this?

33
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,305
It's because you said

34
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:41,705
you were considering something.

35
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:44,025
That's why…

36
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,825
I was afraid that if I called you,
you would…

37
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:54,625
I thought that
if I talked to you in person,

38
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:58,665
it should be hard for you to bring it up.

39
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:00,665
Bring what up?

40
00:05:07,185 --> 00:05:08,385
What were you thinking?

41
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:17,065
If your parents hadn't disapproved,

42
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:19,265
I would snatch you
to get our marriage certificate now.

43
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:23,025
I'm serious.

44
00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:25,465
Why would you have to snatch me?

45
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:28,185
I'm afraid you will run away.

46
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:32,425
When I said I was considering something,

47
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:35,105
it was whether I should stay with you
in Yihe for two years

48
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:37,265
and go back with you after you graduate

49
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:38,905
or if I should go to Nanwu first

50
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:39,985
to get everything settled

51
00:05:40,065 --> 00:05:41,105
and wait for you to return.

52
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:43,385
What were you thinking?

53
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:47,825
Is that it?

54
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:55,945
Actually,

55
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:58,785
I could stay in Yihe too.

56
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:01,145
We can talk about it.

57
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:03,905
You don't always have to give in to me.

58
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,265
I really don't want to stay here.

59
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:08,985
Besides, who else would I give in to?

60
00:06:11,865 --> 00:06:12,985
Young lady,

61
00:06:13,065 --> 00:06:15,345
what you need to do is simple.

62
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:17,385
Stay here and study hard.

63
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:18,745
Don't worry about anything else.

64
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,105
The most important thing

65
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:23,505
is to spend more time with your boyfriend.

66
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:24,865
Understand?

67
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:31,425
As for your parents,

68
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,105
don't worry about it.

69
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:37,505
I'll find time to talk to them.

70
00:06:42,545 --> 00:06:43,385
Smile.

71
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:50,265
Give me a smile.

72
00:07:11,905 --> 00:07:14,505
CHAPTER 24, SET OFF

73
00:07:14,585 --> 00:07:16,665
SO NEAR AND YET SO FAR

74
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:36,625
There is someone

75
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:37,985
that I really like.

76
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:39,585
But

77
00:07:40,705 --> 00:07:42,345
he just doesn't like me.

78
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,385
But I will grow up.

79
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:48,545
Then let's wait until you grow up.

80
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,545
But when I grow up,

81
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,265
he'll fall for someone else.

82
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:55,185
That's fine.

83
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:57,865
Sang Zhi, when you grow up,

84
00:07:58,665 --> 00:08:00,505
you will meet someone better.

85
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:35,425
Why have you been drinking?

86
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:40,425
What's wrong?

87
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,225
I'll bring you some hot water.

88
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:52,545
Why did you get up?

89
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:00,945
Are you in a bad mood?

90
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:03,905
I think

91
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:09,465
that I've treated you badly.

92
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:18,625
When did you treat me badly?

93
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:31,465
Is it because of what I said to you

94
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:32,945
at the airport today?

95
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:36,665
I told you that

96
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:38,465
because I just wanted you to know.

97
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,905
You didn't know it before.

98
00:09:40,985 --> 00:09:42,545
That's why I wanted to tell you.

99
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:44,425
But I didn't want you to feel…

100
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,265
You treat me very well.

101
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:55,945
Be it in the past or the present,

102
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,265
you treat me well.

103
00:09:59,785 --> 00:10:00,625
It's true.

104
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:01,585
Sang Zhi.

105
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,545
I love you.

106
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:17,625
I'm sorry, Zhizhi.

107
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:21,665
I said these words so late.

108
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:29,745
Over the years,

109
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,065
I know

110
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,545
I've made you sad.

111
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:42,225
It was your unwavering dedication

112
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,185
that made me realize I'm not good enough.

113
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:50,545
Whether it's my imperceptiveness

114
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,505
or indecisiveness,

115
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:56,345
I haven't been good enough.

116
00:11:01,905 --> 00:11:03,305
But for these shortcomings,

117
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:06,945
I'll try my best to make it up to you

118
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:08,305
every day that we are together.

119
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:11,305
Zhizhi.

120
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:17,705
I won't let you regret

121
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:19,745
the choice you made.

122
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:26,025
I love you, Sang Zhi.

123
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:48,225
Sangsang, what are you drawing?

124
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:51,265
I found my theme for the competition.

125
00:12:52,745 --> 00:12:53,745
What did I tell you?

126
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:55,025
You can't force ideas to come.

127
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:56,265
You need to clear your mind

128
00:12:56,345 --> 00:12:57,665
for inspiration to come.

129
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:00,025
So what is your theme?

130
00:13:03,905 --> 00:13:04,985
Why are you being secretive?

131
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:17,345
Come in.

132
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:21,305
Siyun.

133
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,305
Perfect timing. Come here quickly.

134
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,545
Help me take a look.

135
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:26,105
I have trouble deciding.

136
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:27,585
Which one of these two is better?

137
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:29,945
I think

138
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,465
this one is the best.

139
00:13:32,665 --> 00:13:34,265
-What is this?
-Open it.

140
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:37,185
You've been working late nights lately,

141
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:38,385
so I bought you a gift.

142
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:41,865
Restorative honey?

143
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:42,945
Xiaoduan recommended it.

144
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:46,785
He sure knows what to pick.

145
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:48,385
This kid knows a lot of things.

146
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:49,505
It smells quite nice.

147
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:52,705
Come in.

148
00:13:56,465 --> 00:13:58,225
Actually, I wanted to talk

149
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,225
to both of you about something today.

150
00:14:00,905 --> 00:14:02,105
What is it?

151
00:14:02,185 --> 00:14:03,265
I was thinking

152
00:14:03,345 --> 00:14:04,905
that after completing the upgrade

153
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:06,465
of the Celestial Progression System,

154
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:08,945
I might have to resign.

155
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:12,265
Resign?

156
00:14:12,345 --> 00:14:14,025
Why do you suddenly want to resign?

157
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,385
Is another company trying to poach you?

158
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,545
No.

159
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,745
I'm thinking of going back to Nanwu

160
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:23,105
to start my own business.

161
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:24,505
Nanwu?

162
00:14:25,705 --> 00:14:26,785
Is it for Sang Zhi?

163
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:29,905
If I'm not mistaken,

164
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:31,465
isn't she only a college sophomore?

165
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:33,425
When she graduates in two years,

166
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,585
you can still go back there with her.

167
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,145
The Dream Games studio

168
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:41,585
has a very promising next few years.

169
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:44,025
Are you sure about leaving now?

170
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:48,105
I have carefully considered it

171
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:49,465
before telling you.

172
00:14:51,785 --> 00:14:53,745
Some things have happened recently.

173
00:14:54,345 --> 00:14:55,385
It made me realize

174
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:57,265
I may not have been good enough

175
00:14:57,345 --> 00:14:58,745
to Sang Zhi.

176
00:14:58,825 --> 00:15:00,385
I haven't done enough for her either.

177
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:02,025
No, Jiaxu, you're worrying too much.

178
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:04,385
Siyun and I both think
that you treat her really well.

179
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:08,705
Actually, the main reason

180
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,865
is that her parents

181
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:12,625
may have some concerns about me.

182
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:18,385
Sang Zhi is also upset

183
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:19,945
because of this.

184
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:22,585
However,

185
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:24,585
she turned around and comforted me.

186
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,065
She was worried

187
00:15:27,145 --> 00:15:28,665
that this might hurt my self-esteem.

188
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:30,185
In truth, I understand

189
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:31,705
her parents' concerns.

190
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,745
But I'm older than her.

191
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:36,945
So I should be the one

192
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:38,465
resolving these concerns.

193
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:40,825
I just want to go

194
00:15:40,905 --> 00:15:42,545
to Nanwu as soon as possible.

195
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,625
After I've settled everything,

196
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:47,105
I'll give myself more time

197
00:15:47,185 --> 00:15:48,865
and chances to prove myself.

198
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:53,905
He's all grown up now.

199
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:56,265
A man should have
a sense of responsibility.

200
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:04,465
Since you've already made up your mind,

201
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:06,985
Li Xun and I can't stop you.

202
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:09,225
We wish you all the best.

203
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,425
Thank you.

204
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,345
However,

205
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:17,065
today's economy isn't easy

206
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:18,145
for young entrepreneurs.

207
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:20,465
Given your qualifications,

208
00:16:20,545 --> 00:16:22,305
there aren't many
reputable companies in Nanwu

209
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:23,265
that can hire you.

210
00:16:23,345 --> 00:16:24,425
How about this?

211
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:26,865
You can apply to our headquarters

212
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,745
to open your own studio.

213
00:16:29,385 --> 00:16:31,625
They can provide some technical support

214
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:33,025
and follow-up expansion,

215
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:34,985
which would be relatively easier for you.

216
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:36,025
Look at that.

217
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:37,705
Siyun thinks of everything.

218
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:39,265
Our company does have this policy.

219
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:41,225
If you need it,
Siyun and I will put in a word.

220
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:44,705
It would be great if that could happen.

221
00:16:45,225 --> 00:16:46,225
Thank you, Li Xun.

222
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:48,145
Thank you, Siyun.

223
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:49,185
You're welcome.

224
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:53,145
If you create a successful game
in the future,

225
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:54,465
I'll get to boast about it.

226
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:56,185
I can say that I mentored this guy.

227
00:16:58,105 --> 00:17:00,225
You were still an intern

228
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:01,905
when you first came.

229
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:02,825
Look at you now.

230
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:04,825
So many years have passed.

231
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,145
Now that you're leaving,

232
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:08,665
I'm actually quite reluctant.

233
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:12,345
You can do it.

234
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:14,345
-Good luck.
-LI Xun and I support you.

235
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:15,665
-You can do it.
-I'll do my best.

236
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:35,425
Hello?

237
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:38,345
The patient's condition isn't optimistic.

238
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,345
Cherish the time and talk to him.

239
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:42,025
Thank you, doctor.

240
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:31,985
It has been a long time
since I thought about the past.

241
00:18:34,385 --> 00:18:35,345
I didn't want to

242
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:37,985
and I didn't dare to.

243
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:42,385
But I think

244
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,385
today should be the day that I face it.

245
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:49,025
I should get some closure.

246
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:54,145
It happened such a long time ago.

247
00:18:55,745 --> 00:18:57,065
Now that I think about it,

248
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:01,305
you would have been released by now

249
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:05,025
if you hadn't jumped.

250
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:10,585
There are many things

251
00:19:12,145 --> 00:19:13,665
that I've never told you.

252
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:19,225
I've finished paying off

253
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:22,465
the compensation you owed

254
00:19:23,505 --> 00:19:24,785
and those debts of yours.

255
00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:28,305
My mom

256
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:33,465
passed away several years ago.

257
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,385
Because of you.

258
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:43,585
Because we didn't have money.

259
00:19:52,945 --> 00:19:54,305
At that time,

260
00:19:55,505 --> 00:19:57,625
she knew she was sick

261
00:19:57,705 --> 00:19:58,705
from cancer.

262
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:02,145
She refused to get treatment

263
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:03,745
because she didn't want to spend money.

264
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:09,545
When she finally went to the hospital,

265
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:13,025
the doctor said
it was too late for treatment.

266
00:20:25,505 --> 00:20:28,225
I used to wish so badly
that you could see it all.

267
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,625
I wished you would wake up,

268
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:35,945
so you could see everything
that happened to us.

269
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:40,585
I wanted to see you feel guilt and pain.

270
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,745
I just wanted you to understand.

271
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:51,145
If you hadn't

272
00:20:52,465 --> 00:20:53,705
run away

273
00:20:54,265 --> 00:20:56,025
and had chosen to face punishment,

274
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:59,985
our lives would have been so different.

275
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:16,185
But actually,

276
00:21:18,265 --> 00:21:19,505
I should thank you too.

277
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:23,065
Because of you,

278
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:25,665
I never dared to drink.

279
00:21:27,705 --> 00:21:28,945
It was also because of you

280
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,305
that I learned what responsibility

281
00:21:31,385 --> 00:21:32,745
and taking on responsibility means.

282
00:21:35,185 --> 00:21:36,265
Now,

283
00:21:40,985 --> 00:21:42,585
I can say

284
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:44,145
that I'm a decent person.

285
00:21:47,985 --> 00:21:49,585
At least I now have the ability

286
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:53,025
to protect the people I love.

287
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:56,745
I really wish you could see it.

288
00:22:05,945 --> 00:22:06,865
All right then.

289
00:22:09,905 --> 00:22:11,265
If you see Mom

290
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:14,625
on the other side,

291
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:19,745
sincerely apologize to her.

292
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:31,585
Be at peace,

293
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:36,305
Dad.

294
00:23:54,025 --> 00:23:54,985
Why are you here?

295
00:24:00,345 --> 00:24:01,585
What's with this expression?

296
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:03,905
I knew

297
00:24:04,425 --> 00:24:05,945
this day would come eventually.

298
00:24:46,225 --> 00:24:47,545
I know.

299
00:24:48,825 --> 00:24:50,705
I know you're very sad.

300
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:52,945
I know that.

301
00:24:56,385 --> 00:24:57,465
Okay, it's all right.

302
00:25:01,945 --> 00:25:03,945
Am I really getting old now?

303
00:25:09,545 --> 00:25:12,145
Why are my parents no longer here?

304
00:25:43,785 --> 00:25:47,305
GRACE UPON DESCENDANTS

305
00:25:47,385 --> 00:25:50,505
IN MEMORY OF BELOVED MOTHER,
XU RUOSHU

306
00:26:00,585 --> 00:26:02,785
Mom, you haven't met her yet.

307
00:26:05,025 --> 00:26:06,265
This is Sang Zhi.

308
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:10,065
I've told you about her before.

309
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:12,385
Now,

310
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,545
she is my girlfriend.

311
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:21,825
Mom.

312
00:26:22,425 --> 00:26:24,385
I might settle down in Nanwu later.

313
00:26:25,425 --> 00:26:26,505
But don't worry.

314
00:26:27,505 --> 00:26:29,865
I'll come and visit you every year.

315
00:26:31,345 --> 00:26:33,385
I came today mainly to tell you

316
00:26:34,585 --> 00:26:35,745
that Dad has also passed away.

317
00:26:37,745 --> 00:26:38,705
He passed away

318
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:41,665
quite peacefully.

319
00:26:43,865 --> 00:26:45,225
Don't worry.

320
00:26:45,305 --> 00:26:46,785
I fulfilled his wish

321
00:26:46,865 --> 00:26:49,145
and found a serene place for him.

322
00:26:49,225 --> 00:26:50,145
I wonder

323
00:26:50,825 --> 00:26:52,785
if you two will meet over there.

324
00:26:54,745 --> 00:26:55,985
If you do…

325
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:15,665
Never mind.

326
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:19,025
As long as both of you
are happy and content.

327
00:27:51,865 --> 00:27:52,825
Hello, Mrs. Duan.

328
00:27:54,545 --> 00:27:55,825
I'm Sang Zhi.

329
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:00,585
You don't have to worry.

330
00:28:01,785 --> 00:28:03,865
Duan Jiaxu is now

331
00:28:03,945 --> 00:28:06,465
a very kind and outstanding person.

332
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:11,465
He treats people well

333
00:28:11,545 --> 00:28:12,705
and is very sincere.

334
00:28:13,185 --> 00:28:14,825
He excelled in his studies

335
00:28:14,905 --> 00:28:16,465
and performs well at work.

336
00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:18,385
To me,

337
00:28:19,545 --> 00:28:20,625
my parents,

338
00:28:21,185 --> 00:28:22,425
and everyone,

339
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:25,025
he is a wonderful person.

340
00:28:27,145 --> 00:28:28,985
Although some bad things

341
00:28:29,545 --> 00:28:32,825
had happened in the past,

342
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:35,585
he never gave up on himself.

343
00:28:36,545 --> 00:28:37,825
Instead, he worked hard

344
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,465
and endured everything

345
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:43,905
with a lot of hardship.

346
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:49,105
If only

347
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,465
you could see how excellent he is now.

348
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:53,745
I'm sure you would have some regrets

349
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:56,305
and worries too, right?

350
00:28:58,145 --> 00:28:59,705
But don't worry.

351
00:29:01,025 --> 00:29:02,785
I'll take good care of him.

352
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:05,745
I'll make it up to him.

353
00:29:07,305 --> 00:29:08,345
I'll make sure

354
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:10,945
he is happy every day.

355
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:14,665
So I'll also give you my promise.

356
00:29:17,145 --> 00:29:18,705
As long as I am here,

357
00:29:20,345 --> 00:29:22,865
I won't let anyone bully Duan Jiaxu again.

358
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:36,345
He'll have his own family in the future.

359
00:29:39,505 --> 00:29:40,785
He has me

360
00:29:43,105 --> 00:29:44,625
and many others who love him.

361
00:29:47,025 --> 00:29:48,225
We all love you.

362
00:29:54,185 --> 00:29:55,105
So

363
00:29:57,185 --> 00:29:59,385
you will never be alone anymore.

364
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:02,265
Okay?

365
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:07,665
Don't cry.

366
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:08,985
If you cry,

367
00:30:10,105 --> 00:30:12,745
your mom will think I'm bullying you.

368
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:15,025
The smoke is stinging my eyes.

369
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:18,305
You promised.

370
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:21,105
You promised in front of my mom

371
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:23,265
that you'll protect me.

372
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:24,865
Yes, I'll protect you.

373
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:29,025
Come here.

374
00:30:29,105 --> 00:30:30,425
Let me protect you for a bit.

375
00:30:41,865 --> 00:30:43,305
Hey.

376
00:30:47,265 --> 00:30:48,185
Come and get me.

377
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:01,825
Come after me.

378
00:31:04,385 --> 00:31:05,265
I can even stand up.

379
00:31:07,425 --> 00:31:09,065
That little girl

380
00:31:09,145 --> 00:31:11,025
who used to sit in my back seat

381
00:31:11,985 --> 00:31:13,785
suddenly grew up one day.

382
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:16,345
She can always accompany me

383
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:18,465
and walk side by side with me.

384
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,145
She helped me overcome

385
00:31:21,225 --> 00:31:23,185
my longest and darkest hour.

386
00:31:24,265 --> 00:31:25,825
She even took the lead

387
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,145
and waited for me

388
00:31:29,145 --> 00:31:30,265
in the sunlight.

389
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:38,145
Come on!

390
00:31:39,225 --> 00:31:40,065
I'm coming!

391
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:18,785
I've submitted my resignation to Siyun.

392
00:32:22,385 --> 00:32:23,505
Why?

393
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,545
Didn't I tell you before?

394
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,185
You don't have to go back to Nanwu.

395
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:31,865
I want to go back.

396
00:32:33,145 --> 00:32:34,065
I want

397
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,265
to go in advance and get things settled.

398
00:32:37,145 --> 00:32:38,785
When you graduate and return to Nanwu,

399
00:32:38,865 --> 00:32:40,345
you can immediately start a good life.

400
00:32:41,185 --> 00:32:43,265
Besides, your family is there.

401
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:45,065
I can start my business anywhere, right?

402
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,785
My home is where you are.

403
00:32:52,545 --> 00:32:53,585
Didn't you say

404
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:56,305
that after all the bad things are over,

405
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:59,465
all that is left are the good things?

406
00:33:01,305 --> 00:33:03,185
So we just need to focus on the future.

407
00:33:04,385 --> 00:33:05,865
Our future.

408
00:33:07,545 --> 00:33:08,385
Okay?

409
00:33:13,545 --> 00:33:14,905
How long will it be before leaving?

410
00:33:16,985 --> 00:33:19,145
After completing the handover procedures,

411
00:33:19,985 --> 00:33:20,865
about a month later.

412
00:33:22,545 --> 00:33:23,545
A month?

413
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,025
That's so soon.

414
00:33:31,505 --> 00:33:32,585
Are you feeling reluctant?

415
00:33:34,825 --> 00:33:35,745
No.

416
00:33:38,745 --> 00:33:40,265
But I feel reluctant.

417
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:50,945
Don't worry.

418
00:33:51,025 --> 00:33:52,705
We'll have many opportunities to meet up.

419
00:34:09,744 --> 00:34:11,425
I'm making supper for you.

420
00:34:12,145 --> 00:34:13,344
Supper?

421
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:14,744
Glutinous rice balls.

422
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:17,304
How about six?

423
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:18,905
Is that okay?

424
00:34:53,344 --> 00:34:54,304
Okay, that's enough.

425
00:34:56,264 --> 00:34:57,785
That's too much water.

426
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,305
Really?

427
00:34:59,385 --> 00:35:00,265
Let me do it.

428
00:35:05,985 --> 00:35:06,865
That's about it.

429
00:35:22,225 --> 00:35:23,905
I'm going to miss you after I leave.

430
00:35:23,985 --> 00:35:24,945
What am I going to do?

431
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:35,025
If you miss me,

432
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:37,945
you can eat the candy I gave you.

433
00:35:38,025 --> 00:35:39,225
Okay?

434
00:35:39,785 --> 00:35:41,505
Or you can bring the polar bear with you.

435
00:35:43,785 --> 00:35:45,625
What will you do if you miss me?

436
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:51,425
I'll leave the polar bear with you.

437
00:35:53,105 --> 00:35:54,665
If you miss me,

438
00:35:54,745 --> 00:35:55,905
you can look at it.

439
00:35:55,985 --> 00:35:57,745
It will be just like I'm right beside you.

440
00:35:58,345 --> 00:35:59,185
Okay?

441
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:05,665
It's not done yet.

442
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:15,425
Do you want…

443
00:36:22,545 --> 00:36:23,745
What are you thinking about?

444
00:36:23,825 --> 00:36:25,745
Why don't you go and get some rest?

445
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:26,945
I'll be done soon.

446
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:33,305
How about…

447
00:37:27,305 --> 00:37:28,225
All right.

448
00:37:28,985 --> 00:37:30,345
I've called a car for you.

449
00:37:30,425 --> 00:37:33,065
Text me after you get in the car.

450
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:36,705
The airport is so far.

451
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:38,825
I shouldn't have let you see me off.

452
00:37:40,145 --> 00:37:42,105
How could I not come to see you off?

453
00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:49,585
I don't want you to leave.

454
00:38:00,025 --> 00:38:00,865
I know.

455
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:03,785
Don't worry.

456
00:38:05,025 --> 00:38:06,225
After I get there,

457
00:38:07,145 --> 00:38:08,625
I'll visit you whenever I have time.

458
00:38:09,305 --> 00:38:11,105
I won't make you wait too long. Okay?

459
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:16,145
Listen.

460
00:38:17,665 --> 00:38:19,625
Once you're back in Nanwu,

461
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:21,945
you need to eat regularly.

462
00:38:22,945 --> 00:38:23,865
You must have

463
00:38:24,825 --> 00:38:26,665
three meals a day.

464
00:38:26,745 --> 00:38:27,945
But I'll remind you.

465
00:38:29,025 --> 00:38:30,065
And also,

466
00:38:31,305 --> 00:38:32,385
don't think

467
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:34,265
about other things.

468
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:35,505
Don't be concerned about them.

469
00:38:36,345 --> 00:38:37,665
Just focus on your work

470
00:38:37,745 --> 00:38:39,305
and work hard.

471
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:40,705
You can work hard,

472
00:38:41,225 --> 00:38:42,785
but don't stress yourself too much.

473
00:38:43,745 --> 00:38:44,585
I mean,

474
00:38:45,465 --> 00:38:47,905
if your start-up does fail,

475
00:38:47,985 --> 00:38:49,145
it's okay.

476
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:51,945
After all, I can…

477
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:54,625
You can what?

478
00:38:56,345 --> 00:38:57,465
I'll provide for you.

479
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:02,065
After I graduate, I can provide for you.

480
00:39:03,185 --> 00:39:04,625
You always say you'll provide for me.

481
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:06,425
Then I'll just wait.

482
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:12,265
All right.

483
00:39:12,785 --> 00:39:13,865
Well,

484
00:39:15,385 --> 00:39:16,665
I'm going to go now.

485
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:17,825
Don't stay any longer.

486
00:39:18,985 --> 00:39:19,825
Okay?

487
00:39:23,265 --> 00:39:24,785
Text me after you get in the car.

488
00:39:26,545 --> 00:39:27,465
I'm going now.

489
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:39,105
Be good.

490
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:43,065
Text me when you get in the car.

491
00:39:43,145 --> 00:39:43,985
Head back now.

492
00:39:46,065 --> 00:39:47,105
Bye.

493
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,585
Let me send you off.

494
00:40:22,425 --> 00:40:23,585
Okay.

495
00:40:24,585 --> 00:40:25,825
Then send me off.

496
00:40:45,545 --> 00:40:46,745
This is far enough.

497
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:49,705
I really have to go now.

498
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:54,345
Head back now.

499
00:40:54,425 --> 00:40:55,865
Text me when you get in the car.

500
00:40:58,305 --> 00:40:59,865
Make sure to text me.

501
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:41,665
What is it?

502
00:41:43,025 --> 00:41:44,065
I have a feeling

503
00:41:44,825 --> 00:41:46,425
that you have something to tell me.

504
00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:51,865
After you go to Nanwu,

505
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:54,905
can we have video calls every day?

506
00:41:55,465 --> 00:41:56,545
Of course we can.

507
00:41:57,505 --> 00:42:00,345
You won't find it burdensome, will you?

508
00:42:01,705 --> 00:42:02,785
Will you find it burdensome?

509
00:42:02,865 --> 00:42:04,825
-No.
-Me neither.

510
00:42:09,025 --> 00:42:09,945
You try it first.

511
00:42:12,585 --> 00:42:13,465
Okay.

512
00:42:25,705 --> 00:42:26,585
One more thing.

513
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,705
We'll be in a long-distance relationship,

514
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:32,225
so we should

515
00:42:32,905 --> 00:42:34,705
make an extra effort.

516
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:38,825
For example, on anniversaries or holidays,

517
00:42:38,905 --> 00:42:40,185
I can visit you in Nanwu

518
00:42:40,265 --> 00:42:42,025
or you can visit me in Yihe.

519
00:42:42,105 --> 00:42:43,185
Of course.

520
00:42:43,745 --> 00:42:45,025
Then I shall go and visit you.

521
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:48,065
Hold on. What do you mean by that?

522
00:42:48,145 --> 00:42:49,385
Are you saying

523
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:50,905
that I usually don't make an effort?

524
00:42:51,705 --> 00:42:52,585
That's not it.

525
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:54,665
So do you agree with it?

526
00:42:54,745 --> 00:42:55,905
Of course.

527
00:42:55,985 --> 00:42:56,825
Good.

528
00:43:05,545 --> 00:43:06,825
And also,

529
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:10,385
if we have an argument…

530
00:43:10,865 --> 00:43:12,585
We won't argue.

531
00:43:13,545 --> 00:43:15,185
But if we do,

532
00:43:15,265 --> 00:43:16,945
we must make up on the same day.

533
00:43:17,745 --> 00:43:19,385
No silent treatment. No disappearing.

534
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:22,465
-Got it?
-We make up on the same day we quarrel.

535
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:24,585
Well said.

536
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:28,545
Trust.

537
00:43:29,185 --> 00:43:31,265
We trust each other.

538
00:43:31,345 --> 00:43:32,265
Actually…

539
00:43:32,865 --> 00:43:33,905
If…

540
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:37,065
-What are you reading?
-Wait. No.

541
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,825
"Guide to maintaining
a long-distance relationship"?

542
00:43:41,545 --> 00:43:42,865
As you know,

543
00:43:42,945 --> 00:43:44,705
many problems come up

544
00:43:44,785 --> 00:43:46,905
in long-distance relationships.

545
00:43:46,985 --> 00:43:48,985
So I summarized them in advance

546
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,625
and developed a guide.

547
00:43:53,585 --> 00:43:55,505
So you don't trust me

548
00:43:55,585 --> 00:43:56,665
and are worried about me.

549
00:43:57,865 --> 00:43:59,105
No.

550
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:02,225
I'm pretty worried about you.

551
00:44:02,785 --> 00:44:04,225
I think your guide

552
00:44:04,305 --> 00:44:05,825
is done very well.

553
00:44:05,905 --> 00:44:07,185
You should strictly follow it

554
00:44:07,265 --> 00:44:08,105
in the future.

555
00:44:09,025 --> 00:44:09,945
Me?

556
00:44:11,545 --> 00:44:12,625
Quickly send me a copy.

557
00:44:15,705 --> 00:44:17,225
You can make your own.

558
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:19,065
I'm serious.

559
00:44:19,145 --> 00:44:20,705
What you wrote is really good.

560
00:44:27,385 --> 00:44:28,305
Wait.

561
00:44:29,105 --> 00:44:31,145
"We can have arguments,

562
00:44:31,225 --> 00:44:33,305
but not in front of other people."

563
00:44:33,385 --> 00:44:34,825
Yes, because it's a matter

564
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,305
of saving our face.

565
00:44:38,865 --> 00:44:40,665
"You don't have to reply
to messages instantly.

566
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:42,305
But if you see them, you must reply."

567
00:44:42,385 --> 00:44:44,305
-That's right.
