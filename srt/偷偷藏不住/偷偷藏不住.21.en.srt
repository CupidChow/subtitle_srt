ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

2
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:01,985
He fell asleep.

3
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:04,145
I'm going to go now.

4
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:07,985
I've been holding back all day.

5
00:02:15,825 --> 00:02:17,665
Can you take the passenger seat?

6
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:19,545
Jiaxu isn't your driver.

7
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:22,705
So? I've been your driver so many times.

8
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:23,865
Can't he be one for me once?

9
00:02:27,385 --> 00:02:28,225
Bye.

10
00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:32,105
Okay, fine!

11
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,545
Wait! My seat belt is still on!

12
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:35,225
You…

13
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:40,305
What's wrong with you?

14
00:02:40,385 --> 00:02:41,345
I'll move.

15
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:44,665
Text me when you reach your dorm.

16
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:46,905
-"Text me."
-Bye.

17
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:47,905
"Bye."

18
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:48,865
I'm off.

19
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:18,905
I'll drive you home first.

20
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:20,425
I need to head back to the office.

21
00:03:21,345 --> 00:03:23,065
Do you still have to work?

22
00:03:23,145 --> 00:03:24,785
It's so late now.

23
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,625
I know.

24
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,705
I had to accompany my darling brother,

25
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:30,305
so I have to catch up on work tonight.

26
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:35,065
It's fine. I'll go with you.

27
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:36,785
I'm curious about how you work at night.

28
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:41,625
Sure.

29
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:43,865
Thank you, darling brother.

30
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:47,385
Cut it out.

31
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:49,265
THE DREAM GAMES

32
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:57,665
Why did you have to squeeze in here

33
00:03:58,345 --> 00:03:59,985
instead of enjoying the bed at home?

34
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:01,505
It's all the same.

35
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:03,865
I'm just gaming at a different place.

36
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:09,465
I have a question.

37
00:04:10,345 --> 00:04:11,705
Are you working overtime

38
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,865
on top of picking up the little demon

39
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:15,505
from work,

40
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:17,504
having dinner, going shopping,

41
00:04:17,585 --> 00:04:19,225
and watching a movie with her?

42
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:23,425
A while ago, my superior fell sick,

43
00:04:23,505 --> 00:04:24,465
so I was quite busy.

44
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,585
But things are better now.

45
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:28,465
Today is an exception.

46
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:30,545
Don't ruin your health just to date.

47
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:33,665
Actually, you can tell her.

48
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:36,905
The little demon isn't sensible,

49
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,745
but she will understand.

50
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:40,145
If she was sensible enough,

51
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:41,665
I would do whatever she wishes.

52
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:44,705
It's fine.

53
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,585
I'm moving to a new place soon.

54
00:04:46,665 --> 00:04:47,825
The situation will improve.

55
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:50,385
New place?

56
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:52,265
Why are you moving?

57
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:56,185
My current place is too small

58
00:04:56,265 --> 00:04:58,265
and far away from her campus.

59
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:00,065
I found a new apartment

60
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:01,585
with two bedrooms

61
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:02,825
and it's near her campus.

62
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:05,505
You won't have to be so worried.

63
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:08,465
As if.

64
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:14,665
Duan Jiaxu, you know me.

65
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:16,905
As her brother,

66
00:05:18,465 --> 00:05:20,945
I'll worry since my sister is dating.

67
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:24,825
Do you remember the mess

68
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:26,225
when she went to see that guy

69
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:28,385
she met online?

70
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,025
But in the past few days,

71
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:37,585
I have felt relieved

72
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:41,705
that you are her boyfriend.

73
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:51,825
But mark my words.

74
00:05:52,665 --> 00:05:56,145
If you ever dare to hurt my sister,

75
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:58,785
I will make sure you pay for it.

76
00:06:03,385 --> 00:06:04,265
It's a shame

77
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:06,505
that you won't have this chance.

78
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:13,745
So about working late tonight…

79
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:15,425
No worries. I won't tell her.

80
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:17,505
I'm not that clueless.

81
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:20,825
Continue with your work.

82
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:21,905
Thank you, darling brother.

83
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,305
CHAPTER 21, RELIANCE

84
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:43,865
I AM BECAUSE YOU ARE

85
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:48,625
Hello. Good morning.

86
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:56,785
Did he sleep here again?

87
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:57,865
He worked overtime.

88
00:06:58,505 --> 00:06:59,385
Again?

89
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:11,385
I'M GOING BACK TO YOUR PLACE FIRST

90
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:31,145
Jiaxu, good morning.

91
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:32,065
Good morning.

92
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:34,705
Did you stay here again yesterday?

93
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:39,705
I saw your girlfriend at the KTV

94
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:41,185
a few days ago.

95
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:42,905
-Really?
-Yes.

96
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:44,185
I saw her in the corridor

97
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:47,025
with the girl who made a scene downstairs.

98
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:48,345
They were talking.

99
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:53,665
Jiaxu, I'll get back to my work.

100
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:55,425
Go ahead.

101
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:04,785
If anything falls off,
come back to see me.

102
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:05,985
-I'll fix it for free.
-Sure.

103
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:07,305
-I'll get going. Bye.
-Bye.

104
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:19,185
Duan Jiaxu?

105
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:21,385
What brings you here?

106
00:08:24,345 --> 00:08:26,225
Would you like anything to drink? Water?

107
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:28,905
What you did to me constitutes harassment.

108
00:08:28,985 --> 00:08:30,505
If you go to her again,

109
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:31,905
I'll consider calling the police.

110
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:41,024
Police?

111
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:44,425
Jiang Ying.

112
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:47,945
You've been bugging me for many years

113
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:49,105
and I've let it go.

114
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:50,745
I can tolerate it all.

115
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:54,265
But if you hurt her,

116
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:57,385
the girl I love,

117
00:08:59,145 --> 00:09:01,305
I can do anything for her sake.

118
00:09:19,545 --> 00:09:21,785
PUBLIC SECURITY
ADMINISTRATIVE PUNISHMENTS LAW

119
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:24,065
According to our statistics,

120
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:25,825
the users of Dongjie

121
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:27,585
prioritize ingredients and additives

122
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:30,225
when choosing skincare products.

123
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:31,905
So we would like to showcase

124
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:35,505
the production of the main ingredients
and extraction process

125
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:36,745
in the animation.

126
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:39,065
This will give the audience a clearer view

127
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,305
of the product's safety.

128
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:47,025
Any thoughts on this?

129
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:50,665
The target audience of this product

130
00:09:50,745 --> 00:09:52,745
are individuals
with allergic skin conditions

131
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,585
and individuals with sensitive skin.

132
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:57,665
I believe the users will be concerned
about the safety of the ingredients.

133
00:09:57,745 --> 00:09:58,705
I think

134
00:09:58,785 --> 00:10:01,025
Xiaoyu's idea is quite good.

135
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:03,225
I don't care what you think,

136
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:04,345
I only care what I think.

137
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:06,345
I think your opinion isn't accurate.

138
00:10:06,425 --> 00:10:07,305
What do you think?

139
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:09,145
What the users are concerned about

140
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:10,985
are not necessarily our clients' concerns.

141
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:12,385
They value nothing but sales.

142
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:14,225
Mr. Zhang.

143
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:16,625
Dongjie's products are high-priced.

144
00:10:16,705 --> 00:10:18,865
Their user base mainly consists of people

145
00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:20,385
between 26 and 36.

146
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:23,105
Ladies within this age range
don't mind spending money.

147
00:10:23,185 --> 00:10:24,305
Instead, they're concerned

148
00:10:24,385 --> 00:10:26,185
about getting unsafe products
for their money.

149
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:27,825
That's why we went in this direction.

150
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:30,425
Dongjie is a well-established brand

151
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,185
in the market.

152
00:10:32,945 --> 00:10:34,345
Do you think it's meaningful

153
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,305
when you advertise the ingredients?

154
00:10:36,825 --> 00:10:38,825
I want bold and creative ideas.

155
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,505
Only by doing so can we help our clients

156
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:42,865
attract new customers.

157
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:45,785
This idea is indeed not persuasive enough.

158
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,305
Let's hear Xiaoyu's other ideas.

159
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:51,665
-Mr. Zhang--
-Enough.

160
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:52,785
You can save it.

161
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:55,505
Does anyone else have ideas?

162
00:10:56,585 --> 00:10:57,465
You?

163
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:01,705
The two of you?

164
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:06,585
I have a tiny idea.

165
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:09,585
Go on.

166
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:12,505
Can we

167
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:15,305
portray the products
as animated characters?

168
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:19,785
Previously,

169
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:22,745
the client mentioned three focal points.

170
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:24,825
One, storytelling.

171
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:26,465
Two, product functionality.

172
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:29,225
Three, garnering public attention.

173
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:31,785
So can we use

174
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:34,065
an animated character

175
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:36,265
combined with the product

176
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:38,745
to create a story in the ad

177
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:41,065
to highlight the function of the product?

178
00:11:41,585 --> 00:11:43,545
We can also make use

179
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,745
of some current hot topics

180
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:47,905
to generate more public interest
in the product

181
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:50,345
and reach out to a wider audience.

182
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:51,865
Are you positive

183
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,665
that using a story plot

184
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:57,425
can help raise Dongjie's sales?

185
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:04,385
Yes, as someone

186
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:07,105
who has had allergies since I was little.

187
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,705
So if I were to see this ad,

188
00:12:09,785 --> 00:12:12,945
it might evoke some childhood memories.

189
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:15,345
Perhaps we can narrow the scope

190
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:16,905
to the allergic cluster.

191
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:19,105
If anyone with allergies watches this ad,

192
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:21,825
they may want to try the product.

193
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:24,585
That's an interesting idea.

194
00:12:24,665 --> 00:12:25,545
Go into detail.

195
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:27,585
Detail?

196
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:30,065
-Details.
-I haven't thought about the details yet.

197
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:35,305
I think

198
00:12:35,385 --> 00:12:37,745
the story of a little girl

199
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:40,785
doesn't align with the image
of Dongjie's product.

200
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:42,185
It's a bit too childish.

201
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:45,385
But I think it's pretty good.

202
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,505
It's interesting.

203
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:48,025
For both of your ideas,

204
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:49,505
one is about function,

205
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:51,185
while the other one is about creativity.

206
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:53,785
Anyway, the client has the final say.

207
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:57,385
I suggest making proposals for both

208
00:12:57,465 --> 00:12:58,625
and letting the client choose.

209
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,225
I agree with Mr. Zhang.

210
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:02,425
I agree with your agreement.

211
00:13:03,345 --> 00:13:04,465
So let's proceed this way.

212
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:07,305
Dongjie is our biggest client.

213
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:09,265
We must not lose this client,

214
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:12,185
so we must make sure to satisfy Dongjie.

215
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:13,345
Understood?

216
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:15,265
Understood.

217
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:17,025
Very good.

218
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:18,265
Young lady,

219
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:20,225
your idea is creative and bold.

220
00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:22,465
Okay, let's call it a day.

221
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:31,705
Are you a Yihe University student?

222
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,425
A freshman.

223
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:35,425
Keep up the good work.

224
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,505
Sang Zhi, come here.

225
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,265
I'll send you the project material.

226
00:13:40,345 --> 00:13:41,905
-Go back and study it.
-Sure.

227
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:46,065
Xiaoyu,

228
00:13:46,145 --> 00:13:47,825
I need you to review a project.

229
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:57,465
Make this part bigger.

230
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,585
Okay, next page.

231
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:03,345
This part is quite good.

232
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:05,305
Xiaoyu.

233
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:09,345
Sang Zhi.

234
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,025
Xiaoyu.

235
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:18,105
I'll submit the proposal to you

236
00:14:18,185 --> 00:14:19,345
after I complete it.

237
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,425
No need to send it to me.

238
00:14:26,305 --> 00:14:27,345
You're an intern.

239
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:30,145
Do you not know the company rules?

240
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,665
You're my subordinate.

241
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:36,385
You should've reported to me

242
00:14:37,065 --> 00:14:38,625
if you have ideas or proposals

243
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:40,345
instead of mentioning them in the meeting.

244
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:41,705
What was your intent?

245
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:44,025
What do you want?

246
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:45,265
To show off that you're smart?

247
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:48,185
No.

248
00:14:49,665 --> 00:14:50,745
I'm sorry, Xiaoyu.

249
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:51,825
I just…

250
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,385
But I should've expected it.

251
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:57,345
Someone who steals
someone else's boyfriend

252
00:14:58,145 --> 00:14:59,185
wouldn't care about the rules.

253
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:19,665
It's blazing hot in Yihe.

254
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:24,625
Have you been waiting long?

255
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:25,625
Not really.

256
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:27,505
Where is Duan Jiaxu?

257
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,745
He went to buy a drink for you.

258
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:34,865
I heard

259
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:36,785
that you always work extra hours.

260
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:39,905
It happens to all interns.

261
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:43,945
Well, while you're working,

262
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:46,745
take care of yourself and get enough rest.

263
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:48,585
I'm flying back tomorrow morning

264
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:49,985
and I have something to do later,

265
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:50,905
so I'm leaving now.

266
00:15:57,345 --> 00:15:58,825
Flying back tomorrow morning?

267
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:03,585
What's wrong with you?

268
00:16:03,665 --> 00:16:05,465
You're leaving after only a few days.

269
00:16:05,545 --> 00:16:07,465
I need to go back
to deal with a lot of things.

270
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:09,705
You should've told me earlier.

271
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:11,945
I could've taken yesterday off

272
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,385
to show you around Yihe.

273
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:16,465
No, I wouldn't like your idea of fun,
little demon.

274
00:16:16,545 --> 00:16:17,385
Forget it.

275
00:16:18,705 --> 00:16:19,545
Well…

276
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:22,545
Can't you stay here

277
00:16:23,385 --> 00:16:24,625
for two more days?

278
00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:25,905
I…

279
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,865
What?

280
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,345
I…

281
00:16:32,665 --> 00:16:35,425
Don't you feel embarrassed crying

282
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:36,785
outside your workplace?

283
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:38,225
Well…

284
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:41,865
I have nothing to do here.

285
00:16:41,945 --> 00:16:44,105
I'm just sitting on his couch every day

286
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:45,945
like his watchdog.

287
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:49,185
I mean it.

288
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:51,385
Hey.

289
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:54,985
Something is wrong with you.

290
00:16:55,065 --> 00:16:56,505
Are you unhappy with your internship?

291
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:01,585
I knew it. Here's the thing.

292
00:17:01,665 --> 00:17:02,545
Listen.

293
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,145
If you're not happy, just quit the job.

294
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,545
We have enough money
to feed ourselves, right?

295
00:17:08,385 --> 00:17:10,345
I give you more than that chump change.

296
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:13,345
How about this? I'll talk to your boss.

297
00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:15,224
I won't allow anyone to bully my sister.

298
00:17:15,305 --> 00:17:16,385
-Got it?
-What happened?

299
00:17:16,944 --> 00:17:18,345
Duan Jiaxu, come quickly.

300
00:17:18,424 --> 00:17:19,385
Come and cheer her up.

301
00:17:19,464 --> 00:17:20,545
What's going on?

302
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,305
-Comfort her.
-Stop bullying your sister.

303
00:17:22,385 --> 00:17:24,224
It's not me. She said it's her internship.

304
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:25,305
-She's unhappy.
-I didn't.

305
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:27,785
He's talking nonsense.

306
00:17:28,345 --> 00:17:29,865
You blocked me

307
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:31,105
and stole my red packets.

308
00:17:31,665 --> 00:17:33,425
That's why I'm upset.

309
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:35,065
I was just messing with you.

310
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:36,545
I'll give you back the red packets.

311
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,065
Fine. Stop talking.

312
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:42,865
Here. Drink this.

313
00:17:46,585 --> 00:17:48,785
Duan Jiaxu, I have plans later.

314
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:50,825
Send her home first.

315
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:52,185
I can give you a ride.

316
00:17:52,265 --> 00:17:53,265
No, it's too much trouble.

317
00:17:53,345 --> 00:17:54,585
It's in the opposite direction.

318
00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:57,065
All right. You guys talk. I'm off.

319
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:05,065
You've got Duan Jiaxu. Aren't you happy?

320
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:07,545
Bye, little demon.

321
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:18,505
Is your boss on the second floor?

322
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:20,745
No…

323
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:22,745
-What?
-Let's go.

324
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:23,665
Let's go.

325
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:31,785
Have you been

326
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,625
in a bad mood lately?

327
00:18:37,385 --> 00:18:39,225
I thought you hadn't talked about work

328
00:18:39,305 --> 00:18:41,385
because you weren't having trouble.

329
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:48,545
There aren't that many troubles at work.

330
00:18:49,185 --> 00:18:50,025
I…

331
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:52,945
I feel that I can handle it myself.

332
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:55,505
You're busy with your work.

333
00:18:56,105 --> 00:18:59,145
I don't want to give you more pressure.

334
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:03,665
You used to cry a lot in front of me.

335
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:05,745
Why do you feel embarrassed now?

336
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:07,705
That was when I was a kid.

337
00:19:07,785 --> 00:19:10,665
I don't cry anymore.

338
00:19:11,185 --> 00:19:12,025
Only…

339
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:14,545
Only kids cry.

340
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,585
I'm an adult now.

341
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:18,105
When I face any problems,

342
00:19:18,185 --> 00:19:20,785
I should think about how to resolve them.

343
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:22,305
I can't cry all the time.

344
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:25,265
If you think

345
00:19:25,345 --> 00:19:26,785
that only kids get to cry,

346
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:29,425
then you can always be a kid.

347
00:19:31,225 --> 00:19:32,545
I'll provide for you.

348
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:38,985
All right?

349
00:19:52,785 --> 00:19:53,905
Are you homesick?

350
00:19:58,705 --> 00:19:59,625
Let's go home then.

351
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:02,705
I'll take some days off

352
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:03,785
and go home with you.

353
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:06,865
And you can quit this job

354
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:08,705
if you don't feel like continuing it.

355
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:10,505
What's wrong with this company?

356
00:20:11,465 --> 00:20:13,345
They keep giving my Zhizhi a hard time.

357
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:16,265
I must have

358
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:19,425
a serious talk with your superior.

359
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,265
Honestly.

360
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,145
You're acting like a parent now.

361
00:20:25,945 --> 00:20:27,105
Yes.

362
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,345
Perhaps I've become more greedy.

363
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:31,345
I want

364
00:20:31,425 --> 00:20:33,025
to be more than just your boyfriend.

365
00:20:34,505 --> 00:20:36,665
I also want to be someone you can rely on.

366
00:20:38,745 --> 00:20:39,625
May I?

367
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:03,145
I also want

368
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:04,665
to be someone you rely on.

369
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:07,945
You can

370
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:12,345
share your joys and sorrows with me.

371
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:17,745
All right.

372
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,945
Then we'll rely on each other.

373
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:28,625
So now can you tell me

374
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,465
what happened at work?

375
00:21:43,145 --> 00:21:44,305
Zhizhi.

376
00:21:46,065 --> 00:21:47,905
I know that Jiang Ying went to see you.

377
00:21:52,705 --> 00:21:53,865
Don't worry.

378
00:21:54,505 --> 00:21:55,905
I went to her

379
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,105
and warned her today.

380
00:21:59,265 --> 00:22:01,025
She won't harass you anymore.

381
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:08,825
Zhizhi.

382
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:13,225
You didn't tell me

383
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:16,425
that you're having trouble at work

384
00:22:17,145 --> 00:22:18,905
and that Jiang Ying came to you.

385
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:21,985
You don't have
to take on everything alone.

386
00:22:23,745 --> 00:22:24,825
Promise me.

387
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:27,385
You'll tell me first thing

388
00:22:28,065 --> 00:22:30,225
when you run into problems, okay?

389
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,385
I will let you know.

390
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:40,265
I didn't tell you about Jiang Ying

391
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,025
because I've grown up

392
00:22:43,105 --> 00:22:44,305
and I can handle it.

393
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:46,665
You don't have to worry about me.

394
00:22:47,705 --> 00:22:49,865
I won't let her pick on me
without doing anything.

395
00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:52,905
I can protect myself.

396
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,025
I can protect you too.

397
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:12,385
What's the matter?

398
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,105
I feel

399
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:19,665
that my Zhizhi really has grown up.

400
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:05,145
SILLY DOG TRANSFERRED 1,000 YUAN

401
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:14,985
VOICE CALL

402
00:24:15,065 --> 00:24:15,905
SILLY DOG

403
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:23,785
-Hello?
-Hello.

404
00:24:24,385 --> 00:24:26,345
Have you received
your pocket money and allowance?

405
00:24:29,465 --> 00:24:30,465
What time is your flight?

406
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:31,385
I'll see you off.

407
00:24:32,865 --> 00:24:34,225
Don't act like you care about me.

408
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:35,225
Accept the money.

409
00:24:35,305 --> 00:24:36,305
You're scaring me.

410
00:24:37,585 --> 00:24:38,665
Well,

411
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:40,505
when will you come to visit me again?

412
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:42,625
When I have spare time.

413
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:44,625
Don't skip meals

414
00:24:44,705 --> 00:24:46,025
and rest if you feel tired.

415
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:49,625
Also, don't throw tantrums at Duan Jiaxu

416
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:50,785
all the time.

417
00:24:51,385 --> 00:24:53,585
-I never do that.
-Fine.

418
00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:56,185
-I--
-Okay. I'm hanging up. Bye.

419
00:25:07,905 --> 00:25:09,105
I want

420
00:25:09,185 --> 00:25:10,665
to be more than just your boyfriend.

421
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:14,825
I also want to be someone you can rely on.

422
00:25:16,545 --> 00:25:18,585
I didn't tell you about Jiang Ying

423
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,145
because I've grown up

424
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:22,385
and I can handle it.

425
00:25:23,225 --> 00:25:24,785
You don't have to worry about me.

426
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:28,185
I won't let her pick on me
without doing anything.

427
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,825
I can protect myself.

428
00:25:32,545 --> 00:25:34,225
I can protect you too.

429
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:36,785
I feel

430
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:40,545
that my Zhizhi really has grown up.

431
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:54,665
That concludes the product budget summary.

432
00:25:54,745 --> 00:25:56,265
Next, let's have our team member

433
00:25:56,345 --> 00:25:57,945
propose the idea for the ad.

434
00:26:00,745 --> 00:26:02,825
The idea for this ad

435
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:05,825
uses a little girl's perspective.

436
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:08,145
This little girl has suffered

437
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:09,985
from allergies since childhood,

438
00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:12,145
so she can't eat or drink

439
00:26:12,225 --> 00:26:13,385
what she wants.

440
00:26:13,465 --> 00:26:15,825
She starts using our skincare product

441
00:26:15,905 --> 00:26:18,705
and is protected by a little spirit.

442
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,145
This little spirit

443
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:21,985
is a symbol of the Dongjie lotion.

444
00:26:22,065 --> 00:26:25,105
This ad will be about 30 seconds long.

445
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:26,985
The plot revolves

446
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:29,745
around the little girl and Dongjie lotion.

447
00:26:29,825 --> 00:26:33,105
We'll build a character image
for the users,

448
00:26:33,185 --> 00:26:34,785
so that the image of a little girl

449
00:26:34,865 --> 00:26:36,345
can always remind them of Dongjie.

450
00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:38,345
Aside from that,

451
00:26:38,425 --> 00:26:40,105
we can build a brand image

452
00:26:40,185 --> 00:26:41,865
to portray the traits of the brand,

453
00:26:41,945 --> 00:26:44,465
which are pure, gorgeous, and reassuring.

454
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:46,225
Lastly, we can highlight

455
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,705
that Dongjie is a natural product.

456
00:26:48,785 --> 00:26:49,665
That's the gist of it.

457
00:26:49,745 --> 00:26:52,545
We'll proceed with the details afterward.

458
00:26:54,785 --> 00:26:57,665
I like the story of the allergic girl.

459
00:27:00,425 --> 00:27:03,105
But I think the production fee

460
00:27:03,185 --> 00:27:04,865
might exceed our budget.

461
00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:07,945
We offer you a fair price.

462
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:10,345
The difficulty comes
with the character design

463
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:12,185
and the shooting.

464
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:14,265
Anyway, I believe
that the more challenging it is,

465
00:27:14,345 --> 00:27:16,265
the more we must try it.

466
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:17,465
Also, I'm confident

467
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:19,065
that we can provide you

468
00:27:19,145 --> 00:27:21,585
with a perfect outcome.

469
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:23,505
All right.

470
00:27:24,385 --> 00:27:25,665
We've decided

471
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:27,305
to use the story of the little girl.

472
00:27:27,865 --> 00:27:29,225
Sir, what about the contract?

473
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:31,865
Make amendments to the contract.

474
00:27:31,945 --> 00:27:32,985
Sign it quickly.

475
00:27:33,825 --> 00:27:35,385
This will be

476
00:27:35,465 --> 00:27:37,225
a perfect collaboration.

477
00:27:37,305 --> 00:27:38,625
Thank you.

478
00:27:38,705 --> 00:27:39,545
Let's go.

479
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,625
-Xiaoyu, see them off.
-See them off.

480
00:27:41,705 --> 00:27:43,185
-This way, please.
-Okay. Be careful.

481
00:27:52,185 --> 00:27:53,065
Sang Zhi.

482
00:27:56,105 --> 00:27:57,585
You're so smart.

483
00:27:57,665 --> 00:27:59,025
You have an amazing brain.

484
00:27:59,105 --> 00:28:01,345
You're sharp as a blade,
coming up with this brilliant idea

485
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:02,985
and securing this project.

486
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:04,425
Do you know what this is?

487
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:08,145
You've done an excellent job, rookie.

488
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:10,345
If you pull your weight

489
00:28:10,425 --> 00:28:12,425
and do well on this proposal,

490
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:15,345
I'll give the entire team a bonus!

491
00:28:16,265 --> 00:28:17,785
Thank you, Mr. Zhang!

492
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:18,905
Brilliant, Mr. Zhang!

493
00:28:18,985 --> 00:28:20,305
I've never seen you all

494
00:28:20,385 --> 00:28:21,825
with such happy faces.

495
00:28:21,905 --> 00:28:22,945
You're so money-obsessed.

496
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:23,865
Do your work well!

497
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:24,945
-Okay!
-You've got this!

498
00:28:25,025 --> 00:28:26,585
-Thank you, Mr. Zhang!
-Thank you, Mr. Zhang!

499
00:28:27,825 --> 00:28:29,305
Sang Zhi, this is thanks to you.

500
00:28:29,385 --> 00:28:30,345
No problem.

501
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:31,985
Xiaowan,

502
00:28:32,065 --> 00:28:33,945
your internship is about to be over.

503
00:28:34,025 --> 00:28:35,945
I'll treat you two to a meal this weekend.

504
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:38,465
-Sure!
-I can't make it this weekend.

505
00:28:38,545 --> 00:28:39,865
I have plans.

506
00:28:39,945 --> 00:28:40,785
Do you?

507
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:42,185
Is it a date?

508
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:44,225
Why are you so nosy?

509
00:28:49,905 --> 00:28:51,505
I'm inside now.

510
00:28:51,585 --> 00:28:52,505
Where are you?

511
00:29:01,945 --> 00:29:02,945
I'm going to…

512
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:10,545
Have you arrived?

513
00:29:15,465 --> 00:29:16,505
What are you doing there?

514
00:29:25,545 --> 00:29:27,145
Wait for me there. I'll come to get you.

515
00:29:29,305 --> 00:29:31,225
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

516
00:29:31,305 --> 00:29:32,225
Will it be…

517
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:42,225
Change into slippers first.

518
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,665
Take a look around first.

519
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:00,385
There's a kitchen over here.

520
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:05,025
There are two bedrooms.

521
00:30:08,945 --> 00:30:10,785
This room has a bigger balcony.

522
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:12,305
It's your room.

523
00:30:15,345 --> 00:30:16,385
Does this mean

524
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:19,265
that we are living together?

525
00:30:20,705 --> 00:30:21,785
No.

526
00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:24,185
I thought of giving you a place to rest

527
00:30:24,745 --> 00:30:27,025
when you get tired from studying.

528
00:30:31,905 --> 00:30:33,425
Let's go eat.

529
00:30:36,185 --> 00:30:37,025
By the way,

530
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,305
you haven't told me

531
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:43,225
how much the monthly rent is.

532
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:44,465
Is it expensive?

533
00:30:45,065 --> 00:30:46,825
If it's expensive,

534
00:30:46,905 --> 00:30:48,465
you don't have to rent this place.

535
00:30:49,545 --> 00:30:51,025
Are you afraid that I can't afford it?

536
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,105
No.

537
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:56,505
I'm afraid

538
00:30:56,585 --> 00:30:57,625
that you are wasting money.

539
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,585
I can afford this.

540
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:03,345
I'm renting this place

541
00:31:03,425 --> 00:31:04,585
because it's near your campus.

542
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:06,745
You can have more time to rest.

543
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:12,905
Give me your hand.

544
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:16,905
Why?

545
00:31:23,065 --> 00:31:24,265
From now on,

546
00:31:24,345 --> 00:31:25,745
this is our home.

547
00:32:26,265 --> 00:32:27,585
Hello, ma'am.

548
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:29,705
This is room 202.

549
00:32:29,785 --> 00:32:31,945
I think something is wrong
with the air conditioner.

550
00:32:32,025 --> 00:32:32,945
What can I do?

551
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:34,305
It's summer break

552
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:35,745
and the technician isn't on duty.

553
00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:36,825
No one can fix it.

554
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:38,665
You'll have to wait until next semester.

555
00:32:39,745 --> 00:32:42,345
Can I hire a technician myself?

556
00:32:42,905 --> 00:32:43,985
I don't recommend that.

557
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:46,665
If the fix makes it worse,
you'll have to pay for it.

558
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:48,185
But the room is really hot.

559
00:32:49,065 --> 00:32:51,465
You'll have to find another solution.

560
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,625
All right. Bye.

561
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:14,545
Hello, Jiaxu.

562
00:33:15,185 --> 00:33:16,625
What are you doing, kiddo?

563
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:17,585
Have you had dinner?

564
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:18,825
I've eaten.

565
00:33:18,905 --> 00:33:20,545
But the air conditioner
in my dorm isn't working.

566
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:21,745
The room is stifling.

567
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:28,145
I see.

568
00:33:30,665 --> 00:33:31,745
I'll go and fetch you now.

569
00:33:33,705 --> 00:33:35,305
Fetch me to go where?

570
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,465
My place.

571
00:33:42,425 --> 00:33:43,665
Wait for me on campus.

572
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:44,985
I'll be on my way now.

573
00:33:47,385 --> 00:33:48,265
All right.

574
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:03,745
It's so refreshing.

575
00:34:03,825 --> 00:34:04,785
Here.

576
00:34:04,865 --> 00:34:05,985
It must be hot in your room.

577
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:08,865
Change your shoes.

578
00:34:15,784 --> 00:34:16,665
Take a look.

579
00:34:17,145 --> 00:34:18,465
See what you want to eat.

580
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:23,065
I bought all your favorite snacks for you.

581
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:31,145
Today, I'll have this

582
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:33,105
and…

583
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:36,945
This.

584
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:38,145
Do you want to try this?

585
00:34:43,705 --> 00:34:45,344
I'm all good with these.

586
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:47,344
I'll eat the rest tomorrow.

587
00:34:47,865 --> 00:34:48,784
Okay.

588
00:34:51,505 --> 00:34:52,385
Have a taste.

589
00:34:56,865 --> 00:34:57,745
You go first.

590
00:34:57,825 --> 00:34:58,705
Don't you want it?

591
00:34:58,785 --> 00:35:00,065
You take the first bite.

592
00:35:04,265 --> 00:35:05,185
Is it good?

593
00:35:08,785 --> 00:35:10,865
You can have these every day

594
00:35:10,945 --> 00:35:12,225
if you move in.

595
00:35:15,425 --> 00:35:16,785
I'll go and tidy up the place.

596
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:30,425
Do you want to take a shower?

597
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:32,985
I've prepared the toiletries for you
in the bathroom.

598
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:40,905
Weren't you sweating in your dorm?

599
00:35:45,545 --> 00:35:46,905
Go ahead and wash up.

600
00:35:47,785 --> 00:35:49,785
All right. I'll go now.

601
00:36:11,825 --> 00:36:12,905
Are you done?

602
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:15,865
Why did he change into pajamas?

603
00:36:16,865 --> 00:36:18,065
Why are you standing there?

604
00:36:21,505 --> 00:36:23,545
I'm working.

605
00:36:27,745 --> 00:36:29,025
I'm playing a game.

606
00:36:31,385 --> 00:36:33,345
Is it the same game as before?

607
00:36:34,785 --> 00:36:35,905
Come and play with me.

608
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,145
Have you tried this before?

609
00:36:49,545 --> 00:36:50,705
Let me show you.

610
00:36:56,785 --> 00:36:57,865
The first skill.

611
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:01,545
Shoot. Shoot outward.

612
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:02,905
The second skill is range.

613
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:09,665
I'm teaching you how to play.

614
00:37:13,225 --> 00:37:14,305
Give it a try.

615
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:16,465
Here.

616
00:37:22,225 --> 00:37:23,225
Buy the equipment.

617
00:37:25,665 --> 00:37:26,905
Attack them with the skills.

618
00:37:37,945 --> 00:37:39,625
Focus on the game.

619
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:52,585
What should I do now?

620
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:55,865
Run.

621
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:57,505
Run.

622
00:37:59,425 --> 00:38:01,385
It's fine. You did very well.

623
00:38:01,465 --> 00:38:02,905
I'll go get some snacks.

624
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:08,145
You…

625
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:09,665
Let me see.

626
00:38:13,785 --> 00:38:14,745
Take your time.

627
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:15,665
I…

628
00:38:17,345 --> 00:38:19,465
Can I unbutton it?

629
00:39:10,585 --> 00:39:11,785
It's done.

630
00:40:11,545 --> 00:40:12,665
You have

631
00:40:13,305 --> 00:40:15,065
to work tomorrow, right?

632
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:19,305
Maybe you should go to bed now.

633
00:40:23,425 --> 00:40:24,305
Yes.

634
00:40:26,065 --> 00:40:27,865
I am a bit sleepy.

635
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:30,145
I think I had better rest now.

636
00:40:30,905 --> 00:40:32,665
I need to go to work early.

637
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:37,785
I still have some work to do.

638
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:46,025
Remember to lock your door.

639
00:42:13,225 --> 00:42:14,345
Good morning.

640
00:42:14,425 --> 00:42:15,465
Good morning.

641
00:42:21,545 --> 00:42:23,145
I'll make breakfast for you.

642
00:42:24,505 --> 00:42:26,585
I'll help you.

643
00:42:47,385 --> 00:42:48,545
Try it.

644
00:42:51,345 --> 00:42:52,625
By the way,

645
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:54,745
are you getting off work late today?

646
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:56,585
Tell me before you leave.

647
00:42:56,665 --> 00:42:57,785
I'll pick you up.

648
00:42:58,345 --> 00:42:59,505
There's no need.

649
00:43:00,185 --> 00:43:01,865
I can come back myself.

650
00:43:02,945 --> 00:43:05,705
Also, isn't your game
going into the testing phase soon?

651
00:43:05,785 --> 00:43:07,905
My internship is ending soon.

652
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,105
After that,

653
00:43:09,185 --> 00:43:12,025
we can have more free time to hang out.

654
00:43:12,985 --> 00:43:13,945
All right.

655
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:16,865
When the testing phase is over,

656
00:43:16,945 --> 00:43:18,825
we can go anywhere you want.
