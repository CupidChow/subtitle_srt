ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

2
00:01:54,545 --> 00:01:56,025
It should make you feel better.

3
00:01:59,465 --> 00:02:00,785
The doctor said to take two pills.

4
00:02:18,585 --> 00:02:20,345
Well? Do you feel better?

5
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:23,185
It doesn't work immediately.

6
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:28,785
Jiaxu, you don't need to worry about me.

7
00:02:30,185 --> 00:02:32,145
I think that milk tea is pretty tasty.

8
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:33,785
Do you still want to have milk tea?

9
00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:35,345
No. It was my first time trying it.

10
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:36,665
I was just

11
00:02:36,745 --> 00:02:38,825
giving you my opinion.

12
00:02:40,465 --> 00:02:41,705
I won't have it again.

13
00:02:41,785 --> 00:02:43,265
The last time I had milk,

14
00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:44,265
I threw up all night.

15
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:49,905
Didn't I buy milk for you before?

16
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:00,945
Did you drink it?

17
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:01,945
No.

18
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:09,305
My classmate drank it.

19
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:12,065
She threw away the bottle too.

20
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,145
It was pointless to keep it anyway.

21
00:03:18,705 --> 00:03:20,385
You should've told me

22
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:22,065
that you can't have milk.

23
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:23,585
I didn't drink it anyway.

24
00:03:24,265 --> 00:03:25,665
I'll take note of it next time.

25
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:28,145
I was careless today.

26
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:30,265
Remember to check

27
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:31,905
before you drink something next time

28
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:33,345
or it will be problematic for you.

29
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:41,025
I'll take you back to your dorm.

30
00:03:43,225 --> 00:03:44,065
Let's go.

31
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:55,185
Stop scratching.

32
00:03:55,265 --> 00:03:56,705
It will only get worse.

33
00:03:56,785 --> 00:03:57,945
You will get rashes again.

34
00:03:58,025 --> 00:04:00,505
I'm not scratching. I just feel hot.

35
00:04:09,305 --> 00:04:10,185
Be a good girl.

36
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:15,385
Let's go.

37
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,465
What's so funny?

38
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:33,185
It's like you're walking your dog.

39
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:37,225
Yes.

40
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:39,345
I'm walking a little dog

41
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:41,625
who eats indiscriminately.

42
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:53,265
Jiaxu.

43
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:01,545
Why did you tell your colleagues today

44
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,785
that I am your friend?

45
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:04,625
In the past,

46
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:08,945
didn't you always tell other people

47
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:11,025
that I am your sister?

48
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,185
Do you really take me for your brother?

49
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:32,065
Sang Zhi.

50
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:49,945
It's nothing.

51
00:05:50,545 --> 00:05:51,385
Let's go.

52
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:04,785
Your birthday is coming up, right?

53
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,985
I guess I can't get you
a birthday cake then.

54
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:10,465
Otherwise, you'll get an allergic reaction

55
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:11,705
to the cream in it.

56
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:13,705
I…

57
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:17,625
Is he saying that he wants
to celebrate my birthday with me?

58
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:28,985
Our birthdays are pretty close.

59
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:35,105
How do you plan
to celebrate your birthday?

60
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:38,145
I'm not celebrating it.

61
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:39,865
Why?

62
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:43,665
It's pointless to celebrate it alone.

63
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:59,065
CHAPTER 15, CONFESSION

64
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:00,665
ATTRACTION

65
00:07:04,505 --> 00:07:06,105
What's the matter with Sangsang?

66
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:07,625
She hasn't texted us yet.

67
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:09,385
I wonder how her date went.

68
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:11,465
You're so nosy.

69
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:15,145
Do you have a cold?

70
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:16,865
No.

71
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:19,425
I have minor symptoms. This will fix it.

72
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:21,865
You don't understand.

73
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:23,745
It's more interesting

74
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:25,945
to observe other people's relationships.

75
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:27,185
Besides,

76
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:30,225
not all crushes reciprocate your feelings.

77
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:32,665
Moreover, this is their first date.

78
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:33,785
Thinking back on it,

79
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:36,425
Sangsang was afraid to even tell him
that she likes him.

80
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:37,505
She was so passive.

81
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:39,905
If I were in her shoes,

82
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:41,945
I would've rushed forward

83
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:42,865
and confessed to him.

84
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:44,065
Who cares?

85
00:07:44,145 --> 00:07:45,305
I would chase him first.

86
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:46,465
Sure.

87
00:07:46,545 --> 00:07:47,905
That only works on your boyfriend.

88
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:48,945
How would you know?

89
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:50,785
Let me ask you this then.

90
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:52,505
What would you do if you had a crush

91
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:53,425
on someone?

92
00:07:54,185 --> 00:07:55,305
You asked the wrong question.

93
00:07:55,385 --> 00:07:56,425
I don't have crushes.

94
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:57,945
I either like him or I don't.

95
00:07:58,025 --> 00:07:59,985
Okay, let me rephrase my question.

96
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:02,425
If you like someone,

97
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:03,865
would you chase him or not?

98
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:05,065
I wouldn't.

99
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:07,545
Why should I chase him

100
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,785
if he never gave me any hints?

101
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:10,665
Why wouldn't you chase him?

102
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:12,545
What if he has the same mindset as you

103
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,945
and neither of you make a move?

104
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:15,825
Neither of you will know anything.

105
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:17,545
I'm sure you'll regret it if he gets taken

106
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,545
by another girl.

107
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,145
If someone else wins him over,

108
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:22,305
that means he wasn't mine.

109
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:23,425
There's nothing to regret.

110
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:24,945
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

111
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:26,065
Let me ask you this.

112
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:28,025
If you like a guy,

113
00:08:28,505 --> 00:08:30,345
would you chase him or not?

114
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:32,345
Would you chase him or not?

115
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:35,305
I…

116
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:36,784
I don't know either.

117
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:38,705
What do you mean?

118
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,264
You asked the wrong person.

119
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:49,025
Who will join me in the library tomorrow?

120
00:08:49,105 --> 00:08:50,625
-Me.
-Me.

121
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,145
I'll ask Sangsang to join us tomorrow.

122
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:54,065
Okay.

123
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:00,025
We already finished supper for some time.

124
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:01,985
Why isn't Sangsang back yet?

125
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,905
Don't tell me she and her crush

126
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:06,225
went somewhere else.

127
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:07,625
I don't think so.

128
00:09:07,705 --> 00:09:10,305
Moreover, this is their first date.

129
00:09:11,545 --> 00:09:12,425
It's so late.

130
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:13,745
Why hasn't she returned yet?

131
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:15,185
Call her.

132
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,225
Sangsang, where are you?

133
00:09:22,305 --> 00:09:23,305
-It's late--
-Hello?

134
00:09:25,385 --> 00:09:26,305
Wait.

135
00:09:26,385 --> 00:09:27,905
What is up with the getup?

136
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:28,945
What's wrong?

137
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:30,185
I'm fine.

138
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:32,225
I had an allergic reaction to milk tea.

139
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,665
-Wait!
-What?

140
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:35,225
Why did you have milk tea?

141
00:09:35,905 --> 00:09:37,545
I only took a sip.

142
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:40,305
Look at the rashes! How are you okay?

143
00:09:40,385 --> 00:09:41,585
You went on a date

144
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,065
looking like that.

145
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:44,025
How did it go?

146
00:09:44,905 --> 00:09:46,065
How did it go?

147
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,505
Was it okay?

148
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,105
Wait!

149
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,545
Tell me how okay it was.

150
00:09:57,745 --> 00:09:59,185
I just

151
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:01,225
feel that…

152
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:02,745
Tell us.

153
00:10:03,785 --> 00:10:05,225
I feel that he likes me too.

154
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:06,865
Really?

155
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:08,625
Does he know that you like him too?

156
00:10:08,705 --> 00:10:09,625
No.

157
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:11,225
I've never expressed it.

158
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:15,105
I'm sure he knows that you like him

159
00:10:15,185 --> 00:10:16,785
if he saw you smile like this.

160
00:10:18,425 --> 00:10:19,545
But Sangsang,

161
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,945
you mustn't let him know

162
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:22,585
that you still like him going forward.

163
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:24,265
In a relationship,

164
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:26,465
you want to be the one being pursued.

165
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:30,505
But what if

166
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,545
he doesn't pursue me?

167
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,425
I don't think that will happen.

168
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:36,345
Trust me this time.

169
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:37,625
Trust her this time.

170
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:38,665
It will work.

171
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:39,625
It will be fine.

172
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,705
Just trust me this time.

173
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:41,625
I'm definitely right.

174
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:43,265
Okay then.

175
00:10:44,265 --> 00:10:45,465
I'll wait for him to pursue me.

176
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:46,745
That's right.

177
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:48,185
If he doesn't pursue me,

178
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:50,465
I'll pursue him.

179
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:53,465
That was a waste of my time.

180
00:10:55,265 --> 00:10:56,345
You're hopeless.

181
00:10:56,945 --> 00:10:58,825
Your face! Hurry and take your medicine.

182
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:00,025
It's so red.

183
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:02,505
Sangsang, you can do it.

184
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:07,865
MARCH 16TH, FRIDAY

185
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:10,545
HE CALLED ME HIS FRIEND

186
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,785
INSTEAD OF HIS LITTLE SISTER

187
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:16,545
Are you waiting at the entrance?

188
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:18,225
Okay.

189
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:19,145
I'll head there.

190
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:39,985
Sang Zhi.

191
00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:44,385
-Jiang Ming.
-Happy birthday.

192
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:46,225
Your birthday present.

193
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:51,865
Thank you, but I won't take it.

194
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:53,425
I already bought it.

195
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,985
I'll be in an awkward spot

196
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:56,025
if you don't accept it.

197
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:57,505
Just take it.

198
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:01,825
Okay then. Thank you.

199
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:03,785
Are you free later? Let's celebrate.

200
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:11,785
Hello.

201
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:17,425
I'll go then.

202
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:18,465
Have a happy birthday.

203
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:20,225
Thank you.

204
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:21,145
Bye.

205
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:49,585
I'll hold it for you.

206
00:13:02,145 --> 00:13:04,945
Is he the manly man you meant?

207
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,865
I told you already.

208
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:07,985
It's not him.

209
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:11,185
Is that so?

210
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:20,225
Take a look.

211
00:13:24,185 --> 00:13:25,705
Did you take a clear look?

212
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:26,745
What are you doing?

213
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,585
Look at me.

214
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:31,985
Do I look like

215
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:33,905
the man you described?

216
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,705
What is he talking about?

217
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,465
What does he mean?

218
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:43,345
Does he know already?

219
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,025
No, I cannot admit it.

220
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,065
If I do,

221
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:53,505
it would be as good as telling him

222
00:13:53,985 --> 00:13:55,545
that I've had a crush on him all along.

223
00:13:58,425 --> 00:13:59,305
No.

224
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:03,545
Is that so?

225
00:14:10,145 --> 00:14:12,185
Jiaxu, you should

226
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:14,145
stop mentioning him to me again.

227
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:16,945
You told me that he is a jerk, right?

228
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:18,465
That's why I stopped contacting him.

229
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:20,385
Now,

230
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:23,145
there isn't anyone I like.

231
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,545
You said that he is a ladies' man.

232
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:35,185
When did I…

233
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:42,265
Did I tell him that that day?

234
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:48,385
Yes, a little.

235
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:51,345
Do you even know what that term means?

236
00:14:52,665 --> 00:14:54,065
Jiaxu, don't you know what it means?

237
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,505
I told you.

238
00:14:57,585 --> 00:14:58,865
You should go online more often.

239
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:00,465
Our generation gap is becoming obvious.

240
00:15:01,185 --> 00:15:02,385
Tell me then.

241
00:15:02,465 --> 00:15:03,745
What does the term mean?

242
00:15:05,385 --> 00:15:06,705
It means

243
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:13,785
a guy with many female friends.

244
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:17,465
He's nice to all women.

245
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:20,625
And he doesn't have a girlfriend.

246
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:24,465
If a guy fulfills
one of these three criteria,

247
00:15:24,545 --> 00:15:26,385
does that make him a ladies' man?

248
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:28,385
Of course not. It must be all three.

249
00:15:35,305 --> 00:15:37,025
You're pretty good at framing people.

250
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:39,025
What did you say?

251
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:43,025
Did I say anything?

252
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:45,985
You did just now.

253
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,305
002 BOUND FOR HONGXI BUS TERMINAL

254
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:02,505
This is strange.

255
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:03,745
Why was the movie in theaters

256
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:04,945
for such a short time only?

257
00:16:06,185 --> 00:16:07,585
It's all because you were too busy.

258
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:12,225
Are you blaming me then?

259
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:15,825
No.

260
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:17,585
This is pretty good too.

261
00:16:17,665 --> 00:16:19,185
The theater downtown

262
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:21,025
has bigger screens and better acoustics.

263
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,625
And it's your birthday.

264
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:24,865
That makes it more meaningful.

265
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:50,025
Hold onto me

266
00:16:50,105 --> 00:16:51,065
so you don't fall.

267
00:17:09,184 --> 00:17:10,025
Hold tight.

268
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:06,905
You want to get a drink again, don't you?

269
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,425
You're not having any anyway.

270
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,745
Aren't you afraid of blushing again?

271
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,625
It was an allergic reaction,

272
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:16,865
not blushing.

273
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:20,105
-Hi. What would you like to order?
-Hello.

274
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:23,825
A girl with square glasses works here.

275
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:25,105
Is she here today?

276
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:28,505
-She's on the night shift today.
-I want lemon tea with boba.

277
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:29,425
Okay. Hot or iced?

278
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:30,345
Iced.

279
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:31,585
Hot.

280
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:33,425
Make it hot.

281
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:35,105
It's too cold for iced beverages.

282
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:36,665
I want it iced.

283
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:37,585
Okay.

284
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:38,905
It's stuffy in the theater.

285
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:41,825
Iced lemon tea with boba.

286
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:44,145
Fine, you can have it.

287
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,185
-Here.
-I'll scan your phone.

288
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:48,745
It will be cold in the theater later.

289
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:50,305
The air-conditioning is strong.

290
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:51,545
Don't drink too much.

291
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,945
Mind your own business.

292
00:18:54,505 --> 00:18:55,945
Do you find me annoying?

293
00:18:56,025 --> 00:18:57,225
No.

294
00:18:57,305 --> 00:18:58,665
Wasn't that what you meant?

295
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:00,385
No.

296
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,225
You should get used to it.

297
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:10,505
Thank you.

298
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:15,545
Have a good day.

299
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:24,385
Over there.

300
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:48,665
I'll hold it for you.

301
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:54,625
Do you want to drink it?

302
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:02,625
I can hold it myself.

303
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:04,425
You…

304
00:20:05,225 --> 00:20:07,185
You can drink your drink.

305
00:20:07,265 --> 00:20:08,705
Why did you touch my hand on purpose?

306
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,865
I can actually hold it myself.

307
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:24,225
Aren't you afraid of cold hands?

308
00:20:25,185 --> 00:20:26,825
Won't you get cold hands too?

309
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:30,625
You're right.

310
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,745
You can warm it up for me.

311
00:20:44,505 --> 00:20:45,545
I don't think

312
00:20:46,985 --> 00:20:47,825
it is

313
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:50,985
appropriate

314
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:52,985
for us to do that.

315
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,545
You're right.

316
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:06,745
After all, we haven't put a label on it.

317
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:09,945
Label?

318
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:32,785
Here you go.

319
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:33,745
Wipe your hands.

320
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,465
Hold it.

321
00:22:28,465 --> 00:22:29,385
-Zhizhi.
-Jiaxu.

322
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,065
You first.

323
00:22:34,865 --> 00:22:35,705
It's nothing.

324
00:22:35,785 --> 00:22:37,705
I just want to ask you
where we're going later.

325
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:39,665
Let's go

326
00:22:39,745 --> 00:22:40,785
to my place later.

327
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,865
My gift for you is at my place.

328
00:22:47,945 --> 00:22:49,145
And then,

329
00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:50,865
we can eat some cake together.

330
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:55,585
Jiaxu.

331
00:22:56,985 --> 00:22:58,425
Do you want me to go to your place?

332
00:23:02,905 --> 00:23:04,825
Didn't you tell me before

333
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:07,185
not to visit you at your place or office?

334
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:09,865
When did I say something like that?

335
00:23:12,385 --> 00:23:13,545
That time

336
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,385
when I brought you the peephole camera.

337
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:17,905
You pulled me off to one side and told me

338
00:23:17,985 --> 00:23:20,745
not to visit you
at your place or office again.

339
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:25,305
That time?

340
00:23:27,745 --> 00:23:29,025
It's like this.

341
00:23:29,105 --> 00:23:29,985
Jiang Ying

342
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:31,665
suddenly came to find me at my office.

343
00:23:32,225 --> 00:23:34,065
I was afraid she might hurt you

344
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:35,985
if she saw you.

345
00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:37,145
That's why…

346
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:40,745
But it's true.

347
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:42,225
I was too hasty that day.

348
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:43,865
I may not have made myself clear.

349
00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:53,545
So you've been upset lately

350
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:55,505
because of this?

351
00:24:04,905 --> 00:24:06,425
You're making it sound

352
00:24:07,305 --> 00:24:09,425
as if I'm a petty person.

353
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:12,985
No.

354
00:24:13,065 --> 00:24:15,225
This was indeed my fault.

355
00:24:15,785 --> 00:24:17,785
I should've explained it to you clearly.

356
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:19,985
Let me apologize to you.

357
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:31,225
I guess

358
00:24:31,785 --> 00:24:34,025
I was being a bit petty too.

359
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,585
I apologize to you too.

360
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,145
I'm sorry.

361
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,025
So now, the misunderstanding is resolved.

362
00:24:42,865 --> 00:24:43,745
Let's go eat cake.

363
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:46,745
Let's go.

364
00:25:07,865 --> 00:25:08,905
I prepared these for you.

365
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:11,785
For me?

366
00:25:15,225 --> 00:25:16,145
They are pretty nice.

367
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:20,785
Don't change into them yet.

368
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:23,705
You haven't been to the rooftop, right?

369
00:25:23,785 --> 00:25:24,745
Go and check it out.

370
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:09,145
Why are there two cakes?

371
00:26:10,185 --> 00:26:11,585
I made one of them.

372
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:12,825
It doesn't contain any dairy,

373
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:13,865
so you can eat it.

374
00:26:16,345 --> 00:26:17,825
It's this one, right?

375
00:26:19,585 --> 00:26:21,065
Can you tell?

376
00:26:21,145 --> 00:26:22,025
It's pretty obvious.

377
00:26:22,905 --> 00:26:25,225
So why did you also buy this one?

378
00:26:26,025 --> 00:26:27,785
I was afraid mine would turn out ugly,

379
00:26:27,865 --> 00:26:29,865
so I bought another one
to stick your candles in.

380
00:26:31,065 --> 00:26:32,665
It's not ugly. It looks great.

381
00:26:32,745 --> 00:26:33,625
Is that so?

382
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,665
Then pick one to stick your candles in.

383
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:40,305
Then I'll go

384
00:26:41,305 --> 00:26:42,225
with this one.

385
00:26:46,545 --> 00:26:47,505
Okay.

386
00:26:50,825 --> 00:26:52,225
How many candles do you want?

387
00:26:52,305 --> 00:26:53,585
One is enough.

388
00:26:53,665 --> 00:26:54,545
-This one--
-No way.

389
00:26:56,225 --> 00:26:57,265
You need 19 candles.

390
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,465
You need to know your own age.

391
00:27:03,905 --> 00:27:04,785
Jiaxu.

392
00:27:05,745 --> 00:27:07,505
If we have to know our own age

393
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:09,345
when we celebrate our birthdays,

394
00:27:09,425 --> 00:27:10,665
I don't think

395
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:12,745
there will be enough candles for you.

396
00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:19,945
You just have to mock my age every day.

397
00:27:47,945 --> 00:27:50,025
Happy birthday to you

398
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,945
Happy birthday to you

399
00:27:53,025 --> 00:27:56,025
Happy birthday to you

400
00:27:56,105 --> 00:27:57,945
Happy birthday to you

401
00:27:59,985 --> 00:28:02,025
This is the first birthday

402
00:28:02,105 --> 00:28:03,825
that I'm spending with Jiaxu.

403
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:05,465
I hope

404
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:07,345
there will be many more to come.

405
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,105
Make a wish.

406
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,825
Can I say it out loud?

407
00:28:16,985 --> 00:28:18,065
Do you want to?

408
00:28:36,225 --> 00:28:37,305
Happy birthday!

409
00:28:40,865 --> 00:28:41,705
Cut the cake.

410
00:28:43,145 --> 00:28:44,785
Make the first cut.

411
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:47,385
Okay.

412
00:29:04,505 --> 00:29:05,505
Here.

413
00:29:06,665 --> 00:29:08,745
Sang Zhi, you're officially 19 years old.

414
00:29:09,505 --> 00:29:11,265
Try it. See if it tastes good.

415
00:29:22,905 --> 00:29:23,825
Does it taste good?

416
00:29:24,785 --> 00:29:25,665
It's delicious.

417
00:29:25,745 --> 00:29:27,585
It's just the same as that one. Delicious.

418
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,505
Great.

419
00:29:31,745 --> 00:29:32,705
Your birthday present.

420
00:29:36,345 --> 00:29:37,705
You already made a cake for me.

421
00:29:37,785 --> 00:29:38,705
Do I get a gift too?

422
00:29:38,785 --> 00:29:41,545
The cake will only last for a while.

423
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:43,465
A present should last longer.

424
00:29:44,545 --> 00:29:45,705
Thank you, Jiaxu.

425
00:29:49,785 --> 00:29:52,225
You can open it when you get back.

426
00:29:54,785 --> 00:29:55,745
Okay.

427
00:29:58,185 --> 00:29:59,385
I'll try a slice too.

428
00:30:24,785 --> 00:30:26,305
Did someone give that to you?

429
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:27,985
Aren't you going to open it?

430
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:31,265
I'll do it when I get back.

431
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:35,625
Is that guy trying to pursue you?

432
00:30:38,425 --> 00:30:40,465
It looks like you're pretty popular.

433
00:30:48,105 --> 00:30:49,425
So can you tell me

434
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:51,545
what it takes

435
00:30:52,385 --> 00:30:53,465
for a guy to pursue you?

436
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:00,745
What? That's nonsense.

437
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:04,105
Then tell me.

438
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,585
What do you look for

439
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:08,345
in a guy?

440
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:17,505
He must be handsome,

441
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:21,425
have a good temper,

442
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:24,625
and…

443
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:30,625
He must be a head taller than me.

444
00:31:32,585 --> 00:31:33,865
Anything else?

445
00:31:34,985 --> 00:31:36,305
And…

446
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:39,305
He must have morals. That's all.

447
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:40,745
Is that all?

448
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:50,385
I think

449
00:31:51,465 --> 00:31:53,985
I check all these boxes.

450
00:31:57,025 --> 00:31:58,345
So I want to ask you something.

451
00:32:05,945 --> 00:32:07,185
Can I pursue you?

452
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:30,625
I…

453
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:33,705
I…

454
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:35,265
Jiaxu.

455
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,905
Does what you said

456
00:32:40,145 --> 00:32:43,745
mean the same as what I think it means?

457
00:32:45,145 --> 00:32:47,225
Is there another meaning to it?

458
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:53,145
But didn't you say

459
00:32:54,865 --> 00:32:56,025
that I'm a kiddo?

460
00:32:57,185 --> 00:32:58,505
You think I'm too young.

461
00:32:59,905 --> 00:33:01,625
That is just a nickname.

462
00:33:01,705 --> 00:33:02,945
If you like it,

463
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:04,985
I can call you that even when you're 80.

464
00:33:06,505 --> 00:33:07,345
Besides,

465
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:09,865
you call me your brother all the time.

466
00:33:09,945 --> 00:33:11,665
Do you really consider me your brother?

467
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:15,745
I do consider you my brother.

468
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:19,705
But

469
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:22,625
I don't want to be just your brother.

470
00:33:23,705 --> 00:33:25,305
I want to be your boyfriend.

471
00:33:48,265 --> 00:33:49,745
Say something.

472
00:33:50,305 --> 00:33:51,385
If you don't say something,

473
00:33:52,745 --> 00:33:54,225
I don't think I can breathe.

474
00:33:56,185 --> 00:33:57,305
You can't breathe?

475
00:33:58,705 --> 00:33:59,825
More like

476
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:02,025
I can't breathe.

477
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:07,585
Jiaxu.

478
00:34:08,824 --> 00:34:10,145
No one asks for permission

479
00:34:10,225 --> 00:34:12,425
before pursuing someone.

480
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:16,025
I have to make myself clear.

481
00:34:16,784 --> 00:34:18,824
Otherwise, what will I do
if you think I'm good to you

482
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:20,545
because I'm your elder?

483
00:34:21,744 --> 00:34:23,264
That's your business.

484
00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:25,025
It has nothing to do with me.

485
00:34:28,344 --> 00:34:29,705
Why don't you just tell me?

486
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:31,585
Tell me

487
00:34:32,065 --> 00:34:34,385
if you feel that way about me.

488
00:34:41,824 --> 00:34:42,665
No.

489
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:46,264
However,

490
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:49,304
what I mean is

491
00:34:50,185 --> 00:34:51,465
that I won't know

492
00:34:52,225 --> 00:34:54,025
if I feel that way about you

493
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,985
until you pursue me.

494
00:35:02,425 --> 00:35:03,265
Sure.

495
00:35:04,825 --> 00:35:07,585
Then can you give me a hint first?

496
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:10,025
How long do I need to pursue you?

497
00:35:11,105 --> 00:35:12,465
How can I give you a hint?

498
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:15,145
You make it sound
as if I'll say yes for sure.

499
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:17,305
How could you say no?

500
00:35:17,385 --> 00:35:18,625
You won't win me over.

501
00:35:18,705 --> 00:35:19,545
I'm tough to please.

502
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:22,025
Fine.

503
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:23,465
Then I'll drag it out.

504
00:35:24,025 --> 00:35:25,585
I'll pursue you for a decade or so.

505
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,905
But if you go and meet other guys,

506
00:35:30,985 --> 00:35:33,265
I'll complain to your parents.

507
00:35:35,705 --> 00:35:37,145
Why would you complain to them?

508
00:35:37,745 --> 00:35:39,265
Did you forget the time

509
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,265
when I met your teacher as your guardian?

510
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:44,545
That was ages ago.

511
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:45,665
Why are you bringing it up?

512
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,105
I'm a nostalgic person.

513
00:35:50,105 --> 00:35:50,945
By the way,

514
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:52,945
I forgot to tell you this.

515
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,385
You look pretty today.

516
00:36:03,385 --> 00:36:04,305
I know.

517
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:07,945
You dressed up to see me.

518
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:10,105
Then you say you have no feelings for me.

519
00:36:11,785 --> 00:36:13,785
Can't I make myself pretty on my birthday?

520
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:17,025
Did you think I dressed up for you?

521
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:18,225
Fine.

522
00:36:18,305 --> 00:36:20,025
I know you don't have feelings for me.

523
00:36:20,105 --> 00:36:21,385
Can't I imagine things

524
00:36:21,465 --> 00:36:22,465
and make myself happy?

525
00:36:22,545 --> 00:36:24,225
Then keep it to yourself.

526
00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:26,185
I want to say it out loud,

527
00:36:26,265 --> 00:36:27,385
so that you know.

528
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:42,545
By the way, Jiaxu.

529
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:45,785
You…

530
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:48,345
You didn't

531
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:49,785
confess to me today, right?

532
00:36:50,265 --> 00:36:51,305
You only asked me

533
00:36:51,385 --> 00:36:52,505
whether you could pursue me.

534
00:36:52,985 --> 00:36:54,745
I technically didn't reject you,

535
00:36:54,825 --> 00:36:55,785
right?

536
00:36:56,345 --> 00:36:57,745
So then,

537
00:36:57,825 --> 00:36:59,065
can I take the cake with me?

538
00:37:03,465 --> 00:37:04,345
Then

539
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:06,785
are you saying

540
00:37:07,505 --> 00:37:09,425
that I confess to you right now,

541
00:37:09,505 --> 00:37:11,265
-you will say yes?
-No.

542
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:12,665
Then you can't take it.

543
00:37:13,985 --> 00:37:15,425
You can keep this one.

544
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:17,745
I'll take this one, all right?

545
00:37:17,825 --> 00:37:18,705
No.

546
00:37:18,785 --> 00:37:20,825
Why are you so petty?

547
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,025
I'm just saying

548
00:37:22,105 --> 00:37:23,625
that you can pursue me a little more.

549
00:37:23,705 --> 00:37:24,825
It's not like I didn't agree…

550
00:37:29,505 --> 00:37:30,545
I…

551
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:31,945
You have to pursue me first

552
00:37:32,705 --> 00:37:33,825
before I can know

553
00:37:33,905 --> 00:37:35,865
if I feel that way about you.

554
00:37:36,665 --> 00:37:37,585
Do you understand?

555
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:39,985
Fine.

556
00:37:40,545 --> 00:37:41,945
That's okay.

557
00:37:42,025 --> 00:37:43,425
If you don't feel that way about me,

558
00:37:43,505 --> 00:37:45,025
I'll keep pursuing you.

559
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:48,745
Eat the cake.

560
00:37:52,225 --> 00:37:53,985
Sit down and enjoy it.

561
00:38:01,505 --> 00:38:03,265
You can take the cake with you.

562
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,865
Both of them?

563
00:38:11,225 --> 00:38:12,105
If you like it,

564
00:38:12,585 --> 00:38:14,425
I can make it for you every day.

565
00:38:20,585 --> 00:38:21,465
Sure.

566
00:38:41,505 --> 00:38:42,585
I'm back!

567
00:38:48,265 --> 00:38:49,425
Are you guys asleep?

568
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:51,945
It's pretty early.

569
00:39:00,225 --> 00:39:01,865
I'm back.

570
00:39:01,945 --> 00:39:05,505
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

571
00:39:05,585 --> 00:39:08,625
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

572
00:39:08,705 --> 00:39:12,065
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

573
00:39:12,145 --> 00:39:14,505
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

574
00:39:16,065 --> 00:39:17,225
-Make a wish!
-Make a wish!

575
00:39:17,305 --> 00:39:18,145
Hurry!

576
00:39:20,465 --> 00:39:21,385
Can I say it out loud?

577
00:39:21,465 --> 00:39:22,745
-No.
-No.

578
00:39:22,825 --> 00:39:23,985
Blow out the candle.

579
00:39:26,265 --> 00:39:27,625
Happy birthday!

580
00:39:27,705 --> 00:39:29,865
-You're another year older now.
-Put it down.

581
00:39:31,065 --> 00:39:32,585
Why do you have two cakes?

582
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:35,945
This one looks terrible!

583
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:36,865
No, it's not.

584
00:39:36,945 --> 00:39:38,345
I think it looks adorable.

585
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:41,665
Don't tell me

586
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:43,385
that your crush made it for you.

587
00:39:44,905 --> 00:39:46,025
Is it that obvious?

588
00:39:46,105 --> 00:39:47,545
Really?

589
00:39:48,505 --> 00:39:50,465
Did your date go well today?

590
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:52,705
Tell us about it.

591
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:55,105
I did have a good time.

592
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:57,185
If so,

593
00:39:57,265 --> 00:39:59,105
was there any substantial progress?

594
00:40:01,785 --> 00:40:02,705
Yes.

595
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:05,785
I knew it!

596
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:07,545
-Tell us!
-Spill it!

597
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:08,465
-Hurry.
-Tell us.

598
00:40:08,545 --> 00:40:09,425
I…

599
00:40:10,025 --> 00:40:10,865
What is it?

600
00:40:11,505 --> 00:40:12,705
I think you guys understand.

601
00:40:16,225 --> 00:40:17,545
I can't take it anymore. Come on.

602
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:18,625
He's so good at this.

603
00:40:41,545 --> 00:40:42,865
Put your back into it.

604
00:40:42,945 --> 00:40:44,185
Knead it repeatedly.

605
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:46,465
Yes, knead it into the shape of a circle,

606
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:47,665
then roll it out.

607
00:40:53,065 --> 00:40:53,945
No, not like that.

608
00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:55,625
Here, let me show you.

609
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:57,145
Roll it out forward.

610
00:40:57,905 --> 00:40:59,105
When you're almost to the end,

611
00:40:59,185 --> 00:41:00,185
you have to roll it back.

612
00:41:00,265 --> 00:41:01,825
You can't just roll in one direction.

613
00:41:01,905 --> 00:41:03,225
-Got it?
-Okay, let me try.

614
00:41:08,105 --> 00:41:09,545
You refused to learn this

615
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:10,785
when you worked at my shop

616
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,505
when you were in 12th grade.

617
00:41:12,585 --> 00:41:14,425
Now you're suddenly back to learn it.

618
00:41:14,985 --> 00:41:16,225
Are you seeing someone?

619
00:41:19,985 --> 00:41:20,945
Am I right?

620
00:41:23,505 --> 00:41:24,545
You brat.

621
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:27,345
Listen.

622
00:41:28,145 --> 00:41:29,545
A cake that you put your heart into

623
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:30,905
will taste different.

624
00:41:32,465 --> 00:41:33,425
Remember that.

625
00:41:34,105 --> 00:41:35,585
Okay, flatten it out.

626
00:41:36,265 --> 00:41:37,745
That's right. Forward and backward.

627
00:41:37,825 --> 00:41:39,625
Be careful. That's it.

628
00:41:46,665 --> 00:41:48,025
Why is it cracked?

629
00:41:48,585 --> 00:41:49,705
Did I bake it for too long?

630
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:51,705
Listen.

631
00:41:52,585 --> 00:41:53,545
Don't be discouraged.

632
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:55,105
It's a tough one to make.

633
00:41:55,185 --> 00:41:56,345
You should've listened to me

634
00:41:56,425 --> 00:41:58,105
and made something simpler.

635
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:00,065
It's fine. I'll try again.
