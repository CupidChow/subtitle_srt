ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

2
00:02:03,105 --> 00:02:04,185
Is this okay?

3
00:02:05,185 --> 00:02:06,025
Yes.

4
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:07,585
Thank you.

5
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,105
Jiaxu, do you want some hangover soup?

6
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:12,865
I don't drink alcohol.

7
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:13,865
I don't need it.

8
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:16,425
It's late. You should go to bed.

9
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:18,185
I'll sleep after taking a shower.

10
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:21,025
Right, Jiaxu.

11
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,345
You need a towel

12
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:26,225
and other things.

13
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:25,665
Though your dad's condition is stable,

14
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:27,625
we must try to avoid repeated infections.

15
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:30,145
He may be sent to the ICU again
at any time.

16
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:35,585
JIANG YING: CAN YOU SHOW ME
A PICTURE OF YOU IN A GRADUATION GOWN?

17
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:37,145
SORRY, THAT IS AN UNREASONABLE REQUEST

18
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:39,545
WHY AREN'T YOU REPLYING? ARE YOU BUSY?

19
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:49,065
Why are you still up?

20
00:03:52,785 --> 00:03:54,705
Jiaxu, why are you still awake?

21
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:56,505
I…

22
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:58,665
I'm not used to this bed.

23
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,345
I can't sleep.

24
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:03,905
Then why don't I wake my brother up?

25
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:07,065
You can sleep on the sofa in his room.

26
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:08,625
You liked resting on that sofa

27
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:10,185
during our tutoring sessions, right?

28
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:11,945
It's fine.

29
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:13,305
I'll go to sleep soon.

30
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:17,145
It's late now.

31
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:18,305
You should go to bed.

32
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,145
Are you upset?

33
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:30,905
That's not it.

34
00:04:30,985 --> 00:04:31,985
Why would I be?

35
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:42,865
If you're upset,

36
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:44,425
you can tell me about it.

37
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,385
You might feel better afterward.

38
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,305
I won't tell anyone about it.

39
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:55,545
Not even my brother.

40
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:05,945
It's fine

41
00:05:06,025 --> 00:05:07,705
if you don't want to talk about it.

42
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:12,345
I can just keep you company for a while.

43
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:23,265
Let me tell you a secret.

44
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:28,105
I have

45
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:31,145
plenty of debtors out there.

46
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:38,825
Are you in huge debt?

47
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:40,865
It isn't about money.

48
00:06:45,065 --> 00:06:46,865
Well, I guess it is about money.

49
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:51,825
How much do you owe?

50
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:53,905
Is it a huge sum?

51
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:57,905
How do I put it?

52
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:02,065
Jiaxu.

53
00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:04,585
Don't panic.

54
00:07:05,185 --> 00:07:06,505
Once I grow up

55
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:07,825
and start making money,

56
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:09,385
I'll help you pay it off.

57
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:19,665
I'm not kidding.

58
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:20,825
I'm serious.

59
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:33,945
Sang Zhi.

60
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:35,905
Actually,

61
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,625
these aren't my debts.

62
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:39,985
You don't need to help me repay them.

63
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:42,225
So Sang Zhi,

64
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:43,545
after you start earning money,

65
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:46,465
buy some beautiful dresses for yourself.

66
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:30,345
Was Jiaxu pretending to be tough?

67
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,904
I've never seen him like this before.

68
00:09:31,345 --> 00:09:32,945
Make a lot of money

69
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:34,625
and help him pay off his debts.

70
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:37,185
JIAXU

71
00:13:41,665 --> 00:13:43,905
I'm taking a morning flight back to Yihe.

72
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:45,745
Please tell your parents for me.

73
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:48,185
Also, you should study hard.

74
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,385
Remember to update me with your grades.

75
00:14:09,385 --> 00:14:10,945
Don't forget the promise

76
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:12,025
you made to me.

77
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:16,825
Does she mean the gifts?

78
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:44,145
CHAPTER SEVEN, PROMISE

79
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:46,225
THE MOST IMPORTANT LITTLE THINGS

80
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:49,305
All of you are in 12th Grade now.

81
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:51,265
Besides the CAP,

82
00:14:51,345 --> 00:14:53,145
you also need to be ready for the NCEE.

83
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,745
This handbook

84
00:14:56,505 --> 00:14:58,985
contains the minimum admission scores

85
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,785
for the nation's top schools

86
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:04,305
and the corresponding
admission ratio of students

87
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:06,545
from our school each year.

88
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:11,385
You can compare your ranking

89
00:15:11,465 --> 00:15:13,305
with this handbook

90
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:15,225
and make an estimation

91
00:15:15,785 --> 00:15:17,305
of the colleges you can select.

92
00:15:18,345 --> 00:15:20,465
You have to work hard for your future,

93
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:21,865
move toward your goal,

94
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:23,985
and enter the university of your dreams.

95
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:26,505
-This is a critical moment.
-To get into Yihe University,

96
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:29,585
I think I need to work harder.

My dream is to get into Yihe University.

101

Twelfth place?

110
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,585
Keep up the good work.

111
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:47,825
Your gift is on the way.

You really did it.

116
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:00,345
I've ordered your gift.

117
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,184
YIHE CITY

118
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:37,985
I must work harder

119
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,225
and get closer

120
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:41,665
to my dream.

121
00:18:02,145 --> 00:18:03,665
Were you rejected again?

122
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:09,105
Fine, I'll stop talking.

123
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:10,385
I'll stop breaking your heart.

124
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:14,705
What did you say?

125
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:17,985
Duan Jiaxu got himself a girlfriend?

126
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:21,025
Really?

127
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:25,505
Isn't that great? He has finally done it.

128
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,185
Do you have a picture of her?

129
00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:29,665
Show me what she looks like.

130
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:32,425
We can hold a celebration for him.

131
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:34,025
I'll hang up now. I'm having supper.

132
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:34,945
Bye.

133
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,305
Sang Yan.

134
00:18:41,065 --> 00:18:42,705
Do you want noodles? I'll get you a bowl.

135
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,345
Does Jiaxu have a girlfriend now?

136
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,025
I guess so.

137
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:48,425
I just heard it from Qian Fei.

138
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,905
Hey, I got you a bowl.

139
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:38,545
JIAXU, I HEARD YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND

140
00:19:49,585 --> 00:19:50,825
It must be fake.

141
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:56,625
It doesn't sound true.

142
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,145
It's possible that he lied to Sang Yan.

143
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:04,945
When you find one,

144
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:08,265
can you show her to me first?

145
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:09,745
Sure.

146
00:20:09,825 --> 00:20:11,985
I'll show you when I find one.

147
00:20:13,985 --> 00:20:14,945
I'll remember that.

148
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:20,585
JIAXU

149
00:20:22,385 --> 00:20:23,785
You promised me.

150
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:27,025
JIAXU

151
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,585
Should I ask him in person?

152
00:21:35,785 --> 00:21:36,905
Hello?

153
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:37,825
Hello, Sang Zhi?

154
00:21:38,385 --> 00:21:40,065
Why didn't you go to cram school?

155
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:40,985
Look at the time.

156
00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:44,225
I'm in Yihe.

157
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:45,665
Where?

158
00:21:45,745 --> 00:21:46,705
Yihe.

159
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:51,545
Why did you go there?

160
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,745
My online boyfriend told me to come.

161
00:21:56,745 --> 00:21:57,585
You…

162
00:21:58,065 --> 00:21:59,625
Which part of Yihe are you in right now?

163
00:22:01,305 --> 00:22:02,505
The airport.

164
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:05,105
Stay there.

165
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:07,465
I'll tell Duan Jiaxu to pick you up.

166
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:08,865
Listen up.

167
00:22:09,425 --> 00:22:12,345
If you go to see
your so-called online boyfriend,

168
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:14,545
you'll be in big trouble
when you get back.

169
00:22:31,905 --> 00:22:32,945
Hello, Dad?

170
00:22:33,025 --> 00:22:34,225
Have you found her?

171
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:35,185
Yes.

172
00:22:36,265 --> 00:22:37,345
Where is she?

173
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,545
Hello?

174
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:48,945
Zhizhi.

175
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:51,145
Zhizhi, didn't you promise us

176
00:22:51,225 --> 00:22:52,545
that you would stay away

177
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:53,465
from that guy online?

178
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:55,905
Stop it. Just stop.

179
00:22:55,985 --> 00:22:57,825
Zhizhi.

180
00:22:58,385 --> 00:23:00,305
Don't run around in the airport.

181
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:01,705
Safety first, okay?

182
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:03,265
It's best to stay in areas

183
00:23:03,345 --> 00:23:05,785
with airport staff and police around.

184
00:23:05,865 --> 00:23:07,665
If someone tries to approach you,

185
00:23:07,745 --> 00:23:08,945
you must go to the police.

186
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:09,905
Do you understand?

187
00:23:10,665 --> 00:23:13,945
By the way, Sang Yan
will tell Duan Jiaxu to pick you up.

188
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,185
Be nice, okay?

189
00:23:20,185 --> 00:23:22,905
Mom, Jiaxu is calling me.

190
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,265
Okay. Be careful.

191
00:23:34,105 --> 00:23:35,025
Hello?

192
00:23:35,105 --> 00:23:36,145
Where are you?

193
00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:39,505
Exit 18.

194
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:41,225
Okay.

195
00:23:53,185 --> 00:23:54,385
Sang Zhi!

196
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:58,105
Jiaxu.

197
00:24:02,185 --> 00:24:03,265
Have you found her?

198
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:40,385
Didn't you promise me

199
00:24:41,585 --> 00:24:42,705
that you would study hard

200
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:44,065
and wouldn't make others worry?

201
00:24:46,025 --> 00:24:47,345
Online boyfriend?

202
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:52,345
Have you forgotten what I told you before?

203
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,705
You're all grown up now, are you?

204
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:57,425
How dare you travel so far by yourself?

205
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:01,665
Who is she?

206
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:05,145
Is she your girlfriend?

207
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:10,745
You promised to tell me first.

208
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:14,025
Why didn't you keep your promise?

209
00:25:17,145 --> 00:25:18,345
Say something.

210
00:25:21,745 --> 00:25:22,625
Jiaxu.

211
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:24,705
Don't speak so harshly to her.

212
00:25:51,105 --> 00:25:52,465
Did he tell you to come?

213
00:25:58,545 --> 00:25:59,745
Have you met him?

214
00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:06,145
He doesn't like me.

215
00:26:11,225 --> 00:26:12,785
He said that I'm too young.

216
00:26:22,385 --> 00:26:23,385
Has he left?

217
00:26:31,185 --> 00:26:32,385
Sang Zhi.

218
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,865
He did the right thing.

219
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,305
You're too young right now.

220
00:26:36,385 --> 00:26:37,865
This isn't right. Got it?

221
00:26:39,705 --> 00:26:41,305
But I will grow up.

222
00:26:41,385 --> 00:26:43,425
Then let's wait until you grow up.

223
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:44,945
But when I grow up,

224
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:46,465
he'll fall for someone else.

225
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:57,545
That's fine.

226
00:26:59,825 --> 00:27:01,505
Sang Zhi, when you grow up,

227
00:27:03,345 --> 00:27:04,545
you will meet someone better.

228
00:27:05,985 --> 00:27:07,185
I guess this lady

229
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:10,745
is your "someone better."

230
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:27,745
Sorry.

231
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:31,945
Sorry for troubling you.

232
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:34,505
I won't do this again.

233
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:40,305
You're no trouble.

234
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:54,425
Wipe your tears.

235
00:27:56,305 --> 00:27:58,105
We were worried about you.

236
00:27:58,905 --> 00:28:01,465
We were scared
that something might happen to you.

237
00:28:02,745 --> 00:28:04,025
But now,

238
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:05,985
it's good that you realize your mistake.

239
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:10,625
Wash up in the restroom.

240
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:12,905
I'll take you out to lunch.

241
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:13,945
I don't feel like going.

242
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:15,825
I want to go home.

243
00:28:15,905 --> 00:28:17,345
Even so, you need to eat first.

244
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:19,825
Give me your ID card.

245
00:28:19,905 --> 00:28:21,345
I'll get a plane ticket for you.

246
00:28:21,425 --> 00:28:24,305
Jiaxu, why don't I take her?

247
00:28:25,545 --> 00:28:26,785
It's fine, miss.

248
00:28:26,865 --> 00:28:28,145
I can go by myself.

249
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,305
I can take care of myself.

250
00:28:35,785 --> 00:28:36,945
Here, get up.

251
00:28:39,705 --> 00:28:41,385
The restroom is over there.

252
00:28:41,465 --> 00:28:42,585
Go and wash your face.

253
00:28:43,985 --> 00:28:45,665
I'll go get lunch with you

254
00:28:45,745 --> 00:28:46,985
after buying your plane ticket.

255
00:28:51,905 --> 00:28:52,825
Go now.

256
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:56,305
We'll have a nice lunch.

257
00:29:06,865 --> 00:29:08,185
The kiddo is all grown up.

258
00:29:49,585 --> 00:29:50,705
So different from before.

259
00:29:54,065 --> 00:29:55,945
That's how young girls are.

260
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:57,305
They'll grow up eventually.

261
00:29:57,385 --> 00:29:58,545
Don't be too worried.

262
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,745
Why did you take it off? Put it on.

263
00:31:32,825 --> 00:31:33,785
I don't need it.

264
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:36,905
Where's the lady?

265
00:31:38,185 --> 00:31:39,505
She's busy and had to leave.

266
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:47,985
Was I too harsh earlier?

267
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,225
Kids are forgetful indeed.

268
00:31:58,185 --> 00:31:59,505
You're treating me like a stranger

269
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,065
after a few months away.

270
00:32:02,225 --> 00:32:03,745
I'm pretty heartbroken.

271
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:08,225
How much was the plane ticket?

272
00:32:10,905 --> 00:32:11,905
It didn't cost a lot.

273
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:14,025
The flight is at 1:10 p.m.

274
00:32:14,105 --> 00:32:15,225
We still have some time.

275
00:32:15,305 --> 00:32:16,505
I'll take you to eat something.

276
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:19,545
Let's go.

277
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:29,705
Eat something.

278
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:44,785
Are you sick?

279
00:32:46,545 --> 00:32:48,625
No, it's just a cold.

280
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:54,185
I'm fine.

281
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:55,465
Are you really not eating?

282
00:33:07,545 --> 00:33:08,745
It's a gift for you.

283
00:33:09,585 --> 00:33:10,625
For me?

284
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:19,025
Can I open it?

285
00:33:29,545 --> 00:33:31,185
So you still remember me.

286
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:34,665
I love your gift.

287
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:36,465
Thank you.

288
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:47,065
I'm going to take this.

289
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:54,225
I've picked her up.

290
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,545
All right.

291
00:34:55,545 --> 00:34:58,105
Listen to your parents after you get home.

292
00:34:58,865 --> 00:35:01,185
Don't let this affect your studies.

293
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:03,225
Okay?

294
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:08,425
You don't need to tell me anymore.

295
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:14,705
What?

296
00:35:17,225 --> 00:35:18,905
You don't need to tell me anymore

297
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:21,985
if you get a girlfriend.

298
00:35:55,225 --> 00:35:57,225
Isn't this the bear plushie I got for you?

299
00:36:01,985 --> 00:36:03,065
It's for you.

300
00:36:06,825 --> 00:36:07,745
I wish you

301
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:09,745
happiness every day.

302
00:36:12,265 --> 00:36:14,065
You must stay happy too.

303
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:20,785
I'm going now.

304
00:36:20,865 --> 00:36:21,985
Bye.

305
00:36:43,145 --> 00:36:43,985
Go now.

306
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:45,945
Little demon.

307
00:39:05,585 --> 00:39:07,465
Forget it. I'll spare you this time.

308
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:08,385
Let's go home.

309
00:39:09,785 --> 00:39:12,185
Mom already told your private tutor
to take the day off.

310
00:39:12,665 --> 00:39:14,425
But I can't help you

311
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:16,465
if Mom and Dad scold you later.

312
00:39:26,225 --> 00:39:27,265
If so…

313
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:31,265
If so…

314
00:39:34,025 --> 00:39:35,465
How about this?

315
00:39:35,545 --> 00:39:37,745
I'll buy you a crispy taro-crusted duck.

316
00:39:39,705 --> 00:39:40,545
But…

317
00:39:41,585 --> 00:39:43,665
All right now.

318
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:47,945
It's just heartbreak.

319
00:39:48,025 --> 00:39:49,545
It's not a big deal.

320
00:39:54,345 --> 00:39:56,785
I'll buy you the last several volumes

321
00:39:56,865 --> 00:39:57,985
of the comic you read, okay?

322
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:02,145
How about this then?

323
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:05,065
I'll find someone to beat him up, okay?

324
00:40:07,665 --> 00:40:08,905
Not that either?

325
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:12,985
Good girl. I'm here for you.

326
00:40:13,065 --> 00:40:14,785
I'm here for you.

327
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:16,505
Don't cry, okay?

328
00:40:25,065 --> 00:40:26,025
It's okay.

329
00:40:42,825 --> 00:40:43,665
You're back.

330
00:40:58,225 --> 00:41:00,225
What's wrong? Are you cold?

331
00:41:00,305 --> 00:41:01,665
Put on something thicker.

332
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:02,785
Wash up and come to dinner.

333
00:41:04,985 --> 00:41:06,505
Go and get changed first.

334
00:41:08,225 --> 00:41:09,185
It will be fine.

335
00:42:17,345 --> 00:42:18,705
I know you're heartbroken.

336
00:42:19,585 --> 00:42:20,785
But I need to remind you

337
00:42:20,865 --> 00:42:22,505
of the severity of the situation.

338
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:24,585
Do you know how worried Mom and Dad were?

339
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:33,705
All right, little demon.

340
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:35,945
At your age, you should study hard.

341
00:42:36,025 --> 00:42:37,945
Do not get into puppy love.

342
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:39,465
Besides,

343
00:42:39,545 --> 00:42:41,345
you stole an ID card
to buy a plane ticket.

344
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,545
What if you had encountered a bad guy?

345
00:42:47,105 --> 00:42:48,825
Stop playing dead. Give me a nod.

346
00:42:58,585 --> 00:43:00,425
There was no online boyfriend.

347
00:43:01,905 --> 00:43:03,465
I just wanted to ask him

348
00:43:04,785 --> 00:43:05,945
whether he remembered

349
00:43:07,025 --> 00:43:08,425
our promise.
