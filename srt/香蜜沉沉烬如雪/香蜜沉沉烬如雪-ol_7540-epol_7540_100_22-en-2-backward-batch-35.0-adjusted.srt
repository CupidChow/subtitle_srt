"Ashes of Love"

None
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 22"

None
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,040
It was probably Duke Nanping

None
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,579
who poisoned my food

None
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,579
and colluded with Liangguo people
in ambushing me before.

None
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,790
How ambitious he is!

None
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,920
I must get back to get rid of him soon.

None
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Why does my heart beat so fast

None
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,780
and feel so sore?

None
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,120
I’ve never felt like this before.

None
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,360
It was urgent, so I offended you.

None
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,320
Since we were separated by the veil,
you didn’t offend me.

None
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,920
Never mind.

None

" Dongting Lake"

None
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,040
My Lord. My Lord.

None
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:44,120
Yong, Lian, how’ve you been?

None
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:45,800
My Lord, please behave yourself.

None
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,320
Master has been waiting for you for a long time.

None
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,660
You’re so boring and monotonous.

None
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,560
"Yunmeng Lake "

None
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,180
Master, how have you been doing recently?

None
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,040
You haven’t been back since Rat Fairy died.

None
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,740
If I didn’t summon you today,

None
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,500
you would never

None
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,020
step in Yunmeng Lake again, right?

None
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,260
I don’t dare.

None
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,020
You don’t dare?

None
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,240
Maybe you don’t dare,

None
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,660
but you have such an idea.

None
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,660
My sincerity to you is visible.

None
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,040
I know the death of Rat Fairy
was a heavy blow to you,

None
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,860
but since he was dead,

None
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,400
it’s useless to dwell on the past.

None
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,580
You should look ahead

None
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,960
and let it go.

None
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,580
What’s your order, Master?

None
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,220
Get up.

None
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,680
I got the message that

None
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,360
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow appeared again.

None
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,180
Go to snatch it

None
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,860
and kill Xu Feng for me.

None
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,190
Oh, my Gosh!

None
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,640
My adopted mother always does whatever she likes.

None
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,740
It sounds like Spirit-Vanishing Arrow

None
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,960
is just a knife in her kitchen

None
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,860
and Xu Feng is a chick raised by her.

None
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,680
Mom, I’m afraid I can’t do it.

None
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,760
Rat Fairy and I got help from outside or in last time,

None
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,180
but we still failed to kill Xu Feng

None
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,160
and Rat Fairy even died because of this.

None
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,620
I really don’t have confidence

None
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,460
that I can get rid of Xu Feng alone.

None
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,700
He’s a mortal now

None
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,280
and even weaker than he was during nirvana.

None
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,260
Since the great cause is unachieved,

None
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,010
someone must die for it.

None
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,340
How can you give it up just for his death?

None
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,980
Did you just regard Rat Fairy

None
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,920
as a pawn?

None
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,140
I know you don’t agree with my behavior,

None
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,000
but we have no way to back down.

None
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,740
Rat Fairy was loyal to me

None
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,960
and masterminded with painstaking effort
in Heaven Realm for so many years

None
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,520
so as to collect a lot of precious information for us.

None
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,300
If we give up halfway,

None
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,140
we’ll fail him.

None
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,580
Before Rat Fairy died for justice,

None
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,580
he repeatedly asked me to tell you

None
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,500
haste makes waste.

None
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,760
Water Immortal saved you

None
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,720
from Heavenly Empress despite everything

None
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,360
and offered you this place to live.

None
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,840
You just mentioned that

None
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,700
it is useless to

None
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,400
dwell on the past.

None
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,740
Why do you

None
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,120
get yourself into endless hatred

None
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,120
and implicate more innocent people?

None
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,120
Cut it out.

None
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Stop telling me

None
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,740
an eye for an eye

None
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,180
will only make the whole world blind.

None
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,110
In such a big world,

None
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,030
I may still exist, but I have ceased to live,

None
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,440
and have nowhere to make my home.

None
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Have you ever tried to

None
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,360
live on the charity and compassion of others?

None
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,500
You saved me,

None
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,500
so I’ll die for you without any hesitation.

None
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,500
After Rat Fairy died,

None
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,000
I’ll still pledge allegiance to you.

None
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,700
If I die,

None
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,520
I wonder who will pledge allegiance to you.

None
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,780
Yan You, I can only depend on you.

None
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,440
You must take care of yourself
when dealing with Xu Feng.

None
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,620
I can’t afford to lose you.

None
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,600
Li.

None
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,160
Mom.

None
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,860
Mom.

None
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,800
I have seen you.
Come out.

None
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,760
Little boy, what species are you?

None
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,800
I’m a carp elf.

None
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,800
I don’t believe you.

None
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,480
She won’t adopt a real carp.

None
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,160
White loach, who are you?

None
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,000
I’m another Li.

None
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,040
But we are the same and both of us are false.

None
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,660
Little loach, are you happy here?

None
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,000
I have plenty to eat and drink

None
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,320
and nice new clothes to wear here.

None
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,940
Surely I’m happy.

None
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,940
But I prefer rolling in the mud puddle.

None
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,380
I can’t let her go on anymore.

None
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,860
I promise to send you back to the mud puddle.

None
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,390
Where is he?

None
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,100
I can’t find him anywhere.

None
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,320
Was he captured by King of Gu City?

None
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,640
It’s forbidden to get in and out of
the sleeping chamber of His Majesty.

None
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,020
Even if Princess Sui He

None
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,080
wants to borrow something,

None
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,340
you must report it to me first. Got it?

None
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:47,780
Yes.

None
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,640
I didn’t expect that you are
not only good at martial arts

None
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,120
but also good at cooking.

None
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,260
Great.

None
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,220
Medical fees.

None
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,980
Claw me and I’ll claw thee.

None
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,620
You saved me, but I was
unable to repay your kindness,

None
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,940
so I cooked a simple meal
to express my gratitude to you.

None
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,120
Here. I don’t need it.

None
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,300
Although you’re my patient,

None
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,140
I’ve regarded you as my friend.

None
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,580
I grew up in Saint Doctors' Family
and seclude myself from the world.

None
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,960
I’m really glad to meet you.

None
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,200
If you heal me,

None
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,400
I’ll achieve one of your dreams someday.

None
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,940
How can a bandit achieve my dream?

None
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,020
Thank you,

None
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,020
but you may not achieve my dream.

None
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,300
If you have a dream,

None
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,060
maybe I can help you achieve it.

None
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,540
That’s a deal.

None
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,340
You don’t stand on ceremony at all.

None
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,020
You get a promise from me then.

None
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
However, I’m sure

None
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,760
we’ll never see each other again in the future.

None
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,940
You bandits lead a bloody life.

None
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,460
Although I don’t have to fight,

None
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,340
I’m on tenterhooks every day.

None
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,040
In fact, we have the same destination.

None
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,220
I’m just taking one day at a time.

None
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,400
Although I have learned medicine for 15 years

None
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,400
and been proficient in medical science and pharmacology,

None
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,200
you’re actually my first patient.

None
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,080
Isn’t that funny?

None
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,580
As Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family,

None
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,580
the meaning of my life

None
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,500
is to prepare Elixir of Life for King Yi.

None
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,500
If I fail,

None
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,040
when King Yi.

None
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,160
passes away,

None
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,560
it’s also time for me to die.

None
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,560
When King Yi is alive,

None
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,860
I have to decoct herbal medicine for him

None
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,860
and when he dies,

None
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,420
I’ll be buried with his coffin

None
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,360
in the imperial mausoleum as a burial object

None
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,000
to expiate his sins with my holy and pure soul.

None
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,940
But I heard that King Yi

None
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,920
fights battles everywhere
and has killed many people.

None
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,160
I guess he may die young as well.

None
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,860
So I can’t live for long.

None
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,620
Here.

None
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,120
Crow, I substitute wine with tea
and propose a toast to you.

None
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,180
Thank you

None
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,660
for letting me know

None
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,720
the meaning of being alive

None
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,440
in my humble and insignificant life for the first time.

None
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,540
Although I don’t know
whether you can be cured or not,

None
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,640
you let me know

None
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,580
how wonderful it is to help someone

None
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,980
when I’m still alive.

None
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,320
I have a poor memory.

None
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,980
I have forgotten that you can’t hear me.

None
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,640
Anyway, Crow,

None
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,720
thank you.

None
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,920
What kind of person are you?

None
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,860
Jin Mi.

None
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,240
I’m afraid that Duke Nanping has plotted for long.

None
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,240
If I return to Palace of King Yi now,
I may be in danger.

None
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,800
It’s better to go to Beiyuan Mountain Villa first.

None
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,020
It is the place where my trusted troops are stationed,

None
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,510
so it is the safest.

None
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,020
I can have a further plan after reaching there.

None
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,000
Crow.

None
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,300
Crow.

None
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Crow.

None
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,980
Crow.

None
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,340
How come

None
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,200
he vanished like the night drew?

None
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,980
Dear Madam, I’ve been sick
for more than one month

None
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,760
and thanks to your careful attention,

None
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,250
I was cured yesterday.

None
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,670
Something happened in my family,

None
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,400
so I have to leave without saying goodbye.
Please forgive me.

None
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,800
We met by chance,
but anyway we have different paths.

None
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,880
I never make a promise easily,

None
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,480
but since I do,
I’ll keep it by any means.

None
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,720
Take care of yourself.
Goodbye.

None
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,140
You left the same night as soon as you were cured.

None
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,580
You didn’t even have time to say goodbye to me

None
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,260
in person?

None
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,540
I won’t charge you for medical fees.

None
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,580
Peony.

None
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,280
Peony?

None
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,460
Peony.

None
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,020
I’ve planted some carrots.

None
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,440
Would you like some?

None
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,800
Mr. Hu,

None
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
what’s wrong with you today?

None
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,600
Do you think

None
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,280
you live too long

None
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,980
and want to die?

None
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,840
Peony, you do lack a sense of romance.

None
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,760
It’s romantic to die for a beauty.

None
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,620
Moon Immortal really wants to be fertilizer.

None
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,260
Someone,

None
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,940
put him in the rabbit house.

None
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,660
Yes.

None
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,320
No.

None
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,120
No. No.

None
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,100
You…

None
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,220
I won’t go in.
I won’t go in.

None
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,320
Let me out.
Let me out.

None
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,460
Help!

None
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,680
Chief Peony, I was wrong.

None
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,240
Let me out.

None
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,240
Let me out.

None
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,280
Chief Peony, I was wrong.

None
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,080
Let me out.
Let me out.

None
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,020
Let me out.
Let me out.

None
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,960
Hong Hong.

None
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,880
Don’t cry.

None
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,920
It was all your fault.

None
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,920
Old fox,

None
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,080
why don’t you make fun of

None
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,760
those fair children in the heaven

None
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,060
but play tricks on me

None
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,720
in Floral Realm?

None
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,920
Jin Mi and Xu Feng both are absent,

None
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,460
so I’m really bored.

None
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,700
You’re bored, so you played tricks on me?

None
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,320
How dare you offend Chief Peony? Chief…

None
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,000
Chief…

None
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,160
How dare you make fun of Chief Peony?

None
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,320
You’re so bold. You…

None
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,960
There is only one man

None
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,840
in Floral Realm.

None
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,160
I could only tie the red rope to you.

None
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,960
Did you just see

None
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,620
how furious those rabbits were?

None
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,460
They came at me.

None
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,160
You know,

None
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,840
a rabbit almost peeled me.

None
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,340
Please let me pass.

None
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,060
A rabbit almost peeled me

None
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,940
just now.

None
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,320
Fortunately, I have a weapon with me.

None
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,520
Mr. Hu, you don’t dare to provoke Chief Peony.

None
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,860
How about…

None
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,580
Lian Qiao?

None
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,420
Are, are you kidding me?

None
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,840
I’m a great-great-great-great-grandfather

None
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,200
of the great-great-great-great-grandfather of Lian Qiao.

None
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,480
No way.

None
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,300
Stop kidding.

None
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,140
A usually love story

None
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,860
must be usual

None
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,240
or it won’t be impressive.

None
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,920
Am I right?

None
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,860
You have become dull

None
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,500
because of playing matchmaker all the time.

None
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,180
I’m leaving.

None
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,400
Jin Mi, Xu Feng,

None
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,400
when do you go back after experiencing hardships?

None
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,180
I’m so bored.

None
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,320
Sister, are you worried about Jin Mi?

None
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,920
I wonder how she is going in the mortal world.

None
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,080
Now she has become

None
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,080
a weak mortal.

None
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,420
Don’t worry.

None
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,160
If she really has an accident

None
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,500
in the mortal world,

None
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,660
she can finish experiencing hardships

None
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,100
and return soon then.

None
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,180
What happens in the mortal world is not terrible,

None
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,080
as it can cultivate her.

None
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,440
I’m afraid that it isn’t mortals who want to harm her.

None
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,900
Jin Mi has no enemy

None
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,280
except Heavenly Empress.

None
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,820
Heavenly Emperor specially issued a decree

None
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,100
ordering all immortals not to intervene
in Jin Mi’s experiencing hardships.

None
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,780
This is issued for Heavenly Empress, right?

None
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,540
Yes. Take it easy, Sister.

None
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,400
Moreover, Night Immortal

None
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,780
keeps an eye on Jin Mi every day,

None
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,340
so I think

None
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,660
Jin Mi will return safely

None
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,660
very soon.

None
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,820
She is always a child in my mind.

None
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,720
I was afraid that she might hurt herself,

None
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,240
so I didn’t dare to let go of her in the past.

None
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,720
It’s time to let go of her

None
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,380
and allow her to experience something outside.

None
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,940
Catch me.

None
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,800
Go and catch me.

None
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,440
It’s a serious fault for taking away the Millennial Ginseng.

None
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,380
I don’t know how they will punish me.

None
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,740
Anyway I’m tough. I’ll play it by ear.

None
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,140
Auntie. Qiang Huo.

None
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,240
You’re back.

None
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:08,940
Jin…

None
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,280
Saint Girl, have you had your dinner?

None
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,740
Are there any leftovers?

None
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,080
Let me cook a bowl of egg noodles for you.

None
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,860
Take it easy.

None
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,520
You’re always reckless.

None
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,320
Did she forget?

None
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,080
Well, give it to me.

None
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,960
Thank you, Auntie.

None
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,600
You have been to Luoye Mountain
for more than one month.

None
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,460
What did you get?

None
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,320
I gained a lot.

None
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,500
I will sort it out in a few days

None
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,500
and lecture other girls about it.

None
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,600
How was everything going

None
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,160
in this month when l left?

None
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,160
Everything was good.

None
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,520
I feel relieved then.

None
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,700
Jin Mi, I didn’t tell them.

None
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,480
I don’t know

None
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,160
how the elders would punish you

None
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
if I told them.

None
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,160
I thought it over later.

None
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,760
What you said did make sense.

None
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,640
Anyway King Yi can’t live forever.

None
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,980
It’s better to give it to other people who need it.

None
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,120
I chose you other than ginseng for sure.

None
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,500
How nice you are, Qiang Huo. I know

None
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,500
you’re my best friend.

None
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,340
But you were so bold.

None
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,240
Don’t ever do it again.

None
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,660
I won’t.

None
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,320
Anyway

None
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,940
I don’t have any Millennial Ginseng to steal anymore.

None
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,500
By the way,

None
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,500
was the person you treated with the Millennial Ginseng

None
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,700
cured?

None
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,480
Yes.

None
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,800
But I met

None
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,800
a rare disease

None
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,800
when treating my first patient.

None
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,160
It’s said in the book that
the patient can be cured in three days,

None
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,680
but it took me one whole month.

None
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,920
My biggest impression this time is that

None
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,220
we can’t believe everything in the book.

None
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,880
Experience is the best teacher.

None
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,100
Let’s go.

None
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,080
A country cannot exist without a king.

None
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,240
Xu Feng is missing and may be dead.

None
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,240
We should hold a funeral at once.

None
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,820
Now Huaiwu is beset by enemies from within and without.

None
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,720
I have no choice.

None
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,880
Cousin must be alive.

None
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,880
I will look for him in Luoye Mountain with my men.

None
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,820
There are plenty more fish in the sea.

None
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,160
As my daughter,

None
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,320
you can certainly find a good husband.

None
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,320
Why are you so obsessive

None
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,560
about Xu Feng?

None
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,260
Daddy, you should understand my only dream

None
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,600
is to get married with him in my life.

None
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,500
Even death can’t part me from him.

None
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
I don't believe heaven is so cruel

None
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,360
to perish my only dream.

None
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,780
I must find Cousin.

None
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,260
You can’t hold a funeral now.

None
00:26:59,260 --> 00:26:59,780
You…

None
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,260
Your Highness.

None
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,720
Your Highness.
Your Highness.

None
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,220
What’s the hurry?

None
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,540
Your Highness,

None
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,540
King Yi returned safely.

None
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,300
What?

None
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,580
King Yi did return safely?

None
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,340
Yes.

None
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,260
Where is he now?

None
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,740
He should have been back to his mansion now.

None
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,380
Who is that?

None
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,520
Why don’t you show up but hide covertly?

None
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,000
Show up.

None
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,280
Just stay away from her.

None
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,640
Hey, I advise you to mind your own business.

None
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,900
Get rid of him first.

None
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,240
Watch out.

None
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
Are you all right?

None
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,280
"Beiyuan Villa"
Your Highness, His Majesty is having a rest.

None
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,800
Let me get in to see him.

None
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,980
His Majesty said

None
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,620
no one is allowed to disturb him without his permission.

None
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,920
How dare you stop me?

None
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,700
Military orders cannot be disobeyed.

None
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,960
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

None
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,480
I won’t leave without seeing him today.

None
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,520
Qin Tong.

None
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,400
Yes.

None
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,160
Go to handle her.

None
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,360
Yes.

None
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,360
Get out of my way.

None
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,680
Your Highness, can I have a moment with you?

None
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,620
You’re so reliable.

None
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,820
I’m flattered.

None
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,580
How did you send her away?

None
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,580
Although His Majesty is safe and sound,

None
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,260
but he is exhausted and weak and needs some rest

None
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,520
after a long and tiring journey.

None
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,100
You shouldn’t bother him now.

None
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,220
Please come here tomorrow

None
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,720
and His Majesty will meet you for sure.

None
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,700
How could you make a decision for me?

None
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,500
I was wrong.

None
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,100
The message of my hunting

None
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,380
must have been divulged to Liangguo.

None
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,560
You doubt there is a mole in the palace?

None
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,080
Fine.

None
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,980
Since I need some rest today,

None
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,820
I won’t think about it.

None
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,120
Let’s discuss it tomorrow.

None
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,540
You can leave.

None
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,340
Yes.

None
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,960
Most of the wound has been recovered.

None
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,840
The poison must have worked.

None
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,720
Your Majesty, it’s not a trivial matter

None
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,200
if someone really divulged
the message of your hunting

None
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,540
to Liangguo.

None
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,380
Please allow me to investigate it.

None
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,440
I’ll find the mole as soon as possible.

None
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,620
Thank you, Duke Nanping.

None
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,680
Yes.

None
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,960
Your Majesty, it seems that you’re still weak?

None
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,040
The medical skill of the
imperial doctor isn’t good enough.

None
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,960
How about summoning Saint Girl
of Saint Doctors’ Family here

None
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,720
to examine you?

None
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,220
Saint Girl?

None
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,760
Jin Mi?

None
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,420
She must not be involved.

None
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,280
I feel much better.

None
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,160
You don’t have to go through all this trouble.

None
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,060
Your Majesty, you’re the foundation of Huaiwu.

None
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,060
You can never take it lightly.

None
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,060
Moreover, the mission of Saint Doctors’ Family

None
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,680
is to make sure the good health of you.

None
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,920
It’s proper

None
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,400
to summon Saint Girl here now.

None
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,280
Your Majesty, I think what
Duke Nanping said makes sense.

None
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,500
I hope

None
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,240
Your Majesty can summon
the Saint Girl here as soon as possible

None
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,280
to nurse your health.

None
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,760
I also agree.

None
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,360
Duke Nanping acts quickly.

None
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,720
He asked me for the imperial edict

None
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,320
and sent for Saint Girl

None
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,480
shortly after he advised to summon her.

None
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,580
Qin Tong, pick several of your trusted subordinates

None
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,580
to follow the men of Duke Nanping

None
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,260
and make sure the safety of Saint Girl.

None
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,260
I’ll protect Saint Girl?

None
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,100
I won’t feel relieved if you don’t go there in person.

None
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,820
I’m worried that

None
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,660
someone really wants to kill you.

None
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,060
Don’t worry.
I have a plan.

None
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,220
I’ll get prepared now.

None
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,860
Cousin, are you getting better?

None
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,120
Much better.

None
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,440
Yesterday I heard from Qin Tong that

None
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,860
you were still weak,

None
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,320
so I asked the senior pharmacist
in my mansion for advice

None
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,660
and chose the best materials

None
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,240
to stew a cup of decoction in person.

None
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,160
It can alleviate your weakness and tiredness

None
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,740
Thank you.

None
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,100
You know,

None
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,500
I worried much about you recently.

None
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,500
Leave the decoction.

None
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,980
I’m tired after discussing
official business in the court today.

None
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,020
I’m going to take a rest.

None
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,860
Someone, keep the decoction.

None
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,680
But…

None
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,680
When will you look back at

None
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,140
my love for you?

None
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,820
Taste some grapes for me.

None
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,140
It looks sweet.

None
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,580
So sour.

None
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,340
Liar.
You such a liar.

None
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,860
"Saint Girl Hall"
Hurry up.

None
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,360
"Saint Girl Hall"
What’s going on?

None
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,140
"Saint Girl Hall"
Look. Have a look. What’s going on?

None
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,620
"Saint Girl Hall"
What happened?

None
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,580
I don’t know.

None
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,880
What happened?

None
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,720
It isn’t the day to hold a memorial ceremony today.

None
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,140
Auntie looks serious.

None
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,220
I said nothing.

None
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,340
Did Auntie know

None
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,020
we flew a kite secretly yesterday?

None
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,620
I don’t know either.

None
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,360
Saint Girl, do you why we come to Saint Girl Hall?

None
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,140
I’m stupid. Please instruct me, Auntie.

None
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,820
Tell me where the ginseng is.

None
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,040
How come the ginseng is gone?

None
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,780
If people from the capital didn’t ask me about it,

None
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,440
the elders and I

None
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,320
wouldn’t check the pharmacy

None
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,360
and we wouldn’t find

None
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,280
the ginseng is gone.

None
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,260
The ginseng is kept by you.

None
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,500
How come it’s gone?

None
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,080
Well, er.

None
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,260
Oh, no.

None
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,180
I didn’t expect that I was caught so soon.

None
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,020
Saint Girl, where is the ginseng?

None
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,080
Auntie, Longevity Qiankun Elixir is prepared.

None
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,080
What?

None
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,560
But,

None
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,560
but I took it.

None
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,920
I was afraid that any mistake was made,

None
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,980
so I took it for King Yi

None
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,660
to have a test.

None
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,240
How, how could you

None
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,700
take such an important thing?

None
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,320
Auntie, I took the liberty to take it

None
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,960
without discussing with you and the elders

None
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,120
in advance. Please punish me.

None
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,400
Didn’t you know the ginseng
can’t be found within 1,000 years?

None
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,360
Since you weren’t totally sure,

None
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,940
how could you add the guiding drug easily?

None
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,820
Auntie, I was not very well the day before yesterday

None
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,820
and arbitrarily took away the medicine of Saint Girl.

None
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,060
I thought it was common medicine

None
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,060
and didn’t expect it is Longevity Qiankun Elixir.

None
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,160
You…

None
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,000
No, Auntie.

None
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,000
It has nothing to do with Qiang Huo.

None
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,360
She wanted to bear the blame for me.

None
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,100
It was done by me alone.

None
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,820
I’m willing to take the consequences.

None
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,840
No. It’s my fault.

None
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,380
No, Auntie.

None
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,960
It’s my fault. It’s my fault. It isn’t Qiang Huo’s fault.

None
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,940
You don’t have to protect me.

None
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:23,920
Auntie, it’s my fault.

None
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,200
Saint Girl. Auntie.

None
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,220
King Yi issued an imperial edict summoning Saint Girl.
