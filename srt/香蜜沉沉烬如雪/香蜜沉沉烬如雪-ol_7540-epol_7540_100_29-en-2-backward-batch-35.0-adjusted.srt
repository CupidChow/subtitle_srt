1
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 29"

3
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,120
It seems that it is providence.

4
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,240
What providence?

5
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,360
Nothing. Nothing.

6
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,280
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

7
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,040
Nothing.

8
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,320
Why haven't returned to Heaven Realm yet?

9
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,400
With your brilliant scheme,

10
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,280
I had so much fun.

11
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,920
I can’t help but want to talk to you.

12
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,040
How did you come up with such a brilliant scheme?

13
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,040
Experience is the best teacher.

14
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,030
Although

15
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,160
I have made matches for others for many years,

16
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,200
what I know about love

17
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,000
is purely theoretical.

18
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
And I have few chances to dig into it.

19
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,480
I really feel ashamed.

20
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,079
As for this aspect, it seems

21
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,960
I have to pick your brains.

22
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
No problem. No problem.

23
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,960
I have heard that
the osmanthus wine of a wine shop

24
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,440
is very tasty, which is very famous.

25
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,600
We may as well chat while drinking the wine.

26
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,079
Okay.

27
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,640
I think we are very congenial.

28
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,079
Let’s have a good chat tonight.

29
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,760
But

30
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,960
let me take a look at Xu Feng first.

31
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,880
He, he is busy with public affairs.

32
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,800
There’s nothing interesting about him.

33
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,840
Besides, he is now a human being.

34
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,400
You can't talk to him.

35
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,520
It’s better to drink wine with me.

36
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,800
In the Human Realm,

37
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,120
night hours in spring are extremely precious.

38
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,360
No. No. No.

39
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,520
You are wrong, Yan You.

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,200
For human beings, the saying that
night hours in spring are extremely precious

41
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,080
is related to the spiritual practice.

42
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,040
It’s not appropriate

43
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,160
to use this saying to describe us.

44
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,240
As for us, we should say

45
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,600
beautiful night hours.

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,080
Yeah, yeah.

47
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,240
Beautiful night hours.

48
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,680
Let’s go.

49
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,640
"Yunmeng Lake"

50
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,200
Young Lord.

51
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,680
You are getting more and more skilled.

52
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,400
You are still so boring.

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,650
You are so disobedient.

54
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,020
So disobedient.

55
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,960
So disobedient.

56
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,000
You

57
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,560
You

58
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,200
So disobedient.

59
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,560
So disobedient.

60
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,159
Why?

61
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,040
Why?

62
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,040
You are so disobedient.

63
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,480
-So disobedient.
-Master, what are you doing?

64
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,920
Stand up.

65
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,640
Li is still young. Keep cool.

66
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,040
Do you think that I don't love him?

67
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,840
I provide him with
delicious food and decent clothes,

68
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,280
making him be a decent carp.

69
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,320
He just doesn’t want to.

70
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,130
Instead, he wants to play in the mire.

71
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,130
Why?

72
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,630
Why? Why?

73
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,050
Why? Why?

74
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,300
Why?

75
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,640
Why?

76
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,360
Go.

77
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,880
Li. Li.

78
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,000
Li.

79
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,520
Promise me

80
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,000
you won’t play in the mire again.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,600
Okay?

82
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,960
Don’t fool me.

83
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,240
If you fool me, I will punish you severely.

84
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,640
Got it?

85
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,410
Got it?

86
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,450
Got it?

87
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,160
Master,

88
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
let Li leave now.

89
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,440
I have something to report.

90
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,120
Okay?

91
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,000
Go.

92
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,960
On that day, you promised me

93
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,720
that you would take back
the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

94
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,640
Have you got it?

95
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,200
I’m incompetent.

96
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,040
I couldn’t take back the
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

97
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,840
What did you promise me that day?

98
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,320
You said that you would
take back the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

99
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,320
Why did you fool me?

100
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,600
You know that I hate being fooled by others.

101
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,880
I don’t dare to fool you, Master.

102
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,960
Maybe it’s providence.

103
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,080
Master, Xu Feng is completely innocent.

104
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,600
Innocent?

105
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Innocent?

106
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,280
He has a mother like that.

107
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
So he must pay for it.

108
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,320
I want his mother to feel the same pain

109
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,360
of losing a son.

110
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,720
Now that you don’t want to kill him,

111
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,440
I will do it by myself.

112
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,120
Tell me.

113
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,160
Where is the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

114
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,000
I’m going to take back the arrow

115
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,640
and kill Xu Feng with it.

116
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,160
Foster mother is going to be insane.

117
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,080
Tell me.

118
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,960
Where is the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

119
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,640
I know I was wrong.

120
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,200
I’m going to take it back now.

121
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,760
Will you really kill Xu Feng for me?

122
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,520
Stand up.

123
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
Stand up.

124
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,800
I’ll believe you one more time.

125
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,159
If you let me down again,

126
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,159
I will punish you severely.

127
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,440
Remember.

128
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,720
You are a red carp from now on.

129
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,880
You are no longer a little green snake.

130
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,040
Got it, Li?

131
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,240
Call me mom.

132
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,040
Mom.

133
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,920
Good boy.

134
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,040
You are a good boy, Li.

135
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,120
I will not let you suffer from injustice.

136
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,280
Okay?

137
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,240
Okay.

138
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,960
Good boy.

139
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,680
You are a good boy, Li.

140
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,320
I got it.

141
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,640
Li.

142
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,720
That’s my boy.

143
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,000
I shouldn’t let her keep insane like this.

144
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,770
Duke Nanping Palace

145
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
-My Lord.
-My Lord.

146
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,160
The princess

147
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,600
hasn’t eaten anything yet?

148
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,480
Not yet.

149
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,280
You may go.

150
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,280
Yes, my Lord.

151
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,240
My dear.

152
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,280
You should eat something.

153
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,760
Seeing you act like this, I really feel distressed.

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,760
Don’t worry.

155
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,320
I have listed that Puchi as wanted

156
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,440
in the whole city.

157
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,080
Tell me.

158
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,280
Do you want me to
have his body cut off piece by piece

159
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,880
or make him torn into pieces by horses？

160
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,280
You can't catch him.

161
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,640
You are complaining about my ineffectiveness.

162
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,600
I didn’t expect that

163
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,840
This Puchi is so cunning and shameless.

164
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,560
Maybe King Yi bought him off

165
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,360
and let him make such a drama.

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,480
This matter has nothing to do with Xu Feng.

167
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,280
OK. OK. He is innocent.

168
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,600
Innocent.

169
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,720
These human beings are so foolish.

170
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,560
Dear,

171
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,520
what on earth can I do

172
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,040
to make you happy?

173
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,560
At present, I can only rely on him
in the Human Realm.

174
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,760
Dad,

175
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,000
you must know what I want.

176
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,320
I know.

177
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,880
But I’m confused.

178
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,840
Why did you go with that Puchi and ask

179
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,280
King Yi to offer you two a marriage permission.

180
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,360
Now King Yi has decreed
the cancellation of your engagement.

181
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,480
This matter is completely settled.

182
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
What can I do?

183
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,720
I,

184
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,120
I’ll find a solution.

185
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,200
I’ll find a solution. OK?

186
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,600
Eat something first, OK?

187
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,880
Be good.

188
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,080
Have a seat.

189
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,960
Come and

190
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,320
bring the meal for the princess.

191
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,320
I won’t allow Sui He
to keep obsessed with King Yi like this.

192
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,040
Qi Chong,

193
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
send this letter to Liangguo.

194
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,160
The sooner the better.

195
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,440
Yes, my Lord.

196
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,720
You are not kind to me.
So don't blame me for being unjust.

197
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,640
You hurt Sui He’s feeling so much.

198
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,920
How I can spare you?

199
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,120
This time, Liangguo is going to send out troops.

200
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,600
When you go to fight in battle in person,

201
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,200
you’ll be dead.

202
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,480
Your Majesty.

203
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,080
The Saint Girl is taking a nap.

204
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,080
She has been very tired in these days.

205
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,800
You may go back, Your Majesty.

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,640
Your Highness.

207
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,720
Xu Feng

208
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,640
made these phoenix lamps for Jin Mi.

209
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,600
I have something to ask you.

210
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,120
What a coincident!

211
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,680
I was going to look for you.

212
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,080
We can meet each other here now.

213
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,360
It seems that we are thinking about the same thing.

214
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,200
Tell me.

215
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,840
Why did you try to get Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

216
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,960
In addition,

217
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Rat Fairy has admitted

218
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,640
that it’s him who used
Magic Fireball to attack Xu Feng that day

219
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,400
and denied that you were his fellow.

220
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,760
But I guess

221
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,440
he was just providing cover for you. Right?

222
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,960
What’s your intention?

223
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,360
Your Highness,

224
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,480
could you please ask these questions one by one?

225
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,240
I’m overwhelmed by so many questions.

226
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,840
If you want to know all the answers,

227
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,000
then please go with me.

228
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,880
What? Are you afraid that I’ll fool you?

229
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,720
Since you can relate Magic Fireballs to me,

230
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,200
you should know that I won’t hurt you.

231
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,000
The answers you want

232
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,120
are under the Dongting Lake.

233
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,720
Don't you remember this place?

234
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,200
Should I remember it?

235
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,880
Don't you think this place is very familiar?

236
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,200
I do feel it’s familiar.

237
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,560
But,

238
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,000
but I’m feared

239
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,600
It seems that

240
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
you still haven't be ready to uncover the mystery.

241
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,640
Why

242
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,880
am I so flustered when approaching this place .

243
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,800
It’s OK.

244
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,560
If you don't want to go down there,
I won't force you.

245
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,400
However, although there is
no need to hurry at this moment.

246
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,240
it is not appropriate to put it off anymore.

247
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,040
If you are ready,

248
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,480
we will enter the bottom of the lake.

249
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,400
All the answers will be naturally revealed.

250
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,720
What did I do wrong?

251
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,960
Your Majesty, did you spoil the plan
and say something wrong a few days ago

252
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,720
when you drank wine to boost your courage

253
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,440
to express your affection?

254
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,800
Tell me.

255
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,200
If your wife is not happy,

256
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,120
what will you do to cheer her up?

257
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,000
Then I’ll decide how much unhappy she is first.

258
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,480
If she’s just a little unhappy,

259
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
then I’ll buy some
fresh stuff for her to make her happy.

260
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,160
If she’s very unhappy...

261
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,560
What will you do?

262
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,520
Then I’ll buy some stuff that are more expensive.

263
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,720
Do you think the Saint Girl is an ordinary girl?

264
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,680
No, I don’t dare to think so.

265
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,480
You may go.

266
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,320
I’m leaving now.

267
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,880
Wait a minute.

268
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,280
Find me

269
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,560
the stuff that are both fresh and expensive.

270
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

271
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,080
Now that you still have feeling for me,

272
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,320
why are being so cruel ?

273
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,200
Liu Ying, we are on different tracks.

274
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,000
You’ll be better off without me.

275
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,640
You said you engraved this with my name.

276
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,000
You said you would never forget our past.

277
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,200
Liar!

278
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,000
Your Highness.

279
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,040
You are back.

280
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,280
Kuang Lu,

281
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,720
do you remember the things
that happened in your childhood?

282
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,360
Of course.

283
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,040
What about things that made you sad?

284
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,400
There was nothing that made me sad.

285
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,840
Even if I felt sad at that time,

286
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,240
now I think

287
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,720
it’s actually not a big deal.

288
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,400
For fairies and immortals,

289
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,320
the most important thing is freedom and happiness.

290
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,440
You should think more
about things that make you happy.

291
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,560
If I can really be like you,

292
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,200
it will be a good thing.

293
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,960
Your Highness.

294
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,920
Do you recall something that makes you sad?

295
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,960
Everyone has his or her troubles.

296
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,960
Time is like the prayer beads
that are made from troubles.

297
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,320
Optimistic people

298
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,880
count the beads with smile.

299
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,400
Although we may meet some setbacks,

300
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,000
we should confront them calmly.

301
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,400
Only in this way can we welcome the bright future.

302
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Kuang Lu,

303
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,720
can you

304
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,200
go with me to the Dongting Lake?

305
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
Dongting Lake?

306
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,800
Your Highness. Wherever you go,

307
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,920
I’ll be with you.

308
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,080
What a beautiful place!

309
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,400
Why did you think of coming here, Your Highness?

310
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,560
In this place,

311
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,880
there may be the past that I wanna face.

312
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,320
You are not a red carp.

313
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,600
You are not qualified to play with us.

314
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,320
Go. Go. Go.

315
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,280
A monster with horns on head.

316
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,920
Go.

317
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,800
Go.

318
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,960
Leave Lize Pond right now.

319
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,760
Your Highness.

320
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,880
Your Highness.

321
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,040
Did you recall something?

322
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,360
You seems to be very familiar with Dongting Lake.

323
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,560
Let's go.

324
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,440
No, please.

325
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,680
Mom, please.

326
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,600
No, please.

327
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,200
Li.

328
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,360
No. No. Li.

329
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,960
Cut the horns,

330
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,840
and you will be just like them.

331
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,040
Mom, please.

332
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,000
No. No.

333
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,440
Mom.

334
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,880
Mom.

335
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,040
Mom, please.

336
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,240
No.

337
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,080
Your Highness.

338
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,280
Are you okay?

339
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,440
Be good.

340
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,200
Mom, please don’t...

341
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,320
Are you okay?

342
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,160
I’m OK.

343
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,320
"Yunmeng Pond"

344
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,350
Yunmeng Pond.

345
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,120
This name is quite nice.

346
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,650
"Lize Pond"

347
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,190
Li.

348
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,820
Li.

349
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,040
Go play with your friends.

350
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,720
Tell them

351
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,600
that you are a red carp.

352
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,120
You are not a little loong.

353
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:55,960
Go.

354
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,080
Go.

355
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,920
Your Highness.

356
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:44,960
Your Highness.

357
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,560
What happened?

358
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,160
Yunmeng Pond

359
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,400
Is it not Lize Pond?

360
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:06,960
Your Highness.

361
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,440
You are here finally.

362
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,000
Please.

363
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,280
Master, Night Immortal wants to meet you.

364
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,640
Lord Dongting.

365
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,560
Please accept my courtesy.

366
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,320
Why do you give me such a big courtesy,
Mister Immortal?

367
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,160
I can’t afford it.

368
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,200
I just do what I should do.
You deserve it, Miss Immortal.

369
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,800
I have some confusions.

370
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,320
I’m here to ask for your enlightenment.

371
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,320
I have stayed here for long time,

372
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
isolated from the outside world.

373
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,360
I’m afraid I can’t help you.

374
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,480
Recently, I got a piece of painting.

375
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,200
I heard that Lord Dongting is well-informed.

376
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,080
So I’m here to appreciate it with you.

377
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,440
Mom.

378
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,160
Could you please leave me and Lord Dongting alone?

379
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,200
I know little about paintings.

380
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,400
I’m afraid I’ll let you down.

381
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,560
It’s OK.

382
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,440
Then let me interpret this painting for you.

383
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,640
In this painting, the string of Magic Fireballs
on the woman's wrist

384
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,400
is a very precious treasure in the Heavenly Realm.

385
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,240
There are only two strings of them in the world.

386
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,440
Another string

387
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,280
was given by Heavenly Emperor
to the Heavenly Empress as a gift on their wedding day.

388
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,760
So the relationship between
the woman in the painting and the Heavenly Emperor

389
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,800
must be very close.

390
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,720
Suddenly a beauty derived from
a red shark bead appears with the sound "susu";

391
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,760
I will never ever let her leave.

392
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,520
This poem conveys the pledge of one's eteranl love,

393
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,360
which is full of affection.

394
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,320
The two words at the end of the two lines
can be combined to the name Su Li.

395
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,840
The signature seal belongs to Lord Beichen,

396
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,600
which is the nickname of the Heavenly Emperor
that he called himself when he was young.

397
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,160
He only called himself this name
in front of the ones who are very close to him.

398
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,240
Few people know this name.

399
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,160
For whom would Heavenly Emperor draw the portrait?

400
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,240
For whom would he write a poem

401
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,040
to express his affection with his nickname signature?

402
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:54,920
What’s more,

403
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,200
when Rat Fairy was in trial

404
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,680
and he repeatedly mentioned the name of Su Li,

405
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,160
Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Empress looked very queer.

406
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,760
Heavenly Empress is a jealous woman.

407
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,880
The relationship between
Fairy Su Li and the Heavenly Emperor

408
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,120
is very evident.

409
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,960
I have studied hard at the Xingjing Court since my childhood.

410
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,520
I can remember all the anecdotes of the people
in the six realms that are mentioned in the books.

411
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,960
Only the name Su Li seems familiar

412
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,120
but leaves no impression on me.

413
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,320
It’s just like my childhood memories,

414
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,760
which vanished completely.

415
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,040
It seems that

416
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,920
Fairy Su Li

417
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,760
is an old acquaintance

418
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,520
who was very important to me in my childhood.

419
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,800
Someone deliberately erased my childhood memories.

420
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,560
I forget all those things,

421
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,120
including this person

422
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,520
and this name.

423
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,000
Mister Immortal, your ability to think much

424
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,000
and to imagine

425
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,320
is so amazing.

426
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,520
Am I really thinking too much?

427
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,000
Heavenly Emperor is from Loong Family,
and he practices fire-related magics.

428
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,960
I’m from Loong Family, too.

429
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,080
But I practice water-related magics.

430
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,520
So it can be inferred that

431
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,120
my biological mother must come from Water Family.

432
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,480
Fairy Su Li in this painting

433
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,120
is treading on the wave and catching fish.

434
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,840
So she’s very likely to be a member of Water Family.

435
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,080
And the shark beads mentioned in the poem

436
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,440
are derived from the tears of mermaids.

437
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,040
Coincidentally,

438
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,480
I also have a string of shark beads.

439
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,760
It has been with me since my childhood.

440
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,360
I have always kept it with me.

441
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,600
Su Li has been dead.

442
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,800
Why do you

443
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,480
keep talking about a dead person?

444
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,600
That day, Rat Fairy chose to die.

445
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,480
Seemingly he had planned to

446
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,000
take revenge for the dead Fairy Su Li.

447
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,240
And he did drive a wedge
between Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Empress

448
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,320
and cause destruction to Bird Family.

449
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,800
But as far as I’m concerned,

450
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,080
this scheme was short of orderliness and foresight.

451
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,000
which couldn’t destroy Bird Family radically.

452
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,200
It’s more like an act of escaping running into danger

453
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,480
at the expense of Rat Fairy’s life.

454
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,280
In the final analysis,

455
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,280
the only reasonable explanation is that

456
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,840
Su Li is not dead.

457
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,680
She’s alive.

458
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,960
And she is the person behind the scenes,

459
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,280
saving power secretly

460
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
and scheming

461
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,080
against Heavenly Realm again and again.

462
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,440
My son has finally grown up.

463
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,440
I have always heard that
Night Immortal is extremely smart.

464
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,360
Now I know that you are really very smart.

465
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,680
With only a piece of painting,

466
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,880
you can make a careful investigation

467
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,000
and make so many inferences.

468
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,200
So

469
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,440
is what I said true or not?

470
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,000
Inferences are just inferences.

471
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,920
You are a prince.

472
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,560
Your parents,
Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Empress...

473
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,000
Heavenly Empress is not my biological mother.

474
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,880
Just because I am
the eldest son of Heavenly Emperor

475
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,960
she does everything possible to

476
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,640
take complete control over me.

477
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,760
During the thousands of years,

478
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,280
I have always

479
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,040
missed my biological mother.

480
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,320
You may go, Mister Immortal.

481
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,080
Your mother has died

482
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,240
in the fire that happened in Lize Pond that year.

483
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,520
I thought

484
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,680
my mother did love me.

485
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,040
She had to give me up

486
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,920
under the unfavorable situation.

487
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,160
I know who the person in the painting is

488
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,520
and the meaning conveyed by the poems.

489
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,880
But I didn’t expect that

490
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,560
my biological mother, who I miss everyday

491
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,640
would keep a distance from me,

492
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,560
seeing me as a stranger.

493
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,720
Is it because I’m too self-sentimental

494
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,240
or you are too heartless?

495
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,000
How is it possible that I don’t love you?

496
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,080
But I have walked on a road with no way back.

497
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,800
There is no end to troubles.

498
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,880
Why are you so obsessed with this matter?

499
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,800
Now you have another child
to accompany you and make you happy.

500
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,600
I don’t want to badger you.

501
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,040
I just want to ask you a question.

502
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,160
If I am really a shame for you,

503
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,560
why did you insist on giving birth to me?

504
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,360
If you and father were in love with each other,

505
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,880
why did you torture me

506
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,560
and abandon me?

507
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,040
This scar is caused by your Magic Fireball.

508
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,720
This is the scar left

509
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,320
after you cut my scales.

510
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,800
Scales have grown on other parts of my skin.

511
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,920
Only this forbidden lamella

512
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,240
has become my lifelong wound

513
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,600
and pain.

514
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,240
Everyone knows

515
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,200
the forbidden lamella of a loong is untouchable.

516
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,920
I really can't imagine

517
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,800
what kind of hatred

518
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,400
would make you do this to me, your child.

519
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,640
Stop.

520
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,640
Stop, please.

521
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,960
Go away.

522
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,680
Go away.

523
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,880
Go away.

524
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:36,440
The one who gave birth to me,

525
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,639
destroyed me

526
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,960
and abandoned me

527
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,800
is my mother.

528
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,880
I get hurt both physically and mentally.

529
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,159
I’m scarred.

530
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,600
It’s because of you.

531
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,480
Today, I worship you one more time

532
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,960
to repay you for giving birth to me.

533
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I am not your mother.

534
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,719
You are not my son.

535
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,440
I am not your mother.

536
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,280
Go away.

537
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,080
Go away.

538
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,600
Li.

539
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,840
Li.

540
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,640
Li.

541
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,280
Li.

542
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,120
Li.

543
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,400
Li.

544
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,400
Li.

545
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,240
Li.

546
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,560
"Beiyuan Villa"

547
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,280
Your Majesty, don’t you like these?

548
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,360
You don’t like these, either.
