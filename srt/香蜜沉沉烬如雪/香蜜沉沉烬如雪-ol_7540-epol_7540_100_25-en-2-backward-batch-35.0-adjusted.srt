1
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 25"

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,980
Invite Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family now.

4
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,420
Yes.

5
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,720
General Qin.

6
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,420
What’s wrong with His Majesty?

7
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,200
His Majesty is unwell.
Your Excellencies, please go back.

8
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,020
Minister, please wait.

9
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,740
Get out of the way!

10
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,200
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

11
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,960
Minister Fu. Duke Nanping.

12
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,880
Do you have anything important to report?

13
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,600
Your Majesty, you feel unwell, so we are so worried.

14
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,260
I have been in a cold recently.

15
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,760
It’s a minor illness. Don’t worry.

16
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,840
Is there any urgent report from the border?

17
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,360
All the main forces of Liangguo withdrew.

18
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,500
Your Majesty, don’t worry.

19
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,420
Minister Fu is in command to deal with
military affairs and important things,

20
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,340
so you can rest easy, Your Majesty.

21
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,620
Other officials and I will also help him sincerely.

22
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,360
With you two,

23
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,740
I feel so contented.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,360
Your Majesty, here comes Saint Girl.

25
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:53,360
Summon her.

26
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,200
Do you have anything else to say?

27
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,620
Your Majesty, please rest without worry.

28
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,860
-We’ll leave.
-We’ll leave.

29
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,180
Minister, please wait.

30
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,420
His Majesty is unwell by accident.

31
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,100
Why am I in command to deal with
military affairs and important things?

32
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,880
Duke, I can’t

33
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,180
stand your groundless pretence up.

34
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:39,880
Minister.

35
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,880
Minister, don’t embarrass me.

36
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,760
His Majesty is unwell, so it’s reasonable for you

37
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,300
to deal with state affairs on behalf of him.

38
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,460
Minister, did I misread?

39
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,520
I saw His Majesty seemed to spit blood.

40
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,280
What do you think?

41
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,000
I also saw that.

42
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,280
In your opinion, His Majesty
suffers from some severe illness

43
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,340
rather than cold.

44
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,659
I am afraid that

45
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,200
His Majesty falls ill from overwork

46
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,440
and lots of hardships on earlier expedition wars.

47
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,840
Surely,

48
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,740
the condition also depends on
the diagnosis of Saint Girl.

49
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,220
His Majesty was in army for half a life.

50
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,400
In recent years, he has been
busy with government affairs

51
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,720
and had no time to marry consorts,
so he still has no son.

52
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,280
We keep submitting memorials,

53
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,840
but His Majesty ignored us.

54
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,500
Once His Majesty has bad health,

55
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,660
whom will he give the throne to?

56
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,540
Whom, indeed?

57
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,340
It’s a misfortune for the state and families.

58
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,120
The deceased emperor advocated imprisonment
and His Majesty’s blood relationships

59
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,520
were all killed.

60
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,660
Now,

61
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,160
even no one can be adopted by him.

62
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,680
Duke, please.

63
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,360
Minister, please.

64
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,020
Take care.

65
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,360
Go to arrange

66
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,980
so that princess can come here
to pay respects to His Majesty

67
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,000
and sound out his illness condition tomorrow.

68
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,660
Yes.

69
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,400
Today King Yi didn’t hold court due to illness.

70
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,280
Spread this piece of news

71
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,580
in secret.

72
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,820
Remember to keep it a secret from princess

73
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,440
before she comes

74
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,880
to prevent her from making a
wrong judgment due to care.

75
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,600
I see.

76
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,040
It’s his breath.

77
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,300
Mu Ci, I know it’s you.

78
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,980
Why haven’t you admitted you are Mu Ci?

79
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,060
Why haven’t you meet me since you save me?

80
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,740
You even took away the only gift you gave me.

81
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,980
Now that you want to draw a line with me

82
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,260
Well,

83
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,440
I’ll give my life right back to you now.

84
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,220
From then on,

85
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,420
we don’t owe each other.

86
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,880
You haven’t come out.

87
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,800
Well.

88
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,120
I know you care about me.

89
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,140
Even if you don’t want to take off your mask,

90
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,320
I also know you are Mu Ci.

91
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,500
You shouldn’t have gambled

92
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,460
with your life.

93
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,520
If not,

94
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,100
you wouldn’t have come out to see me.

95
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,840
It shows I won.

96
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,840
Go back now.

97
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,580
Those chasing to kill you

98
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,960
will come again after a failure.

99
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,840
Be careful of your own safety.

100
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,680
Mu Ci.

101
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,600
Return my brass strip to me before leaving.

102
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,000
Why haven’t you admitted you are Mu Ci?

103
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,060
Do you know how much I want to see you again?

104
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,040
That Mu Ci you mentioned

105
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,000
has been gone.

106
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,660
All people think you died,

107
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,480
but I don’t think so.

108
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,220
I know you must be alive

109
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,120
and you will come back to meet me.

110
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,580
It seems that we are different

111
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,580
in the definition of being alive.

112
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,540
What actually happened back then?

113
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,900
Why did you disappear

114
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,120
after there was Nether Fury in Wangchuan River?

115
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,620
Mu Ci, what actually happened back then?

116
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,500
-Demon Lord.
-Demon Lord.

117
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,820
My Lord.

118
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,920
My Lord.

119
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,880
Demon Lord, Mu Ci

120
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,900
was accidentally hurt by Liu Ying 1,000 years ago.

121
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,240
King of Bian City thought he was alone and helpless,

122
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,000
so he took him back and brought him up in his mansion.

123
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,060
He has practiced magic

124
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,700
with two princes and Liu Ying since childhood,

125
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,880
showing no abnormity.

126
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,760
But Nether Fury appeared without reason today,

127
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,160
which is a bad omen.

128
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,180
He could solve it easily.

129
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,700
He has black pupils.

130
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,920
Only the pure bloodline of Spirit-Vanishing Family

131
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,160
can have this abnormity after growing up.

132
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,360
But I did

133
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,820
kill the whole Spirit-Vanishing Family back then.

134
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,940
Unexpectedly,

135
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,800
there is still a leftover evil of Spirit-Vanishing Family.

136
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,400
Back then, Spirit-Vanishing Family rebelled

137
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,300
to try to overthrow our Demon Realm.

138
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,720
Luckily, Your Majesty was wise and resolute,

139
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,040
so a disaster was avoided.

140
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,460
To leave no chance for their revival, we must kill him.

141
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,440
My Lord, I am not a different family.

142
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,600
Please let me out.

143
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,460
You aren’t from a different family?

144
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,440
It’s obvious to people of the whole Demon Realm that

145
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,380
you hurt Liu Ying by Wangchuan River.

146
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,880
Don’t quibble.

147
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,260
I hurt Princess Liu Ying?

148
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,520
So, how was she then?

149
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,480
My Lord,

150
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,660
we can’t take such an evil lightly.

151
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,000
We’d better seal him

152
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,540
and throw him into Yu Abyss right now.

153
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,440
I hurt Princess?

154
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,580
I hurt Princess?

155
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,820
I hurt Princess?

156
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,940
OK, I’ll leave it to you.

157
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,140
Remember not to make any trouble again.

158
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,740
Yes.

159
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,700
You don’t need to know what happened before.

160
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,480
Just remember there is no Mu Ci

161
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,200
in this world.

162
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,380
I know you’ve suffered a lot.

163
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,980
Mu Ci, go back to Demon Realm with me.

164
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,640
As usual, we can

165
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,100
practice martial arts and…

166
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,340
Mu Ci, don’t go.

167
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,160
Don’t leave me, OK?

168
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,340
As fast as wind.

169
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,120
As slow as the slowly spreading forest.

170
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,980
Attack like fire.

171
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,560
Defend like mountain.

172
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,040
Difficult to predict the movement when motionless.

173
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,280
Take action at lightening speed.

174
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,100
You’ve progressed.

175
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,860
Of course.

176
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,360
When you were out,

177
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,940
I learnt military strategies and tactics hard.

178
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
I heard from Qin Tong that

179
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,670
you had taken away

180
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,860
all the “Seven Military Classics” in my study.

181
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,000
I remember you didn’t like martial arts before.

182
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,800
I couldn’t understand them when I was young,

183
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,120
but I find I am deeply attracted by them

184
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,760
after several years.

185
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,700
The art of war is like the feeling of the world,

186
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,020
so we should be clear-sighted
at the situation and popular feeling.

187
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,270
As the saying goes, there are
different situations in deployment of army

188
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,430
like the water flows without a fixed shape.

189
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,320
Those with foresights will win.

190
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,820
No wonder you always read.

191
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,140
Fortunately, you are enlightened late,

192
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,860
or you, the General Feifeng of Huaiwu

193
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,980
might own my title God of War.

194
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,440
Don’t laugh at me, Cousin.

195
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,300
As a woman, I don’t dare to talk about
affairs of state defense and administration.

196
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,980
I just know little

197
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,120
under your influence.

198
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,500
It’s a pity that I am not a man,

199
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,940
or I can serve as a pawn and pacesetter

200
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,200
under your command.

201
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,640
Your Majesty, it’s time for you to take medicine.

202
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,400
Your Majesty, here are our respects.

203
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:46,319
Who are they?

204
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,040
Jin Mi of Saint Doctors’ Family.

205
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,760
Qiang Huo of Saint Doctors’ Family.

206
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,040
Princess, here are our respects.
May you great happiness.

207
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,540
Are you the famous female doctors
of Saint Doctors’ Family?

208
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,060
Your Highness, you flatter us.

209
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,100
Our family always lives in seclusion
from the earthly world,

210
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,500
so we aren’t famous at all.

211
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,940
Because of so,

212
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,840
there are many rumors about you in the human world.

213
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,520
I’ve long heard that Saint Doctors’ Family act secretly

214
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,500
and need to observe numerous rules.

215
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,640
You do impress me a lot today.

216
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,400
But why do you cover your faces with veils?

217
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,680
Covering face with veil is
a century-old tradition of our family.

218
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,960
The female doctor of our family
begins to wear veil since childhood.

219
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,940
We also wear veils when
presenting ourselves to His Majesty.

220
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,100
I am not a king.
How about letting me look at your face?

221
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,000
It seems that I have no qualification.

222
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,160
No. No.

223
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,540
We are ugly and afraid to scare you.

224
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,280
Your saying

225
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,500
even arouses my curiosity.

226
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,220
They have strict family rules, so don’t force them.

227
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,100
Saint Doctors’ Family is loyal to the royal family all the time.

228
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,780
Cousin, you may make a decree

229
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,980
to abolish their bad habit.

230
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,860
If all of them cover their faces with veils,

231
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,100
spies and assassins may sneak into the palace

232
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,240
to hurt you, Cousin.

233
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,420
Cousin.

234
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,220
Cousin, are you OK? Cousin.

235
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,940
Cousin.

236
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,280
Cousin. Cousin.

237
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,160
How is His Majesty?

238
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,480
On the way here,

239
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,200
I just heard His Majesty was unwell.

240
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,400
Seeing he brandished a sword vigorously,

241
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,780
I thought his illness was just a rumor.

242
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,740
It seems true now.

243
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,360
Your Highness,

244
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,660
His Majesty has kidney yang and blood failure,

245
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,860
so he is impotent.

246
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,780
He just coughs.

247
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,540
Why, why is he impotent?

248
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,560
Rome is not built in one day.

249
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,320
His Highness falls ill from
overwork throughout the year.

250
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,500
Now he is extremely weak.

251
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,760
Besides kidney yang and blood failure,

252
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,760
His Majesty also has five taxations
and seven damages,

253
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,400
so he often has prostration, coughs

254
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,620
and blood in phlegm.

255
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,980
At first glance,

256
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,880
it is due to lung meridian,

257
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,420
but virtually

258
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,140
kidney meridian.

259
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,980
Can he be curable?

260
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,440
As he is incurably ill, he approaches death.

261
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,120
But, please don’t worry, Your Highness.

262
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,860
I’ll treat His Majesty carefully.

263
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,420
Your Majesty.

264
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,440
Your Highness, Saint Girl of my family
has excellent medical skills,

265
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,620
so she’ll treat His Majesty with all her strength.

266
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,420
Depending on the situation,

267
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,560
His Majesty won’t wake up so soon.

268
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,140
Don’t be anxious here.

269
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,120
It’s not worth if you get ill due to tiredness.

270
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,660
How about going back for a rest first?

271
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,740
Once His Majesty comes round,

272
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,000
we’ll inform you at once.

273
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,240
I leave all that to you, Saint Girl.

274
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,940
Your Highness, don’t worry.

275
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,560
We’ll try our best.

276
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,520
Qiang Huo, see Her Highness out.

277
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,340
Yes.

278
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,540
Your Highness, please.

279
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,500
If His Majesty gets better,

280
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,880
ensure to inform me first.

281
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,080
OK. Please don’t worry, Your Highness.

282
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,660
She loves you so deeply.

283
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,780
How is my acting skill?

284
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,980
Duke Nanping asked someone to send you a letter,

285
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,480
right?

286
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,440
How, how did Your Majesty know?

287
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,040
Now, with domestic trouble and foreign invasion,

288
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,220
Huaiwu is beset by uncertain border
and unstable court situation.

289
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,840
In the midst of war, people worry about their safety,

290
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,760
not to mention a good and prosperous life.

291
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,700
But being obsessed with ambition,
someone wants to kill me

292
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,600
and usurp the throne in chaos

293
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,840
for his own power and desire.

294
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,400
But it’ll take a long time

295
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,620
to eliminate the traitor.

296
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,680
Its hardships, advantages and disadvantages

297
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,080
can’t be expressed in a few words.

298
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,020
I did have some doubts about you
when you came in the beginning.

299
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,060
I was afraid you were really
on the side of Duke Nanping.

300
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,120
But you haven’t written back to Duke Nanping,

301
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,960
so I know

302
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,460
you are on my side, right?

303
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,660
Saint Doctors’ Family pledges loyalty to King Yi.

304
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,800
As Saint Girl, I don’t dare to neglect my mission.

305
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,180
Then tell Duke Nanping

306
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,720
I’ve been incurably ill and approached death.

307
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,340
Why?

308
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,120
In this case, he’ll drop his guard

309
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,060
and show his original face.

310
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,760
I can counterattack when he is off guard.

311
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,200
So I need your full cooperation.

312
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,020
As for what kind of serious illness I have,

313
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,320
you need to think about it.

314
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,500
Your acting skill has actually

315
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,640
reached a high degree of excellence.

316
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,830
I am gladly convinced,

317
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,210
admire you from the bottom of my heart

318
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
and bow to you in worship.

319
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,460
Don’t fool me.

320
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,460
We face

321
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,380
such traitor officials like Duke Nanping and Minister Fu,

322
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,760
hard-boiled and slippery persons
who have been in office for decades.

323
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,940
If they are put on the stage,

324
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,760
all of them will become famous actors.

325
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,140
We should be full of spirit and energy.

326
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,240
Yes.

327
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,060
It’s all your fault.

328
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,680
You tell them I am a patient
with deficiency of the kidney

329
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,400
and can’t have sexual intercourse.

330
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,680
How can I face them later?

331
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,180
Well, is,

332
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,980
isn't this Your Majesty’s meaning?

333
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,720
What?

334
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,460
What’s this?

335
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,800
Qiang Huo can understand
and get you medicine by prescription.

336
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,060
Powder for the Seven Emotions Medicament can fully achieve

337
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,560
Your Majesty’s desired effect.

338
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,980
But with seven emotions,

339
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,280
people have different reactions due to external stimulation

340
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,420
and express them in lines, which is natural.

341
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,560
The medicine can reverse veins

342
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,700
and forcibly take away one’s feelings,

343
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,780
so one can take it for a long time.

344
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,720
If you must take it,

345
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,760
remember not to get too happy or sad.

346
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,640
You’d better take it with Golden Chamber Pill

347
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,900
to slow medicine resistance.

348
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,000
OK, you can arrange it.

349
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,100
The crafty and suspicious Duke Nanping

350
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,900
may not believe so easily,

351
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,160
so he’ll send Sui He

352
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
to sound out my condition in two or three days.

353
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,780
You cooperate with me

354
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,740
to act before Sui He by then.

355
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,860
Your Majesty,

356
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,380
are you tired of

357
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,420
scheming against them every day?

358
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,000
I am just a doctor rather than an actress.

359
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,360
I am unmarried,

360
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,360
but now you widely spread
I can’t have sexual intercourse,

361
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,980
breaking my reputation.

362
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,880
If I am alone

363
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,440
and childless later,

364
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,940
who will accompany me?
You?

365
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,180
Your, Your, Your Majesty, calm down.

366
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,300
After taking the Seven Emotions Medicament,
you can’t become emotional or angry.

367
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,160
I heard

368
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,420
people have seven emotions and
change their emotions with the environment change.

369
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,060
If the environment changes,
people’s emotions will be stimulated and changed.

370
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,400
Now only the secret behind the veil

371
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,020
can make my emotions fluctuant

372
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,840
and make me be lost in a reverie.

373
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,240
Both Sui He

374
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,100
and I

375
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,060
are curious about your look.

376
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,880
Your Majesty,

377
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,520
it’s said by Confucius:

378
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,140
“I’ve never seen anyone who
loves morality just like loving a beauty.”

379
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,720
Your Majesty, please be self-possessed.
And I look…

380
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,460
You look ugly and are disliked by all people?

381
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,160
I don’t care.

382
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,520
When we were in Luoye Mountain,

383
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,500
we stayed in the same room for over a month.

384
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,640
I know your character well.

385
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,560
I don’t see my lover,
so I am care-laden like entranced.

386
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,340
What can I do?
You’ve forgotten me.

387
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,700
I don’t dare.

388
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,420
When we stayed in the mountain,

389
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,980
you were so bold.

390
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,200
You found chances to have physical contact with me.

391
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,220
After treating me flippantly in the mountain,

392
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,880
you actually want to disown me

393
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,360
and be irresponsible for me.

394
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,120
Do you

395
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,720
have special love

396
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,480
for mountain bandit?

397
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,300
I am terrified as I am guilty.

398
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,160
I, I am very guilty and deserve death.

399
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,820
Don’t always talk about death.

400
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,300
I know you cherish your life.

401
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,900
No.

402
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,440
Though I cherish my life,

403
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,760
I pledge loyalty to Your Majesty more,

404
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,940
or I don’t help Your Majesty deal with Duke Nanping

405
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,520
without consideration of life and death.

406
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,720
I never want your loyalty.

407
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,420
Well,

408
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,120
many a day will come yet.

409
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,860
One day,

410
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,320
I will make you willingly remove the veil.

411
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,880
Your Majesty,

412
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,540
with the bounden duty
as a saint girl of Saint Doctors’ Family,

413
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,340
I need to observe both
Your Majesty’s orders and my family rules

414
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,780
and don’t dare to go off the rails.

415
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,560
I have no other merits

416
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,520
except loyalty.

417
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,620
I can’t give what Your Majesty wants.

418
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,380
Though we had a good time in the mountain,

419
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,600
it isn’t the life of Your Majesty

420
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,880
and me.

421
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,620
About the time in the mountain,

422
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,040
please just take it as a dream, Your Majesty.

423
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,740
I almost couldn’t control myself.

424
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,640
As the emperor of a state, so enchanting

425
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,180
that I was even trapped.

426
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,360
You came up with this dumb idea.

427
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,780
What dumb book is this?

428
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
The words of sages

429
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,700
featured by ideas without evil,
such as abstemious joy and sadness.

430
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,920
Unexpectedly, Saint Girl was scared away.

431
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,700
Your Majesty, the love between
man and woman is like march to war.

432
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,780
Besides fine weather, favorable geographical
and human conditions,

433
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,220
tactics and ideas are also important.

434
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,180
When the enemy advance, we retreat
and when the enemy retreat, we chase.

435
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,700
Your Majesty loves Saint Girl

436
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,240
who is dignified and stable,

437
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,800
so the ordinary positional warfare is infeasible.

438
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,820
You should adopt the city seizure tough warfare
of strengthening the defenses and clear the fields.

439
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,480
You are an expert.

440
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,840
Fellow officers and I

441
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,420
think about two things all our lives,

442
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,560
namely protecting our homes and defending our state

443
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,840
and carrying on the family line.

444
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,460
Good.

445
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,240
Go to fetch “Wuzi” for me.

446
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,980
I want that volume with notes I made in spring.

447
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,420
“Wuzi Art of War”?

448
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,740
It was borrowed away by Princess Nanping.

449
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,320
What about “Six Secret Teachings”?

450
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,420
Your Majesty, do you forget

451
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,780
all the Seven Military Classics
were borrowed away by Princess?

452
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,570
Hasn’t she finished reading them?

453
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,570
Go to get them back from her.

454
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,020
Your Majesty, do you forget

455
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,920
now you are unconscious due to illness?

456
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,300
So how can you make an order?

457
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,880
Yes.

458
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,100
Get them back some other day

459
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,600
when I cure

460
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,160
my kidney.

461
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,400
Leave.

462
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,920
So terrible.

463
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,660
Jin Mi is double-faced

464
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,260
and Xu Feng also irritates me.

465
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,440
He actually only listened to Jin Mi verbally.

466
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,680
Well, if it goes on like this,

467
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,760
when will they be together?

468
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,460
It worries me a lot.

469
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,240
This part was over.

470
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,120
You’re to blame. It’s all your fault.

471
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,520
You banished Jin Mi

472
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,540
to the hated Saint Doctors’ Family.

473
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,740
I think

474
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,420
you just envy at

475
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,300
her youth and beauty,

476
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,260
so you don’t want her to have a happy marriage

477
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,860
and arranged her

478
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,140
a fate that is doomed to loneliness.

479
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,900
Damn fox, how can you blame me?

480
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,300
You were there back then.

481
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,540
Recall carefully.

482
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,520
Who agreed to arrange her to Saint Doctors’ Family?

483
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,980
Who disallowed Jin Mi to experience
separation of lovers in mortal world?

484
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,980
It was your dear Second Nephew.

485
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,860
No one expected he would also
jump down to mortal world with her.

486
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,940
He hurt himself

487
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,240
by his own doing.

488
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,800
He deserves it.

489
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,700
Sui He.

490
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,140
Daddy.

491
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,020
What’s wrong?

492
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,460
Who makes you cry

493
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,700
so sadly?

494
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,660
Tell me.

495
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,540
Cousin.

496
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,940
His Majesty?

497
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,160
What did His Majesty do?

498
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,280
Cousin is…

499
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,360
Don’t panic. Don’t panic. Speak slowly.

500
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,880
Today I saw Cousin

501
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,380
coughed up a handful of blood

502
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,000
and passed out.

503
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,060
Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family
diagnosed His Majesty.

504
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,740
What did she say?

505
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,340
She said Cousin

506
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,500
was impotent with kidney deficiency
and five taxations and seven damages.

507
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
He has been incurably ill.

508
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,840
Daddy, what can I do?

509
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Find a way to save Cousin.

510
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,180
OK, don’t be afraid.
Don’t be afraid.

511
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,220
I’ll handle everything for you.

512
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,420
Fortunately, His Majesty’s father already passed away.

513
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,900
I’ll manage to cancel your engagement.

514
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,620
Daddy, what do you mean?

515
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,260
Don’t worry.

516
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,020
I won’t push you into the living hell.

517
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:13,840
You.

518
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,500
You.

519
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,560
You want…

520
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,000
As you see,

521
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,760
a wedding gown and a mourning gown.

522
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,000
Since I was 12 years old,

523
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,300
I’ve preparing a wedding gown for myself every year.

524
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,280
Also when I was 12 years old,

525
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,580
I first saw Cousin

526
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,760
returned from battlefield with wounds

527
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,020
and knew another fate

528
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,700
was waiting for me.

529
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,220
Sui, how stupid you are!

530
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,140
Xu Feng crusaded everywhere,

531
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,700
so he won’t live long.

532
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,140
I know you’ve loved him passionately since childhood,

533
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,620
but we can’t

534
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,800
go against the heaven’s will.

535
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,680
As your father,

536
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:06,360
I won’t allow you to marry this autocrat.

537
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,020
It turns out that you think of him
in this way all the time.

538
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,340
You really disappoint me.

539
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,160
But I am afraid that I’ll also disappoint you.

540
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,400
I must marry Cousin this life.

541
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,840
Whether I live in widowhood
or can’t have any child later,

542
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,000
I won’t regret.

543
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,760
If I marry him, it’s my luck
and if not, it’s my fate.

544
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,700
Unless he dies,

545
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,740
no one

546
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,300
can separate us forcibly.

547
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,100
Qi Chong.

548
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,820
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

549
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,480
Go get Saint Girl.

550
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,760
I have something to discuss with her.

551
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,100
Yes.

552
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,140
What’s wrong with you?

553
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,340
I didn’t see you the whole afternoon.

554
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,960
Now you are back,

555
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,480
but you bend the brows.

556
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,600
Taste it now.

557
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,120
His Majesty just asked people
to send sweetmeats to us.

558
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,920
Having some sweet food,
you’ll become happy.

559
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,199
I just went to meet Duke Nanping.

560
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,100
Why did you meet him?

561
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,239
I was afraid that you would worry,

562
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:43,400
so I didn’t tell you.

563
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,679
But now…

564
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,320
Jin Mi, what actually happened?

565
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,820
I heard His Majesty’s illness condition

566
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,520
from my daughter.

567
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,520
You’ve done a good job.

568
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:03,159
My Lord, you flatter me.

569
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,980
In your opinion,

570
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,360
how long can King Yi live?

571
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,600
One year at most.

572
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,900
I haven’t told it to Her Highness,
or she may feel sad.

573
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,980
Leave her alone.

574
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,900
Today I meet you

575
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,520
to let you manage

576
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,120
to reduce King Yi’s longevity

577
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,320
into 10 days.

578
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,860
10 days?

579
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,920
Yes.
The plan changes.

580
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,780
I can’t wait that long.

581
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,250
It’ll be the Meeting of Commanding Officers

582
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,370
10 days later

583
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:40,120
when civil and military officials and
border defending generals of various places

584
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,040
will come.

585
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,720
I’ll depose Xu Feng by then.

586
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,220
You should

587
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,380
exactly make him

588
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,860
be killed by poison

589
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,280
on the spot that day.

590
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,060
Yes.

591
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,220
Does Duke Nanping think he is the living Hades

592
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,720
who can determine the death time of a person?

593
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,540
Lower your voice.

594
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,700
Sit down.
Lower your voice.

595
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,400
Moreover,

596
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,740
he holds the lives of more than one hundred people

597
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,900
in our family this time.

598
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,840
It’s worse than last time.

599
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,540
Now he has sent killers into the village.

600
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,500
They’ll act according to the news 10 days later.

601
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,240
We can’t let Auntie die.

602
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,300
I know.

603
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,420
But if King Yi dies,

604
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,280
more people will suffer.

605
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,460
Why?

606
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,980
Now there is a state of chaos.

607
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,720
People are destitute.

608
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,720
But as for the places under the rule of King Yi,

609
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,300
wars are pacified and people live and work in peace.

610
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,800
If he dies,

611
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,040
who can save the living in water and fire?

612
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,340
I believe him.

613
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,900
If he can calm down the country,

614
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,180
he’ll create a peaceful, tranquil and prosperous age

615
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,000
without war and famine.

616
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,940
It sounds reasonable.

617
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,320
It’s too nerve-racking.

618
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,760
We can’t await our doom

619
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,160
in this way at all.

620
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,420
How about seeking advice from Auntie?

621
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,720
I also think so.

622
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,200
This is a matter of great importance.

623
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,060
We need to discuss with our auntie carefully.
