1
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 01"

3
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,740
My order

4
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,370
From today

5
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,060
Nobody is allowed to tell about me giving birth to my baby.

6
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,480
Anyone who talks about this will die

7
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,730
his soul will be destroyed

8
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,590
Yes, My Lord.

9
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,980
As you wish, my Lord.

10
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,480
We will destroy our own soul if we break our word

11
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,560
Please let her take this pill.

12
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,220
It's Yun Elixir.

13
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,480
Anyone who takes this will not fall in love and get hurt

14
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,980
My Lord.

15
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,570
A relationship can make people suffer and lose freedom.

16
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,980
Without falling in love, one can be strong and be at peace.

17
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,120
This is the best gift I can give her.

18
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,560
My baby girl should not be like me

19
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,260
suffering from deep love and regrets.

20
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,370
The excellent Water Immortal, Luo Lin,

21
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,520
and the virtuous Wind Immortal, Lin Xiu,

22
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,360
you are a good match

23
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,180
I'm afraid that within the universe, it is no longer possible to find such a happy marriage.

24
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,990
Drink this cup of wine

25
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,040
I wish you a lifetime of love and happiness.

26
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:21,980
Hope you can work together

27
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,780
to help the Emperor from now

28
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,500
If you later give birth to a baby boy

29
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,120
I would like my first son to be brothers with him.

30
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,270
If you later give birth to a baby girl,

31
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,100
I would like my first son to be betrothed to her.

32
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,580
I hope our friendship will be passed down to the next generations,

33
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,410
what a great thing!

34
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,650
What do you think of my suggestion?

35
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,140
That is definitely great.

36
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,300
Zi Fen,

37
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:22,260
The Emperor's order is irreversible.

38
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,780
I have no choice

39
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,580
But what about us?

40
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,730
But my heart is only for you

41
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,180
Nothing can change my love for you

42
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,460
I just hope you can find eternal peace in floral blossom

43
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,060
Have a peaceful life like water and the clouds

44
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,080
I want to name her Jin Mi

45
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,640
Yes, my lord.

46
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,210
Congratulations for the birth of our young goddess Jin Mi

47
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
No more congratulations

48
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,010
After I pass away

49
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,470
I don't want Jin Mi to be the Flower Deity like me.

50
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:10,540
I want her to live a simple life

51
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,840
Your highness, please reconsider.

52
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,360
How can the Floral Realm have no Goddess

53
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
I've decided.

54
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,670
After I die,

55
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,450
You all take your place

56
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,520
to be in charge of the Flower Palace.

57
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,940
Follow the order of the four seasons

58
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
take your responsibilities

59
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,150
Your highness, we will follow your order.

60
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,940
I foresee that

61
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,400
my baby girl will have a tragedy

62
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,260
within the following 10000 years.

63
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,900
Even though she has taken the pill, I am still worried.

64
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,570
My order,

65
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,900
From today forth, Jin Mi is forbidden to go out of the Flower Palace.

66
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,030
For ten thousand years,

67
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,000
She is forbidden to leave.

68
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Yes, My Lord

69
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,260
My Lord

70
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:13,020
My Lord

71
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,500
On summer solstice of  the celestial year of 208613,

72
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,020
The Floral Immortal Zi Fen passed away

73
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
All the flowers perished

74
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,860
Hearing this bad news

75
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,760
The Emperor mourned for 7 days

76
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,470
All the beings in the floral realm cried for her

77
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,480
Flowers of the whole world shared in this sorrow

78
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
and withered

79
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,250
for the following ten years

80
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,620
There were no more flowers blossom in the world

81
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,420
The colors between the heaven and earth were lost

82
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,520
until after the end of the mourning period of ten years

83
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,300
flowers start to blossom again

84
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,980
The beginning of the world was Tao

85
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:06,659
Tao gives birth to Yin and Yang, separates the clear and turbid

86
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,200
This creates two realms of the Celestial and the Devil

87
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,120
Ying and Yang interact and fuse

88
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,240
Then there were the sun, the moon, the stars

89
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,180
and all the creatures in the world

90
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,460
and also the good and the evil

91
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,940
After that, all the creatures cultivate themselves

92
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,020
And become gods, fairies, monsters, demons

93
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,340
and humans of flesh and blood

94
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,900
The Floral Realm once belonged to the Heaven Realm

95
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,500
four thousand years ago, the Floral Immortal passed away with regrets

96
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,880
the floral fairies left the Heaven Realm

97
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,200
and established their own realms

98
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,600
becoming the new sixth realm

99
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,600
That's all for the biography of Floral Immortal

100
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,220
Any questions?

101
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,020
Mr. Hu!

102
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,260
Lian Qiao!

103
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,400
Everyone's talking about the six realms

104
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,100
The general history of sixth realm

105
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,280
The complete collection of six realm

106
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,380
The Romance of six realm

107
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,220
However, those books only talk about four realms

108
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,900
Floral, Celestial, Human and Devil

109
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,900
What are the other two realms?

110
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,560
yes, yes, what are they?

111
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,080
emmmm

112
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,220
The Tao is so difficult to explain

113
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,140
This is something I cannot divulge

114
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,000
why not? what does it mean?

115
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,580
Look, Jin Mi

116
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,860
Wake up!

117
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,880
Little One!

118
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,020
What happened? Dinner time?

119
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,420
Look at you!

120
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,780
You spend your day just eating and sleeping.

121
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,420
Tell me, can you do anything else?

122
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,540
Don’t worry.

123
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,540
Today is neither first nor fifteenth of month,

124
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,540
so Chief Peony won’t come.

125
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,500
Jin Mi

126
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,220
did you forget what today is?

127
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,340
Jin Mi! Jin Mi!

128
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,660
Chief Peony

129
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,660
Chief Peony

130
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,060
You  haven’t made any attempt to work hard

131
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,660
Chief Peony.

132
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,220
do you mix up the date?

133
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,980
Today is neither first nor fifteenth of month!

134
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,000
Spot check.

135
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,200
Chief Peony.

136
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,420
This is all you have learned in four thousand years?

137
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,580
Your spiritual power is weak and your fairy skill is poor,

138
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,100
and you cannot even complete a medium spell.

139
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,200
Your comprehensive skill is not worse than others

140
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,940
and you are even smart

141
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,640
In the past years, where have you put your mind?

142
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,640
It is quite dangerous outside the Water Mirror

143
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,340
you can only increase your spiritual power to protect yourself

144
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,800
If you want to leave the Water Mirror, stop being lazy

145
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,720
Work hard and practice more.

146
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,120
Yes, I know. I will follow your guidance.

147
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,740
Have you not remembered what day is today?

148
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,800
Today?

149
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,630
Today is not the first or the fifteenth.

150
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,970
Hu?

151
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,770
Carrot?

152
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,580
Radish?

153
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,420
Lian Qiao, do you want to be punished as well?

154
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,600
Drink turnip soup?

155
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,910
I remembered! Frost’s Descent.

156
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,170
We drink Turnip and Spare Ribs Soup in Frost’s Descent.

157
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,090
So today

158
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,740
so today is the anniversary of past Floral Immortal’s death.

159
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,730
After today’s worship ceremony

160
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,270
you are punished to guard the Floral Immortal’s Mausoleum.

161
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,280
Chief Peony.

162
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,340
I am freaked out! Finally left.

163
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,100
According to laws,

164
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,420
my son Xu Feng must refine for forty-nine days to achieve rebirth.

165
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,610
Tonight is the last night.

166
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,780
Lord Liaoyuan, please help him to reborn in Nirvana.

167
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,020
You must protect Qiwu Palace well tonight

168
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,940
and no one should enter it without permission

169
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,000
Remember

170
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,700
no one

171
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,900
As you wish, your Majesty

172
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:59,180
I seem to remember that Chief Peony was furious about something,

173
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,440
Today is the anniversary of past Floral Immortal’s death.

174
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,250
The Flower Realm opens the Water Mirror every hundred years

175
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,970
to let the low-level floral elves and fairies like us to worship

176
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,360
Maybe Chief Peony misses the past Goddess, so she was not happy.

177
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,220
The day before yesterday, I proposed a report to Chief Peony,

178
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,700
telling her that

179
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,760
I want to leave the Water Mirror.

180
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,860
No wonder she tested your spiritual power.

181
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,800
Little One, are you crazy?

182
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,110
It is very dangerous outside, very dangerous!

183
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,900
Fruit fairies and elves are quite rare

184
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,220
and we may be eaten when we go out

185
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,240
But how good it is to be under the protection of this Realm!

186
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,600
We can devote ourselves to cultivation.

187
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
I just want to go out and have a look.

188
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,500
Look at the Human, Celestial, Devil Realms

189
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,700
written in the book

190
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,560
I just want to take a look and see what places look like.

191
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,480
We are in Floral Realm, but we are kept in this water mirror.

192
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,400
We don’t even know what the Floral Realm looks like.

193
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,960
I don’t understand.

194
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,380
Why the past Floral Immortal made this water mirror

195
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,510
restraining us in a fake water drop.

196
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,640
If I stay here anymore, I will become a raisin.

197
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
shhhh

198
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
Lower your voice.

199
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,260
If Chief Peony hears your words, you will be punished again.

200
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,800
Let me tell you. It’s not fun outside.

201
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,240
It’s dangerous.

202
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,420
Did you forget the anniversary of past Floral Immortal’s death 900 years ago?

203
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,420
What a disaster you made when you escaped!

204
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:40,240
The Water Mirror is open! Really! Come on, let’s go and see.

205
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,320
Jin Mi, it’s about time.

206
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,920
Let’s go and worship the past Floral Immortal.

207
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,880
Jin Mi, come to the front?

208
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,590
What did you do?

209
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,619
Kneel down.

210
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,900
Me?

211
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,339
She is still an elf.

212
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,000
I’m afraid it is against the disciplines.

213
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,839
Keep things simple and follow your heart.

214
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:56,980
Past Floral Immortal cared all beings in Floral Realm, and there is nothing against the disciplines.

215
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Keep silence.

216
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
Kneel.

217
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,370
Respect.

218
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,750
We miss you who left us,

219
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,100
and picked flowers for you.

220
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,460
No one can live forever,

221
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,900
but our memory of you last forever.

222
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,260
Chief Peony

223
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,960
Chief Begonia

224
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,550
and all beings in Floral Reals gather here

225
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,660
to show our sincere respect to Past Floral Immortal.

226
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:34,960
Worship.

227
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,480
Flower rain. Look, it rains flowers.

228
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,860
It’s raining flowers.

229
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,820
So beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful.

230
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,020
Jin Mi, come here.

231
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,360
With the protection of the Yun Elixir,

232
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
you will be safe.

233
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,760
Tonight is the last period of the Phoenix Nirvana.

234
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,000
At the midnight

235
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,300
the spiritual power of God of the Fire is the weakest.

236
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,040
You can act according to circumstances.

237
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,340
I'm aware

238
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,740
My Lord

239
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,930
if there is no perfect plan,

240
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,440
we must not act rashly!

241
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,700
Phoenix Nirvana takes place once in five hundred years.

242
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,590
I have been waiting too long.

243
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,520
I will send others for this matter, you don’t have to worry about.

244
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,340
See the fairy in Floral Reals as soon as possible.

245
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,010
Yes, my Lord.

246
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,320
Lian Qiao, are you OK?

247
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,080
I’m all right.

248
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,050
Just go. You don’t have to accompany me.

249
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,920
I am OK to kneel here alone. It doesn’t matter.

250
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,880
No

251
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,980
good friends come through thick and thin together.

252
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,190
You are in a worse condition than me. Chief Peony gave you an Immobilizing spell

253
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,460
It may be solved after sunset

254
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,860
Then your body will be numb

255
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,350
My mother is calling me, I have to go.

256
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,900
Mo-

257
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
-ther?

258
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Move!

259
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,280
Grape, grape

260
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,160
you can’t even break the Immobilizing spell

261
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,620
What can you do?

262
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,060
No it can't be like this

263
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,100
Mountain

264
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,140
down,

265
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,120
Waves up!

266
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,680
Oh, come on, am I really a useless elf?

267
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,770
Lord Puchi.

268
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,980
Yan You.

269
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,440
Lord Puchi.

270
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,260
Yan You.

271
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,800
You still can’t remember it for nine hundred years?

272
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,920
Yan You is not good name at all.

273
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,260
Do you know why?

274
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,040
Why?

275
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,360
There is a slug in the Flower Realm called “Yan You”

276
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,620
It looks very cumbersome.

277
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,300
Lord Puchi sounds better

278
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,180
It shows your characteristics

279
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,900
And also, very cute, isn’t it?

280
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,040
Lord Puchi. I don’t like this name.

281
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,960
But you have been called me that for nine hundred years, and I starting to get used to it.

282
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,470
You are just a little monster in the pond

283
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,650
why you need such big opening every time?

284
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,960
It’s only an eye candy and a waste of power.

285
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,800
This is the spiritual power I saved for a hundred years.

286
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,840
take it to nourish yourself.

287
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,260
Want to be a heroine?

288
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,800
Give the spiritual power you saved to me?

289
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,740
Who is the poor girl that even cannot break the Immobilizing spell?

290
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,950
Poor girl. Take it back.

291
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,440
Are you looking down on me?

292
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,480
OK, you win.

293
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,000
That’s right.

294
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,560
Here you are.

295
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,390
I also brought you a gift.

296
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,610
What gift? Something to eat?

297
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,220
Guess.

298
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,860
I’m hungry.

299
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,900
If you bring me meat,

300
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,160
it would be the best.

301
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,960
Clever, half correct.

302
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,980
This is Rou Rou.

303
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,260
Time really flies.

304
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,840
These years, you have given me the spiritual power of your hard work

305
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,880
to repay the help of that day.

306
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,000
In fact,

307
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,260
I really don’t need your spiritual power.

308
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,060
Your chatting with me makes me very happy.

309
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,940
Actually,

310
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,840
I repay you with spiritual power

311
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,640
not all because of you

312
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,680
If I had not taken her out of the Water Mirror,

313
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,940
we would have not met Qiong Qi

314
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,800
If we had not met Qiong Qi...

315
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,340
So what I want to do now

316
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,480
is atonement.

317
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,360
I know that you can’t let her go

318
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,740
so I want you to know

319
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,140
Your best friend is accompanying you in another way.

320
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,100
Lord Puchi,

321
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
will she change back to the Rou Rou

322
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,100
who can talk and sing, run and jump?

323
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,360
Well...

324
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,920
this is not impossible

325
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,400
Just find the Great Immortal.

326
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,520
The Great Immortal?

327
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,660
Then if I go to the Heaven Realm, can I find the Great Immortal?

328
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,120
Elves have no right to meet.

329
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,500
Unless you cultivate to become a fairy.

330
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,780
I cannot even get out of this small water mirror.

331
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,260
Everything has cause and effect.

332
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,920
Don’t live in the memory.

333
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,300
It’s time to let it go.

334
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,280
Practice hard.

335
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,560
And one day,

336
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,020
Succulent Fairy will wake up

337
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,020
and change back to Rou Rou in your memory.

338
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,420
Today is Frost’s Descent,

339
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,400
make a Fire Tiger.

340
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,440
Night Immortal.

341
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,320
Night Immortal.

342
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,600
Lord Liaoyuan.

343
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,760
Why is your Grace here so late at night?

344
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,980
Just now, I saw a man in black break into the Northern Heavenly Gate

345
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,060
and came here.

346
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,820
Have you noticed a man in black?

347
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,280
No.

348
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,680
Have you seen a man in black?

349
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,940
No.

350
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,590
Now it is the critical moment of Xu Feng’s rebirth in Nirvana.

351
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,530
I am afraid that the man in black wants to hurt Xu Feng.

352
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,280
Lord Liaoyuan, please come with me to catch him together.

353
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,520
Empress published an order that Qiwu Palace should be closed tonight.

354
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,170
I beg for your forgiveness, my Grace.

355
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,480
Ok. I fought with the black man.

356
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,070
This person has a strong spiritual power.

357
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,540
Hope you can take more precautions.

358
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,410
Night Immortal and his Highness are like brothers.

359
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,700
I am deeply moved by your friendship. I will keep an eye on the Palace.

360
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,680
Then I will leave.

361
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,700
Meteor!

362
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,520
Humans say if you make a wish when meteor across the sky, your dream will come true.

363
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,410
But there is a Realm protection, will the effect be greatly discounted?

364
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,260
It doesn’t matter. Let me try first.

365
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,260
I want to meet the Great Immortal.

366
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,300
What is this?

367
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,060
A burning smell.

368
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
So stinky.

369
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,050
Seems to be a bird

370
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:50,930
First baked,

371
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,020
then frozen,

372
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,140
frozen when cooked

373
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,660
what is this method of cooking?

374
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,140
This is a bird?

375
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,600
I see a bird.

376
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,110
Yes, a bird.

377
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,130
Its flowers and leaves are hard.

378
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,190
These are its feathers.

379
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,320
It is a bit stinky.

380
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,180
Crow, it is a crow.

381
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,940
Crow?

382
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,380
how do you know?

383
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,400
I read Hu’s “The Six-Realms Species Encyclopedia”.

384
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,380
Crows grow like this.

385
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,380
It must be a crow.

386
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,660
But why it doesn’t move?

387
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,220
Is it dead?

388
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,020
Don’t panic.

389
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,160
No, it is not dead yet. It still has breath.

390
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,710
Then we save it, and we raise it.

391
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:00,490
There is a saying in Human Realm

392
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,020
Buddha said be merciful

393
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,180
How can we just watch it dying without doing anything?

394
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,360
Let’s save it!

395
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,880
Can this really save it?

396
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,810
Don’t worry.

397
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,660
We grew in this way when we were young, didn’t we?

398
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,290
Water it,

399
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,630
and let it enjoy sunshine. It will be fine.

400
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,570
Little crow, take care of yourself.

401
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,520
We will come to see you later.

402
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,620
To water you again.

403
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,830
Let’s go.

404
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,480
OK

405
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,040
Your Majesty, his Highness disappeared in the process of rebirth.

406
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,540
What happened!

407
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,780
Make it clear, Liaoyuan.

408
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,000
I produced fire for forty-nine days to help his Highness to rebirth in Nirvana.

409
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,120
Today is the forty-ninth day.

410
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,420
Unexpectedly, as the fire was extinguished,

411
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,640
his Highness suddenly disappeared.

412
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,280
How could this happen?

413
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,260
According to your opinion,

414
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,560
what variables were there during Xu Feng’s refinement?

415
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,060
There is another event to be reported.

416
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,120
Say it!

417
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,040
Little crow, little crow

418
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,390
little crow.

419
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,160
You are so special.

420
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,680
Our Realm protection is inseparable,

421
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,140
how did you come in?

422
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,580
No response?

423
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,520
Ok, okay, I never serve it for anyone.

424
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,190
This is the honey that I made

425
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,980
with more than 100 kinds of flowers,

426
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,980
and it has been sealed for five hundred years.

427
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,440
I will give you a try first to see if it works.

428
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,960
Good, it works.

429
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,920
Why, why are you dead again?

430
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,390
Oh my god,

431
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,850
Lian Qiao must be disappointed.

432
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,940
However, if you can break through this protection,

433
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:39,179
you are certainly not a simple crow.

434
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:41,679
Are you a crow fairy?

435
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,190
If that’s the case, it’s too wasteful to bury you as flower fertilizer.

436
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,730
You even ate my precious honey.

437
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,239
How about

438
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,239
How about, how about I cook you?

439
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,100
This is it

440
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,680
Little crow

441
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,070
little... Little crow?

442
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,550
Little crow

443
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,470
Little crow...

444
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,940
how do you get so big?

445
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,160
How should I place you in the pot if you are so big?

446
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,400
Then how can I cook you?

447
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,210
However, I have heard that fairies have inner Dan,

448
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,640
which condenses all their power.

449
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,330
If I find yours and eat it,

450
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,220
it might be equivalent to eating your whole body?

451
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,720
Grape,

452
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,140
you are so intelligent.

453
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,680
It's strange...Why it has a tumor here?

454
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,420
I know it.

455
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,010
it might be his Internal Dan.

456
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,460
must be able to help me with my spiritual power

457
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,520
Who are you?

458
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,010
Hi, you woke up!

459
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,720
What kind of little evil spirit are you?

460
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,840
I'm not an evil spirit

461
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,080
I said...I'm not an evil spirit

462
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,440
Though I'm just a little fruit elf

463
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,060
a fruit elf still need to cultivate and practice hard

464
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,080
I'm not an evil spirit

465
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,820
Now that you woke up

466
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,450
just call me "my savior"

467
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,520
We do good without leaving our name

468
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,400
It is our good tradition in the Water Mirror

469
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,450
My savior?

470
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,900
Were you trying to save me,

471
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,740
with a knife?

472
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,900
Yes... I was...

473
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,500
I was...

474
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,650
You fell into my garden and was badly injured

475
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,720
I saved you from good will

476
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,740
To save you

477
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,660
I fed you the precious honey

478
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,640
so that you can wake up

479
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,660
well

480
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,020
Your clothes are quite dirty and ragged

481
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,080
I was trying to change you some new clothes

482
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,560
Then I saw

483
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,260
you have illness near your belly

484
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,700
Though I appreciate that you are broken in body but firm in spirit

485
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,080
you are still different from the average person

486
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,700
Now that I saved you, I'll finish my job

487
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,250
Lie down and I'll remove the ill part

488
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:57,370
lie down...what are you doing...

489
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,920
you are a female. Do you know the differences between male and female?

490
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,320
What differences...

491
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,660
How can you ignore the basic morals?

492
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,820
I've only heard about the differences between flowers, birds and animals

493
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,770
Never heard of differences between male and female

494
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,770
you...

495
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,640
I consider that you're still young

496
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,720
and were raised in this uncivilized place

497
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,380
I won't blame you...

498
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,040
We elves making fruits of course don't care about what birds think of us

499
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,970
a low level elf...

500
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,940
how could she have the magical hair clasp?

501
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,000
where did she get it?

502
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,330
well...

503
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,960
Well... since we've now known each other

504
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,430
We are friends now

505
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:49,200
take a good rest

506
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,330
I'll bring you something to eat

507
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,960
good night

508
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,860
friend, lunch time

509
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,200
hurry

510
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,190
sit

511
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,400
Eat those yourself

512
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,360
why

513
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,820
Don't you crows like worms

514
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,620
little elf...Who told you I'm a crow?

515
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,020
you are not?

516
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,240
Then you are a magpie?

517
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,180
wow

518
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,500
Is there any fountain water here?

519
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,580
please follow me

520
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,440
The water's OK

521
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:09,970
not bad

522
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,480
friend, friend

523
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,700
I didn't know you were so good at fairy skills

524
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,850
though I know the skills of changing shapes

525
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:18,650
never learned how to do the magic of bring a real thing from nothing

526
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,620
Neither can Mr. Hu. But Chief Peony can

527
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,290
friend, to achieve such skill

528
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,300
How many years does it take?
