00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 23"

3
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,060
My respects, Auntie.

4
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,079
King Yi sent someone
with an edict to invite the Saint Girl

5
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,860
It's over. I'm done.

6
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,220
This short-lived ghost will let me
be an immolation, won't he?

7
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,220
I heard that King Yi recently
has a physical malaise,

8
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,440
and needs to be healed by
Saint Girl of the Saint Doctors’ Family.

9
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:57,700
King Yi has a physical malaise.

10
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,920
Jin Mi, if anything should go wrong with King Yi,

11
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,700
how can you be good?

12
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,280
Auntie,

13
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,220
why don't you let me treat King Yi first?

14
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:10,880
If nothing goes wrong with my body,

15
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,280
that would mean the Elixir
has been successfully refined.

16
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,880
By then, I will go find another piece of Snow Ginseng,

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,540
and refine the Longevity Qiankun Elixir.

18
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,940
Auntie, please rest assured.

19
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,380
I will follow the example of the past Saint Girls

20
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,860
and bear in mind the regulations
of the Saint Doctors’ Family.

21
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,220
I won't fail the teachings of Auntie

22
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,100
and the elders.

23
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,340
By now,

24
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,180
it's useless to focus on the issue of right and wrong.

25
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,880
You will first go and check

26
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,660
the physical conditions of King Yi.

27
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,060
Yes, I will first go pick up the imperial edict.

28
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,700
King Yi, you must be fine.

29
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,460
Auntie, I don't know when I’ll return.

30
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,720
If anything happens to me,

31
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,900
the next Saint Girl will be determined by Auntie.

32
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,900
Don't worry about the Saint Doctors' Family .

33
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,660
I will handle it.

34
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,579
The Beiyuan Villa has many rituals,

35
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,260
so it's not so free as in the Saint Doctors’ Family.

36
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,100
You should be extremely careful.

37
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,660
Don't go beyond the limits
of your actions nor forget your origin.

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,880
You should always remember
your duty as the Saint Girl.

39
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,600
Yes, I will remember the teachings of Auntie.

40
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,140
Qiang Huo, take care of the Saint Girl.

41
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,900
and report the physical condition
of King Yi at all times.

42
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,300
Auntie, please rest assured.

43
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,340
Respected Elders and Auntie, take care.

44
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,880
Auntie, the Qiankun Elixir was really eaten by me.

45
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,200
If only Qiang Huo returns alive.

46
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,740
Auntie, please don't blame her.

47
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,100
You're good, Qiang Huo.

48
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,360
This time,

49
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,560
we had a really good cooperation.

50
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,820
Saint Girl, you're getting more and more daring.

51
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,680
How dare you lie with Auntie?

52
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,100
I'm naively, too.

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,540
Qiang Huo, look!

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,540
That looks delicious!

55
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,000
Stop!

56
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Steamed buns!

57
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,100
Hot steamed buns!

58
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,480
Jin Mi,

59
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,980
let’s have a look at it.

60
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,980
I want this, this and this.

61
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,560
Okay, I'll wrap it up for you.

62
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,659
Do you think we've bought enough?

63
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,800
Yes, that's enough.

64
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,220
Thank you.

65
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,480
Thank you. And See you.

66
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,860
Slow down! Take it easy! Look at this!

67
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,840
Pastries!

68
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,460
Jin Mi, I’ve never seen this before.

69
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,380
They look so delicious.

70
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,820
They really are delicious.

71
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,660
Since you think it’s good,
I’ll buy each of them.

72
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,980
Tastes good?

73
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,580
Hey, Lady!

74
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,320
You try it.

75
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,800
"Fortune-telling"

76
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,840
Your veil!

77
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,360
You’re an orphan, right?

78
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,520
I never tell a fortune for others randomly.

79
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,100
I only choose the fated ones.

80
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,380
I think you two

81
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,260
must be good friends since very young.

82
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,860
You can even die for each other.

83
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,100
And you're charged with an important task.

84
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,340
I'm afraid this is going to
have an inexorable doom.

85
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,640
Sir,

86
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,720
what inexorable doom do you mean?

87
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,200
This is something I cannot divulge!

88
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,700
You’re a fairy who came down to the mortal world.

89
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,680
Looks so alike!

90
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,659
Not a man has ever seen my face in the past.

91
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,300
But the portrait looks so alike me.

92
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,240
Is he really an expert from the outside world?

93
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,400
This time, your trip to the mortal world

94
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
is to find a man you truly love.

95
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,000
A man?
You made it wrong!

96
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,000
Our Saint Girl will never get married.

97
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,260
Who is that man?

98
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,680
His name is

99
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,820
Yan You

100
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,620
Yan You?

101
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,440
This...

102
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,120
what’s written on it?

103
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,700
Sometimes be a man and sometimes be a woman.

104
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,140
And this is my notes taken when I read it,

105
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,700
just to make a memo.

106
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,940
Pictures about the Beauties in the Six Realms

107
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,480
There they are!

108
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,080
Go quickly!

109
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,000
Who are you?

110
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,400
I'm just a poor fortune-teller.

111
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
Telling from your faces, officers,

112
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,700
you will hit a bad patch.

113
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,780
Be careful with your feet.

114
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,660
Lady, please get on the cart.

115
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,900
Let's go.

116
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,780
Move.

117
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,799
Lady, I'm not done yet.

118
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,440
Where are you going?

119
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,300
Officer, where is the lady going?

120
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,520
Forgive me, I have nothing to tell.

121
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,940
I'm on business today.

122
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,540
It’s a pity that I have no time
to ask for your suggestion.

123
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,500
But tomorrow I will handle affairs in the Beiyuan Villa.

124
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,960
Sir, would you please come and meet us there?

125
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,860
You can then tell the fortune for us
and be presented a grand reward.

126
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,720
Yes, yes, Yes.

127
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Well, that's good.

128
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,840
-Let's go.
-Move.

129
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,110
"House of Fragrance"

130
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,240
What is this place?

131
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,240
This is the House of Fragrance.

132
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,840
The best teahouse in town.

133
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,140
Lady, you've been through a long trip.

134
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,940
You can have a cup of tea and rest inside.

135
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,240
before heading for the Beiyuan Villa.

136
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,060
Please!

137
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,300
"House of Fragrance"

138
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,540
My Lord.

139
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,460
You must be the Saint Girl
of the Saint Doctors’ Family?

140
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,240
This is Duke Nanping

141
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,180
Duke, what's his background?

142
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,740
My respects, Duke Nanping.

143
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,620
Take your seat.

144
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
I came to meet you in person today,

145
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,620
because I’m truly worried about
the physical condition of King Yi.

146
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,260
It's a great matter of our country Huaiwu.

147
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,800
Therefore, I would like to have a
deliberate discussion with you.

148
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,900
How to nurse the health of King Yi.

149
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,360
and make him enjoy health and longevity

150
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,080
will bring benefits for the people of Huaiwu

151
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,820
and safeguard the prosperity of our country.

152
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,260
Please rest assured, Duke Nanping.

153
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,200
The health of King Yi is

154
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,320
the biggest focus of the Saint Doctors’ Family,

155
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,320
and also my duty.

156
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,220
I’ll try my best

157
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,940
to cure his Majesty.

158
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,240
You're wholehearted!

159
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
But...

160
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,600
I still have some details

161
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,700
to discuss with you alone.

162
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,700
Please come with me.

163
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:44,220
"Beiyuan Villa"

164
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,860
That Duke Nanping,

165
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,680
what did he talk with you just now?

166
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,480
About the physical condition of King Yi,

167
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,680
I hope you can report it to me at all times.

168
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,880
I want to know how serious his illness is.

169
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,500
I see.

170
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,760
The mission of the Saint Doctors’ Family
is to be loyal to King Yi.

171
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,160
But you should think clearly

172
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,760
which is more important,

173
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,060
the single life of King Yi

174
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,680
or the hundred lives of the
Saint Doctors’ Family are more important.

175
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,080
According to the regulations
of the Saint Doctors’ Family,

176
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,540
if His Majesty dies,

177
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,900
the Saint Girl will be buried with him.

178
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,120
However,

179
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,960
if you can do as I said,

180
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,780
you can save your own life,

181
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:51,240
and also the safety of all people
in the Saint Doctors’ Family.

182
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,300
Why do you look so dumb?

183
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,300
Won't it be that King Yi

184
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,220
is too sick to be saved?

185
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,420
No.

186
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,840
The Duke asks me

187
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,260
to take good care of the health of King Yi

188
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,600
and nurse him.

189
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,480
That would be great.

190
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,340
The trip is smooth.

191
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,800
But after entering the town,

192
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,560
a fortune teller came out all of a sudden.

193
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,440
He's a mystery.

194
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,800
Later, a person served Duke Nanping

195
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,920
led the Saint Girl to
the House of Fragrance for a rest.

196
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,100
With too many eyes and ears, I stopped following

197
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,100
and didn't enter the House of Fragrance.

198
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,560
Later, the person served Duke Nanping

199
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,840
sent the Saint Girl to the posthouse for a rest.

200
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,980
A fortune teller...

201
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,900
You go check it out.

202
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,880
Yes.

203
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,340
How about the House of Fragrance?

204
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,680
Check the fortune-teller first.

205
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,240
About what happened in the House of Fragrance,

206
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,520
I can guess a little bit without checking.

207
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,180
Yes.

208
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,480
Did she move the entire Saint Doctors’ Family here?

209
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,880
Jin Mi, before the court situation becomes steady,

210
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,880
I didn't want you here to take this.

211
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,880
But since you're already here,

212
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,600
I will do whatever I can

213
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,840
to keep you safe in this mess.

214
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,100
It seems King Yi

215
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,260
is not as ill as we thought.

216
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,400
We've already come here for one day.

217
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,600
but he is not eager to ask you to see him.

218
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,900
But...

219
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,700
the foods he sent here

220
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,560
are really delicious, they're all I love to eat.

221
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,740
There's one thing that's so weird about it.

222
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,960
I just heard the servants say that

223
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,860
there is not a consort in the Beiyuan Villa.

224
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,980
But the emperors have always had a big harem since the ancient time.

225
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,560
And I also heard that King Yi has a matchless

226
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,800
and peerless face.

227
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,840
There are countless girls in town who admire him.

228
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,380
But there is not a consort in the mansion at all.

229
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,740
Jin Mi, do you think
what the reason is supposed to be?

230
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,520
There's only one possibility.

231
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,540
What is it?

232
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,080
Qiang Huo,

233
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,060
do you know what your name means?

234
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,660
It's acrid and warm, and has strong ability
to release things to the surface.

235
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,820
It can mainly release the wind and
cold dampness of the solar channel.

236
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,900
It can also dispel the wind and
cold dampness and relieve pain.

237
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,280
So it can be used for treating exogenous cold
and headache without sweat,

238
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,900
wet and cold stasis, wind-water puffy swelling

239
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,900
and sore and ulcer.

240
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,660
That's all?

241
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,620
That's all.

242
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,980
Well,

243
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,980
you really don't know how to
seize the key points while reading.

244
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,240
You didn't get the essence when learning.

245
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,480
No wonder you haven't

246
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,740
made any progress over the years.

247
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,940
Then what else is there?

248
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,460
The main effect of Qiang Huo is

249
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,180
to warm the kidney and help enhance yang,
absorb Qi and stop diarrhea.

250
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,260
It's used to reinforce Yang.

251
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,220
Anyway, it's related to male diseases.

252
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,420
Never mind, just forget it.

253
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,540
You can take your time to comprehend it.

254
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,900
Saint Girl, His Majesty asked you to see him.

255
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,020
Lord Qin Tong has been waiting outside.

256
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,180
My respects, your Majesty.

257
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,560
Have a seat.

258
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,440
Thank you, your Majesty.

259
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,760
Your Majesty, please reach your hand out,

260
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,760
so that I can diagnose your pulse.

261
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,020
As I see,

262
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,280
the pulse is not shallow
nor deep but has even rhythm.

263
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,220
It's calm and gentle, fluent and strong.

264
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,600
There's no problem.

265
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,740
What's there to diagnose?

266
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,040
Your Majesty, do you feel any discomfort these days?

267
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,700
I feel sick both in my heart and liver.

268
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,320
And I often feel dizzy.

269
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,860
I have also lost my appetite, and can't sleep tight.

270
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,860
No.

271
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,240
These symptoms may be only said by His Majesty.

272
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,720
He deliberately did it to confuse others.

273
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,720
Is it possible that

274
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,180
he really has that kind of disease.

275
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,920
Your Majesty, there is no need
to be worried and anxious.

276
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,160
Although I'm a woman,

277
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,240
I am first a doctor,

278
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,240
and then a woman.

279
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,000
And a saying goes that
gender is not considered among doctors.

280
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,280
So Your Majesty, you shouldn't
have any burden in this aspect.

281
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,440
To be frank,

282
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,020
I've made great achievements in this field.

283
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,620
I'm proficient in studying it

284
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,060
and I'm afraid I'm unparalleled in this field in the world.

285
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,860
So I suggest

286
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,680
Your Majesty can try a herb, Qiang Huo.

287
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,640
Qiang Huo?

288
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,560
Exactly.

289
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,720
Apart from dispelling coldness,
eliminating wind and cold,

290
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,480
this medicine can also cure

291
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,080
impo...

292
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,740
this medicine can also cure

293
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,740
your kidney deficiency.

294
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,380
You've made great achievements in this field

295
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,920
and you're proficient in studying it?

296
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,760
Is that what a girl supposed to say?

297
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,880
Your Majesty, there is no need to worry.

298
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,260
The Saint Doctors’ Family

299
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,620
itself exists for the health of Your Majesty.

300
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,220
If your Majesty can be healthy,

301
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,500
I'll exert all my strength and wisdom
without any hesitation.

302
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,320
You thought too much.

303
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,100
You're useless here.

304
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,960
I feel quite good.

305
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,500
Do you know why I asked you to come over here?

306
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,680
I don't know.

307
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Aren't they the manuscripts of me and Crow?

308
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,660
How did they fall into the hands of King Yi?

309
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,500
Your Majesty, I...I...

310
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,800
Do you recognize them?

311
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,800
Yes, I...I...recognize them.

312
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,320
Do you have anything to say about them?

313
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,960
Your... your Majesty

314
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,380
I'm very guilty and deserve death.

315
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,060
What are your sins?

316
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,360
To save

317
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,980
a friend who was seriously wounded,

318
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,980
I...I…

319
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,380
gave...

320
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,800
gave him the Snow Ginseng, the guiding drug

321
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,960
of the Longevity Qiankun Elixir, to eat.

322
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,700
But...but I really didn't know that

323
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,900
he is an enemy of your Majesty.

324
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,340
When he was healed,
he went away without saying goodbye.

325
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,340
So I have no idea of his whereabouts.

326
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,640
Enemy?

327
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,440
Do you ever regret saving him?

328
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,900
Never.

329
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,580
It's said that doctors should have a merciful heart.

330
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,120
I wonder if a doctor meets a dying man,

331
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,900
how could he do nothing to save him?

332
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,020
Just like a chevalier in the martial world,

333
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,800
how could he not draw a sword
and render help the person in need?

334
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,000
That's why I saved Crow.

335
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,420
I did it all out of instinct.

336
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,420
I have no regrets for that.

337
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,720
Your Majesty,

338
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,100
if you want to grant me a death today,

339
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,460
I have absolutely no complaints for that.

340
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,460
But the safety of all people
in the Saint Doctors’ Family,

341
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,720
they know nothing about it.

342
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,180
Please don't give any penalty to them, Your Majesty.

343
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,800
Your Majesty, if you really want to execute me,

344
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,620
could you just give me a stab for good?

345
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,700
That would be great.

346
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,980
Are you really willing to die for Crow?

347
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,320
Death will come sooner or later.

348
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,740
I just beg your Majesty not blame
on the Saint Doctors’ Family.

349
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,180
Your Highness.

350
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,680
Your Highness, are you going out?

351
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,120
Kuang Lu, I'm going out for a trip.

352
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,280
You take care of Xuanji Palace.

353
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,640
Yes.

354
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,840
Okay, stand up.

355
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,680
I dare not.

356
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,680
Then lift your head up,

357
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,260
and look who I am?

358
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,750
Your Majesty has a majestic

359
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,400
and noble look as Hess,

360
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,760
and is tall and straight like a pine tree,

361
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,040
lofty like a jade mountain to be collapsing

362
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,480
Your Majesty

363
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,600
has an overwhelming light that I dare not face it.

364
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,480
So stubborn!

365
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,480
Come on.

366
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,900
- Look who I am?
- I dare not

367
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,840
I dare not.

368
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,840
I'm Crow.

369
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,140
Crow!

370
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,860
How could it be you?

371
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,860
You scared the hell out of me?

372
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,520
You can talk now.

373
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,980
You can hear me now.

374
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,360
Why don't you just be a bandit?

375
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,680
What are you doing here?

376
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,100
Your dressing like this

377
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,920
does make you look like a king.

378
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,220
You...

379
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,200
are not the real king, right?

380
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,140
Your Majesty!

381
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,800
I... I admit my sins.

382
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,680
I admit my sins.

383
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,680
Your Majesty, won't you kill me?

384
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,020
When did I say I'll kill you?

385
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,280
It's probably

386
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,960
what the fabled saying,
a blessing in disguise means?

387
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,520
Crow said when he left that he'll repay the favor.

388
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,260
And he asked me to come here.

389
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,260
Won't it be that he will pay his debt of gratitude?

390
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,700
It's good to repay a favor!

391
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,780
But the royal extravagance is totally different

392
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,920
with such a long foreshadowing

393
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,000
Your Majesty

394
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,440
Here is a battle report.

395
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,280
The Saint Girl has finished the diagnosis.

396
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,780
You come to the study with me.

397
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,220
Yes.

398
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,720
I never thought Crow would be King Yi.

399
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,840
Looks like I saved my little life.

400
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,940
But I haven't diagnosed the illness of King Yi.

401
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,760
How will I report to the Duke Nanping?

402
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,980
And who was the person poisoned King Yi?

403
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,900
Chief Peony.

404
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,640
Jin Mi is experiencing hardships
in the mortal world.

405
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,980
How does your Highness
come to the Floral Realm now?

406
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,660
I'm worried about her experiencing
hardships alone in the mortal world.

407
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,780
I want to go look at it.

408
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,780
So I hereby come to notify the Water Immortal.

409
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,480
You're really considerate!

410
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,520
Jin Mi is ill-fated.

411
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,000
I want to ask Your Highness,
do you truly love her

412
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,120
without distractions?

413
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,600
I surely do.

414
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,600
You don't need to question that, Chief Peony.

415
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,740
In every case, if one gives true love to the other,

416
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,700
he will wait for equal return from the other.

417
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,800
If Jin Mi is like a barren land

418
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,600
which will never bloom

419
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,740
whatever seed you sow
and whatever fertilizer you apply,

420
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,080
and however you water it

421
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,560
And talking about love with her
is like a stone sinking in the sea,

422
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,140
without any response.

423
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,860
If it's so time consuming and troublesome,
will your Highness fear that?

424
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,220
Why should I fear this?

425
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,120
If the time is bound to be wasted,

426
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,980
then I will only be willing to idle away the time with her.

427
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,700
But,

428
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,840
why are you so pessimistic about Jin Mi's love?

429
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,080
Jin Mi is kind by nature,

430
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,840
it's just that she was born with indifferent feelings.

431
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,560
No one will come into her eyes,

432
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,240
not will he go into her heart.

433
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,240
But I should say

434
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,200
faith will move mountains.

435
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,200
If so,

436
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,040
then I hope Your Highness
will have your wish fulfilled.

437
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,640
Your Highness seems to
have something on your mind.

438
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,200
I know that

439
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,440
it's the destiny of Jin Mi to experience hardships,

440
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,500
but I'm still a little worried.

441
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,500
I want to...

442
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,900
You want to go down to the mortal world.

443
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,180
Yes.

444
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,540
Descending to the mortal world privately
is a violation against the heavenly law.

445
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,540
For the sake of Mi,

446
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,940
whatever just comes if
it violates the heavenly rules.

447
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,480
I’ll take my leave.

448
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,780
I'll come and play chess
with Mister Immortal next time.

449
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,780
Hold on.

450
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,040
Be careful.

451
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,860
Please rest assured, Mister Immortal.

452
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,180
So Crow is King Yi.

453
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,120
And King Yi is Crow.
Things are unpredictable!

454
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,980
But the words that are annotated here

455
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,580
is exactly the same as Crow.

456
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,900
Is it possible that

457
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,520
Crow lied to me.

458
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,360
Like I said,

459
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,520
taking the prescription I prepared

460
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,020
he must have recovered within three days.

461
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,620
He even lied to me, pretending not to hear me

462
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,740
and wrote down everything I said.

463
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,620
Didn't he do that to embarrass me deliberately?

464
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,660
Well, never mind.

465
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,180
I forgive his rudeness.

466
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,340
As long as Crow is safe and sound,

467
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,100
that would be great.

468
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,200
The great immortal... the great immortal...

469
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,940
I beg you to show your power.

470
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,360
Please show your power.

471
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,780
Bless Crow, bless His Majesty,

472
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,500
a good physical health and longevity.

473
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,540
This way,

474
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,960
I'll be buried with him
to the netherworld a little later.

475
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,300
God Bless.

476
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,260
God Bless. God Bless.

477
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,680
Don't be afraid, Jin Mi.

478
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,660
The great immortal really makes its presence!

479
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,800
I'm not dreaming, right, the great immortal?

480
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,060
I'm not dreaming!

481
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,000
I've dreamed of you since I was a kid.

482
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I told people but they didn't believe me.

483
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,740
I never thought I'd see an immortal today.

484
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,100
I truly see you.

485
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,020
I had to be with you in the form of
my primordial spirit in your dream.

486
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,460
If I don't show up now,

487
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,020
I'm afraid I can't keep you anymore.

488
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
It's not a dream at this moment.

489
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,460
I...I saw you in my dream before.

490
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,660
You never say a word.

491
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,560
You...you're...

492
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,240
You're the King of Medicine, Sun Zhenren.

493
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,580
You're touched by my diligence and endeavor

494
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,140
and so you show up to encourage me?

495
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,840
No.

496
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,600
So...so what kind of immortal are you?

497
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,020
I'm just a...

498
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,220
an immortal herding the deer

499
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,140
Well, where's your deer?

500
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,540
I didn't take him with me, I just came myself.

501
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,520
An immortal herding the deer
is anyhow an immortal.

502
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,220
To show up for a mortal like me

503
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,220
would have been hard for the great immortal,

504
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,880
but I even embarrassed him.

505
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,720
I really opened up a can of worms.

506
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,920
He must have felt embarrassed.

507
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,760
I think the post of your great immortal

508
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,960
is very promising.

509
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,960
It's said in the story that

510
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,960
in those days, Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven,

511
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,020
stood out from a Supervisor for Heavenly Horses

512
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,960
in the animal husbandry sector.

513
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,820
How amazing he was in his journey to the West later!

514
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,820
The Buddha even granted him

515
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,080
a title, The Monkey King.

516
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,080
And also Zhang Guolao, one of the Eight Immortals.

517
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,640
He herded a donkey before he became an immortal.

518
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,900
He became glorious and respectable later.

519
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,400
So, I think

520
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,620
the great immortal have
boundless prospects in the future.

521
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,760
Exactly the same.

522
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,220
Exactly the same.
What do you mean by that?

523
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,760
Who am I exactly the same as?

524
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,000
A friend of mine.

525
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,240
She said the same thing as you did.

526
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,950
It's indeed my great honor

527
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,920
of saying the same thing as your friend did.

528
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,640
Well...well, that friend of yours,

529
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,620
is she an immortal?

530
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,620
Exactly.

531
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,520
I didn't expect I'm really
related to an immortal a little bit.

532
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,120
Not only a little bit.

533
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,100
Jin Mi, you can call me Run Yu.

534
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,680
Can I?

535
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,440
Immortal Run Yu

536
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,530
"Beiyuan Villa"

537
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,340
The scent of the person who saved me that day

538
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,340
finally led me here.

539
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,900
Is it a coincidence or what?

540
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,720
Who are you?

541
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,440
Why did you use your psychic power to save me?

542
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,680
And why do you sneak into the Beiyuan Villa?

543
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,820
Stop!

544
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,860
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow!

545
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,320
The moves...

546
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,139
Are you a friend of mine I once knew?

547
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,719
As the Princess of the Demon Realm,

548
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,300
shouldn't you only think of
killing me when you see it?

549
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,960
Why do you ask so many questions instead?

550
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,720
I didn't find that

551
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,960
the firmament of our Demon Realm is so beautiful

552
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,560
What is this?

553
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,660
Today is your birthday.

554
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,140
I saw your mansion was covered with gifts.

555
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,900
I hope

556
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,980
Your Highness will not reject my shabby gift.

557
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,800
The gifts from the six realms

558
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,320
are all the same every year.

559
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,160
I've been bored with that.

560
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,080
To save the face of my father,

561
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,000
I had to go through the motions.

562
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,200
I'll punish you if I'm not satisfied.

563
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,500
You'll have to move everything in my storeroom

564
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,580
to your own room.

565
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,940
so as not to take my place.

566
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,620
I wish Your Highness would like it.

567
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,720
What is this treasure?

568
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,460
What's so special about it?

569
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,720
It is a piece of pure brass

570
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,060
I found in the furthest border
in the mortal world.

571
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,800
You've been missing for three months,

572
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,360
and you went find this thing.

573
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,220
I've watched the weapon of Your Highness.

574
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,940
Your Demon Bone Whip

575
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,260
is not easy to inlay with ornaments

576
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,960
like other swords.

577
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,340
So I went find this piece of brass

578
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,960
and will engrave the name of your Highness on it.

579
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,300
It's just going to fit.

580
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,520
How do you know I envy
Xuan Shou's sword tassels?

581
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,760
In that case, let's do the engraving now.

582
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,780
Your Highness, please wait.

583
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,480
If you use spells,

584
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,920
it would have nothing different

585
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,220
with the other gifts.

586
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,400
What do you mean?

587
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,060
Inside the Qingtian Cave,

588
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,060
the names we engraved together

589
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,060
and the time we spent together

590
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,860
will never disappear even after thousands of years

591
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,660
and will become our memories

592
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,340
we’ll never wipe away.

593
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,400
That is the gift I'm going to give you.

594
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,620
You do have a mind on it.

595
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,580
I will always carry this gift.

596
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,880
It's your voice, Mu Ci.
