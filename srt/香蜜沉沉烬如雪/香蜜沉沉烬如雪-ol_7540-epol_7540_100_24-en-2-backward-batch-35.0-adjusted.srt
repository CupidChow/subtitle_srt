00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 24"

3
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,780
Who are you?

4
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,340
Why did you use your power to save me?

5
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,900
Stop!

6
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,700
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow!

7
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,620
Mu Ci.

8
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,000
Your Highness, you got the wrong person.

9
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,360
Can you show me your face then?

10
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:06,360
We are just strangers, we don't have to meet.

11
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,540
Well, why are you carrying
the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

12
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,500
And why do you sneak into the Beiyuan Villa?

13
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,180
Your target is Xu Feng, isn't it?

14
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,480
Do you know the consequences
of perishing his primordial spirit?

15
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,020
Mu Ci, I know it's you.

16
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,900
You just made the same moves as before.

17
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,400
Your Highness, you should just take care of yourself.

18
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,740
Mu Ci…

19
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,200
Mu Ci, please show up.

20
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,160
Mu Ci, please show up.

21
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,460
Come out and see me.

22
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,760
Why do you pretend not to know me?

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,640
How could it be?
How?

24
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,440
You gave my memory back to me!

25
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,140
Mu Ci.

26
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,080
Give it back to me!

27
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,560
Why did you ask me to come here?

28
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,840
You sent me a gift that I liked so much.

29
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,660
I should certainly return a gift.

30
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,300
Look!

31
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,600
A heart!

32
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,800
Now I give my heart to you,

33
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,640
you should keep it well.

34
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,380
Sure.

35
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,240
I promise you.

36
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,920
I'll wear it where it's closest to my heart

37
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,920
until the last moment of my life, okay?

38
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,800
Sorry!

39
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,780
I broke my promise.

40
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,040
"Beiyuan Villa"

41
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,660
My Majesty, what is your discomfort today?

42
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,680
I feel dyspnea and shortness of breath.

43
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,880
His pulse shows that

44
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,380
he has smooth breaths.

45
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,320
What's there to diagnose?

46
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,080
If Your Majesty feels dyspnea
and shortness of breath,

47
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,620
I'll go prepare a piece of tonic medicine

48
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,640
to replenish your heart and lungs.

49
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,360
I'm sure

50
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,780
you can breathe smoothly after taking it.

51
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,800
Apart from the feeling of dyspnea
and shortness of breath,

52
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,900
I also have a splitting headache today.

53
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,560
Why do you trouble me again?

54
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,280
There's no problem with the pulse.

55
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,900
What's there to diagnose?

56
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,300
Your Majesty has been worrying
too much over the state affairs for days.

57
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,760
So I'll prepare a tranquilizer.

58
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,500
I'm sure it'll relieve your headache.

59
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,120
Apart from the feeling of dyspnea
and shortness of breath,

60
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,260
and a splitting headache,
I also have bad appetites

61
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:13,040
and lost sleep.

62
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:16,620
Why do you give me a tough task every day?

63
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,060
The pulse is quite good.

64
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:20,500
What's there to diagnose?

65
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,040
Your Majesty, when did these symptoms started?

66
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,220
And how long have they lasted?

67
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,520
It's always like this when you're gone,

68
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,320
and seeing you will ease it a little bit.

69
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,740
I heard the Saint Doctors' Family
has the medical skill

70
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,520
that is second to none.

71
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,600
As the Saint Girl of Saint Doctors' Family,

72
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,760
you've already come here for a couple of days.

73
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,140
But you haven't yet diagnosed what disease I have,

74
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,200
and just fool me with some useless medicine.

75
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,140
Don't you feel ashamed?

76
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,420
Please forgive me for my disability.

77
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,700
Your Majesty, please give me some more time.

78
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,720
I will surely cure your illness.

79
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,919
Couldn't King Yi have got lovesick?

80
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:09,080
How could it be?

81
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,500
King Yi has never seen

82
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,620
my face!

83
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,380
If he's got lovesick, he loves someone else.

84
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,380
That's right.

85
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,340
Guess what,

86
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,380
could it be that His Majesty has got sick

87
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,500
because of missing somebody?

88
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,940
As I said, you didn't get
the essence when learning.

89
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,100
Well, tell me

90
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,840
which medical book has mentioned lovesick?

91
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,060
Go, go, go, and get me the book.

92
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,480
If we fail to cure His Majesty,

93
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,960
we both have to be implicated.

94
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,400
I see.

95
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,180
Go quickly!

96
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,060
Lovesick?

97
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,020
"Beiyuan Villa"

98
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,660
I heard that these days

99
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,460
His Majesty always called in

100
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,760
that Saint Girl of Saint Doctors' Family.

101
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,200
And she stayed in there for quite a while.

102
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,120
In the past, if Princess Sui He came,

103
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,480
His Majesty used to send her
away with just a few words.

104
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,320
Looks like His Majesty treats
the Saint Girl quite differently.

105
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,320
That's it.

106
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,660
His Majesty has a heart for the Saint Girl.

107
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,880
You see, the tributary fresh fruits

108
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,460
were recently sent to the Saint Girl every day.

109
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,460
Could it be that His Majesty loves the Saint Girl?

110
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,780
It's the Beiyuan Villa here.

111
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,540
There are some words we can't speak.

112
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,260
Let's go.

113
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,760
Saint Girl,

114
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,140
this is from Duke Nanping.

115
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,600
He hopes Saint Girl

116
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,260
can answer the questions well.

117
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,320
At this time after five days,

118
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,160
I'll come and pick up the letter of reply.

119
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,180
What are you thinking of?

120
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,620
It's you, Qiang Huo!

121
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,760
I wasn't thinking of anything?

122
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,300
Jin Mi, according to your observation,

123
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,140
is the life of His Majesty in danger?

124
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,800
If so,

125
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,880
why don't we go back early?

126
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,140
Although the life of His Majesty isn't in danger,

127
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,940
he does have different physical discomforts.

128
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,380
Now that we're here,

129
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,040
how can we return without curing him?

130
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,800
If we fail to diagnose his symptoms,

131
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,880
we'll disgrace our Saint Doctors' Family, aren't we?

132
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,480
Besides,

133
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
if he doesn't get well,

134
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,700
I'm going to be buried with him sooner or later.

135
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,320
Am I right?

136
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,000
You mean cousin often calls in
the Saint Girl to his bedroom.

137
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,200
and she stayed there for quite a while.

138
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,920
All the people in the mansion said that

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,140
His Majesty cares a lot for the Saint Girl.

140
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,140
and treats her differently.

141
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,920
Cousin has a physical malaise these days

142
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,680
and the Saint Girl of Saint Doctors' Family

143
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,000
has the top-notch medical skill,

144
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,240
there's no harm for her to stay long there

145
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,180
as she is devoted to cure him.

146
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,340
Don't guess blindly like others.

147
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,340
Yes.

148
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,080
Well, do you know the name of the Saint Girl?

149
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,680
She's called Jin Mi.

150
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,680
Jin Mi.

151
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,680
As I see, Your Majesty has
a good appetite these two days.

152
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,620
That's true.

153
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,660
But I don't let Jin...

154
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,980
don't let the Saint Girl know it.

155
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,360
Otherwise our efforts will be in vain.

156
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,720
Speaking of the Saint Girl,

157
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,020
she didn't have a bite of the food

158
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,800
we sent there these two days.

159
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,640
Were the dishes not delicious?

160
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,980
According to the maid, the Saint Girl is sick.

161
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,020
So the summon of Your Majesty today...

162
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,360
I'm afraid she can't make it.

163
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,380
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

164
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,480
The wind was so strong that day,

165
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,940
I told you not to sit in the yard that long.

166
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,200
but you didn't listen to me, did you?

167
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,560
Come on, take the medicine and you'll get better.

168
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,420
My respects...

169
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,300
How did you get sick?

170
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,760
Your Majesty, the Saint Girl
is just infected with the wind chill.

171
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,680
She will be fine after taking
the medicine and rest for two days.

172
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,480
There'll be no big deal.

173
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,700
It's been two days.

174
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,980
Why haven't she got well?

175
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,140
You're also from Saint Doctors' Family, aren't you?

176
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,520
Why can't you cure a minor illness like this?

177
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,660
Why does His Majesty get so angry?

178
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,140
Is he angry for I can't go see him?

179
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,040
But his energy is

180
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,260
really great today.

181
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,660
Take your leave.

182
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,960
Yes.

183
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,900
Your Majesty, my...my...

184
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,240
There's no need.

185
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,420
I allow you not to greet me from now on.

186
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,380
So handsome and so gentle!

187
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,020
The future queen has a great blessing.

188
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,220
I can do it myself.

189
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,040
My grapes

190
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,620
are all sweet.

191
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,960
Xu Feng, I have given way to you since childhood.

192
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,660
But for Jin Mi,

193
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,280
I won't give in.

194
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,020
Jin Mi...

195
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,660
I don't know what background the Saint Girl has.

196
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,120
Who are you?

197
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,920
My respects, Princess Sui He.

198
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,600
Princess

199
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,600
Heavenly Empress asked me

200
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,580
to unseal the immortal memories of your Highness.

201
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,720
What immortal memories?

202
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,240
What the hell are you talking about?

203
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,380
Sorry to offense.

204
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:16,960
You...

205
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,300
Don't come over here. Don't come over.

206
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,480
Do you know who my cousin is?

207
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,280
How dare you! I'll kill you.

208
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,480
This is supposed to be the Spirit-Vanishing
Arrow my foster mother mentioned.

209
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,860
Who the hell is he?

210
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,320
He's so hard to deal with.

211
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:52,330
"Beiyuan Villa"

212
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,240
Qiang Huo, why do you get up so early?

213
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,080
Your Majesty!

214
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,700
Has your wind cold healed?

215
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,960
I am still waiting for

216
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,920
your diagnosis and treatment.

217
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,440
I have recovered.

218
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,560
Sorry to let you worry.

219
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,760
Your Majesty, do you still have the
feeling of dyspnea and shortness of breath,

220
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,100
splitting headache or other discomforts these days?

221
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,140
Why don't you make another diagnosis on me?

222
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,980
Smile so warm like the spring breeze.

223
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,160
He should be in a good mood today.

224
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,180
Yesterday, he came here with
jubilant strides and rosy complexion.

225
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,500
And now his breath is even and his face radiant.

226
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,940
It's completely unlike what he said.

227
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,240
He is not that weak.

228
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,800
Please forgive me for my disability.

229
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,000
The pulse of Your Majesty is strong and steady.

230
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,940
I said earlier that I felt dyspnea and
shortness of breath, splitting headache,

231
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,660
bad appetites and sleep.

232
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,800
Although it is a little bit exaggerated,

233
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,540
these symptoms

234
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,220
were truly what I felt.

235
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,320
As the Saint Girl of Saint Doctors' Family,

236
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,280
you don't know what the symptoms are.

237
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,560
Your Majesty, I...

238
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,890
You're not experienced.

239
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,310
I can't blame it on you.

240
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,060
My disease shouldn’t have been recorded

241
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,100
in the ordinary medical books.

242
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,620
Your Majesty, as far as I know,

243
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,280
your pulse

244
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,480
indicates

245
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,200
the sick of love?

246
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,460
You... you already figured it out?

247
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,660
Yes.

248
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,040
It seems

249
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,960
that girl is the right medicine of Your Majesty.

250
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,060
Let me ask you,

251
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,060
You want me to be sick

252
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,300
or healthy?

253
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,320
What do you mean by that, Your Majesty?

254
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,820
I certainly hope Your Majesty is healthy

255
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,120
and enjoys longevity.

256
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,920
Come on, here comes the freshly ground sesame paste.

257
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,760
So sweet-smelling...

258
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,340
I didn't know Your Majesty is here.

259
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,180
Please forgive my rudeness.

260
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,440
Qiang Huo?

261
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,780
Why is it so familiar to me?

262
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,060
So I suggest

263
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,000
Your Majesty can try a herb, Qiang Huo.

264
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,940
Qiang Huo?

265
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,120
Exactly.

266
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:27,000
Apart from dispelling coldness,
eliminating wind and cold,

267
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,700
this medicine can also cure Yang...

268
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,940
this medicine can also cure your

269
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,820
kidney deficiency.

270
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,640
Well, the Lantern Festival is coming in a few days,

271
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,300
I'd like to ask you what kind of lantern you like.

272
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,320
The phoenix lantern.

273
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,880
Mu Ci.

274
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,720
Mu Ci.

275
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,900
What's wrong?

276
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,040
What's wrong?

277
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,900
What's going on?

278
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,080
What's going on?

279
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,080
Your Highness!

280
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,360
Jump over here.

281
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,260
Damn, this is the Nether Fury.

282
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,420
Your Highness!

283
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,240
Mu Ci.

284
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,920
Mu Ci.

285
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,050
Wangchuan River gathers
grievances and resentments,

286
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,760
even the immortals and demons fear it.

287
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,980
Your Highness, you go first!

288
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,340
Mu Ci, don't force yourself to confront it.

289
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,800
You'll receive a countercharge.

290
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,580
Mu Ci.

291
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,140
Mu Ci.

292
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,760
Mu Ci.

293
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,540
Your Highness, go quickly!

294
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,380
Mu Ci.

295
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,640
Mu Ci.

296
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,640
What the hell happened back then?

297
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,200
Why don't you want to recognize me?

298
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,160
Since we came here,

299
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,220
you've been gloomy with worry and sadness.

300
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,160
What happened?

301
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:56,940
Nothing.

302
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,640
Perhaps, it's because I'm a bit acclimatized.

303
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,240
I see that His Majesty is energetic,

304
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,640
he doesn't look like a sick person.

305
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,500
Why don't we go back to Saint Doctors' Family?

306
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,900
The mission of our Saint Doctors' Family

307
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,220
is to ensure the health of His Majesty.

308
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,160
Now His Majesty himself has not said he’s recovered.

309
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,680
How can we leave without permission?

310
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,380
You can't, or you don't want to?

311
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,880
I'm the Saint Girl, and I'll undertake it.

312
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,860
Saint Girl...

313
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,600
I hope you can remember that.

314
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,340
What's wrong with you today?

315
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,280
I'm fine.

316
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,620
What am I going to do?

317
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,860
Crow, Duke Nanping...

318
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,140
Who should I choose?

319
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,380
Have you heard anything from the Saint Girl?

320
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,200
My lord, there's no news.

321
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,440
Looks like she didn't know what I am capable of.

322
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,160
It's time to exert some pressure on her.

323
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,220
"Beiyuan Villa"

324
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,560
Who are you?

325
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,220
Are you all right?
Did you get hurt?

326
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,380
I'm fine.

327
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,840
Thank you, Immortal Run Yu.

328
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,440
That was close.

329
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,540
If it weren't for your show-up,

330
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,700
my little life was just over there.

331
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,200
Have you offended anybody?

332
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,580
I've been in contact with very few people

333
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
as I grew up,

334
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,220
let alone offend someone.

335
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,040
Would it be Duke Nanping?

336
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,140
But he just sent a letter hours ago,

337
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,760
and wanna kill me so soon.

338
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,240
It's irrational.

339
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,560
That arrow was weird.

340
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,100
It's absolutely not a weapon a mortal should have.

341
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,460
It seems...

342
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,280
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

343
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,140
What a nice piece of fish scale!

344
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,000
It's a piece of dragon scale.

345
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,800
Dragon scale?

346
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,540
It's for you.
If you want to see me,

347
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,700
just say the dragon-summon spell.

348
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,680
Dragon-summon spell?

349
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,720
Thank you, Immortal Run Yu.

350
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,320
So fragrant.

351
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,560
It smells a bit like ambergris.

352
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,600
But better than that.

353
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,900
It's cool and sweet,

354
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,360
exactly like your body scent.

355
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,100
I wonder if I could use it as a guiding drug.

356
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,520
It's the only piece.

357
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,860
It's a pity if it's used as medicine.

358
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,840
I'm kidding.

359
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,120
You give me such a precious thing,

360
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,500
I'll sure keep it good and keep it safe.

361
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,180
There was once a fairy

362
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,560
who promised to appreciate the epiphyllum with me.

363
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,860
But then for a variety of reasons,

364
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,100
she failed to make it.

365
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,920
Ten days later, the flower will bloom again.

366
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,260
I wonder if I could invite you

367
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,880
to appreciate it with me.

368
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,300
You saved my life, gave me the dragon scale,

369
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,920
and invited me to appreciate the flower.

370
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,940
That's very kind of you, Immortal Run Yu.

371
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,360
But this makes me embarrassed.

372
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,640
If you are happy to take it,

373
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,880
I will be contented.

374
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,200
You are neither relative nor friend to me,

375
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,380
how can I have the cheek to receive it?

376
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,920
Though I have no valuables,

377
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,600
if you have any wishes,

378
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,300
just tell me and I'm sure
I'll do whatever I can to make it.

379
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,400
Well...

380
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,880
can you make wine?

381
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,540
Make...make wine?

382
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,520
I have a friend who always says

383
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,640
"Appreciate the flowers and drink the wine;

384
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,420
It’s so pleasant that you'll be reluctant to return home."

385
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,780
Fine, fine. I’m on that.

386
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,320
Looks like your old friend

387
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,580
is pretty interesting.

388
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,630
Tonight the sky has lost its brilliance

389
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,760
since your Highness failed to
arrange the stars in the sky.

390
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,220
It's so boring.

391
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,640
Your Highness.

392
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,880
Please take a seat.

393
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,820
In the huge Heaven Realm, the only one who knows

394
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,560
I am absent would be you.

395
00:33:39,699 --> 00:33:41,300
You descend to the mortal world in the deep night,

396
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:44,139
I'm afraid it's not just about for Zen meditation.

397
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:45,000
It’s not that simple, isn’t it?

398
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,080
I dare not say an insinuating word
before your Highness.

399
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,719
This time, Fairy Jin Mi experiences
her inexorable doom.

400
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,940
His Majesty ordered that no fairies and immortals

401
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,540
shall intervene.

402
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,020
Your Highness, you went a little over this time.

403
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,739
My father sent you to take care of Jin Mi,

404
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,960
but just now Jin Mi was close to lose her life.

405
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,460
I think you must have also seen
through the mortal world-viewing mirror

406
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,000
that the murderer was not a mortal.

407
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,900
I wonder how can you

408
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,920
afford to bear the delinquency of lack of care.

409
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,000
Essentially,

410
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,040
how dare I violate the order of my father!

411
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,440
You also have your difficulty,

412
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,200
I don't want to delve into it.

413
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,020
Just the tree desires stillness
but the wind will not cease.

414
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,020
I wanted to make concessions to avoid trouble,

415
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,120
but some people are just trying to be malicious.

416
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,760
Ultimately,

417
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,540
Jin Mi is my fiancée.

418
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,240
If something happens to her,

419
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,560
then even my word does not carry much weight,

420
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,560
I will never sit idly by.

421
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,180
Even it stirs up trouble in
the Empyrean Cloud Palace,

422
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,440
I won't fear at all.

423
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,620
Your Highness, you take it too seriously.

424
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,120
No one dares to harm the
heavenly consort of your Highness.

425
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,270
What's more, it is Heavenly Emperor's order,

426
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,560
I'll surely do with all my heart.

427
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,040
Well, that's the best way to say it.

428
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
And my final reminder,

429
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,840
Jin Mi is not only my fiancée,

430
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,860
she is also the daughter of the
former Floral Immortal and the Water Immortal.

431
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,700
Even His Majesty regards her with special concern.

432
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,740
Straightly speaking, the experience of inexorable doom

433
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,380
is only to

434
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,260
make an exception to
grant Jin Mi the Floral Immortal.

435
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,320
Just the motions to go through.

436
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,620
In case anything happens to the next Floral Immortal,

437
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,080
His Majesty will be sure to strictly investigate it.

438
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,900
Who do you think

439
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,500
will be the scapegoat?

440
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,740
By that time,

441
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,460
who will stand out

442
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,200
and keep you safe.

443
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,700
You're wise.

444
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,140
You should have the right answer

445
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,680
for which eye to open and which to close.

446
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,500
It's so late, you can leave now.

447
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,700
"Palace of Duke Nanping"
It's not far from the front.

448
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,860
Father,

449
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,980
Our respects, your Highness.

450
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,600
Sui, you're here.

451
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,660
Good.

452
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,820
You can leave now.

453
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,420
Yes.

454
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,360
Father.

455
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,180
Your father and Minister Fu,

456
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,660
which is more magnanimous?

457
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,720
Naturally, my father is.

458
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,420
How can Minister Fu compare with my father?

459
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,380
How about His Majesty?

460
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,200
My father’s absolutely perfect when he was young.

461
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,480
My cousin was not born yet.

462
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,300
In my heart,

463
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,880
my father is always the best father in the world,

464
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,540
with imposing appearance and graceful bearing.

465
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:14,000
What a sweet heart you are!

466
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,660
You're so smart.

467
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,360
I don't know which guy will be so much blessed

468
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,340
to marry you in the future.

469
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,740
I'm afraid I'll envy him to death.

470
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,460
Father, you said that again.

471
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,120
In the big Huaiwu,

472
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,100
the one who will make me willing to cook for him

473
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
will be nobody else.

474
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,020
Father, are you going to envy my cousin?

475
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,760
You're talking about your cousin all the time.

476
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,560
Girls truly have outward hearts.

477
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,520
My daughter,

478
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,600
I raised you for His Majesty.

479
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,820
What are you talking about, father?

480
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,560
Isn't it okay if I don't get marry?

481
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,400
Marquis.

482
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,120
This is the golden snow bird's nest
that her Highness cooked for you.

483
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,460
Since father thought I have an outward heart,

484
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,300
then father would better not
eat the golden snow bird's nest

485
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,440
I cooked for you specially.

486
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,860
No one is allowed to rob what my daughter gives me.

487
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,320
Just take your time.

488
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,920
You forgot the way of keeping good health again.

489
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,720
How does it taste?

490
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,040
Great!

491
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,100
It's carefully prepared by my beloved daughter,
how could it be not good?

492
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:28,980
The best taste in the world is nothing more than this.

493
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,520
It was decided yesterday that we would
discuss the affairs from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. today.

494
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,680
But it's noon now.
His Majesty is always punctual.

495
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,880
Is it possible that

496
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,960
the rumor is true that

497
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,080
His Majesty has got some unmentionable disease.

498
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,880
That's groundless statement.

499
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,140
You don’t need to worry.

500
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,040
Lord, when hunting in Luoye Mountain,

501
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,320
did anything happen to His Majesty?

502
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,960
I heard there was a Liangguo troop in ambush...

503
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,440
Minister Fu, you and me are servants to His Majesty.

504
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,000
We shall only exert all our strengths
and be loyal to His Majesty.

505
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,270
It could be a mess outside the court
and among the lower officials

506
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,400
that doesn't matter.

507
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,960
However, we can't mess up.

508
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,480
Send the Saint Girl of Saint Doctors' Family quickly!

509
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:33,840
Yes.

510
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,880
General Qin

511
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,860
what's wrong with His Majesty?

512
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,420
His Majesty doesn't feel well, please go back.

513
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,360
Minister, please wait.

514
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,140
Get out of the way!

515
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,600
-Your Majesty
-Your Majesty
