1
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 03"

3
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,240
Such powerful water spell.

4
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,640
Who else could cast it other than
you here in the heaven?

5
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,560
Moreover, a servant saw you
around Qiwu Palace on that day.

6
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,840
You were supposed to guard the
Northern Heavenly Gate that night.

7
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,440
Something went wrong with
Xu Feng's nirvana.

8
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,000
Tell me,

9
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,520
is this real?

10
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,820
Father.

11
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,360
That night,

12
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,360
I did drop by at Qiwu Palace.

13
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,730
Your Majesty.

14
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,820
I know that Xu Feng is having a
hard time with his nirvana.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,040
I followed the man in black
to Qiwu Palace.

16
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,350
I wanted to protect him.

17
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,620
But...

18
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,940
How was it?

19
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,120
You'd seen that person?

20
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,310
Who was he?

21
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,920
Why didn't you inform us?

22
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,880
I fought with the man in black.

23
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,840
I could tell that he's powerful but
he wasn't interested in fighting.

24
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,640
He ran away after a few rounds.

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,360
I saw Lord Liaoyuan was
guarding Qiwu Palace,

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,720
and it was at the crucial moment
of Xu Feng's nirvana.

27
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,170
I didn't want to disturb him.

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,440
So I left after a few words
with Liaoyuan.

29
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,870
We never would have expected you to say this,

30
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,670
but your words alone,

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,800
are not convincing.

32
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,560
I know that Father and
Mother are wise,

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,480
I would never hurt Xu Feng.

34
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,600
I practice water spell.

35
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,810
I can never get near to
the flame of nirvana.

36
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
That's the first point.

37
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,680
Secondly,

38
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,260
I was injured by that person
due to carelessness.

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,640
Even though he used the sleet,

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,079
but he seems to be fearless to fire.

41
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,280
You're burnt.

42
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,160
Why didn't you inform us
regarding your injury?

43
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,410
Black feathers doesn't necessarily
belong to crow or magpie.

44
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,760
They might belong to a burnt phoenix.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'd never imagined this crow
to be a magical bird.

46
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,640
We'll have endless supply
of elixir pills then.

47
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,460
We can't blame Liaoyuan for this.

48
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,360
Nirvana of the phoenix family
has always been risky.

49
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,390
Though I've fallen into wilderness,

50
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,780
but I'm back unharmed with the
help of the little demon.

51
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,640
It's my destiny after all.

52
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,710
Your Highness, since you're back safe,

53
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,080
I'll have nothing to worry about.

54
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,409
Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Empress
are worried about your safety.

55
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:00,010
They'd called in Night Immortal just now...

56
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,670
to punish him.

57
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,850
Run Yu?

58
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,000
Take me to my father now.

59
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,960
Your Majesty.

60
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,720
Investigation wasn't done yet.

61
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,150
By listening to Run Yu's mere words...

62
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,440
The Fire Immortal has arrived!

63
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,330
Greetings to Father and Mother.

64
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,520
Xu! Xu!

65
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,750
Please get up. Are you hurt?

66
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,480
I was so worried.

67
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,970
I apologize for causing you to worry.

68
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,590
What'd happened?

69
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,310
Where were you all this while?

70
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,820
Father.

71
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,520
I was attacked during my nirvana...

72
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,910
by sleet weapon.

73
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,480
And I'd fallen into wilderness
for a few days.

74
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,960
And I wanted to find the culprit.

75
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,400
Therefore I've spent a few days more.

76
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,200
I'd never expected to
bring chaos to you.

77
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,950
I was being reckless.

78
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,960
Please forgive me.

79
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,659
Have you found the culprit?

80
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Not yet.

81
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,400
But I'm sure that it has nothing
to do with brother.

82
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,480
I've found out some traces.

83
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,360
The truth will be unearthed soon.

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,360
Stand up.

85
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,720
Both of you...

86
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,000
do care a lot about each other.

87
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,800
I'm happy to see this.

88
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,400
Good that you're back.

89
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,920
During the days when you're gone,

90
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,640
your mother has been
worried about you.

91
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,260
You have to comfort her.

92
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,610
Yes.

93
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,910
I know.

94
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,330
It's really a good news that
The Fire Immortal is now back.

95
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,650
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

96
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,880
Your Majesty.

97
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,670
Since Xu is now back safe.

98
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,660
I hope that you'll
fulfill your promise.

99
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,080
Summon the six realms.

100
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,510
And decide on the titles.

101
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,440
Father. Mother.

102
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,240
What is it all about?

103
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,320
Your father and I had made a vow.

104
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,040
The day when you're back safe,

105
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,909
will be the day the Heaven Realm
to crown it's crown prince.

106
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,750
Now that we're under the attack of
army of Demon Realm,

107
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
I think,

108
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,960
we'll talk about this when Xu Feng
brings victory home.

109
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,620
News!

110
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,510
Your Majesty!

111
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,600
The army of Demon Realm has
retreated from Lethe.

112
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,860
Any reason for that?

113
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,050
According to witness,

114
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,090
The Fire Immortal broke into King of
Yan City's headquarter last night,

115
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,760
and scared off the army.

116
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,900
Scaring the army off by
a mere appearance,

117
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,640
what an ability it is!

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,040
Your Majesty.

119
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,540
You have always been fair
with praise and punishment.

120
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,530
Fire Immortal.

121
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,920
What do you think?

122
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,000
I plead father and mother
to retrieve your order.

123
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,240
It's my job to lead the army and
protect my homeland.

124
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,360
Their retreat is just
a delaying tactic.

125
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,680
From what I'd observed
yesterday night,

126
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
the King of Yan City
will definitely be back.

127
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,720
Banishing the enemy is far more
important than anything else.

128
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,520
Please excuse me.

129
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,080
I shall prepare the army for war.

130
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,190
I can only help you to get rid of
the flame poison in your body.

131
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,760
You might experience pain
for these few days.

132
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,880
Our physiques contradict each other.

133
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,370
If I forcefully heal you,

134
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:04,950
you'll bear worse injury.

135
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,880
Fire and water have never
gotten along.

136
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,900
Please save your magical prowess
for something else.

137
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,480
I'm afraid that I can't handle more.

138
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,610
You know that fire and
water don't get along,

139
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,600
then why did you still
come to my rescue?

140
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,960
You'd do the same too, right?

141
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,360
Liaoyuan has just cleared the
ice poison in your body.

142
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,200
And now you're here to help me.

143
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,880
Mother will blame me if she
finds out about this.

144
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,920
This is to thank you
for saving my life.

145
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,200
Xu Feng.

146
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,510
Everyone suspected me.

147
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,680
Don't you have doubts?

148
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,080
Of course I do.

149
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,920
You can't run away if anything
happened to me.

150
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,280
I rushed to your rescue without even
changing into my clean clothes.

151
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,720
I thank you for that.

152
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,410
You're powerful.

153
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,080
But still you're severely injured.

154
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,350
Apparently the one who wanted to
kill me must be very powerful.

155
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,880
I'm afraid that I can't
handle him alone.

156
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,300
What happened that day?

157
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,260
During my nirvana that day,

158
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,230
I felt a decrease in
the fire intensity.

159
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,350
The surrounding was icy cold.

160
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,480
And I couldn't move.

161
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,480
I could only use my inner force to
pass through the meridians.

162
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,750
And jumped into the sea of cloud
without the enemy noticing.

163
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
As for the rest,

164
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,480
I knew nothing about it.

165
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,960
He is good at water spells,

166
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
and fearless of the flame of nirvana.

167
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,640
That's really weird.

168
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,680
I've told father and mother that
I will investigate this matter.

169
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,440
This is to put the enemy at ease,

170
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,080
and let you investigate
for me in secret.

171
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,000
And get the culprit caught
as soon as possible.

172
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,080
Don't worry.

173
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,920
I'll dig for the truth,

174
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,280
to make up to you.

175
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,960
And prove my innocence.

176
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,520
But still...

177
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,960
you have to brush up
your magical prowess.

178
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,600
So that you won't cause me trouble.

179
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,920
Just like today.

180
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,120
You're in such a mess.

181
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,070
"Zifangyun Palace"

182
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,160
Your Majesty.

183
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,480
Fire Immortal doesn't suspect him. He helped with his injury,

184
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,920
and they even had tea together.

185
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,910
They don't seem to be turning their
backs on each other.

186
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,160
Stupid child.

187
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,320
He doesn’t know that he's making
friends with the wrong people.

188
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,560
If it wasn't for me who
helps him in planning,

189
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,800
he wouldn't even know if he has
handed the throne to someone else.

190
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,800
Keep an eye on Run Yu.

191
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,400
If anything happens,

192
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,680
come to me at once.

193
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,880
Yes.

194
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,440
So this is Heavenly Palace?

195
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,480
There's nothing special
about it after all.

196
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,320
The mist is covering the floor,

197
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,440
I can't see the path properly.

198
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,360
Why did it disappear again?

199
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
What’s happening?

200
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,720
Those flowers look
green and cheerful,

201
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,800
why do they disappear after
I touch them?

202
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,720
Am I not powerful enough?

203
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,880
That even flowers look down on me?

204
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,600
Stingy.

205
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,240
I'm not plucking anymore.

206
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,800
Weird.

207
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,840
Why isn't there even a flower
in Phoenix's front yard?

208
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,200
I should have gone to other places.

209
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,680
Is this fox?

210
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,560
It feels soft by touch.

211
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,840
And it looks cute too.

212
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,440
I've been living for so many years,

213
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,530
finally someone harassed me.

214
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,080
I feel thankful for that.

215
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,790
Harass?

216
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,320
What does it mean?

217
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,360
Why do you say so?

218
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,160
Where do you come from, Fairchild?

219
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,800
What's your name?

220
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,760
I'm not a Fairchild.

221
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,760
Just call me Jin Mi.

222
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,440
I'm just...

223
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
I'm just a half-fairy.

224
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,160
Half-fairy?

225
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,000
Seems like I've taken a long nap.

226
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,680
There's a new ranking for fairy
in the Heaven Realm.

227
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,480
I'm half way through my practice,
that makes me a half-fairy.

228
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,520
Isn't this Xu Feng's garden?

229
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,760
So you're Xu Feng's Fairchild?

230
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,360
I'm not a Fairchild of
that burnt phoenix.

231
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
I'm his Saviour.

232
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,040
Saviour!

233
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,760
Come, little Jin Mi.
I love story time.

234
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,040
Let's go.

235
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,300
Who is he?

236
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,280
How can one be proficient in
both water and fire magic?

237
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,600
That phoenix was burnt and
fell into Floral Realm.

238
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
A gentleman in distress.

239
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,280
And I bumped into him.

240
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,520
Pretty Fairchild.

241
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,310
I passed him some air.

242
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,200
Body contact!

243
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,070
Then I waited for him
to regain consciousness.

244
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,320
Then what? Say it!

245
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,600
I was waiting for your...

246
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,180
After he woke up,

247
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,050
he brought me to the Heaven
Realm to thank me for helping.

248
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,680
That's how a romance started.

249
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,720
It's classic.

250
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,310
I like the story very much.

251
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,200
Why doesn't he smell bad?

252
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,680
Fate loves to make fun of people.

253
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,800
Too bad you're a boy.

254
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,620
I think Xu Feng would have
fallen for you.

255
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,360
The burnt phoenix said
that I'm a girl.

256
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,440
Am I a boy or a girl?

257
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,120
Little Jin Mi.

258
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,510
Let you tell you something.

259
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,440
I was the one who started the word
"bao en" (repay one's kindness).

260
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,230
But one of the words were passed down
wrongly time after time.

261
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,110
Which is such a waste of my effort.

262
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,720
This is the right word.

263
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,600
Bao (hug) en (kindness).

264
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,040
One must hug to repay the kindness.

265
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,800
Since you're the first one
who'd ever harassed me,

266
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,840
I'll give you a red string.

267
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,200
Tie it round Xu Feng's ankle.

268
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,600
So that your romance will blossom.

269
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,320
Bad luck will turn into good one.

270
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,040
Moon Immortal has been generous.

271
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,180
Five, six, seven,

272
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,280
eight, nine, ten,

273
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:39,240
eleven, twelve...

274
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,760
It seems that...

275
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:43,640
Moon Immortal has endless
supply of red string.

276
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,560
If you stop giving them to the
servant fairies in my house,

277
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,920
I'll thank you for that.

278
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,400
Little kiddo is all grown up now.

279
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,360
You'll never listen to
your uncle anymore.

280
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,360
I remember the time when
you were still a little chick,

281
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,600
you love to play among the
red strings in my house.

282
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,640
But now...

283
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,160
you even sounded strange to me.

284
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,590
I feel so sad.

285
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,080
Kiddo?

286
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,240
You're exaggerating, uncle.

287
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,550
My nephew is a good boy.

288
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,820
That's how family members
address each other.

289
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,400
I'd never expected...

290
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,470
that both of you are uncle and nephew.

291
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,440
Never judge an immortal by his looks.

292
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,050
Jin Mi is good.

293
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,960
Take her as your mistress.

294
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,550
Who's Jin Mi?

295
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,920
Is the "Mi" in your name Jin Mi...

296
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,470
derived from honey (mi tang)?

297
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,440
No it isn't.

298
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,480
It must be...

299
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,310
Mi from xun mi (search)?

300
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,400
No.

301
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,570
My Mi is from "mi shi"
(looking for food).

302
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,650
Aren't both of them the same word?

303
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,530
Great! That's great!

304
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,600
How old are you?

305
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,080
When is your birthday?

306
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
Where are you from?

307
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,960
How many are there in your family?

308
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,200
It's boring here, Jin Mi.

309
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,560
Why don't you come and tour around
my house of marriage?

310
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,760
Please excuse me.

311
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,800
It's really boring here. Fine!

312
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,120
Let's go!

313
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,330
"House of Marriage"

314
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,240
He is handsome.

315
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,920
He is really good looking.

316
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,370
His skin is flawless.

317
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,520
This boy is so attractive.

318
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,680
If he lives for a few thousand
years more,

319
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,870
countless fairies will swoon over him.

320
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,880
If he grows on like this,

321
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,110
even the princes will be defeated.

322
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,120
- That's right.
- That's right!

323
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Xu Feng has great taste.

324
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,120
Enough. Go.

325
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,240
- Yes.
- Quick.

326
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,440
Let's go.

327
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Little Jin Mi.

328
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,000
Why don't you stay at my
house of marriage?

329
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,480
It's more interesting
than Qiwu Palace.

330
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,240
My house is a good place
with good fairies.

331
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
What do you think?

332
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,920
My name is Liu Yan.

333
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,800
The eldest daughter of
the Liu in Hangzhou.

334
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,080
I'm 28 years old.

335
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,400
I beg you, Moon Immortal,

336
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,360
to grant me a husband.

337
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,200
Who is as handsome as Pan An.

338
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
And may our love last forever.

339
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,790
What does it mean?

340
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,040
It's normal that you know nothing
about love since you're still young.

341
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,000
But if you were to be with
my second nephew,

342
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,200
I think you better learn
about it earlier.

343
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,200
No worries.

344
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,240
I'll slowly guide you through.

345
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,320
I'm here at the Heavenly Palace to
save my friend Rou Rou.

346
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,480
I'm looking for the Great Immortal.

347
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,840
Do you know where he is?

348
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,760
There are many Great Immortals
here at the Heaven Realm.

349
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,000
Who are you looking for?

350
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,560
The one who can revive
my friend Rou Rou.

351
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,440
I can see that it's still green
and crispy. It's fine.

352
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,240
My friend Rou Rou...

353
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,480
was a fairy that took human form.

354
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,680
But an incident that happened
900 years ago...

355
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,470
had her beaten down.

356
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,760
And she turned into this since then.

357
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,720
Do you know any Great Immortal
who can help her, Moon Immoral?

358
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,280
We are all in a cycle
of birth and death.

359
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,040
Even the Heavenly Emperor
can't take charge of it.

360
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,480
Puchi has lied to me.

361
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,280
I got it.

362
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,400
Then I shall say goodbye.

363
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,520
Wait up!

364
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,320
We have many powerful immortals
and resources here at Heaven Realm.

365
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,680
If you would stay and practice,

366
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,920
you can definitely help your friend.

367
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,120
Moreover,

368
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,360
there's Supreme Clarity Heaven
above the Empyrean Heaven.

369
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,990
If you dedicate yourself to practice
the magical prowess,

370
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,440
you'll have a chance to go
to Supreme Clarity Heaven...

371
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,400
and listen to the Hunyuan Testimony
by the masters.

372
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,960
So Puchi wasn't lying.

373
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,360
Magical prowess?

374
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,480
I'm on!

375
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,080
You're right! So I'll stay for a
little while longer here.

376
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,760
That's right.

377
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,600
If you stay with me,

378
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
then...

379
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,760
I'll have some good things for you.

380
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,880
Elixir pills?

381
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,680
Better than that.

382
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:26,760
"Qiwu Palace"

383
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,840
How's Jin Mi in the Palace?

384
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,520
Your Highness.

385
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,920
We had everything arranged
for Jin Mi as ordered.

386
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,080
But recently she's been
at Moon Immortal's place a lot.

387
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,320
Your Highness always
misses the chance...

388
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,600
to see her.

389
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,640
Half-fairy Jin Mi is now very popular
at the house of marriage.

390
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,880
She has many left over
red strings in hand.

391
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,400
Many people wanted them.

392
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,070
Half-fairy.

393
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,920
Only this little demon dares to...

394
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,950
claim herself a fairy.

395
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,840
Forget about it.

396
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
Leave it alone.

397
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,680
Let her be.

398
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,480
Yes.

399
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,880
Little Jin Mi!

400
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,520
You're slacking off.

401
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,920
If you didn't,

402
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,080
how can the Beast of Dreams
trace you by your smell?

403
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,520
It is a magical creature that
feeds on dreams.

404
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,360
What's this?

405
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,120
Look for yourself.

406
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,280
See?

407
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,910
How dare you deny that
you've been slacking off?

408
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
There are no flowers here at
the house of marriage.

409
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,200
What flowery dreams you have.

410
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,040
Can you do me a favour, Immortal Fox?

411
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,200
Can you please run some errand for me?

412
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,480
Though I'm staying in the sky now,

413
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,400
but still my job is to pick flowers
and make honey.

414
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,760
The flowers here are snobbish.

415
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,920
They bully low ranked fairy like us.

416
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Whenever I touch it,
it will vanish like smoke.

417
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,360
So,

418
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,200
can you help me to pick some flowers?

419
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,920
Spring will never stay.

420
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,000
So do the flowers after they withered.

421
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,150
The reason for this is
better kept unknown.

422
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,220
It's all due to an uncommon
relationship.

423
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,960
It's all about love.

424
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,740
What's love?

425
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,680
You've never heard of it since
you're from the Floral Realm?

426
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,720
A few thousand years ago,

427
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,920
our current Heavenly Emperor had
offended the late Flora Immortal.

428
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,470
The late Floral Immortal destroyed
all flowers in Heaven Realm.

429
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,800
The Heaven Realm has been
barren since then.

430
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,100
However,

431
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,330
the Heaven Realm can't
be barren forever.

432
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,320
So Heavenly Emperor’s decided to
make flowers out of the clouds.

433
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,370
To fill the entire Heaven Realm.

434
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,560
This returned the colors
to the Heaven Realm.

435
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,320
So all the plants are fake.

436
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,680
Once you pluck it,

437
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,520
it will turn into smoke.

438
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,480
So I can't make honey anymore?

439
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,840
You stupid fellow.

440
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,440
Is honey that important?

441
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Didn't you get something out of it?

442
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,930
What?

443
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,150
Heavenly Emperor.

444
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,310
The Floral Immortal.

445
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,090
He is handsome.

446
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,640
While her beauty is unparalleled.

447
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,760
Isn't that a classic love story?

448
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,280
Can love help with magical prowess?

449
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,980
If it can't and causes trouble,

450
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,320
why do we need it?

451
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,120
You! You're such a thick head.

452
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,800
This is my collection of love manual,

453
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,920
"Tianxiang Secret book".

454
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,280
Take a look.

455
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,240
It all starts from theory.

456
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,680
Hideous postures.

457
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,120
Totally uninteresting.

458
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,700
The...

459
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,720
love between boys and girls...

460
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,000
is the most beautiful and truthful
thing in the world.

461
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,480
Does it help with magical prowess?

462
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,810
- Of course.
- Really.

463
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,240
That's great!

464
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,760
Bring this back and have a look at it.

465
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,040
Study it.

466
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,000
With your intelligence,

467
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,480
you'll get the idea soon.

468
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,270
They look similar to me.

469
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,240
It's more beautiful here
at night than in the day.

470
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,220
Why does the star fall into the lake?

471
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,230
Even the fish is forced
to leave the water.

472
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,040
The climate is bad
at the Heaven Realm.

473
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,480
It's you again!

474
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,280
Be polite, Beast of Dreams.

475
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,120
I apologize for that, fairy.

476
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,520
It's okay.

477
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,640
Actually this deer..

478
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,640
İs quite adorable.

479
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,920
Just that it's a little grumpy.

480
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,320
Actually I'm not a fairy after all.

481
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,720
But I'm a fairy who's
becoming an immortal.

482
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
Right.

483
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,200
I saw your tail just now.

484
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,520
Your tail is majestic.

485
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,120
Mister Immortal,

486
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,040
you've taken really good
care of your deer.

487
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,380
He's fat and strong.

488
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,150
Beast of Dreams.

489
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:08,320
Which kitchen are you sending him to?

490
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Kitchen?

491
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,840
I mean...

492
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,800
your job has quite a good prospect.

493
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,070
I remember Sun Wukong,
the Great Sage Equaling Heaven...

494
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,640
started off as a hummer
and excelled at it.

495
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,480
He then joined the journey to the
West and had a glorious life.

496
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,520
Buddha even gave him the
title The Battling Buddha.

497
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,520
And Zhang Guolao of
the 8 Immortals.

498
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,640
He looked after donkeys before
becoming an immortal.

499
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,920
He led a glorious life after that too.

500
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,960
Therefore, I think...

501
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,160
your future will be bright.

502
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,840
Your words have made my day,

503
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,120
and I was enlightened.

504
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,560
Thank you so much.

505
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,320
You're welcome.

506
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,240
My name is Run Yu.

507
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,240
What's your name?

508
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,360
I'm Jin Mi.

509
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,270
Jin Mi.

510
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,240
I nearly forgot.

511
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,840
I have to deliver something
to the fairies.

512
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,760
I'm occupied, Mister Immortal.

513
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,000
I'll bid you good bye.

514
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,320
Right!

515
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,480
You have this cute deer with you,

516
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,400
but you still look rather lonely.

517
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,080
I'll give this red string to you.

518
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
I hope you'll find that
someone to be with you.

519
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,880
Thank you Fairy Jin Mi.

520
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,680
You're welcome. I have to go.

521
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,150
Wait.

522
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,520
Fairy Jin Mi.

523
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,230
This is your hair pin.

524
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,520
Thanks. Good bye.

525
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,370
He is really good at weaving.

526
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,840
- That's right.
- He's great.

527
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,600
That's brilliant!

528
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,960
Look.

529
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,120
It's beautiful.

530
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,600
It's fragrant too.

531
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,760
- Next.
- It smells good.

532
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,160
- Make one for me.
- Me too. Me too.

533
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,880
Wait. Wait. Can I have
a word with you?

534
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,120
Wait.

535
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,870
- Don't go.
- You haven't make one for me yet.

536
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,600
It's me.

537
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,830
Who're you?

538
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,360
I'm Liao Ting, assistant of
the Fire Immortal.

539
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,040
I've sent you meals and clothes.

540
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,640
- Is His Highness looking for me?
- No, no, no.

541
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,880
It's me.

542
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,040
Half-fairy Jin Mi.

543
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,160
Can you make me a bouquet of flowers?

544
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,880
Congratulations for the new born baby.

545
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,520
Liao Ting is still young,
I'm not married yet.

546
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,760
What are the red eggs for then?

547
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,880
Red eggs?

548
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,520
No, no, no.

549
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,600
This is Qiwu Palace's magical bird,
Zhu Que's eggs.

550
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,280
One has to wait 800 years for an egg.

551
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,200
If you eat it, you can gain 100 years
of magical prowess out of an egg.

552
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,760
And 300 years worth of
magical prowess for two eggs.

553
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,600
300 years of magical prowess?

554
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,830
What did you say just now?

555
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,110
What flower do you want? I can
make you as much as you need.

556
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,960
- You wait for me.
- Okay.

557
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Prosperous day.

558
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,400
Good for cooking eggs.

559
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,000
The taste of Zhu Que's eggs...

560
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,390
is really incredible.

561
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,160
I like it.

562
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,200
I like it so much.

563
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,340
Help!

564
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,930
Help!

565
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,320
What's wrong, Little Jin Mi?

566
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,120
Help me.

567
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,880
- Go look for Xu Feng, quick!
- Yes.

568
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,240
Did you eat something weird?

569
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,400
I...

570
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,120
I don't know what happened.

571
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,360
It's painful.

572
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,000
Am I being poisoned?

573
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,480
Don't panic!

574
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
You!

575
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,760
Jin Mi!

576
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,680
- I just got somebody to get you.
- Take her away.

577
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,850
You're a bad guy!

578
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,440
Where are you taking Mi?

579
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:35,480
Mi!

580
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,800
It's daddy's fault.

581
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:42,480
I can't do anything seeing you
kidnapped by the thief.

582
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,760
If you carry on,

583
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,159
she'll vanish within half an hour.

584
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,880
Aren't you my nephew?

585
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,920
I didn't get to act too
much, you know?

586
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,030
What did you eat?

587
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,160
I ate two Zhu Que's eggs.

588
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,480
I didn't expect to feel hot and
painful after eating the eggs.

589
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,120
Why do I feel...

590
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,760
my magical prowess has decreased?

591
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,920
You little demon.

592
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,880
Your body is cold in nature.

593
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,590
You can only be nourished by water.

594
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,920
Why did you dare to eat Zhu Que's eggs?

595
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,080
Zhu Que is extremely hot in nature.

596
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,120
If it weren’t for me,

597
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,390
I'm afraid that you might already
have turned into a thread of smoke.

598
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,520
I'm a grape.

599
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,720
I grow in dirt.

600
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,040
Not in the water.

601
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,080
I thought Zhu Que was
a relative of pig.

602
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,720
Who would have related it to fire?

603
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,160
And now I've lost half of the
magical prowess I had

604
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,480
What shall I do?

605
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,800
Stop babbling.

606
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,040
You're making me dizzy.

607
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,640
Rest and recover.

608
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,920
You're ignorant.

609
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,640
You nearly sacrificed your life for
mere 300 years worth of powers

610
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,440
Stupid.

611
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,840
Look after her. Don't let her
eat anything weird.

612
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,480
Yes, Your Highness.

613
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,240
Half-fairy Jin Mi.

614
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,880
Why does His Highness
call you little demon?

615
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,530
You shut up!

616
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,200
You are to blame for all this.

617
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,840
Now that I've lost most of my prowess,

618
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,560
perhaps I need to eat something
to compensate for it.

619
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,460
Do you need any herb,
Half-Fairy Jin Mi?

620
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,080
I can look for them.

621
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,200
A demon like me...

622
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,440
loves to eat...

623
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,400
young boys and girls.

624
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,970
Of course!

625
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,940
Little fairchild like you...

626
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,280
would be my favourite.

627
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,720
Help! help!

628
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,200
Jin Mi?

629
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,880
"Qiwu Palace"

630
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,970
Who is this?

631
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,660
Yan You?

632
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,130
How are you, Your Highness?

633
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,480
You're tired of being an immortal.

634
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,590
That's why you went to the
lower realm to be a demon.

635
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,640
I've never thought that...

636
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,360
you're even tired of
being a demon now,

637
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,220
and came to Qiwu Palace
to be a thief.

638
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,640
Thief?

639
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,880
That's what I want.

640
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,040
I've been delving into this in the
lower realm recently.

641
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,350
I target pretty ladies.

642
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,400
But I'm tired of the beauties
of lower realm.

643
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,400
Heaven Realm is
still the best, right?

644
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,200
Changing my appetite back
to the Heaven Realm,

645
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,650
I still have Jin Mi, a pretty and
delicate grape waiting for me.

646
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,690
You know Jin Mi?

647
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,170
Of course, we've been friends
for a 1000 years.

648
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,440
We're buddies.

649
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,960
What is your relationship?

650
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,520
Why can I smell her scent on you?

651
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,800
That's because we love
each other dearly.

652
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,320
Quit smooth talking with me.

653
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,910
I know Jin Mi considers magical
prowess as life itself.

654
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,940
I'm glad that she didn't
steal from others,

655
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,680
how can she afford to
give it to others?

656
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,480
If you won't be honest with me,

657
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,200
then you’ll have to forgive my rudeness.

658
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,160
Don't get all worked up,
Your Highness.

659
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,390
Let me explain.

660
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,690
My relationship with Jin Mi is simple.

661
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,600
We are creditor and debtor.

662
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,160
She owes me 1000 years worth
of magical prowess.

663
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,560
Therefore we've made a 100-year vow.

664
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,560
She'll pay me 100 years worth of
prowess every 100 years.

665
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,900
Therefore we're sharing
magical prowess.

666
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,030
That's why we're more
connected than others.

667
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,290
There, I've nothing to hide now.

668
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,290
I shall comfort her.

669
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,590
She's sleeping soundly.

670
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,000
She doesn't need your comfort.

671
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,120
She doesn't? Can you do that yourself?

672
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,400
Turning her into raisin with your
Nine Luminaries Fire?

673
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,300
Rou Rou.

674
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,230
Rou Rou.

675
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,000
Don't worry, Rou Rou.

676
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,560
My magical prowess has now grown.

677
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,200
I can protect you.

678
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:26,910
Rou Rou.

679
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:30,870
Rou Rou.

680
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,530
Let go of Rou Rou!

681
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,670
Rou Rou!

682
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,040
Let go of Rou Rou!

683
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,130
Let go!

684
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,840
Rou Rou.

685
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,320
Phoenix.

686
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,320
Destroying 100 years worth of
prowess due to gluttony.

687
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,640
Only she can do that.

688
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,160
How much prowess does
she still owe you?

689
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,080
What? You are paying back
on her behalf?

690
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,160
Let me remind you about something.

691
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,640
It's easy to pay back by prowess.

692
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,320
Not when there's affection involved.

693
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,800
You are a high spirit,

694
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,960
I know that you don't
need these prowesses.

695
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,160
You're just taking debt as a cover,

696
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,640
to advance on Jin Mi.

697
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,960
Let me tell you something.

698
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,640
Jin Mi is now at my place.

699
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,480
She is protected by Qiwu Palace.

700
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,680
I don't care about what
you did out there.

701
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,240
But if you ever try to advance
to Qiwu Palace,

702
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,080
I shall never look on and do nothing.
