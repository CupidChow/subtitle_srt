1
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,850
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,900
"Episode 14"

3
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,040
You must have mistaken.

4
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,480
How would that be?

5
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,800
Well...

6
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,920
since Jin Mi is no longer in danger,

7
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,000
I shall not disturb you all any longer.

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,120
I'll visit again another time.

9
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,560
Everyone has done something
right and wrong,

10
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
all the immortals have
their own stories.

11
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,520
Right now there are no outsiders,

12
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,680
you all have no need to
conceal it from me.

13
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,320
I know that you all have
sworn an oath to Zi Fen.

14
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,640
I won't make things
difficult for you all.

15
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,640
Just now I've just
checked Jin Mi's spirit,

16
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,120
even if you all want to hide it
from me, you won't be able to.

17
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,079
I'm only going to ask you one thing.

18
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,160
Is Jin Mi born during the frost fall?

19
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
It's true.

20
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,000
Mi...

21
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,360
These 4000 years,

22
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,520
I have never done anything
a father should.

23
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,240
Zi Fen has passed away,

24
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,720
I am ashamed to see her.

25
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,720
Mi...

26
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,600
Mi...

27
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,520
Let father help you up.

28
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,800
Here...

29
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,720
This...

30
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,360
Father?

31
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,360
Immortal,

32
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,280
you have mistaken.

33
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,880
Is my fault that I didn't
look after you well.

34
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,880
If you are not willing to
recognise me as your father,

35
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,800
I will not be angry at you.

36
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,680
No...

37
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,240
It's not like that.

38
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,600
It's not that I don't want to
recognise you,

39
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,880
it's that you have mistaken
me as someone else.

40
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,920
I'm just a normal grape fairy,

41
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,080
raised by nature.

42
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,000
Even if I want to scam or pretend,

43
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,440
I wouldn't dare to
do it to you, right?

44
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,200
Silly girl,

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,880
how can you be a grape fairy?

46
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,400
Just now I've checked your spirit,

47
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,480
you are indeed the child
of Zi Fen and I.

48
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,560
Zi... Zi Fen?

49
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,520
Which? Which Zi Fen?

50
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,400
In all six realms,

51
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,480
who dares to have the same name
as late Floral immortal?

52
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,440
The late Floral immortal?

53
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:03,840
I'm the child of
late Floral immortal?

54
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,280
Oh my!

55
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,080
I cannot simply dream.

56
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
State of illusion,

57
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,760
I've pretended to be the late
Floral immortal's descendant,

58
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,040
scammed the Heavenly Emperor
for 5000 years prowess,

59
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,960
indeed now I'm facing
retribution from it.

60
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,080
Late Floral immortal,

61
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,520
please forgive me.

62
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,720
Quickly wake up.

63
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,160
One, two, three...

64
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm... I'm not dreaming?

65
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,400
Is... Is this real?

66
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,880
I...

67
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,880
I've been a grape fairy for
the past 4000 years.

68
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,280
Right now, am I...

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,640
a drop of water or a flower?

70
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,800
You spirit must have been sealed off
by Zi Fen using the Garan Seal.

71
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,280
Therefore your true form
is not this entity.

72
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,080
Also because of this, training your
prowess was an obstacle.

73
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:04,560
Your body also looks a bit younger.

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,880
I'll bring you to my Master,

75
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,600
Xuan Ling Lord Doumu,

76
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,280
to seek for the counter spell,

77
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
then you'll be able to
get back your true form.

78
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:15,120
Chief Peony,

79
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,720
is that true?

80
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,600
Late Floral Immortal
concealed the truth...

81
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,720
to protect you.

82
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,520
Since you've exposed your true
form in the Heaven Realm,

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,080
it can no longer be concealed.

84
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,600
It's good that Water Immortal is
protecting troublemaker like you.

85
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,160
Are fathers so easy
to be found nowadays?

86
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,000
Yesterday I had one,

87
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,400
today I have another one.

88
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,840
But since Chief Peony has
already confirmed it,

89
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,400
it must be true.

90
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,400
I didn't think that I would have
a father and mother.

91
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,840
Fa... Father.

92
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,560
Are you really my father?

93
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,720
Let me bring you home.

94
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,600
I will never leave you
behind anymore,

95
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,880
causing you to be so lonely.

96
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,400
Okay...

97
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,080
It's okay.

98
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,440
But you all told me that I'm the
late Floral immortal's child...

99
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,720
but the late Floral immortal
passed away for 4000 years ago.

100
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,680
I've never even seen her once...

101
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,680
or to know what she looks like.

102
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,800
Although you mother is
not around anymore...

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,840
but you still have father.

104
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,360
As long as I'm here,

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,440
I will accompany you forever.

106
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
By the way.

107
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,080
Mi.

108
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,400
Right now your body is filled with
yang energy that's burning furiously.

109
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,960
Where did you get it?

110
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,520
To solve it, we must find
the one that casts it.

111
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,800
In this current state of urgency,

112
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,760
we have to find that person...

113
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,640
to retrieve the prowess
that's working against you.

114
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,080
I... I didn't ask for it.

115
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,280
He gave it to me.

116
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,520
He gave it to me,
do I really need to give it back?

117
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,039
In this situation, why are you still
thinking about the prowess?

118
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,720
If you don't give back,
you'll die from vomiting blood.

119
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,440
No. Last night, Heavenly
Emperor brought my spirit...

120
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,520
to the state of illusion.

121
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,320
He gave me 5000 years of prowess,
it has nothing to do with me.

122
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,920
Heavenly Emperor?

123
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
What did he say to you?

124
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,960
He said...

125
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,920
He...

126
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,440
He is also my father.

127
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,120
What a joke.

128
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,480
Indeed the biggest joke in the world.

129
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,120
This shameless person,

130
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,480
how can he be the master
of the Heaven Realm?

131
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,440
If it wasn't for Heavenly Emperor,

132
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,240
the late Floral Immortal's soul wouldn't be
destroyed and wouldn't die in hatred.

133
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,840
Calling him the murderer of Jin Mi's
mother will not be too far off.

134
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,320
Father?
What a joke!

135
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
How could he?

136
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,080
Begonia!

137
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,360
What did you just say?

138
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,680
What was the cause of
Zi Fen's passing?

139
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,640
It's been 4,000 years,

140
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,840
how long will you hide it from me?

141
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,240
How did late Floral Immortal pass away?

142
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,000
Speaking about that,

143
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,520
you were also part of the cause.

144
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,800
Today, even if I have to go against
the oath I swore to the late Floral Immortal,

145
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,600
and destroy my own spirit,

146
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,560
I'll have to tell the truth.

147
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,400
All the men in the world are
fickle when it comes to love.

148
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,440
Right now Jin Mi has grown up...

149
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,880
everyone claims to be her father.

150
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,600
Where were you then?

151
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,720
Do you know that the
late Floral Immortal used...

152
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,280
all her prowess to protect this child?

153
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,000
Four thousand years ago,

154
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,840
Jin Mi came into the world crying,

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,360
when late Floral Immortal closed her eyes...

156
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,120
it was the same night when
Water Immortal had his wedding.

157
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,480
You are all happy and well-contented,

158
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,360
don't even have the time to
watch the peach blossoms.

159
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,680
Why would you even think of
people from the past?

160
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Enough, Begonia!

161
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,320
Jin Mi is still inside.

162
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
If Jin Mi hears all these,

163
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,920
we all have to share the blame...

164
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,560
and drag Jin Mi into the affair
of the past generation.

165
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,680
What for?

166
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
That means that...

167
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,640
Zi Fen died in the frost fall
of the year 28612...

168
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,680
and not Summer Solstice
in year 28613?

169
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,400
Floral Realm has hidden the news about
Zi Fen's death for almost a year?

170
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,760
- Why?
- That year...

171
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,760
Begonia!

172
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,080
Are you not going
to even listen to me?

173
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,160
All the chiefs have already sworn
an oath to the late Floral Immortal,

174
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,280
please don't force
us to tell you anymore.

175
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,040
Chiefs, today Little One
has found her father.

176
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,040
Please don't make her upset anymore.

177
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,400
Why don't you all go
inside to accompany her?

178
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
If you would like to talk
about the old days,

179
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,880
why don't you talk to me?

180
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,040
Mr. Hu,

181
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,760
you are considered someone
who was close to Zi Fen.

182
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,120
You must know what had happened
back then.

183
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,000
Since the late Floral Immortal had always
wanted to keep this secret,

184
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,920
I'm afraid she intended
not let you worry about it.

185
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,040
However, since you are not willing
to become a confused fool,

186
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,760
then why not become a sad but
understanding person?

187
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,320
Back then when Heavenly Emperor
was still the second prince,

188
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,680
he planned every move carefully...

189
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,720
to win over the late Floral Immortal's heart,

190
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,880
I am sure you are
more aware of it than I do.

191
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,160
In order to rise to the throne
as Heavenly Emperor,

192
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,680
he formed an alliance
with the bird tribe...

193
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,760
and married the princess of
bird tribe, Tu Yao...

194
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,160
and betrayed the late Floral Immortal.

195
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,400
When the late Floral Immortal knew about it,
she was desperate and heartbroken.

196
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,320
Luckily,

197
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,960
luckily your kindness...

198
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,200
to the late Floral Immortal was
the same every day.

199
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,600
Her love for you had grown
stronger in time.

200
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,120
This was supposed to stop her
before it was too late.

201
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,040
Who knew?

202
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,240
The Heavenly Emperor acted the same
even after he was crowned.

203
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,120
He continued to harass
the late Floral Immortal...

204
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,560
but the late Floral Immortal refused to yield.

205
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,640
That made the Heavenly Emperor
even more frustrated and...

206
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,560
he forcibly defiled the late Floral Immortal.

207
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,040
He used force on Zi Fen!

208
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,760
But the late Floral Immortal
didn't know that...

209
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,960
she was already pregnant with Jin Mi.

210
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,680
In anger,

211
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,880
she went to the
River of Unmindfulness.

212
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,440
Lady.

213
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,080
You already made your choice
between power and me.

214
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,480
We have taken different paths,

215
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,480
but you've shamed me
and made me betray Luo Lin.

216
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,920
Only by jumping into the
River of Unmindfulness...

217
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,080
could wash off the shame
and heartbreak.

218
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,080
The late Floral Immortal wanted to drink
from River of Unmindfulness...

219
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,840
to forget her sorrow
but Heavenly Emperor stopped her.

220
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,400
She then jumped into the river
to destroy her own spirit...

221
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,960
but the Heavenly Emperor
cast a spell to stop her.

222
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,560
I am the Heavenly Emperor.

223
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,440
The entire of Heaven Realm is mine.

224
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,800
I won't allow you to die...

225
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,360
and I won't allow you to forget me.

226
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,840
Let me go!

227
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,920
Let me go!

228
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,320
Let me go!

229
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,680
The Heavenly Emperor imprisoned the
late Floral Immortal inside Qi Wu Palace.

230
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,720
Brother!

231
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,760
Brother!

232
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,600
Brother!

233
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,880
To get the late Floral Immortal
to give up on you,

234
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,920
the Heavenly Emperor plotted to get
you and Wind Immortal to marry,

235
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,080
he even purposely let the
late Floral Immortal hear about it.

236
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,400
The Water Immortal and Wind Immortal
have arrived.

237
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,280
His Majesty,
why did you summon Lin Xi and I?

238
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,640
Brother.

239
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,880
My heart belongs to someone else,

240
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,960
even if I'm not the one she wants...

241
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,119
I've already decided that I won't
marry anyone else except for her.

242
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Forming a marriage
between Lin Xiu and you...

243
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:37,680
is not an idea of just my own.

244
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,680
Due to the unrest in the six realms,

245
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,319
a marriage between you two...

246
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,520
would boost up the morale of
the soldiers in the Heaven Realm.

247
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:47,960
Luo Lin,
are you going to defy my order?

248
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,119
Thank you your Majesty
for your kindness.

249
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,120
I wish that Princess Tu Yao and you
would be happy together forever...

250
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,800
but to go against my heart,

251
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,560
even if you have to take away my
immortality and make me human,

252
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,440
I will not obey your order.

253
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,320
Your Majesty, please calm down.

254
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,840
Luo Lin, Zi Fen and I had been...

255
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,160
cultivating in the same
school for thousands of years.

256
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,320
We are as close as siblings.

257
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,280
I cannot just take away
their loved ones.

258
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,800
Tu Yao was already married to
the Heavenly Emperor as she wished,

259
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,960
what else was she not satisfied with?

260
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,360
Due to the situation then,
the Heavenly Emperor...

261
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,680
has no choice but to
make Tu Yao his wife.

262
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,040
But in his heart, he has always
missed the late Floral Immortal.

263
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,480
He even wanted to make the
late Floral Immortal his concubine.

264
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,670
"Linyuan Terrace"
Tu Yao found out about it...

265
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,700
and how could she not hate him?

266
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,120
- Chief!
- Chief!

267
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,480
- Chief!
- Chief!

268
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,480
- Chief!
- Chief!

269
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,960
Why are you hurt so badly?

270
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,720
- Chief!
- Chief!

271
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,360
After I've rejected the
marriage proposal,

272
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,080
I went to the Floral Realm
to visit Zi Fen...

273
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,840
but she told me...

274
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,520
she has never loved me.

275
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,320
From the very beginning till the end,
I only love the Heavenly Emperor.

276
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,480
Why don't you just go and
marry Lin Xiu?

277
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,600
The spirit and internal organs of late
chief were already severely burnt.

278
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,080
She knew she couldn't live any longer.

279
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,880
That's why she had been cold to you,

280
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,780
in hopes that you would be
able to let her go easily.

281
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,980
She didn't want you...

282
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,520
to cause a scene for something
that can never be undone.

283
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,240
She hoped that the Wind Immortal
and you could be a loving...

284
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,200
and contented couple.

285
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,040
I wanted to spend the rest
of my life with Zi Fen...

286
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,400
but this world is unpredictable.

287
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,800
Without Zi Fen,

288
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,920
how can I be contented?

289
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,720
Jin Mi lost her mother
when she was so young,

290
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,520
she was lonely and helpless,

291
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,600
how can I forgive myself?

292
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,760
I must kill that poisonous
woman with my own hands.

293
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,240
Even if my spirit will be perished,

294
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,320
I'll have to avenge Zi Fen!

295
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,680
The deceased is already gone.

296
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,880
The late Floral Immortal's spirit
has been destroyed,

297
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,760
even if you have finally avenged her,

298
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,000
she will not be resurrected.

299
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,960
Also, the late Floral Immortal's
last wish...

300
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,360
was for the Floral Realm
to be peaceful...

301
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,520
and stop seeking revenge
on each other.

302
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,800
The late Floral Immortal was worried that the
little grape would be like her,

303
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,120
develop infatuation
and die in grief.

304
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,880
That's why she ordered all the chiefs
to strictly protect this secret.

305
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,480
Even made Grape to dress up
like a man when she's out...

306
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,280
and trap her in the Water Mirror
for 10,000 years,

307
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,320
even asked me to
watch over her closely.

308
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,080
I thought that the little one...

309
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,120
would be happy and carefree
for the rest of her life.

310
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,520
Who would have thought that...

311
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,440
fate messes with people?

312
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,840
Jin Mi,

313
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,880
it's you after all.

314
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,520
There's a limit to taking revenge,

315
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,200
how could you use Jin Mi...

316
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,360
and put the young chief
of Floral Realm in danger.

317
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,080
Do you know that...

318
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,840
the Heavenly Empress almost
killed her that day?

319
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,920
Hurting her is the Heavenly
Empress's doing,

320
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,320
not what I wish for.

321
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,080
I will no longer help you.

322
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,400
Chief Magnolia , do you really want to
break the agreement?

323
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,400
You broke faith first.

324
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,600
I've already told you...

325
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
there's a limit to taking revenge,

326
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,200
it must not involve the
people from Floral Realm.

327
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,840
Since we have already
decided to take revenge,

328
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,440
of course there will be risk.

329
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,960
If you dare to cause anymore
harm to Jin Mi,

330
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,000
I will not forgive you.

331
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,200
Chief Peony has always
been just and stern,

332
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,960
if she finds out that
we formed an alliance,

333
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,720
what would be your consequences?

334
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,360
No matter what,

335
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,080
we are on the same boat right now.

336
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,640
Since we've started it,

337
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,760
how can we stop now?

338
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,240
Take care of yourself.

339
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,290
"Xuanji Palace"

340
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,520
Your Highness, how's Jin Mi?

341
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,600
Luckily, Water Immortal
was there to help.

342
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,480
Jin Mi is fine now.

343
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,200
Jin Mi is actually Water
Immortal's daughter.

344
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,000
According to the arrangement
made 4000 years ago,

345
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,680
she is my fiancÃ©e.

346
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,880
Isn't she...

347
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,240
the child of Heavenly Emperor?

348
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,000
The magical prowess that father passed
to her goes against her own prowess.

349
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,040
Water Immortal has already
personally checked it.

350
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,000
He confirms that Jin Mi
is his own child.

351
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,360
Soon...

352
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,400
he'll announce it publicly.

353
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,440
Your Highness,
I can see that you're very happy.

354
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,800
I've never been this happy...

355
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,800
but I've also never
been this nervous.

356
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,080
I overheard the conversation between
Water Immortal and Chief Peony...

357
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,200
about the relationship between father
and late Floral immortal, Zi Fen.

358
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,520
The Water Immortal hates
father and mother.

359
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,600
I'm afraid that he might not
approve this marriage.

360
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,320
Even if there was
any misunderstanding,

361
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,640
the engagement was made long time ago.

362
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,160
Promise made by the Immortals
must be obeyed,

363
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,600
no one can break it, isn't?

364
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,200
But I know that...

365
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
Xu Feng likes Jin Mi too.

366
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,040
He might be able to fool others...

367
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,200
but I won't be fooled by him.

368
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,880
I can't bare to hurt him.

369
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,160
Then can you bare giving her up?

370
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,880
When Lord Fire Immortal was young,

371
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,840
he had so much love from
Heavenly Emperor and Empress.

372
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,320
He is also the firstborn.

373
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,840
He already has too much.

374
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,560
Unlike you,

375
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,640
you're always alone,

376
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,200
beast of dream and the night
are you only companion.

377
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,560
You never fight for anything.

378
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,120
If...

379
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,560
If you give your wife away, that's...

380
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,440
This one time...

381
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,640
Xu Feng,

382
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,560
I'll wrong you just this one time.

383
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,440
I'll repay you for hundred
and thousand times in the future.

384
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,160
Would you still blame me?

385
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,360
Chief Peony,

386
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,160
while we're here today,

387
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,000
tell me the honest truth.

388
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,240
Jin Mi,
is she or is she not my child?

389
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,520
In the spirit of the
departed late Floral Immortal,

390
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,040
no matter how many
times you asked.

391
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,080
I will only have one answer.

392
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,000
Jin Mi is not your descendant.

393
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,760
Don't try to hide it from me.

394
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:33,960
Zi Fen...

395
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,480
passed away after giving birth on
summer solstice in the year 28613.

396
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,400
Based on the time calculation,

397
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,560
no doubt that Jin Mi is
my own flesh and bone.

398
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,160
Your Majesty, you've mistaken.

399
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,160
Jin Mi was not born on
the summer solstice...

400
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,160
but was on the frost fall
a year before that.

401
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,480
I understand that..

402
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,040
I've wronged Zi Fen...

403
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,240
and caused her to die in hatred.

404
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,200
I also know that...

405
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,320
you all feel injustice for her.

406
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,640
But these past thousand years,

407
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,800
I've tried every chance given
to make up for the regret.

408
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,880
I'm sure that you all
would not want Jin Mi...

409
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,080
to become an orphan.

410
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,360
Has Your Majesty forgotten
how and why did late Floral Immortal died?

411
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,720
Only a few days ago,

412
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,320
Heavenly Empress came
to the Floral Realm...

413
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,160
ruined the tomb of late Floral Immortal...

414
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,960
and almost killed Jin Mi,

415
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,080
Your Majesty should know
about it, right?

416
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,360
Your Majesty, for the sake of
the relationship that you had,

417
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,880
then please don't endanger
late Floral Immortal's only child.

418
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,680
Regarding the Heavenly Empress,

419
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,520
please be at ease.

420
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,120
I will talk to her,

421
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,400
make her and everyone else in
the Heaven Realm to accept Jin Mi.

422
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,880
It is just Jin Mi.

423
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,280
Who dares to trouble the
Heavenly Emperor for it?

424
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,720
When the King and Queen are fighting,
Heaven Realm becomes unrest,

425
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,600
Jin Mi will not be able to
bare the blame for it.

426
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,040
In the Heaven Realm,
mistakes can be made easily.

427
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,560
Even the late Floral Immortal, which is also a
Supreme Immortal was plotted against,

428
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,000
let alone a weak child.

429
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,760
Jin Mi has a place in the
Floral Realm,

430
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,640
it will be enough.

431
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,120
Please Heavenly Emperor,
give her a way out.

432
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,240
Fine.

433
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,000
This needs further consideration.

434
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,160
But you should know,

435
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,560
although time has passed...

436
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,920
I've not changed my mind.

437
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,960
One day, I'll have to
recognise Jin Mi as my own.

438
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,200
I want to proudly get her
back to the Heaven Realm.

439
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,000
It'll be considered as
giving Zi Fen some justice.

440
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,640
In that case,

441
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,320
I'll patiently wait for it.

442
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,560
Former Floral immortal,

443
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,160
I'm here to visit you.

444
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:28,280
Can I call you mother now?

445
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
Mother,

446
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,960
I've recognised father,

447
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,480
which is the Water Immortal.

448
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,280
He told me that you loved
having these flower biscuits.

449
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,400
What a coincidence, fresh flower
biscuit is my favourite as well.

450
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,840
I've brought some for you.

451
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,160
They don't look good...

452
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,640
but I made them by myself,
they are quite good.

453
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,920
Please don't mind it.

454
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,680
Frankly speaking,

455
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,880
these past 4000 years,
I've been thinking...

456
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,960
how would you and I reunite?

457
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,400
But I've never thought that...

458
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,720
we would reunite this way.

459
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,200
I even thought that,

460
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,680
after meeting you,

461
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,880
I'll have many heart-to-heart
talks with you.

462
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,080
But I've never thought that,

463
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,160
I've already spoken enough with you.

464
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,320
You are really a surprising mother.

465
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,320
I've always been jealous of Lian Qiao.

466
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,360
Because every time during meal time,

467
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,720
her mother...

468
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,120
would ask the butterflies to ask her
come home to have her meal.

469
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,080
I was thinking,

470
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,520
how nice would it be
if I have a mother.

471
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,560
My mother would ask me
to have my meal.

472
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,400
But now that I've know that
I have a mother,

473
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,880
I'm even more jealous of her.

474
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,480
How in the world is there
a mother like you?

475
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,200
You didn't care about me
after giving birth to me.

476
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,560
Even trapped me in the
Water Mirror for 4000 years.

477
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,960
Even asked Chief Peony to lie to me,

478
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,080
said that I'm an orphan grape.

479
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,440
You even hid my true form,
caused my prowess to be so low.

480
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,320
What did father and
I ever do to you?

481
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,800
In the love letter, I found the place
where we meet in every life.

482
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,840
There I'll wait for us to
watch the setting sun.

483
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,880
In the love letter, I found the place
where we love in every life.

484
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,200
There I'll sing in the moonlight.

485
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,440
It's fine...

486
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
although you didn't treat me well...

487
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,000
at least you have brought me
to this world.

488
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,840
Okay, I'll have to go now.

489
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,250
I'll be fine with father.

490
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,040
When I have the time,
I'll come visit you again.

491
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,320
I'm leaving now.

492
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,360
Water Immortal.

493
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,080
Now that Jin Mi has gone
to pay her respect to Zi Fen,

494
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,000
I'll like to ask you about something.

495
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,560
Water Immortal, you are too serious.

496
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,000
I'll tell you whatever I know.

497
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,800
When I was checking on
Jin Mi's true form,

498
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,360
I found that besides the
Garan Seal in her body,

499
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,400
there's also another restriction.

500
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,880
I've asked Mr. Hu...

501
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,480
but he wouldn't tell me
no matter what.

502
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,680
Do you know anything about it?

503
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,760
That restriction was planted
by the late Floral Immortal.

504
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,800
She has predicted that Jin Mi
will face a trial in 10,000 years.

505
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,160
It's for Jin Mi to block
out that trial.

506
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,320
Regarding the details,

507
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,360
we are not sure of it.

508
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,120
Is that right?

509
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,680
However, please be at ease.

510
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,560
The late Floral Immortal planted
this restriction...

511
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,639
out of a parent's love.

512
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,199
It does nothing bad to Jin Mi,

513
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,600
please be at ease with it.

514
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,760
Since it's Zi Fen's idea,

515
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,040
I'll let it go.

516
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,960
Sister Zhang,
the Water Immortal is Jin Mi's father.

517
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,280
Why can't we tell him the
truth about the Yun Elixir?

518
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,760
Water Immortal has always
been kind and soft-hearted,

519
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,840
adapts to nature.

520
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,320
Based on his temperament,

521
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,400
if he knows that the Yun Elixir...

522
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,400
is used to suppress
Jin Mi's true nature,

523
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,600
most likely he will remove it.

524
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,640
In case late Floral Immortal's prediction
has come true,

525
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,880
Jin Mi will face a 10,000 year
love trial.

526
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,560
How do we explain ourselves
to the late Floral Immortal then?

527
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,680
Next time, at the Highest Palace,

528
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,920
you can't just speak as you like.

529
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,360
Please be at ease, father.

530
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,960
I'll just sit here quietly
and listen to you all speak.

531
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,080
I will not speak as I want...

532
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,000
and will definitely not
speak to Heavenly Empress.

533
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,320
She won't have any excuse
to go against me then.

534
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,920
If she tries to trouble you,
you don't have to be afraid of her.

535
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,720
Water Immortal! Water Immortal!

536
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:58,760
Rat Immortal.
Water Immortal! Water Immortal!

537
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,400
Rat Immortal.

538
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,200
Where are you going, Water Immortal?

539
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,600
I'm bringing my daughter to
the Empyrean Cloud Palace.

540
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,440
This is my daughter, Jin Mi.

541
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,120
Mi, greet the Rat Immortal.

542
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,920
Greetings, Immortal.

543
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,240
You look like you are in a rush,
are you going to Mortal Realm now?

544
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,000
I was about to go look for you.

545
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,760
What's the matter?
Why are you looking for me?

546
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,760
- Fairy Jin Mi.
- Fish Fairy.

547
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,600
- What a coincidence.
- Are you going to patrol the night?

548
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,640
I am not in the rush for it
as it's still early.

549
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,300
Oh right,
you just went back to the Floral Realm.

550
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,900
Did the chiefs punish you?

551
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,880
That's good.

552
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,000
You must be really careful
coming to the Heaven Realm.

553
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,240
The Heavenly Empress is still angry,

554
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,160
I'm worried that it'll be
a disadvantage for you.

555
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,560
Why don't you let me accompany you,

556
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,640
so that you'll be looked after?

557
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,960
You don't have to worry about me.

558
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,440
You must not let me hold up
on your duty time.

559
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,400
By spending time speaking to me,

560
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:23,440
I'm guessing I've already hold up
your time to form the night.

562
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,960
No, you don't.

563
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,360
Courtesy to your kind words last time,

564
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
saying that you liked me,

565
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,520
I've been grateful for it,
from the bottom of my heart.

566
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,240
It's my pleasure
to be able to serve you,

567
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,760
just that I have an
engagement since young,

568
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,520
I'm worried that I'll have to
let you down on your kindness.

569
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,080
What's the big deal?
We are friends.

570
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,760
Fish Fairy,
even if you have an engagement,

571
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,360
I would still like you.

572
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,400
I like you too.

573
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,640
Greetings, Immortal.

574
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,720
I was careless and did not
notice your presence,

575
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,360
please forgive me.
