1
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,540
"Episode 35"

3
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,800
I’m reasonable.

4
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,920
Two choices.

5
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,040
Make a clean break
with these remnants of Dongting,

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,160
and execute the punishment personally,

7
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,340
Or take the blame for the remnants

8
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,100
and to atone for your mom.

9
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,500
I,

10
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
I am wrong.

11
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,680
I would like to save him with my life.

12
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,700
Run Yu.

13
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:24,880
OK.

14
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,700
You’re sensible.

15
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,740
I can’t betray
my birth mother and her family again.

16
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,800
I’ll take all the blame.

17
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,960
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess,

18
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,920
punish him with your Shocking Heavenly Thunder,

19
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
Lightning Light,

20
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,100
and my Lotus Fire of Retribution.

21
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,700
Even Qiong Qi couldn’t bear such a punishment.

22
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,860
I wonder whether you can stand

23
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,260
the cruel punishment for 30,000 times.

24
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,740
Please punish me.

25
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,480
OK.

26
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,140
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess,

27
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,800
carry out the punishment.

28
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,579
Your Majesty,

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,160
here is the Empyrean Cloud Palace.

30
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,000
Moreover, the first Prince
is the son of His Majesty.

31
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,440
Carry out the punishment.

32
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,360
Brother.

33
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,600
Originally I thought he was rational

34
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,400
and different from Xu Feng.

35
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,920
Unexpectedly, he can hardly retain his composure.

36
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,540
The hands and feet are broken into pieces.

37
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,600
The body is like broken jade.

38
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,260
The fierce fire of retribution is burning.

39
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,400
The sea of blood is surging.

40
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,700
The dim nether world is crying.

41
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,860
Countless bones are empty.

42
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,960
Mom.

43
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,180
I heard of that.

44
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,460
I bow and call Bhagawan.

45
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,340
Don’t get slack.

46
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,540
Run Yu.

47
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,720
Brother. Brother.

48
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,260
Run Yu.

49
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,820
-Wake up.
-Run Yu, wake up.

50
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,840
Wake up, Brother.

51
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,980
Wake up.

52
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,500
Heavenly Empress,

53
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,680
you are a demon.

54
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,460
I’m the one who killed your son.

55
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,600
Punish me.

56
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,740
She even cares nothing.

57
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,860
Brother.

58
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,840
Your Majesty,

59
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,020
there isn’t Glazed Pure Fire
in the Punishment of Thunder and Light.

60
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:03,940
If Glazed Pure Fire is used,

61
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,320
Night Immortal will certainly die.

62
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,460
Please don’t.

63
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,460
How about saving it for you?

64
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,940
What crime did Night Immortal commit?

65
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,740
Why did you even want to
kill him with illegal punishment?

66
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,500
Water Immortal,

67
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,380
although you shielded the criminal,

68
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,780
I forgave you

69
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,440
with great generosity.

70
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
Don’t push your luck.

71
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,440
However, you plot to murde
r the son of His Majesty.

72
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,240
Run Yu disobeyed orders first

73
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,080
and then took the punishment
for 30,000 remnants.

74
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,340
It has nothing to do with me.

75
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,560
Just stop.

76
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,640
Your Majesty.

77
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,500
Your Majesty.

78
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,740
Here,

79
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,280
deliver an imperial order
at the Southern Heavenly Gate.

80
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,860
The heinous chief criminal Su Li

81
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,159
was executed before.

82
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,980
Water Family in Dongting
who have been deceived and forced by her

83
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:08,140
are forgivable.

84
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,720
Given that it is your first offence,

85
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,460
I offer you a general pardon.

86
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,400
I hope that you
can thoroughly reform yourselves

87
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,300
and be loyal to the Heaven Realm.

88
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,900
If you commit further crimes in the future,

89
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,080
you’ll be severely punished.

90
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:19,840
Yes.

91
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,420
You’re acting a good person.

92
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,220
Night Immortal.

93
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,920
On behalf of the 36,400 lives in Dongting,

94
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:49,260
I’d like to extend gratitude

95
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,040
to Your Majesty.

96
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,080
Please order to release them, Mother.

97
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,840
Heavenly Empress,

98
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,740
deal with the rest problems.

99
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,540
30,000 times of heavenly punishment
are much more painful than slow slicing,

100
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,440
not to mention healing wounds.

101
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,540
If I were you,

102
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,660
I would rather destroy the Internal Dan of myself,

103
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,360
so all trouble would come to an end.

104
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,220
Please don’t worry.

105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,620
I won’t die.

106
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,280
I’ll live well

107
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,640
to witness personally

108
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,560
that you fulfill your  promise

109
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,740
of releasing all of them

110
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,980
and won’t go back on your word.

111
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,100
Brother.

112
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:19,800
Your Highness

113
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,680
Run Yu.

114
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,380
He is dying.

115
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,300
Mom,

116
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,540
I feel very cold.

117
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,060
I feel very cold.

118
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,280
Your Highness.

119
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,160
Brother Run Yu.

120
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,360
Mom.

121
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,020
Mom.

122
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,100
Mom.

123
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,840
Mom.

124
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,740
Mom.

125
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,000
It’s so hot.

126
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,340
It’s so hot.

127
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,340
Once His Highness said

128
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,220
if someone is extremely cold
due to losing a lot of blood,

129
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,280
there will be a feeling of burning viscera instead.

130
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,880
Mom.

131
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,260
Your Majesty,

132
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,340
you agreed to let me handle
this matter with full authority,

133
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,520
but at the last moment,
you became soft-hearted.

134
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,460
You acted a good person

135
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,020
and I was the bad one.

136
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,620
If it goes on like this

137
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,260
and arouses heavenly wrath,
immortal resentment and popular criticisms,

138
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,000
what’s good for you and me?

139
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,240
It’s your fault.

140
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,600
You indulged him so much

141
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,000
that at last he shifted the blame.

142
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,960
He would rather accept

143
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,420
his heinous birth mother than me.

144
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,860
After the battle in Dongting,

145
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,680
he even wanted to protect the remnants.

146
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,860
If it keeps going on,

147
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,240
I’m afraid the Heaven Realm
will be overturned by him.

148
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,260
It won’t happen as I’m here.

149
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,260
Xu Feng and Run Yu are different.

150
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,480
I know well

151
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,560
who is more important.

152
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,860
I’ll keep what you said in my mind

153
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,180
and hope that you will never forget it.

154
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,620
Your Highness,

155
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
finally you’re awake.

156
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,640
Has Her Majesty released them?

157
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,300
Don’t you care about your life at all?

158
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,520
I promised my mom

159
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,260
to take good care of Li.

160
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,600
There are thousands of Li in the Dongting Lake.

161
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,340
Once Li of the Lize Pond

162
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,240
suffered the pain of depending on others.

163
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,580
I don’t want them to suffer the same pain.

164
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,040
The Water Family in Dongting is lucky that

165
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,500
you can consider them in your own place.

166
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,520
Mister Immortal.

167
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,620
You’re badly hurt.

168
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,280
Lie down.

169
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,100
Mister Immortal,

170
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,380
I have an unreasonable demand.

171
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,840
I’m too weak

172
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,340
to compete with Her Majesty.

173
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,220
Please take care of

174
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,800
those homeless members in Water Family

175
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,000
in Dongting.

176
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,580
Don’t worry.

177
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,780
I’ll try my best.

178
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,820
After that day in the Dongting Lake,

179
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,720
I’ve decided to fight against her to the end.

180
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,080
Thank you.

181
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,680
Kuang Lu,

182
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,420
Mister Immortal,

183
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,620
do not tell anyone that

184
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,840
I was hurt,

185
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,400
especially Mi.

186
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,740
I don’t want her to worry about me

187
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,000
and don’t want her

188
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,260
to see

189
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,960
my disgrace.

190
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,740
Promise me.

191
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,780
Don’t be sad for me.

192
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,380
Rou Rou.

193
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,760
Rou Rou.

194
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,880
Rou Rou.

195
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,580
Rou Rou.

196
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,860
I’ll find the murderer

197
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,600
and avenge your death.

198
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,100
Choose a lucky day three months later

199
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,140
to hold the wedding ceremony
for Jin Mi and Run Yu.

200
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,940
"Xuanji Palace"

201
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,820
Temper your mind body in hardships,

202
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,280
and stick to overcome difficulties.

203
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,120
I’ve told it to you many times

204
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,860
but you can’t do it.

205
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,540
Now you and the Heavenly Empress
are incompatible,

206
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,320
which makes me very embarrassed.

207
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,060
She did overdo it,

208
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,060
but she did that under my order.

209
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,840
Going against her is against me.

210
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,060
You should learn a lesson
from what happened

211
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,600
in the Empyrean Cloud Palace.

212
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,200
I know I was wrong.

213
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,800
I’ve pardoned the Water Family in Dongting.

214
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,079
Today’s matter concerns
the reputation of the Heaven Realm.

215
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,540
The matter that you were punished
by the Heavenly Thunder and Lightning Fire

216
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,200
for remnants of Dongting

217
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,380
can’t be mentioned again, you know?

218
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,540
Yes.

219
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:45,859
OK.

220
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,079
Make a promise of an immortal.

221
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,880
I promise

222
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:57,540
as long as Father and Mother
don’t mention this matter

223
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,540
and let it go,

224
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,440
it’ll be the past.

225
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,360
I won’t mention it again.

226
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,660
Father,

227
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,380
is my mom

228
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,180
really so wicked?

229
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,520
As the matter has been settled,

230
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,720
there is no need to reconsider it.

231
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,520
As an immortal,

232
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,180
you shouldn’t be stopped
by other matters or confused in love.

233
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,020
You still have to further train your power.

234
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,780
Don’t worry.

235
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,060
The matter of your birth mother
is none of your business.

236
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,900
However, I didn’t expect that

237
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,080
you dare to go against
the Heavenly Empress one day.

238
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,960
I know I was wrong.

239
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,080
Under the critical circumstance,
I had no time to think more about it.

240
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,640
The reason why I didn’t
come immediately just now

241
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,700
was that I wanted to test you.

242
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,800
Misfortune might be a blessing in disguise.

243
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,340
You’re supposed to resist against

244
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,840
the Heavenly Empress
and the Bird Family afterwards.

245
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,480
Father,

246
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,960
if I didn’t stand out back then,

247
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,020
would you just ignore lives

248
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,520
of the Water Family in Dongting?

249
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,940
You’re still young.

250
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,480
After living for another
tens of thousands of years,

251
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
you’ll know that

252
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,350
those with a hundred years of life,
or a thousand years of cultivation

253
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,240
are the same as ephemera

254
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,780
to our immortals.

255
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,060
Such a short moment is meaningless.

256
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,800
Nothing will be changed

257
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,740
without them in the world.

258
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,020
That is, the natural law is merciless.

259
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,240
In the tens of millions of years,

260
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,100
as an immortal,

261
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,740
have you ever been

262
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,100
moved with compassion?

263
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,840
I’m not afraid to tell you the truth.

264
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,420
I am

265
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,180
the biggest prisoner

266
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,480
in heaven and earth.

267
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,080
It turns out...

268
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,800
It turns out that my birth

269
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,800
is completely a conspiracy.

270
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,200
Mom.

271
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,140
Mom, I’m the one who killed you.

272
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,020
I’m guilty.

273
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,440
I’m guilty.

274
00:19:59,500 --> 00:19:59,920
No.

275
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,980
It’s him.

276
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,500
He is

277
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,640
the chief criminal

278
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,720
of everything in the world.

279
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,180
In your heart,

280
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,420
you don’t care about your sons, your wife

281
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,440
or the family.

282
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,140
In you heart,

283
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,860
you can control all people.

284
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,160
The natural law is merciless.

285
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,780
Father,

286
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,940
I’ve learned it.

287
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,760
I must live on.

288
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,300
What doesn’t kill me,

289
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,880
make me stronger.

290
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,360
Where is Mi?

291
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,920
She was thinking about Rou Rou just now.

292
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,020
She should have fallen asleep now.

293
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,940
How is Night Immortal?

294
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,220
New hatred is piled on old
and the disaster continues.

295
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,120
He is filled with grievances,
but he can complain to nowhere.

296
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,320
It seems that it’ll be difficult to dissolve

297
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,700
the resentment between him and Her Majesty.

298
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,620
Though today’s matter
has been covered by His Majesty,

299
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,940
it has spread secretly
in the Heavenly Realm.

300
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,260
What Her Majesty did
has caused public outrage.

301
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,400
Instead, Night Immortal
has won more people’s support

302
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,360
with his firm character
behind a gentle appearance.

303
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,600
In the past I thought
that he was gentle in nature.

304
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,960
I didn’t expect that
he isn’t afraid of strong enemies

305
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,280
and would rather die for a just cause.

306
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,120
He can bear what is unbearable to others.

307
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,820
Ordinary one won’t be

308
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,700
so tolerant and brave.

309
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,200
Her Majesty failed to show her restraint.

310
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,960
A thing turns into its opposite
if pushed too far.

311
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,460
Things will change.

312
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,680
Just wait and see.

313
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,320
Chief Magnolia,

314
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,800
what are you doing?

315
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,340
What happened?

316
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,400
Sister,

317
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,920
I was wrong.

318
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,460
I committed a great crime.

319
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,380
That day someone of the
Water Family in Dongting came to you

320
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,240
to form an alliance with Floral Realm
to fight against Heaven Realm.

321
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,120
I was so lost and confused

322
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,900
that I believed in what he said

323
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,440
and told him

324
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,800
the birth of Jin Mi.

325
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,160
What?

326
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,260
Magnolia,

327
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,380
you were so foolish.

328
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,080
I think it was my fault
for telling others about her birth,

329
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,980
so she was almost killed

330
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,080
by others with the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow

331
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,900
when she experienced hardships.

332
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,100
It’s all my fault.

333
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,820
I know that I am too sinful

334
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,680
to beg for your pardon.

335
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,180
I just want to die

336
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,220
to show respect to the spirit of the late lord.

337
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,160
If you die in this way,

338
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,220
how could you face her?

339
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,980
But if I live in this way,

340
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,180
how could I face others?

341
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,780
All right.

342
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,960
I know your mind.

343
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,240
You made the mistake
just because you wanted to

344
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,600
revenge the late lord’s death.

345
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,360
However,

346
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,180
she didn’t allow us to revenge,

347
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,320
because she was afraid that
there is never an end of taking revenge.

348
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,040
She had returned to heaven and earth,

349
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,760
and what she cared most was only Jin Mi.

350
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,800
Since that you show true repentance,

351
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,040
do not mention this matter again.

352
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,880
I’ll pretend that it hasn't happened.

353
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,200
Yes.

354
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,700
Promise me.

355
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,580
From now on, we would abide
by the teachings of the late lord

356
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,560
to safeguard Jin Mi

357
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,180
with one mind.

358
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:20,940
Yes,

359
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,280
Sister.

360
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,620
Fairy Jin Mi.

361
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,320
I should call you Immortal Jin Mi now.

362
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,740
It doesn’t matter.

363
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,400
Do you come to see His Highness?

364
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,880
You have no idea of it.

365
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,930
His birth mother
who he just met for a short time

366
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,470
was executed on the spot by Her Majesty

367
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,460
on the grounds of rebellion.

368
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,820
She was executed?

369
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,820
After his birth mother died,

370
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,460
His Highness doesn’t sleep or eat.

371
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,740
Would you please try to persuade him?

372
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,920
He has always listened to you.

373
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,700
OK.

374
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,040
Immortal.

375
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:01,800
Mi.

376
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,060
I just heard that your birth mother died.

377
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,660
I don’t know the ins and outs.

378
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,400
However, you are so kind,

379
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,640
so your birth mother

380
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,260
must be gentle and kind too.

381
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,320
I just recalled my childhood,

382
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,440
just knew who was my birth mother

383
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,540
and just met her,

384
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,100
but I watched her

385
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,000
dying before me

386
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,380
helplessly.

387
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,820
Not long ago,

388
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,120
I watched Rou Rou

389
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,620
perished her primordial spirit to save me.

390
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,160
I was helplessly too.

391
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,300
so I can understand your mood.

392
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,500
Before Rou Rou died,

393
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,020
she told me to let it go.

394
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,420
As a saying in the mortal world goes,

395
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,520
the deceased now has rested in peace,
while the alive must keep living on.

396
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,540
Your mom

397
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,880
must hate seeing you like this now

398
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,060
and hate seeing that you don’t sleep or eat

399
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,580
and you’re so miserable.

400
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,640
The deceased now has rested in peace,
while the alive must keep living on.

401
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,300
Yes.

402
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,940
I think

403
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,640
they loved us so much

404
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,200
that they didn’t want us to be sorrowful.

405
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,300
Love?

406
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,480
Mi,

407
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,820
you seem to be

408
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,780
a little different from the past.

409
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,260
What is the difference?

410
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,980
Kuang Lu said

411
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,820
our wedding date has been set by Father.

412
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,500
What’s your opinion?

413
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,500
What’s your opinion?

414
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,660
I think if I refuse now,

415
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,080
he will be sadder.

416
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,540
When she was alive,

417
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,920
I couldn’t take care of her.

418
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,600
Now she is gone.

419
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,660
I want to apply to Father

420
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,440
for observing mourning for her for 3 years.

421
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,560
Mi,

422
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,660
you’re the most important person

423
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,980
to me now.

424
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,040
Will you wait for me?

425
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,180
I...

426
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,220
Stay with me for a while, OK?

427
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,720
As long as you’re by my side,

428
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,940
I won’t be so spiteful

429
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,980
and so painful.

430
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,680
Jin Mi,

431
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,040
I miss you so much.

432
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,460
Jin Mi,

433
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,180
let me have a look.

434
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,760
Have you changed
after being promoted to be an immortal?

435
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,200
It seems that there is nothing different.

436
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,960
On the contrary, I think

437
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,540
all is different.

438
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,820
Chief Peony,

439
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,960
Chief Begonia.

440
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,080
Luckily, Jin Mi comes back safely,

441
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,600
or I’ll be really unforgivable

442
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,680
and feel guilty for the late lord.

443
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,400
It’s all because of my carelessness

444
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,120
that you even had to worry about her.

445
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,080
No one expected that there were

446
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,840
so many twists and turns in just a few days.

447
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,340
No wonder that the Heaven Realm
didn’t allow us to interfere in it.

448
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,280
Unexpectedly, behind it was a hidden trap.

449
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,480
It was really unbearable
to our Floral Realm this time.

450
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,020
That’s just what I think.

451
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,360
But don’t forget

452
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,680
what Zi Fen told you.

453
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,080
We have to give the matter further thought.

454
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,380
The Floral Realm shouldn’t get involved.

455
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,160
Without the reveal of the late lord,

456
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,440
we won’t be who we are now.

457
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,120
Though the late lord
asked repeatedly not to seek revenge,

458
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,280
bullying Jin Mi

459
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,020
is insulting the Floral Realm,

460
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,680
so I can’t remain indifferent.

461
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,000
Thank all of you

462
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,320
for your kindness.

463
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,040
However, as Mi has experienced hardships,

464
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
she needs a good rest to readjust her mood.

465
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,620
I also need to think about this matter.

466
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,080
You’ve suffered a lot, Jin Mi.

467
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,460
I didn’t lead a tough life in the mortal world,

468
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,580
because Rou Rou was with me,

469
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,640
but...

470
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,540
Rou Rou?

471
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,940
Where is she?

472
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,760
Has she come alive?

473
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,380
She,

474
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,580
she came alive originally,

475
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,440
but she died later.

476
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,520
That’s her destiny.

477
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,840
Don’t blame yourself.

478
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,940
She got a life

479
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,560
in the mortal world
just because of your obsession.

480
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,420
I think Jin Mi has made some progress

481
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,660
after coming back.

482
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,620
She even refused to be Floral Immortal,

483
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,000
which was really a surprise to us.

484
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,700
I thought it was troublesome
when I learned that

485
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,060
I had to handle matters in the Floral Realm.

486
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,020
I think she’s right.

487
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,720
If she is Floral Immortal,

488
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,720
the Floral Realm will be in a mess.

489
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,280
Daddy.

490
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,320
Even an immortal has merits and faults.

491
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,560
I must be the best in
having fun and eating in the Floral Realm.

492
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,940
However, all matters of Floral Realm

493
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,900
should be in the charge of Chief Peony.

494
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,120
Only when you take charge,

495
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,360
we’ll feel assured.

496
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,840
Mi is becoming more and more sensible.

497
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,800
OK. Let’s come inside.

498
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,140
Please, Water Immortal.

499
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,360
Go, please.

500
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,190
"Zifangyun Palace"

501
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,780
In the mortal world,

502
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,620
I even killed

503
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,020
my natural father personally for Xu Feng.

504
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,800
However,

505
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,960
he didn’t change his mind at all.

506
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,120
Auntie,

507
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,040
I really don’t know what to do.

508
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,900
It seems that after
what happened in the mortal world,

509
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,220
Xu Feng is increasingly obsessed with Jin Mi.

510
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,700
Auntie,

511
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,640
what should I do?

512
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,420
Calm down.

513
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,900
Let me think about it.

514
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,260
Go back

515
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,780
to have a good rest.

516
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,880
Wait for my message, OK?

517
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,000
Yes.

518
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,060
Jin Mi.

519
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,420
Your Majesty,

520
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:16,840
time flies.

521
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,460
You have been gone for two years.

522
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,340
I wonder if you have been
reincarnated in a new body

523
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,180
and come back to the mortal world.

524
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,040
If there is a chance,

525
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,940
how I wish I can work with you

526
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,580
for another life.

527
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,320
Lord Liaoyuan,

528
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,860
you’re so loyal to Xu Feng.

529
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,600
You really don’t let me down.

530
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,659
Young man,

531
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:46,139
where are you from?

532
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,460
Young man?

533
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,460
After living for so many years,

534
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,280
I’m stilled called young man.

535
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,380
How shameful!

536
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,739
Are you a human being or a ghost?

537
00:34:01,699 --> 00:34:02,420
I’m neither a human

538
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:04,000
nor a ghost.

539
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,600
I’m an immortal.

540
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,820
The way you play chess

541
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,760
has never been seen before
and never will again.

542
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,180
Are you praising me?

543
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,520
Confidence is absolutely one of your merits.

544
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,900
Is there anything you want to say to me?

545
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,060
Daddy,

546
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,080
if,

547
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,680
if I tell you now

548
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,580
I don’t want to get married,

549
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,640
what will you do?

550
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,060
Why?

551
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,720
I used to think that
it was appropriate to marry Night Immortal,

552
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,740
but now...

553
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,600
What do you think is inappropriate now?

554
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,640
After going to the mortal world,

555
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,300
I think...

556
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,520
After you went to the mortal world,

557
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,120
what happened between
Fire Immortal and you

558
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,020
was just like a dream.

559
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,540
Don’t mix

560
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,560
the mortal Jin Mi

561
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,320
with the Immortals Jin Mi.

562
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,620
Think over it carefully
before making a decision.

563
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:39,080
Don’t make the wrong decision for the future

564
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,560
as what you did in playing chess.

565
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,280
Well,

566
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,320
Lord Liaoyuan,

567
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,620
be sure

568
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,120
not to tell Xu Feng that

569
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,680
I pushed you to the mortal world.

570
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,960
Xu Feng,

571
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,820
Lord Liaoyuan comes back with me.

572
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,120
Your Highness.

573
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,460
You went to the mortal world with me

574
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,320
to guard me.

575
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,220
Thank you very much.

576
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,240
That’s my responsibility.

577
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,120
Only you could think of

578
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,860
jumping into the Cause and Effect Plate

579
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,700
to be a mortal with me in the mortal world.

580
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,940
However, if you were an immortal,

581
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,920
you could protect me better, right?

582
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,940
Oh, why I didn’t think of that?

583
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,140
Well,

584
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,500
I have to do matchmaking
in House of Marriage.

585
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,680
I’m leaving.

586
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,480
Lord Liaoyuan,

587
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,600
as Xu Feng is grounded for several days,

588
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,680
take good care of him.

589
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,440
Where are the Phoenix Lanterns
in mortal world now?

590
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,940
They are collected in the Imperial Mausoleum.

591
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,700
Help me to take them back

592
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,000
and put by the side of the Liuzi Pond.

593
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:20,720
Yes.

594
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,400
Go.

595
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,360
Your Highness.

596
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,740
Why isn’t there
the one that I made with Jin Mi?

597
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,000
Qin Tong knew that

598
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,420
King Yi loved it most,

599
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,560
so he put it in the coffin

600
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,320
of Jin Mi and King Yi.

601
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,300
I forgot it.

602
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,920
Qin Tong in the mortal world was quite smart.

603
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,480
Why are you a bit stupid

604
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,000
after coming back to the Heaven Realm?

605
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,540
I’ll go and fetch it now.

606
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,340
Mr. Hu.

607
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,140
Look.

608
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,480
Great. Finally, you get one.

609
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,940
Mr. Hu,

610
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,580
after being an immortal,

611
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,780
Jin Mi is different.

612
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,840
She liked small toys very much before,

613
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,160
but now she loses her interest soon

614
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,740
after playing this slingshot for a while.

615
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,020
Will it be boring

616
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,340
after someone is promoted to an immortal?

617
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,060
In my opinion,

618
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,340
she is mixing up with sad,

619
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,540
unhappy and happy moods,

620
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,960
so she loses her interest in having fun.

621
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,940
She is sad for Rou Rou’s death,

622
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,300
but why is she unhappy?

623
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,960
After all she has been
promoted as an immortal

624
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,520
and gained much magic power.

625
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,120
I guess

626
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,560
it’s because of Night Immortal.

627
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,120
He is an high-level immortal

628
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,340
while she is an immortal.

629
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,760
At the end, she is

630
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,560
a level lower than her future husband,

631
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,240
which makes her feel inferior unavoidably.

632
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,900
That makes sense.

633
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,180
So she must be happy that

634
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,080
her wedding date

635
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,560
with the first Prince has been set.

636
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,500
Yes.

637
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,760
What’s that invading the Water Mirror?

638
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:17,580
Get it.
