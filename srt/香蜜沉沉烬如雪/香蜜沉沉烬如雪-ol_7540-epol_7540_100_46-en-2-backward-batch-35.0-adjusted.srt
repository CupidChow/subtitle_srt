1
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 46"

3
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,060
As expected, you attached my hair

4
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,680
to the essence of Internal Dan.

5
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,020
What is love?

6
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,700
The elder is nine years old, he is clever and pure.

7
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,360
Autumn waters are his soul, jade is his bones.

8
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,020
The younger son is five years old,
exhibiting an imposing presence.

9
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,860
The guests that fill the hall all turn their heads.

10
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,980
<i>Unwilling to get involved in troubles,</i>

11
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,579
<i>but things go contrary to the wish.</i>

12
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,690
<i>The flower in my heart has withered. </i>

13
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,360
<i>Time can’t go back...</i>

14
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,520
A bird with black feathers

15
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,900
isn’t always crow or magpie.

16
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,579
It may be an adust phoenix.

17
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,520
Do you want to change your life?

18
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,400
For example,

19
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,080
for example, be an ordinary girl,

20
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,080
or,

21
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,080
or, be my wife.

22
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,320
I’ll leave my only Phoenix Hairpin to you.

23
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,380
Don’t you know my mind?

24
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,720
Do you know that

25
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:43,380
the one destroying others’ marriage
will go to the hell?

26
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,500
Don’t you fear that?

27
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,310
I’m an immortal.

28
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,269
I’m not afraid of going to the hell.

29
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,620
I’m afraid of nothing

30
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,880
in heaven and earth.

31
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,480
The only thing I’m afraid of

32
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,160
is your mind.

33
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,360
Now,

34
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,420
you finally become my ugly wife.

35
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,120
Phoenix!

36
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,160
Run Yu,

37
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,500
what a good boy you’re!

38
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,720
Xu Feng.

39
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,280
Tai Wei.

40
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,700
Tai Wei!

41
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,380
<i>The flower in my heart has withered. </i>

42
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,130
<i>Time can’t go back.</i>

43
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,720
<i>The memory haunts me, </i>

44
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,810
<i>making me grieved.</i>

45
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,770
<i>Hope I won’t feel regret in the rest of my life. </i>

46
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,020
<i>Fly away with the fragrance of the flowers.</i>

47
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,770
<i>A pot of clear wine </i>

48
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,940
<i>and the dust on me...</i>

49
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,720
Your Majesty.

50
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,460
Xu Feng.

51
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,840
Save him.

52
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,680
Your Majesty.

53
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,140
You don’t have to do this.

54
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,720
Mi.

55
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,400
l can’t lose him.

56
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,530
Let me go.

57
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,080
Let me go!

58
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,900
Why?

59
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,400
Why did you kill him?

60
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,680
I love him dearly,

61
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,780
but you killed him.

62
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,660
Why?

63
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,540
Why?

64
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,230
<i>A pot of clear wine </i>

65
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,400
<i>and the dust on me.</i>

66
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,740
<i>As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.</i>

67
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:04,220
<i>People come and go in my life
despite the vanity and right and wrong.</i>

68
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:11,300
<i>I look back and taste the
aftertaste of the wine in my heart.</i>

69
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:17,940
<i>I know clearly all these births and deaths in my memory...</i>

70
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,520
Your Majesty,

71
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,420
Water Immortal has been sleeping for half a year.

72
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,560
We can’t wake her up no matter how hard we try.

73
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,020
Would she

74
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,500
remain unconscious forever?

75
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,800
No.

76
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,380
She’ll recover her consciousness.

77
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,220
She’ll come back to me.

78
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,539
Your Majesty, I’ve chosen 108 heaven generals

79
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:06,980
from millions of heaven troops

80
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,240
to guard outside the palace.

81
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:13,730
However, the Palace General is very important,

82
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,360
you should decide it personally.

83
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,280
What do you think about Po Jun?

84
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,240
Po Jun?

85
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,540
Your Majesty, he was promoted

86
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,480
by Fire Immortal personally.

87
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,910
Palace General will rule 30,000 immortals

88
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,620
to guard you closely, Your Majesty.

89
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,940
It’ll be impossible to defend effectively

90
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,580
if he becomes disloyal.

91
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,280
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

92
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,880
Po Jun is loyal and honest.

93
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,120
If he agrees, he won’t be disloyal.

94
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,680
If he is disloyal, he won’t agree.

95
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,260
Your Majesty, you’re tolerant,

96
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,520
-but...
-Half a year ago,

97
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,980
Heaven Realm was severely damaged in chaos.

98
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,420
Now as a thousand things wait to be done,

99
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,980
we need more talents.

100
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,180
I want to tell immortals and six realms

101
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,460
that everything takes on a completely
new look in Heaven Realm.

102
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,980
Now I’ll use virtuous and talented
people regardless of their past.

103
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,280
What matters is that everyone knows this,

104
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,780
not

105
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,200
the agreement of Po Jun.

106
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,090
Your Majesty,

107
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,890
you are considerate to the people, wise and brilliant.

108
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,060
I’ll deal with it now.

109
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,060
It changes in a flash and the scenery is beautiful.

110
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,560
Under the colorful cloud is a grand pavilion.

111
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,060
In the breeze and drizzle, the boat is covered by mist.

112
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,640
The girl in her private room
hasn’t realized how valuable time is.

113
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,420
Wei.

114
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,940
Wei.

115
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,660
Go to tell His Majesty that Water Immortal

116
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,320
has recovered her consciousness.

117
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,380
Hurry up.

118
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,580
Immortal, please wait.

119
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,080
The grand enthronement of
His Majesty ended just now.

120
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,360
He is drinking with immortals happily.

121
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,120
His Majesty was anxious for you

122
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,960
when you remained unconscious
in the past half a year.

123
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,800
I remained unconscious for half a year?

124
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,100
You mentioned Water Immortal just now.

125
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,120
Is my dad also here?

126
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,200
You’re

127
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,940
Water Immortal now.

128
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,540
Do you forget it?

129
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,920
Yes, my dad has gone.

130
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,880
This isn’t a dream.

131
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,780
Well,

132
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,420
Fire Immortal.

133
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,640
How about Fire Immortal?

134
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,440
Fire Immortal?

135
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,120
Now,

136
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,800
there isn’t Fire Immortal.

137
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,760
As you haven’t recovered,

138
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,860
don’t think too much.

139
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,220
Please have a rest.

140
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,340
You killed my dad

141
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,820
and Auntie Lin Xiu!

142
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,060
I did kill him.

143
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,860
Immortal, you just came to yourself

144
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,700
and haven’t recovered yet.

145
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,220
Please don’t overly grieve.

146
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,940
Mi.

147
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,200
Mi.

148
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,820
Mi.

149
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,740
Kuang Lu, you can leave.

150
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,620
Mi, finally you recover your consciousness.

151
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,460
Do you feel any discomfort?

152
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,000
I...

153
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,740
It hurts.

154
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,060
It hurts.

155
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,530
Where?

156
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,320
I can transfer magic power to you

157
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,820
to ease your pain, OK?

158
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,600
I don’t know.

159
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,480
I feel

160
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,020
it expands from my chest

161
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,140
to the whole body.

162
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,580
I feel that I’m cut by knives
and probed by stone needles.

163
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,300
I can’t tell it.

164
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,840
I just feel that

165
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,380
my whole body is aching.

166
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,780
It,

167
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,280
it, it hurts,

168
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,520
but I don’t know

169
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,920
where it hurts.

170
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,700
My mouth is bitter.

171
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,280
OK, Mi,

172
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,100
take sweets and it won’t be bitter.

173
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,960
Here, Mi.

174
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,290
How are you?

175
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,090
Do you feel better?

176
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,600
Mi.

177
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,060
Mi.

178
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,480
Mi.

179
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,140
It’ll be fine, Mi.

180
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,120
It’ll be fine.

181
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,800
Everything is going to be all right.

182
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,880
Everything is going to be all right.

183
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,760
Mi, look.

184
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,340
The night-blooming cereus under the tree

185
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,240
keeps blooming for you.

186
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,700
How beautiful!

187
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,000
After you recover,

188
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,320
we’ll hold another wedding ceremony

189
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,340
in this spring, OK?

190
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,240
Fairy Shangyuan.

191
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,560
Your Majesty.

192
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,580
Kuang Lu helped me a lot

193
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,580
to rectify Heaven Realm

194
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,160
in the past half a year.

195
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,660
Your Majesty, she was of little help,

196
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,550
but you promoted her to Fairy Shangyuan

197
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,540
and gave her Xuanzhou Fairyland.

198
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,540
Thank you very much.

199
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,380
I’m strict and fair in meeting out
rewards and punishments.

200
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,020
She works properly and discreetly,

201
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,860
so she deserves these rewards.

202
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,620
Your Majesty,

203
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,740
I don’t need these possessions.

204
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,200
I just want to serve you.

205
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,120
I gave you the fairyland

206
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,520
as a place for editing

207
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,180
the astronomical calendar of Heaven Realm.

208
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,130
The climate and other natural phenomena of a season

209
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,420
are important to the livelihood of six realms.

210
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,080
The old calendar is inaccurate
and against the farming season.

211
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,140
It’s urgent to make a new one.

212
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,120
It’s a heavy task.

213
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,540
I know it.

214
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,200
I’ll try my best.

215
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,780
Get up.

216
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,430
Your Majesty,

217
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,350
Water Immortal just recovered her consciousness

218
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,000
and is still very weak.

219
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,440
I remember

220
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,860
my father gave Supreme Lord Lao an elixir

221
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,500
for tranquilizing and  nourishing vitality.

222
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,440
We can try it on her.

223
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,480
No need.

224
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,990
It's a sore point with her

225
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,780
Elixirs won’t work.

226
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,360
Give her more time.

227
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:27,920
Yes.

228
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,940
By the way, Your Majesty,

229
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:32,819
these are the related documents and evidence

230
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:33,920
of the case of the late Water Immortal.

231
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,560
After you read them,

232
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,920
I’ll keep them on file.

233
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,980
No need.

234
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,319
I trust you.

235
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,160
Keep these documents

236
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,880
on file carefully in the Archives Pavilion

237
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,480
of Pixiang Hall personally,

238
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,060
lest she think of her dad sadly upon seeing them

239
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,599
as she just recovered her consciousness.

240
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,500
Yes, I’ll deal with it now.

241
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,080
I’ll leave.

242
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,400
Your Majesty, I’ll leave too.

243
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,340
These are for you.

244
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,340
They are seeds of night-blooming cereus

245
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,580
which just blooms at night

246
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,020
and sleeps most of the day.

247
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,360
I think your habit is somewhat the same,

248
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,700
so I give it to you

249
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,640
to keep your company.

250
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,440
Mi,

251
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,840
everything in the past

252
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,760
isn’t important any more.

253
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,880
The old men and past things

254
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,240
will vanish.

255
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,100
I won’t let you suffer any pain.

256
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,920
We’ll lead

257
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,240
a peaceful and happy life,

258
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,040
OK?

259
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,000
Xu Feng.

260
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,340
Why are you here?

261
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,600
You come to see how miserable I am, right?

262
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,180
You still have a bad temper.

263
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,240
If you’re miserable,

264
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,920
I’d like to congratulate you.

265
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,080
Don’t be pleased too early.

266
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,400
After Xu Feng becomes Heavenly Emperor,

267
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,400
he’ll take me out.

268
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,600
By then, I won’t let you go.

269
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,320
I’m sorry to disappoint you.

270
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,320
You have no idea.

271
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,320
Half a year ago,

272
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,560
Xu Feng failed in the mutiny

273
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,390
on my wedding day with Jin Mi

274
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,860
so he was killed

275
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,800
with his essence destroyed.

276
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,100
That’s impossible.

277
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,580
Stop kidding.

278
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,920
Wait.

279
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,400
And

280
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,160
my father was so distressed at Xu Feng’s death

281
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,990
that he destroyed his own primordial spirit

282
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,480
to kill himself.

283
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,580
Impossible.

284
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,710
That’s impossible.

285
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:31,960
You’re kidding me.

286
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,520
You’re kidding me.

287
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,960
Your Majesty.

288
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,480
Your Majesty?

289
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,360
It doesn’t matter.

290
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,440
Just leave.

291
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,140
-Yes.
-Yes.

292
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,030
That’s impossible.

293
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,910
You’re kidding me.

294
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,960
You’re kidding me.

295
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,800
You’re kidding me.

296
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,420
Why?

297
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,460
Why?

298
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,600
Even though you hate me,

299
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,880
you shouldn’t kill Xu Feng.

300
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,380
He treated you as his elder brother.

301
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,080
What did he do?

302
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,700
He was innocent.

303
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,520
Tell me.

304
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,740
What did my mother do?

305
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,120
What did Jin Mi do?

306
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,860
Thousands of members of
the Water Family in Lize Pond

307
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,240
were innocent.

308
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,240
When you killed my mother,

309
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,870
eliminated her family

310
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,260
and plotted to murder Jin Mi,

311
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,980
were you softhearted?

312
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,980
When you killed others

313
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,980
for my father,

314
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,840
did you ever think that they were innocent

315
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,760
and had families?

316
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,000
I should never have brought you back.

317
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,360
I should have killed you

318
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,740
to avoid today’s disaster.

319
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,740
You’re right.

320
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,940
I’m just a puppet

321
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,480
you used to strive for Father’s favor and take credit,

322
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,320
but you didn’t expect that

323
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,120
I would be against you some day.

324
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,300
You think

325
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,800
I’m willing to witness my birth dad

326
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,100
and brother

327
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,860
died in front of me?

328
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,360
No, I’m not!

329
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,860
You should kill me in the beginning.

330
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,240
Maybe

331
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,560
I could free myself early

332
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,640
if you killed me.

333
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:58,180
Both of Xu Feng and His Majesty died.

334
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,580
It’s meaningless for me to go on living.

335
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,780
Kill me.

336
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,960
OK.

337
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,020
If you don’t want to live,
you can jump down from here.

338
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,160
Back then,

339
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,220
the past Floral Immortal was
forced to jump down from here

340
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,860
after being burnt by your Glazed Pure Fire.

341
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,860
Mother,

342
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,960
you’re always superior,

343
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,960
but you should know

344
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,100
many immortals die under here

345
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,360
and many living beings

346
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,060
make contributions to your high status.

347
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,060
If you really want to die,

348
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,080
jump down from here

349
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,740
and have a look

350
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,440
at those innocent living beings

351
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,940
who were killed by you.

352
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,980
Have a look at them.

353
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:39,820
Mother,

354
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,340
I won’t allow you to die so easily.

355
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,400
I want you to be alive

356
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,520
and experience such feelings
of losing your husband and son

357
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,120
and see how I, your rebellious son

358
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,880
unify the Heaven Realm

359
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,620
and pacify it for long.

360
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,060
Xu.

361
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,560
Xu.

362
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,020
Xu.

363
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,000
Xu.

364
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,980
Mom!

365
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,700
I’m tired.

366
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,980
Hug me like this for a while.

367
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,000
You’re late.

368
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,620
Drink a cup of wine as a punishment.

369
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,860
I put it out.

370
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,640
I set fire.

371
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,460
I put it out again.

372
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,040
I set fire again.

373
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,960
He is just an encumbrance

374
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,320
after a night of romance of His Majesty.

375
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,340
He doesn’t surpass the second Prince.

376
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,740
After marrying Fire Immortal

377
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,000
and becoming his wife

378
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,140
in the future,

379
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,140
you have to reduce

380
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,140
to respecting Night Immortal.

381
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,580
Stop talking about

382
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,580
this undetermined thing,

383
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,660
but for the second Prince…

384
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,780
I'm flattered.

385
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,530
I don’t deserve it.

386
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,700
-Your Highness.
-The second Prince.

387
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,640
We…

388
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,220
The first Prince always speaks and acts
cautiously and lives a simple life.

389
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,220
When did he offend you?

390
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,860
Should I apologize to you for him?

391
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,360
Your Highness, don’t take it seriously.

392
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,740
Just now we were just saying it.

393
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,300
Someone who loves and respects others

394
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,760
will be also loved and respected by others.

395
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,220
Night Immortal is my elder brother.

396
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,460
I always respect and think highly of him

397
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,520
and won’t treat him casually.

398
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,980
What do you mean?

399
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,560
Your Highness, sorry. I’m wrong.

400
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,860
I shouldn’t say that.

401
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,860
Princess Sui He is pampered.

402
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,000
If she really marries me in the future,

403
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,520
she has to please, respect and
treat Night Immortal as her elder brother.

404
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,900
I really worry she will be wronged.

405
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,640
You’re right.

406
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,820
As the princess of the Bird Family,

407
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,580
I should speak and act cautiously.

408
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,330
Thank you for reminding.

409
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,060
No need.

410
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,400
I’m leaving.

411
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,610
Run Yu,

412
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,570
don’t mind their words.

413
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,400
They’re right,

414
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,120
but I won’t mind their words.

415
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,700
No matter how they talk about me,

416
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,640
Sui He is really kind to you.

417
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,640
Don’t offend her for my sake.

418
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,660
Otherwise, Mother will…

419
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,360
I just want them to know

420
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,160
I don’t allow them to offend you.

421
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,200
Well, forget it.

422
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,270
Don’t have a stormy relationship

423
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,540
because of me.

424
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,560
Here you are.

425
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,460
What’s this?

426
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,780
Open it and have a look.

427
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,100
So mysterious.

428
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,380
You get them from Zifangyun Palace?

429
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,660
I have recovered early,

430
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,940
but you’re poisoned by fire and injured.

431
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,540
It can nourish your body.

432
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,740
Thank you.

433
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,960
I’m going to the drill ground.

434
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,060
Wait a minute.

435
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,340
This is Sparkling Aqua-essence.

436
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,460
It can relieve the ice toxin in your body.

437
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,060
I can use it to make tea.

438
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,060
Thank you.

439
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,000
Xu Feng,

440
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,220
you’re dead,

441
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,000
but why do you always appear in front of me?

442
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,620
You’re always superior,

443
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,580
spoiled and loved by others.

444
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,540
Everyone regards you as a bright sun,

445
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,420
admires your excellence

446
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,420
and eulogizes your feats.

447
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,280
I’m also excellent,

448
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,120
but I have no choice.

449
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,800
You,

450
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,500
you always gave me things,

451
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,440
but you never asked me

452
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,280
whether I wanted them.

453
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,440
Now I tell you,

454
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,440
I don’t want them.

455
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,380
I don’t want

456
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,040
your hypocritical rewards and mercy

457
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,120
and even your alms.

458
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,780
Xu Feng, do you know?

459
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,900
In the past,

460
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,140
I always hoped I could become stronger,

461
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,080
because I hoped

462
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,380
I could give you what you wanted

463
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,400
some day,

464
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,760
but later I finally realized that

465
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,080
with you,

466
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,740
I wouldn’t become the stronger one forever.

467
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,860
Tai Wei was shrewd all his life,

468
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,020
but he was killed his son.

469
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,960
Night Immortal killed his dad and young brother

470
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,380
as Tai Wei did in the past.

471
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,460
Maybe Tai Wei didn’t expect it.

472
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,020
He deserves it.

473
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,390
My Lord,

474
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,640
Night Immortal just ascended the throne.

475
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,020
Now Heaven Realm isn’t stable

476
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,100
and immortals aren’t of one mind.

477
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,420
It’s a good time to attack Heaven Realm.

478
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,340
You’re right.

479
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,110
In the past six months,

480
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,660
I recruit followers to enlarge
the forces of our Demon Realm,

481
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,400
hoping to fight against Heaven Realm heartily.

482
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,080
Tai Wei,

483
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,880
I’ll realize the great aspiration of unifying the six realms

484
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,000
that you didn’t realize.

485
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,480
Jin Mi has awaked?

486
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,380
What do you want to do?

487
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,420
I regret stopping you

488
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,320
from killing her with Spirit-Vanishing
Arrow in the mortal world.

489
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,720
I planned to kill her,

490
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,720
but you stopped me.

491
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:35,540
I didn’t know she was so despicable.

492
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,880
I’m so blind

493
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,460
to treat her as my good friend.

494
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,520
Let me kill her to revenge Xu Feng.

495
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,580
I know you hate Jin Mi

496
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,000
because of Xu Feng,

497
00:33:46,219 --> 00:33:47,739
but now Run Yu has become Heavenly Emperor.

498
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,500
We can’t change anything.

499
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,080
I really don’t understand.

500
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,719
Why does the world become like this?

501
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:56,360
It’s common that mortals kill others
to fight for the throne,

502
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,540
but why are Heaven Realm and Demon Realm

503
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,480
which have been peaceful for 10,000 years

504
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,620
also in chaos?

505
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,900
As a son and minister, Run Yu seized his dad’s power,

506
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:04,100
but he is still righteous?

507
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,400
You’re right,

508
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:06,969
but you should know

509
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,969
the new Heavenly Emperor just ascended the throne,

510
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,120
and we don’t know how he’ll treat our Demon Realm,

511
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,760
so we must take the long view

512
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,940
and follow the tendency.

513
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,719
Follow the tendency?

514
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,320
It’s none of our business.

515
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:20,320
It’s the best that King of Gu City
fights against Run Yu

516
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,639
and neither of them gains.

517
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,900
Keep your voice down.

518
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,780
King of Gu City is Demon Lord now.

519
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,820
Even your uncle and dad have to show their respect

520
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,820
when meeting him.

521
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,720
Moreover,

522
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,500
if King of Qing City didn’t mediate in it,

523
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,840
we would be eliminated from Demon Realm.

524
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,380
If you meet him later, be respectful.

525
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,480
Heavenly Emperor and Demon Lord

526
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,760
are shameless men of no scruples now.

527
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,220
The peace of six realms

528
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,720
will be destroyed by them some day.

529
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,000
By the way,

530
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,900
as Run Yu ascended the throne,

531
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,820
Jin Mi will be Heavenly Empress soon.

532
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,820
Heavenly Empress!

533
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,040
They collude in doing evil.

534
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,800
What a good match!

535
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,900
I was blind before.

536
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,340
I’ll kill her when I meet her later.

537
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,340
Calm down.

538
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,340
We were not present that day.

539
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,480
I always think that

540
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,800
perhaps there is something unknown to us.

541
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,440
I don’t care.

542
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,040
It’s true that she killed Xu Feng.

543
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,280
Xu Feng just made effort in vain to love.

544
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,790
Immortal,

545
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,830
when you fainted, His Majesty

546
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,800
planted night-blooming cereus

547
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,060
and watered it with magic power personally.

548
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,300
It’ll bloom even in the daytime,

549
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,440
so you can see it after
recovering your consciousness.

550
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,160
It’s said that phoenix flowers
in the mortal world blooms in two seasons.

551
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,980
One brings fate, and the other takes away fate.

552
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,340
I use magic power

553
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,880
to make it bloom forever.

554
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,560
People will part with each other eventually.

555
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,820
Blooms and dead flowers will fall without exception.

556
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,360
Mi.

557
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,100
Mi, what’s wrong?

558
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,900
I’m fine.

559
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,220
Don’t keep it to yourself.

560
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,520
What I promised to you have all been fulfilled.

561
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,860
Now,

562
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,960
those who once hurt you

563
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
have been punished.

564
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,340
The dethroned Heavenly Empress

565
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,940
is locked up in the extremely cold Linyuan Tower

566
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,760
and lives a very miserable life.

567
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,340
And

568
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,950
you killed Xu Feng

569
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,980
as he killed your dad.

570
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,620
As you’ve avenged,

571
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,280
Floral Immortal, Water Immortal and Wind Immortal

572
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,680
can rest in peace.

573
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,740
Mi.

574
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:46,940
Mi.

575
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,300
Mi, I know.

576
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,460
As you lost your closest relatives

577
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,680
and experienced the decisive moment,

578
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:23,540
you’re suffering and struggling.

579
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,660
You’re finished with Xu Feng.

580
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,660
You just did what you were supposed to do.

581
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,260
Don’t torture yourself.

582
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,040
Everything is going to be all right.

583
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,760
Your Highness.

584
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,200
Do you want some raisins?

585
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,400
These raisins...

586
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,180
are soft, sticky and firm,
the sweetness is just right,

587
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,680
They are of top grade of raisins.

588
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,800
Have a try.

589
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,500
Why do you like raisins so much?

590
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,740
Well, we are what we eat.

591
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,940
Don’t you want to try?

592
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,800
If you go on like this,

593
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,000
I will feed you in the way I did last time.

594
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,560
Mi,

595
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,880
Xu Feng has been gone.

596
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,160
Afterwards,

597
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,300
no matter whether you’re happy or sad,

598
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,680
I’ll be always by your side.

599
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,140
After you recover,

600
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,360
I’ll hold a grand wedding ceremony for you.

601
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,740
We’ll live a life like this

602
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,060
in the next thousands of years.

603
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,840
OK?

604
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,100
Why?

605
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,040
You killed my dad

606
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,600
and Auntie Lin Xiu.

607
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,020
Have you loved me?

608
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,900
He made mistakes,

609
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,220
but why do I cry?
