1
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 02"

3
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:51,980
How about this?

4
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:52,860
We will search this side

5
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:53,760
You guys search that side

6
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,440
Okay

7
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,840
Hey!

8
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,740
This...

9
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,620
What is this water used for?

10
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,060
Of course it's for washing feet, bathing, and washing clothes

11
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,440
You uncivilized little demon, unbearable filthiness

12
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,620
Friend, you really are strange

13
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,580
You just said this water is refreshing

14
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,600
But now you say I'm filthy?

15
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,460
Could it be that magpies all like to get angry often?

16
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,500
Let me ask you

17
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,160
This is the Floral Realm

18
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,460
Precisely

19
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,380
Hey!

20
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,440
Are you leaving the Floral Realm?

21
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,960
But you haven't repaid me back yet

22
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,920
How would you like me to repay you?

23
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:55,720
Now we are talking!

24
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,040
Just bring me to the Heaven Realm

25
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,840
then we will be even

26
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,770
No way...

27
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,100
I thought his skills were great

28
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,060
How come with one tug and he fell into the water?

29
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,680
This wretched bird

30
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,380
We definitely need to find it

31
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,720
Let's go over there to take a look

32
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,680
Yes

33
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,120
Jin Mi

34
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,620
There was a bird yesterday that broke through the Water Mirror

35
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,320
Have you seen it?

36
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,420
Bird...

37
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
What bird?

38
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,500
Can fly, have wings,

39
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,240
and its body is burned with fire

40
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
What is that moving?

41
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,780
I'm washing my feet

42
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,100
Even if we have to dig several feet or turn the Realm inside out,

43
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,810
we have to catch that bird.

44
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Let's go

45
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
Friend

46
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
Friend

47
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,659
Friend

48
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
No way...

49
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:22,220
He couldn't have died again, right?

50
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,700
How can this be any good?

51
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,060
I got it!

52
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,340
Six Auspicious Treasures!

53
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,650
Friend

54
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,060
Friend

55
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,660
You're awake!

56
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,980
My Floral Realm's Six Auspicious Treasures is really effective

57
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,720
What did you just feed me?

58
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,160
Six Auspicious Treasures

59
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,700
What Six Auspicious Treasures?

60
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,200
This is it

61
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,540
Onion, ginger, garlic

62
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,320
Celery, cilantro, and Sichuan pepper

63
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,080
This is my ancestor's medicine for sickness

64
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,580
and specifically for birds who have fallen into water

65
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,240
Do you believe that I'll destroy you?

66
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,680
You want to destroy me?

67
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,280
Friend, I think you have it all wrong

68
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,680
Earlier, you most likely also heard Chief Begonia say,

69
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,220
even if the Floral Realm has to dig several feet to find you, they will still look for you

70
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,440
So now,

71
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,980
the only person that can help hide you in the Floral Realm,

72
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,159
is me

73
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,460
If I'm found out,

74
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,180
then you will be finished.

75
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,960
Once you are discovered,

76
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,100
they will cut your legs

77
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,840
and make you become flower fertilizer

78
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,420
My dignified Heavenly Realm

79
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,000
What about your dignified Heavenly Realm?

80
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,480
Why would someone as dignified as me

81
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,880
come here

82
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,060
and be afraid of some Flower and Fruit Spirits

83
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,720
You are too funny

84
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,180
The dignified great man in the Heavenly Realm

85
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,300
comes and goes freely

86
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:41,960
Then why every time

87
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,920
you are in trouble

88
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,840
It is me

89
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,080
the small fruit elf who saved you

90
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,540
You saved my life?

91
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,420
Two times

92
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,940
I saved you twice

93
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,100
But a person like me

94
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,980
is not that kind of

95
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,000
arrogant and prideful person

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,880
And I will not force you

97
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,020
into calling me your benefactor

98
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,320
It is clearly you

99
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,780
As the proverb goes

100
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,159
A drop of water should be returned by a spring

101
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,200
My kindness towards you

102
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,080
meant I not only used one drop,

103
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,700
but four drops

104
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,640
Four drops of fermented honey

105
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,280
A favor that saved two lives

106
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,720
The first time I saved your life

107
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,820
is at the night of the day before yesterday

108
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,200
I used 500 years old fermented honey

109
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,040
to save your life

110
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,700
and to help you transform back to your true form.

111
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
Forget it

112
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,860
Hey! I'm not done talking

113
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,860
I'm not done yet

114
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,080
The second time was just now

115
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,170
I used 3 drops of fermented honey to help you gain consciousness

116
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,080
What on earth do you want

117
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,380
Friend

118
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,320
Didn't we discuss before?

119
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,680
If you can help take me out of the Water Mirror

120
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,880
and bring me to the Heaven Realm

121
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,020
then these 4 drops of fermented honey

122
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,900
and the two times I saved you can be even

123
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
What do you think?

124
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,460
No

125
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,760
Wait!

126
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,660
Don't go yet!

127
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,400
There's something I just thought of

128
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,160
that I better tell you

129
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,710
Okay, please say it

130
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,340
My true body

131
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,780
is actually a bird

132
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,980
Usually

133
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,440
I like eating fruits

134
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,700
Forget it

135
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,970
It seems like this place is not dangerous

136
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,720
I can rest for a few days

137
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,800
Thatâ€™s a very moody bird

138
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,800
I'm leaving the day after tomorrow

139
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,750
Really? Great!

140
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,920
We as fruits,

141
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,220
cannot lower ourselves to

142
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,220
the same level as a bird

143
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,910
King of Gu City

144
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Go ahead

145
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,050
Demon Lord

146
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,740
Congratulations!

147
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,620
You can all take your leave

148
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
King of Gu City

149
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,920
Where is this congratulations coming from?

150
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,780
I just received information

151
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,300
that the Fire Immortal

152
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,960
has unexpectedly gotten into an incident

153
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,100
His whereabouts are unknown right now

154
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,420
Is this information credible?

155
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,240
I heard that the Heavenly Emperor is furious

156
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,200
that he ordered 10,000 soldiers to search for the Fire Immortal

157
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,960
Congratulations Demon Lord

158
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,020
Congratulations Demon Lord

159
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,260
Thank you!

160
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,460
Drink up!

161
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,460
Cheers, cheers!

162
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,680
That Fire Immortal

163
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,200
is always arrogant

164
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,600
He destroyed so many of soldiers In my Demon tribe

165
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,960
Godâ€™s way really goes in a cycle

166
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,680
He will pay for what he did

167
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,980
Phoenix Nirvana

168
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,420
is now escaping from death

169
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,640
Now the Heaven Realm has weak military power

170
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,460
I think that

171
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,460
We can strike while the iron is hot

172
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,540
and send soldiers straight to Huang Long

173
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,640
King of Gu City is right

174
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,380
Pass my order

175
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,060
Inform the six ministries

176
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,780
to recruit twenty thousand soldiers

177
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,020
Gather them at the riverside of Wangchuan River after ten days

178
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,740
March into the Heaven Realm

179
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,180
Mighty Demon Lord

180
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,280
Relax

181
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,240
The Heavenly Guards has already been sent to search

182
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,060
I believe that we will get some news soon

183
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,000
I have a request

184
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,700
If the Fire Immortal

185
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,200
safely comes back,

186
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,540
can you agree to my request?

187
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,280
What is it?

188
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,480
The position of crown prince has been empty for a while

189
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,340
All celestials are talking about it

190
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,340
Xu Feng is the first son of the legal wife

191
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,840
He has made great contributions in the battles

192
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,640
He is respected and supported by the public

193
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,180
I wish, your majesty

194
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,180
can appoint Xu Feng as the crown prince

195
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,520
as soon as possible

196
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,000
How come you suddenly brought this up?

197
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,380
What does the disappearance of Xu Feng

198
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,130
has to do with this

199
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,580
Your majesty

200
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,680
do you believe this is an accident

201
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,960
I believe

202
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,600
that someone has caught us off guard

203
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
to torment my son

204
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,960
Liaoyuanâ€™s words are still lingering

205
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,450
Will your majesty

206
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,410
excuse this person

207
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,410
Liaoyuan also said that

208
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,690
on that day

209
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,980
Run Yu did not enter the Qiwu Palace

210
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,900
If you want to place blame upon others

211
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,540
you should show convincing evidence

212
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,900
I did not want to be blunt before

213
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,300
Secrets of the heaven

214
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,980
is easy to bring trouble

215
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,160
but now Xu Feng is in danger

216
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,320
The ones who benefit from it

217
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,940
are those

218
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,630
who carry an ambitious heart like a wolf

219
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,500
Your majesty

220
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,240
You must appoint someone sooner

221
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,820
to end the greed of these people

222
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,060
Alright, alright

223
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,160
No need to say anymore

224
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,980
Lets wait until the Xu Feng returns

225
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,240
and discuss this afterwards

226
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,380
Xu Feng is fearless and the bravest in the army

227
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,550
How could he be so easily harmed by others

228
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,000
Run Yu is virtuous and kind-hearted

229
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,500
he would never harm others so easily

230
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
My queen

231
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,640
Do not believe

232
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,060
these villains who

233
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,880
stir up trouble between families of the heaven

234
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,000
Virtuous and kind-hearted, what a description

235
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,480
Are you ready yet?

236
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,640
I wonâ€™t wait

237
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,520
I'm leaving

238
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,620
I'm ready, I'm ready

239
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,450
Let's go

240
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,040
Are you bringing the entire house with you?

241
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Not exactly

242
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,040
It is a long way

243
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,980
I donâ€™t even know if

244
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,160
I will be used to living in the Heaven Realm

245
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,700
Bringing more is better than bringing nothing

246
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,800
Wild evil

247
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,180
How could the Heaven Realm allow you to reside long

248
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,420
Do not bring one thing

249
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,500
Even one thing

250
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,340
to bring

251
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,620
Friend

252
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,560
Have you forgotten what this is?

253
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,560
This is the fermented honey that I spent 500 years cultivating

254
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,800
and used it to rescue you

255
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,340
You also drank four drops of it

256
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,840
Although when you were drinking it,

257
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,500
you weren't conscious,

258
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,800
the effects

259
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,000
you already know how effective it was

260
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,280
In case you run into

261
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,630
some emergencies

262
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,990
something of vital importance

263
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,520
Let's go

264
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,600
Wait! Give me a second!

265
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,320
Don't worry, I wouldn't abandon you

266
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
I'm ready

267
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
You are really the oldest sister

268
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,110
This success

269
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,840
is not due to my own contribution

270
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,500
but thanks to the effort of all the sisters the people in the enchantment

271
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,240
the people in the enchantment

272
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
can enjoy peaceful days again

273
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,920
But recently

274
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,120
I still could not find

275
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,360
the breath of that flying bird

276
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,360
I feel really anxious

277
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,540
Maybe it died

278
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,740
Or maybe it flew back the way it came

279
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,660
It is not yet known

280
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,860
Or maybe it has excellent skills

281
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,980
that can handle himself in all situations

282
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,220
with an untraceable track

283
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,840
You have worried too much, sister

284
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,000
Not that I am arrogant

285
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,920
The old enchantment

286
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,920
is established by the former god of flower before dying

287
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,860
At that time, the god is weak in his power

288
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,160
Now that four thousand years have passed

289
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,160
The enchantment is already unsteady

290
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,200
The birds just accidentally

291
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,740
took a strike

292
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,300
The person who breaks the enchantment

293
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,760
of we sisters this time

294
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,260
can be counted by two hands

295
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,980
in all the six domains

296
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:31,079
Was that the bird

297
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:32,119
He has gone too far

298
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,180
under our nose

299
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,060
Sister

300
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,140
I will catch it immediately

301
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,339
cut its legs

302
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:37,500
and use them as fertilizers

303
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,860
Fellow, can you be more steady

304
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,200
It is making me feel dizzy

305
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,140
If you keep doing this

306
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,540
I am about to throw up

307
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,540
Believe it or not

308
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,540
I am throwing you down here

309
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,540
I am really about to throw up

310
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,840
Don't throw up

311
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,400
You

312
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,660
I am flying in the sky

313
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,520
I am in the sky

314
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:02,880
Watch out

315
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,320
Itâ€™s windy and foggy

316
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,820
Be careful that itâ€™s not steady

317
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,120
If you roll down I wonâ€™t catch you

318
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,980
Itâ€™s my first time flying up

319
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,980
I need to see the

320
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,980
beautiful scenery

321
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,900
This is just the third level of heaven

322
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,420
You are really inexperienced

323
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,200
Whatâ€™s there to see

324
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,760
Damn bird

325
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,100
Freeze there

326
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,540
No no

327
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
Chief Begonia is near

328
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,320
Let's go

329
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,100
Go go

330
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,980
Are all the people in the Floral Realm

331
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,460
sticky like a limpet

332
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,480
Please donâ€™t abandon me

333
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,980
Even if you abandon me

334
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,480
She will also

335
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,540
Cut both your feet

336
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,620
and use them as fertilizers

337
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,340
This celestial looks fine

338
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,320
but has such a vicious heart

339
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,480
It truly doesn't match

340
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,940
Your great appearance

341
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,000
Damn bird

342
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,360
Trespassing my Floral Realm

343
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,320
Destroying the Water Mirror enchantment

344
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,100
Was it your master Sui He

345
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,460
who sent you here

346
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,420
Sui He

347
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,940
She cannot control me

348
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,900
How confident

349
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,340
Your master Sui He is incompetent

350
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,360
I will place discipline in place of her

351
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,700
You evil animal

352
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,400
Sorry for offending you

353
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,820
This little naughty

354
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,020
has been chattering about leaving the Water Mirror

355
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,480
Has she really left

356
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Thatâ€™s not possible

357
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,160
Where can she go

358
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,020
Mr. Hu

359
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,060
Chief Peony

360
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,540
Where did Jin Mi go

361
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,700
Picking flowers in the jungle, washing clothes in the backyard

362
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
Picking flower, washing clothes

363
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,040
You have always been close with Jin Mi

364
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,700
Where on earth did she go

365
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,160
Chief Peony

366
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,280
We really do not know this

367
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,800
Everyone focuses on practicing

368
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,960
brewing honey

369
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,240
Every one cannot always

370
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,560
stay together

371
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,220
Could it be

372
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,860
that she is playing hide and seek

373
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,560
and hid herself

374
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,220
I have used my power

375
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,200
to detect the whole Water Mirror

376
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,820
I did not find

377
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,980
any breath of Jin Mi

378
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,700
She is not

379
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,320
in the Water Mirror anymore

380
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,320
These days

381
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,160
Did you notice her

382
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,620
doing anything unusual?

383
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,380
Yes

384
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,640
Recently

385
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,520
Her appetite has increased

386
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,360
Of course a bird tribe

387
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,320
The crow disappeared

388
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,960
Little naughty disappeared

389
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,100
Could it be the crow

390
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,100
who ate little naughty

391
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,440
Heavenly Empress used to be head of the bird trible

392
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,480
Although not harmonious with our Floral Realm

393
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,820
But with her position and honor

394
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,520
Thereâ€™s no reason for her to come to the Floral Realm

395
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,660
Plundering a little elf

396
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
Could it be that

397
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,190
No matter what intention that bird has

398
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,560
Whether it is planned or not

399
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,380
We must get Jin Mi back

400
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,980
Mr. Hu

401
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,100
You did not take care of Jin Mi enough

402
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,600
Go look for her immediately

403
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,780
If you cannot find her

404
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,740
I will cut

405
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,820
your old skin

406
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,060
and send you to a rabbit hole

407
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,580
No no no

408
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,100
Chief Peony, I will go and look for her

409
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,820
I will go right away

410
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,320
I will go, too

411
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,640
What a crow

412
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,300
I was just about to look for you

413
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:14,920
and revenge for little naughty

414
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,240
But you came in yourself

415
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,920
Go go go

416
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,780
You old bungler

417
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,280
Just open your eyes

418
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,500
and look who I am

419
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,780
You

420
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,540
Sister

421
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,180
You need to find justice for me

422
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,100
Why were you hurt like this

423
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,100
Who did this

424
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,140
It was that damn bird

425
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,120
I cut his path in the third level of heaven

426
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,520
Didnâ€™t expect he has such strong power

427
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,440
and is good at fire attacking techniques

428
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,580
and burned me like this

429
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,220
The bird tribe values fire

430
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,920
Sui He, the present leader of bird tribe

431
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,360
is good at fire techniques

432
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,980
This bird

433
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,940
must be her trusted follower

434
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,120
When you encountered the crow,

435
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,240
did you see Jin Mi?

436
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,440
Could Jin Mi also be kidnapped

437
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,780
That would be awful

438
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,060
The crow is cruel in its nature

439
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
That girl

440
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,920
Iâ€™m afraid bad things will happen to her

441
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,230
It won't

442
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,750
It won't

443
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,870
It won't

444
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,100
Turns out to be Chief Peonyâ€™s arrival

445
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,310
It is nice to meet you

446
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,010
Princess Sui He

447
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,840
Chief Peony would never

448
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,160
come for nothing

449
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,860
I wonder what

450
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,820
brought you here today

451
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,160
Even Chief Peony

452
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,280
Got into a fight

453
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:32,840
A few days ago

454
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,120
A flying bird broke into my Floral Realm

455
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,320
Plundered an elf

456
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,960
Hurt a master

457
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,680
whose whereabouts is still unknown

458
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,240
We hereby come to Princess Sui He

459
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,760
to ask for an explanation

460
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,320
Such thing actually happened

461
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,960
My Floral elf has witnessed it

462
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,590
Everyone witnessed it

463
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,980
Not fabricated at all

464
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,620
Although our Realm has always been in harmony with the rest of the world

465
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,600
No bullying from foreigners is allowed

466
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,320
If it is really the scum of our bird tribe

467
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,420
Stirring up trouble on purpose

468
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,220
No need for Chief Peony to step in

469
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,040
I will place punishment on my own

470
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,880
Que Ling

471
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,180
Yes

472
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,820
From whatâ€™s flying in the sky

473
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,020
to whatâ€™s not yet born

474
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,060
Interrogate them one by one

475
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,050
She has no proof

476
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,040
Who knows if she is provoking on purpose

477
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,040
I canâ€™t stand anything like this

478
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,600
Chief Peony

479
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,360
Please calm down

480
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,000
After I arrest the murderer

481
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,680
You can do anything with him

482
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,640
Reporting to the princess

483
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,180
Nirvana, the Fire Immortal has gone missing

484
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,180
The Devil domain has sent a hundred thousand soldiers in the riverside of Wangchuan River

485
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,300
intending to attack the Heaven Realm

486
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,540
What

487
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,180
Follow me

488
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,940
Wait

489
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,800
Everything has its order

490
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,640
Today

491
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,980
Princess should give me an explanation

492
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,540
Everything has an order of priority

493
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,180
Sui He has important things to do

494
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,320
Today

495
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,320
I am afraid that I will let you down

496
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
If I cannot win her

497
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,700
How can I have the prestige to lead the bird tribe

498
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:35,890
Nice one

499
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,540
During emergency, we need to be flexible

500
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,570
We will surely catch the murderer in the future

501
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,750
and file lawsuit in Floral Palace

502
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,500
What happened, Chief Peony

503
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,020
What's wrong

504
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,380
I have been hurt by Sui Yushan

505
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,440
I need to rest

506
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,010
Pass my order

507
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,850
From today on

508
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,180
The bird tribe is forbidden to eat

509
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,060
If the bird tribe doesn't hand over

510
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,980
our elf

511
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,460
We will never provide them food.

512
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,780
Yes

513
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,460
If you donâ€™t hand in Jin Mi and the bird

514
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,620
We will not let go

515
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,100
Whatâ€™s the smell

516
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,380
Evil breath

517
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,100
Has the climate in the Heaven Realm

518
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
become so bad now

519
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,500
I am about to suffocate

520
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,540
The below domain is Wangchuan River

521
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
Itâ€™s weird

522
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,320
Why is the evil breath

523
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,320
so heavy today

524
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,160
Thatâ€™s pretty big scale

525
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,440
Wild evil

526
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,600
Today

527
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,000
I will show you around to the world

528
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,340
Great, great

529
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,260
King of Bian City

530
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,500
I asked you to recruit soldiers

531
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,160
You keep slacking

532
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,720
See

533
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
You recruited such a small group of soldiers

534
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,100
Lord of the Devil, please allow me to report

535
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,100
I believe there are three setbacks to this battle

536
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,970
We recruited soldiers in a hurry, unprepared

537
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,470
I tried my best

538
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,780
to recruit only three thousand soldiers

539
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,080
the Heaven Realm has always trained the best soldiers

540
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,720
and they are not at the level we can achieve

541
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,850
This is one setback

542
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,820
The truce agreement between heaven and demon is still effective

543
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,100
If we openly tear up the agreement

544
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,140
We lose our integrity and support

545
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,600
This is the second setback

546
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,740
Fighting upfront alone on our own

547
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,520
This is not a feasible strategy

548
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,000
This is the third setback

549
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,180
Please think twice

550
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,140
I have been hearing a rumor

551
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,550
saying that King of Bian City and the Fire Immortal

552
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,680
are very close

553
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,740
I have always been reluctant to believe

554
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,780
But now we have this opportunity in front of us

555
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,360
While King of Bian city is here

556
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,680
Spreading fallacies to deceive people and delay the battle

557
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,480
It seems that this rumor

558
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,880
is going to be proved true

559
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
You

560
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,290
Demon Lord

561
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,560
Colluding with the enemy

562
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,560
What should we do about that

563
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,460
This crime should be sentenced to death

564
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,120
Dismember the body

565
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,140
and dump in the Wangchuan River

566
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,960
Take him down

567
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,820
Stop

568
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,880
Please allow me to report

569
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
My father never go against your order

570
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,480
He has recruited a number of soldiers as ordered

571
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,680
Where are the remaining soldiers

572
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,720
They are here

573
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,620
Do you remember

574
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,800
Our battle at Tushan Mountain thousands of years ago

575
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,400
Liu Ying has blocked eight thousand enemies alone

576
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,400
Lord of the Devil had given precious words

577
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,900
to compliment me

578
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,440
for fighting thousands of troops alone

579
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,920
Liu Ying has hereby come to request to be sent to the front

580
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,420
Liu Ying

581
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,040
This is not an usual war

582
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,860
You

583
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,870
The King of Bian City is weak and sly

584
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,410
But you have a wonderful daughter

585
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,160
Listen to the order, Liu Ying

586
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,340
I appoint you as the pioneer

587
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,490
Serve the wine

588
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,720
Wait until we drink it off

589
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,160
and lead the troop across the Wangchuan River

590
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,630
and wipe out the Empyrean Cloud Palace

591
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,530
and catch the Heavenly Emperor

592
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,940
I will award you a first class merit

593
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,530
Grant the wine

594
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,100
The Fire Immortal has come, it's the Fire Immortal.

595
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,680
Protect Demon Lord

596
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,280
King of Yan City is really arrogant

597
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,600
and ambitious

598
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,520
But occupying the Heaven Realm

599
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,960
You donâ€™t get a say in this

600
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,540
and King of Gu City doesnâ€™t either

601
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,500
Fire Immortal

602
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,300
I am reviewing troops here today

603
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,000
Do you want to step in

604
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,760
and restart the war

605
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,980
Quit finding excuses for yourself

606
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,180
I was just up in the heaven

607
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,840
and saw this evil

608
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,300
Leading the soldiers to cross over the Wangchuan River

609
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,580
King of Yan City

610
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,940
Since the battle between heaven and demon

611
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,680
Wangchuan River has become the boundary

612
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,080
across which no one offends the other

613
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,040
This rule has been followed for tens of thousands of year

614
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,020
Just as the King of Yan City review the troops

615
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,300
Did you forget about this rule

616
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,240
If you really want to occupy the Heaven Realm

617
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,760
Please ask my Phoenix Feather Arrow first

618
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,400
I should say

619
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,780
There must be some misunderstanding

620
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,700
Disordered people

621
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,130
King of Yan City

622
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,520
With incapable soldiers

623
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,240
and only an ambitious heart

624
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,500
Be careful

625
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,380
I have long heard that the Fire Immortal is very brave

626
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,860
and has been the top of the six domains

627
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,080
There is no time like now

628
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,040
Liu Ying is brave enough

629
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,040
To request a battle with the Fire Immortal

630
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,880
It turns out to be Princess of Bian City

631
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,220
I have heard a lot about you

632
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,340
Itâ€™s just

633
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,280
I never fight with women

634
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,580
There is no gender difference in the battlefield

635
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,560
Alright

636
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,200
Then I will make some concessions

637
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,380
Thatâ€™s not necessary

638
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,260
We people in the Demon Realm

639
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,180
Not as weak

640
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,460
as you celestials in the Heaven

641
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,659
It has been a while

642
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,560
And still donâ€™t see attacks from soldiers of the heaven

643
00:33:52,469 --> 00:33:53,699
Maybe it is only him

644
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,810
Itâ€™s better to design a trap

645
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,880
to capture him alive

646
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,440
Please think twice

647
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,739
Today, the Fire Immortal suddenly appears

648
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,440
We can tell that the Heaven Realm has released fake messages

649
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,580
Intending to trick us

650
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,000
The Fire Immortal leads three armies

651
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,460
There must be backups

652
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,260
I have already lost my face

653
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,840
Do I even have to lose my army

654
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,420
So that everything can end

655
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,580
No offense

656
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,000
I get to meet the Fire Immortal today

657
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,560
You really deserves the reputation

658
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,920
I never dare challenging you

659
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,320
Who else wants to take on the challenge

660
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,680
100 thousand Devil soldiers

661
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,700
are not comparable with a girl

662
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,470
Good

663
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Very good

664
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
King of Yan City

665
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,650
There hasnâ€™t been a battle in a thousand years

666
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,180
I am burning to do this

667
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,440
But the rules are strict

668
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,740
You can practice my soldiers more in the future

669
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,860
Feel free to come and attack us

670
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,980
I have millions of soldiers in the Heaven Realm

671
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,480
We are all set to start the battle

672
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
Ready for it all the time

673
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,340
Fire Immortal

674
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,700
The battle between the two fields is not a game

675
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,100
I have always been

676
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,640
proposing for peace

677
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,820
About this

678
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,920
Please help me spread the words

679
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,660
Father

680
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,060
When he took my whip

681
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,300
He looked like Mu Ci

682
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,360
There will be one day

683
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,200
I can fight with him

684
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,500
simply and directly

685
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,770
How has Run Yu been preparing

686
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,480
Your Majesty

687
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
God of night has finished assigning soldiers outside the Southern Heavenly Gate

688
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,820
Come and report on the tasks immediately

689
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,820
Run Yu hasnâ€™t gone through a battle

690
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,340
This battle

691
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,000
Is just intended to make him settle in the army

692
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,600
and stabilize the army

693
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,080
As for the army lineup

694
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,040
We have to count on Liaoyuan

695
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,340
and the soldiers from other directions

696
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,160
I have followed the Fire Immortal for a long time

697
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
Marching and fighting battles

698
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,180
Although not comparable to the Fire Immortal in any way

699
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,520
I am confident to succeed in the assignment

700
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,220
I hope that you can trust me and relieve

701
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,220
If Xu Feng is here

702
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,980
Why would I be so worried

703
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,580
Heavenly Empress arrives

704
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,400
Your Majesty, please take a look at what this is

705
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,040
This is

706
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,780
This is found

707
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,360
in the nirvana of Xu Feng

708
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,080
There must be someone who wants to hurt him

709
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,080
But if you look at the whole Heaven Realm

710
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,260
Who would it be

711
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,260
to have such strong power

712
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,020
Call Run Yu

713
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,400
Run Yu pays respects to father and mother

714
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,500
Somebody

715
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,720
Come take him down

716
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,180
What did I do

717
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,660
Please clarify for me

718
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,740
Look what you did

719
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,680
a hundred thousand of soldiers

720
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,800
How dare you to hand them to a

721
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,940
disloyal, unfilial

722
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,860
unjust and sinful person

723
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,760
This ice does not belong to me

724
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,760
Do you really not know

725
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,120
This thing

726
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,520
is found in the nirvana of Xu Feng

727
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,180
He did not disappear with no reasons

728
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,460
but rather he was attacked by this

729
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,900
His nirvana was cut off

730
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,280
Such a strong water technique

731
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,900
In this large heaven

732
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,940
Who could it be if it is not you

733
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,640
Besides, a celestial saw you on that day

734
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,840
near the Qiwu Palace

735
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,040
You were on duty at the Northern Heavenly Gate that night

736
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,560
At that time

737
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,020
Something was wrong with Xu Fengâ€™s nirvana

738
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,820
You tell me

739
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,120
Whether this is true

740
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,420
Father

741
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
That night

742
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,440
I did go to Qiwu Palace

743
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,440
You Majesty

744
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,440
Welcome

745
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,080
Have you heard back from him

746
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,190
Your highness

747
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,540
You are finally back, your highness

748
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,940
What danger did you encounter

749
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,620
Were you hurt

750
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,200
No worries

751
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,580
I just wandered for a couple of days

752
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,480
I might have worried you all

753
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,520
Why are you here

754
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,500
I heard that the Devil domain has been intruding

755
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,320
Sui He has brought the bird tribe to assist

756
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,920
It is so great

757
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,200
that you can come back

758
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,560
You two may go

759
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,170
Yes

760
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,160
Sorry for bothering you

761
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,360
I am fine

762
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,780
It is aunt who worries about you

763
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,220
She could not sleep at night

764
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:17,720
Your Majesty

765
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,220
has sent out soldiers and troops

766
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,380
Looking for you everywhere

767
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,500
But have never hear back about you

768
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,700
Your highness

769
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,400
Where have you been these days

770
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,440
All wild places

771
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,860
It was also my first time there

772
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,620
But it was kind of fun

773
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,380
So I stayed there for a couple more days

774
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,980
Evil detected

775
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,640
Who are you

776
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,300
Why are you near your highness

777
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,260
I am, I

778
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,720
Never mind

779
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,520
Just an evil who wants to return a favor

780
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,540
Your highness, you have a kind heart

781
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,080
Even if you are in danger

782
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,980
You still care about others

783
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,860
No no you made a mistake

784
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,020
It is the magpie who owes me a favor

785
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,320
Not me

786
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,320
Fellow

787
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,720
Explain it to her

788
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,560
Fellow

789
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,410
Yourâ€¦Your highness

790
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,740
It is your highness

791
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,220
who was saved twice by me

792
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,900
So he should return the favor to me

793
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,140
Not I should return the favor to him

794
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,380
And one other thing

795
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,580
Make sure you donâ€™t misunderstand

796
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,800
I am not any evil

797
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,440
I am a

798
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,020
decent grape elf

799
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,820
Now that you saved your highness

800
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,680
Then to me

801
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,100
I owe you a favor

802
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,540
Wait until I report to the queen

803
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,700
You will surely be awarded

804
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
Now

805
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,620
Please accept this

806
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,680
Take it as my gratitude

807
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,260
This Rose Medicine

808
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,800
Is a rare treasure

809
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,900
You can have a hundred years of spiritual power if you eat this

810
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,020
Do you like it

811
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,440
Yes, yes

812
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,440
This is my favorite

813
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,020
Congratulations on your nirvana

814
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,980
We did not protect you well

815
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,200
Please place punishments

816
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,520
Nirvana

817
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,090
A phoenix?
