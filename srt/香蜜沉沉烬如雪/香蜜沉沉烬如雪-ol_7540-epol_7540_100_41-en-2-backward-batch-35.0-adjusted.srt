1
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 41"

3
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,400
Now Heavenly Empress is in jail,

4
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,560
while the effect of Autopsy
Wild Silkworms is getting stronger.

5
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,220
What should I do?

6
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,260
Am I doomed to die?

7
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,060
Thank you for saving me.

8
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,220
Follow me.

9
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,360
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow

10
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,040
is made with bones and blood

11
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,060
of the Spirit-Vanishing Family.

12
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,720
It has taken almost all my bones and blood

13
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,820
to make it all these years.

14
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,440
Although I’m barely supported
by the magic power of Heavenly Empress,

15
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,780
I’m already useless.

16
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,280
I’m afraid I can’t assist you

17
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,320
in doing a great cause.

18
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,220
Please allow me to live in seclusion

19
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,079
for the rest of my life.

20
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,420
Auntie and the Bird Family

21
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,800
just lose influence for the time being,

22
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,440
are you going to leave us

23
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,700
like other snobbish immortals?

24
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,320
I dare not do this.

25
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,480
If Her Majesty didn’t save me back then,

26
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,720
I wouldn’t be here now.

27
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,620
I’m really grateful

28
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,000
for her help.

29
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,820
I’ll repay her favor next life.

30
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,800
Are you going to find your old flame

31
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,380
Princess of Bian City?

32
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,280
Liu Ying and I...

33
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,840
No.

34
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,740
Princess of Bian City and I

35
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,380
have been strangers long before

36
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,120
and our love is gone.

37
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,840
Make

38
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,060
another Spirit-Vanishing Arrow for me

39
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,460
and I’ll eliminate Autopsy Wild Silkworms for you.

40
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,800
Thus you’ll be free

41
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,940
to find your Princess of Bian City

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,080
to continue your former love.

43
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,380
OK?

44
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,900
You don’t believe me?

45
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,740
I’ve transferred all my cultivation this life to you.

46
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,840
With the help of Glazed Pure Fire,

47
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,380
you must rejuvenate the Bird Family

48
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,080
and help Xu Feng to be the Heavenly Emperor.

49
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,380
I see.

50
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,880
Take good care of both Xu Feng and the Bird Family.

51
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,800
Don’t let me down.

52
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,260
Your Highness Night Immortal is really brilliant.

53
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,460
I’ll fail

54
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,520
no matter how hard I try.

55
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,180
Do you give up now?

56
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,520
Even if I try,

57
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,520
nothing will change in the end.

58
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,220
I fail.

59
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,260
It’s my honor to play chess

60
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,780
with a master like you.

61
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,720
What?

62
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,440
Nothing is left in the barn of the Bird Family?

63
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,400
Since the Floral Realm stopped
the supply for us last time,

64
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,080
we have been on bad terms with each other.

65
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,940
Although they still

66
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,860
supply flowers, grass and grain,

67
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,400
the amount is much smaller.

68
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,700
We can’t accumulate food all the time.

69
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,960
You should have reported it earlier.

70
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,420
Elder Yin Que asks for a visit.

71
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,280
Let him come in.

72
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,000
Yes.

73
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,740
You can leave.

74
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,880
Yes.

75
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,980
Here is my respect, Leader.

76
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,760
Have you heard of

77
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,680
the grain shortage of the Bird Family recently?

78
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,760
What do you mean?

79
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,980
As the leader of the Bird Family,

80
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,360
certainly I know it.

81
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,900
That’s fine.

82
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,500
I worry that you forget us

83
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,580
as you linger in the Heaven Realm.

84
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,180
Since you have known it,

85
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,280
why don’t you take action earlier?

86
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,800
Birds of the family are dying.

87
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,160
I’ll deal with it.

88
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,940
The deposed Heavenly Empress
appointed you as the leader

89
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,240
and helped you manage the
affairs of the Bird Family back then,

90
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,320
so we’re prosperous.

91
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,060
However, as she loses her influence now,

92
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
elders worry

93
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,179
whether you can assume the task

94
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,840
to protect us safe and sound.

95
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,920
I’ll solve the grain problem properly in three days.

96
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,620
I’ll prove

97
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,780
I deserve

98
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,460
the post of the leader.

99
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,920
Then

100
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,580
I’ll wait and see.

101
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,520
Wait.

102
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,700
Don’t you have other matters

103
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,040
to report?

104
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,880
What do you mean?

105
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,360
Surely, it’s about your meeting with Demon Lord

106
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,640
in Demon Realm.

107
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,480
Is it necessary to report a meeting of old friends?

108
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,000
If you have spare time,

109
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,940
you’d better solve the grain problem earlier.

110
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,920
Xu Feng is in charge of the Mansion
of the Five-Direction Heaven Troops

111
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,760
and controls the gates of the Heaven Realm,

112
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,480
which is heavy responsibility.

113
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,900
However, Xu Feng is ill-behaved and perverse.

114
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,600
I worry much about it.

115
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,940
I’ll temporarily

116
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,100
hand his position over to you.

117
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,300
Reported by Sui He of the Bird Family.

118
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,140
The Bird Family has been living on flowers and grain.

119
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,280
Though the Floral Realm has resumed supply,

120
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,300
there are fewer things left in our barns

121
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,980
due to years of food shortage.

122
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,340
Now the Bird Family is in danger,

123
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,420
so please offer us grain to relieve us

124
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,260
from the pressing situation.

125
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,560
We are begging for your approval.

126
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,120
Leader.

127
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,180
Is there news from the Heaven Realm?

128
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,880
No.

129
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,620
No.

130
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,460
I have to go to the Heaven Realm personally

131
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,760
to borrow grain with Heavenly Realm.

132
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,040
But Elder Yin Que and other elders

133
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,520
are waiting for you to have a meeting in the hall.

134
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,500
It’s inappropriate for you to leave now.

135
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,980
They can’t wait to see me

136
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,940
making a fool of myself.

137
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,960
That’s impossible.

138
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,980
Yin Que,

139
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,500
I’ll get even with you

140
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,980
for your meeting Demon Lord.

141
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,020
If she still can’t borrow grain from Heaven Realm...

142
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,220
The Leader is coming.

143
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,880
...we’ll be in deadly danger.

144
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,780
Yes.

145
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,180
It has been three days.

146
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,580
Have you got any idea

147
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,540
to solve the grain problem?

148
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,260
I’ve reported to the Heaven Realm,

149
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,580
but they slow to lend us grain.

150
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,580
I think you’re to blame, Elder Yin Que.

151
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,380
The Bird Family is hit by grain shortage

152
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,960
and the Heaven Realm refuses to lend food.

153
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,860
Does this have anything to do with Elder Yin Que?

154
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,240
He met with Demon Lord

155
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,220
in the Demon Realm several days ago.

156
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,460
His Majesty heard of that

157
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,420
and was very unsatisfied.

158
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,340
He thought we may rebel.

159
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,240
If I didn’t told him

160
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,100
we’re loyal to the Heaven Realm,

161
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,400
he would have sent troops to suppress us.

162
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,380
Well.

163
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,280
I don’t know my meeting with
Demon Lord in Demon Realm

164
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,600
even results in such a case.

165
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,880
If His Majesty really doesn’t
want to lend food because of this,

166
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,540
I would like to clarify it

167
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,680
to him with you,

168
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,860
so as to dispel his doubts

169
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,380
and make him lend us food earlier

170
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,960
to relieve us from the pressing situation.

171
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,000
That really makes sense.

172
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,640
Please go to the Heaven Realm

173
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,420
with Elder Yin Que

174
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,760
to handle the matter now.

175
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,280
Do you have any evidence to prove that

176
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,240
you haven’t colluded with the Demon Realm?

177
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,260
As they didn’t send troops,

178
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,020
it shows

179
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,780
they have no evidence of
my collusion with the Demon Realm.

180
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,360
You fail to borrow grain.

181
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,820
Are you going to blame it on me now?

182
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,880
In the last thousands of years,

183
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,740
I have been devoting myself to the Bird Family

184
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,580
to make it increasingly prosperous.

185
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,300
I try my best to save

186
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,960
the suffering Bird Family now.

187
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,880
Elder Yin Que’s improper behavior

188
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,880
led to grudges between the Heaven Realm and us.

189
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,080
I want to know

190
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,020
whether we can borrow grain from

191
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Demon Realm.

192
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,020
Leader,

193
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,020
Elder Yin Que,

194
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,320
it’s useless to quarrel here.

195
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,980
It urgent that you should go to

196
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,820
the Heaven Realm

197
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,300
to tell Heavenly Emperor our loyalty,

198
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,480
so as to borrow grain earlier.

199
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,200
Night Immortal is coming.

200
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,640
Here is my respect, Your Highness.

201
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,200
Your Highness.

202
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,400
I don’t think you just

203
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,840
come to play chess with me today.

204
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,400
I heard you met Demon Lord secretly recently.

205
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,620
I wonder what you talked.

206
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,500
You come for it.

207
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,100
I just talked about the past with him.

208
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,860
We discussed nothing.

209
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,860
No one knows what you talked about.

210
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,120
However, it has been reported to the Heaven Realm.

211
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,440
It’s inevitable that if there are

212
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,380
some fictitious guesses.

213
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,140
If His Majesty misunderstands you,

214
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,920
it’ll be bad for the Bird Family.

215
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,140
His Majesty asked me to investigate it thoroughly.

216
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,120
How do you think

217
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,360
should I answer give?

218
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,860
I’m sorry.

219
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,680
I don’t know what you mean.

220
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,560
I know

221
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,760
Heaven Realm has overly controlled the Bird Tribe

222
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,640
After the Arowana Family was eliminated back then,

223
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,220
the deposed Heavenly Empress
let the Bird Family take over

224
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,360
the rich Lake Taihu.

225
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,040
The Bird Family has been much
more thriving and prosperous

226
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,220
than before in the last several thousand years.

227
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,000
You should be satisfied.

228
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,040
Just speak out what is

229
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,780
in your mind.

230
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,920
I don’t like to beat around the bush.

231
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,640
In this case,

232
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,300
I’ll speak it out.

233
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,960
In fact, I come

234
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,020
to ask for your favor.

235
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,820
As a powerless elder of the Bird Family,

236
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,180
I don’t think I can help you.

237
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,060
If the Bird Family knows

238
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:49,599
its top-secret force deployment defense plan

239
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,280
was revealed by you,

240
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,640
will they allow you

241
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,560
to stay in the Bird Family later?

242
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,000
With His Majesty’s order, today I escorted grain here

243
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,700
to help the Bird Family

244
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,880
as a special envoy of the Heaven Realm.

245
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

246
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,900
The whole Bird Family thanks you very much.

247
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,040
I come here to solve

248
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,400
another matter today.

249
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,680
What is it?

250
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,180
I would like to help you.

251
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:30,340
Elder Yin Que secretly met Demon Lord

252
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,280
in Demon Realm not long ago,

253
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,840
which I think you should have known it.

254
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,340
He secretly met Demon Lord

255
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,780
with hidden evil.

256
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,660
If you want to punish him,

257
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,340
I’ll assist you fully.

258
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,460
However, the Bird Family is
always loyal to the Heaven Realm.

259
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,080
Please believe us.

260
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,700
It seems that you can’t wait

261
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,660
to punish him.

262
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,800
Princess Sui He once applied to the Heaven Realm

263
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,380
for the heaven troops to
set things right in Yimiao Continent.

264
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,540
However, His Majesty believed the Bird Family is loyal

265
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,980
and asked me to investigate it.

266
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,900
I come here

267
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,140
to tell you the result of the investigation.

268
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,100
Elder Yin Que went to the Demon Realm

269
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,340
just for personal reasons.

270
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,920
Don’t hurt the relation between

271
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,320
the Bird Family and the Heaven Realm for it.

272
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,120
His Majesty didn’t want to suppress us.

273
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,500
It was you, even asked for troops
to deal with Yin Que.

274
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,840
I made such a proposal

275
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,160
in a moment of desperation.

276
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,140
That’s true.

277
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,760
Luckily, no big mistake has been made.

278
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,640
However, you ignored the grain shortage

279
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,360
of the Bird Family

280
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,240
and dealt with Elder Yin Que instead.

281
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,080
You have got your priorities back to front.

282
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,560
I didn’t ignore the grain shortage of the Bird Family.

283
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,980
I wrote to the Heaven Realm

284
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,680
for borrowing grain three days ago.

285
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,820
The Heaven Realm hasn’t received your report.

286
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,000
That’s impossible.

287
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,160
If Elder Yin Que didn’t report it personally

288
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,580
to the Heaven Realm yesterday,

289
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,520
we may have no idea of it all the time.

290
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,500
Sui He,

291
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,600
you are unqualified for the leader of the Bird Family.

292
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,340
Yes.

293
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,460
You are unqualified for it.

294
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:16,900
Yes.

295
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,560
You are unqualified for it.

296
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,640
Princess Sui He,

297
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,680
just as what elders said,

298
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,020
you suppressed your enemy

299
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,640
and Elder Yin Que

300
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,480
while ignoring the lives of the Bird Family,

301
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,140
which has let His Majesty down.

302
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,780
His Majesty ordered me

303
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,020
to handle this matter with full authority.

304
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,640
However, I think

305
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,920
I should discuss it

306
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,900
with all elders of the Bird Family.

307
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,660
Your Highness, as you’re
deeply believed by His Majesty now,

308
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,120
we have no doubts.

309
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,300
What’s your opinion, Your Highness?

310
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,860
I think

311
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,880
now that Princess Sui He

312
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,380
doesn’t want to manage the Bird Family,

313
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,740
ask a virtuous and talented person to help her

314
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,160
deal with affairs of the family.

315
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,140
It’s just a suggestion.

316
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,220
The final decision

317
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,480
should be made by you.

318
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,820
Elder Yin Que did a great thing

319
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,880
by borrowing grain from
Heaven Realm for the Bird Family.

320
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,680
Moreover, he has always cherished the Bird Family.

321
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,840
I’m sure he’ll work to bring benefit to the Bird Family.

322
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,920
I recommend him

323
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,220
to deal with the family’s affair for the time being.

324
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,340
We also recommend him to deal with

325
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,500
the family’s affair.

326
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,260
Please take care, Your Highness.

327
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,140
Elder Yin Que,

328
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,800
the Bird Family will be managed by you afterwards.

329
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,640
I admit that I fail.

330
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,440
Since I’ve known your trick,

331
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,340
I won’t change my mind.

332
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,920
That’s fine.

333
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,520
Barns of the Bird Family will be empty for two days.

334
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,580
Sui He will ask the Heaven Realm for help,

335
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
while her report

336
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,720
will disappear.

337
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,200
I hope you can borrow grain personally by then.

338
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,220
With this chance,

339
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,420
I’ll help you to gain the real power of the Bird Family.

340
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,720
It seems that I can’t refuse.

341
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,260
As long as you support me with the Bird Family,

342
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,980
you’ll be leader

343
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,240
of the Bird Family some day,

344
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,480
so you can do anything

345
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,340
you want to.

346
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,560
Leader?

347
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,940
What your status will be in the future?

348
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,040
Your Highness Night Immortal is really brilliant.

349
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,440
I’ll fail

350
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,840
no matter how hard I try.

351
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,160
Yin Que,

352
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,020
you colluded with Run Yu

353
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,800
instead of Demon Lord.

354
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,380
Everything I’ve done is

355
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,660
for the future of the Bird Family

356
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,940
rather than the selfish desire like you.

357
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,300
Don’t worry.

358
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,100
I’ll help you deal with

359
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,900
the affairs of the Bird Family with full authority.

360
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,640
Go. Go. Go.

361
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,300
Finally, we’re here in time.

362
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:55,780
Yes.

363
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,440
Look.

364
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,420
Listen, it needs 7 years of magic power.

365
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,560
Mu Ci,

366
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,820
wherever you’re,

367
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,440
I’ll find you.

368
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,000
Run now.

369
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,720
Is Mu Ci making Spirit-Vanishing Arrow again?

370
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,540
Does he still want to hurt Jin Mi?

371
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,800
Your Highness.

372
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,220
Go to Heaven Realm

373
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,380
to kill Run Yu now.

374
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,960
Night Immortal is the son of Heavenly Emperor.

375
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,440
So what?

376
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,300
He has destroyed what I’ve worked hard for

377
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,740
in thousands of years,

378
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,000
I’ll kill him.

379
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,660
He has strong magic power.

380
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,600
However, most of my magic power has
been used to make the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

381
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,540
I can’t defeat him

382
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,120
even if I have Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

383
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,880
I’ll go with you by then.

384
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,480
If foster mother knew you miss her so much,

385
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,960
she would be very pleased.

386
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,500
Why are you here?

387
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,580
I heard that the power of the Bird Family

388
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,080
has been taken over by Elder Yin Que.

389
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,420
I think

390
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,960
it must have something to do with you.

391
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,780
It seems that you begin to take action.

392
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,460
I just want to

393
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,380
fulfill my mom’s wish.

394
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,880
However, she made many mistakes

395
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,840
for this wish.

396
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,620
What on earth do you want to say?

397
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,660
I just hope that

398
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,340
you don’t follow her footsteps.

399
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,640
I’m afraid you can’t stay true to the mission

400
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,760
after making too many mistakes.

401
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,100
I can’t make any mistake on this way.

402
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,860
With just one mistake,

403
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,120
I’ll lose the whole game.

404
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,000
I have nothing to lose.

405
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,280
But when choosing this way,

406
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,660
have you thought about Jin Mi?

407
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,500
She is innocent.

408
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,000
She shouldn’t be used

409
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,020
or hurt by you.

410
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,380
The Xuanji Palace.

411
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,080
It went the Xuanji Palace?

412
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,580
Yes.

413
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,740
Go to have a look with me.

414
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,220
Fish Fairy.

415
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,200
Fish Fairy.

416
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,940
Fish Fairy, are you here?

417
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,900
Well, thank you for saving me.

418
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,800
Today, I specially come for you,
but you’re not here.

419
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,320
I’ll just leave it here.

420
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,020
I didn’t expect Run Yu isn’t here,

421
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,920
while you come by yourself.

422
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,140
That’s great.

423
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,940
What a rare chance!

424
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,200
Kill her with Spirit-Vanishing Arrow now.

425
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,340
The stem of noble dendrobium is very nourishing.

426
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,200
It can help you restore
magic power as soon as possible.

427
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,140
I hope it can cure you wound

428
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,220
to help you.

429
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,120
Let’s be an ordinary couple

430
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,400
in the mortal world.

431
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,900
I told you if you hurt Jin Mi again,

432
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,100
you’ll be my enemy.

433
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,720
Don’t do things that are against your conscience.

434
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,540
I know you aren’t that kind of person.

435
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,420
Shoot her now.

436
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
Your Highness.

437
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,960
Jin Mi.

438
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,280
Jin Mi.

439
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,540
Take care of her.

440
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,200
Yes.

441
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,080
Your Highness.

442
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,100
Your Highness,

443
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,120
you still care about me.

444
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,800
Jin Mi was hurt by fire magic just now.

445
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,700
Why did you do that?

446
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,980
You know the reason.

447
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,120
You love her,

448
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,700
while she sent tonic to Night Immortal.

449
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,300
I was so furious.

450
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,800
Mi.

451
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,040
What happened?

452
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,700
Someone wanted to hurt Fairy Jin Mi.

453
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,320
Luckily, the Second Prince saved her in time.

454
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,440
Where is he?

455
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,660
He ran after that person.

456
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,900
Go to help him now.

457
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,580
I’ll protect her.

458
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,820
OK.

459
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,200
Mi.

460
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,660
Mi.

461
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:34,900
Mi.

462
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,020
Fish Fairy.

463
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,440
What happened just now?

464
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,320
I specially sent you tonic just now.

465
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,100
When I was going to leave,

466
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,380
I was somehow hit

467
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,800
to the ground.

468
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,980
Then I remember nothing.

469
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,380
Did you save me, Fish Fairy?

470
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,280
No,

471
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,920
it was Xu Feng.

472
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,120
It happened in the Xuanji Palace,

473
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,160
so did they want to kill me?

474
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,280
But when choosing this way,

475
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,180
have you ever thought about Jin Mi?

476
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,800
She is innocent.

477
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,440
She shouldn’t used

478
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,060
or hurt by you.

479
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,920
It’s my fault.

480
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,719
I promise,

481
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,639
you won’t be hurt again

482
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,639
afterwards.

483
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,500
Thank you, Fish Fairy.

484
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,060
I’m fine.

485
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:56,840
Your Highness,

486
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:58,540
I didn’t mean to hurt her.

487
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,960
It was Qi Yuan.

488
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,260
He is the one who wanted to
kill her in the mortal world.

489
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,760
I know.

490
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:06,120
He is a friend of Princess of Bian City.

491
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,699
I’ve promised Liu Ying

492
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,880
I won’t kill him.

493
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,380
But he is perverse.

494
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,960
He must want to kill her today.

495
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,120
We can’t spare him.

496
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,719
Liu Ying said

497
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,320
he is kind.

498
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,639
I believe her.

499
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,960
Thank you, Xu Feng.

500
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,720
Mu Ci.

501
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,180
Where is Jin Mi?

502
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,600
Is she all right?

503
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,680
She is fine.

504
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,640
But he didn’t come to kill her.

505
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,440
Xu Feng,

506
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,900
Autopsy Wild Silkworms planted in him

507
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,300
require regular feeding.

508
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,460
Someone uses Mu Ci with it.

509
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,120
He has been forced to do all things before.

510
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,540
He has no choice.

511
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,380
Autopsy Wild Silkworms?

512
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,260
Did my mother do it?

513
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,480
Auntie saved her.

514
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,500
He chose to do work for auntie.

515
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,100
Auntie is still in jail,

516
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,760
while you want to disassociate from her.

517
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,720
How ungratefulness!

518
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,220
Sui He.

519
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,920
Now that my mother has been punished

520
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,620
and in jail,

521
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,220
I hope you can forgive her.

522
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,720
As you forgive Mu Ci,

523
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,180
I’ll ask for nothing else

524
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,220
but to take him back

525
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,100
and stay with him forever.

526
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,060
I’ll make atonement

527
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,840
for him.

528
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,580
From now on, no matter what the reason is,

529
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,200
if you hurt Jin Mi again,

530
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,880
I won’t let you go.

531
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,640
I’ll keep my promise in the mortal world that

532
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,720
I’ll save you when you’re in danger,

533
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,180
but don’t ever try to

534
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,000
touch my bottom line.

535
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,060
I want to meet Jin Mi.

536
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,920
She is sleeping.

537
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,100
She is all right.

538
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,000
I heard you saved her today.

539
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,600
Thank you.

540
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,100
Did you catch the murderer?

541
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,400
Sui He lost her temper and hurt Jin Mi.

542
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,840
Sui He?

543
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,100
This is not trivial.

544
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,520
Report to Father earlier.

545
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,760
No need.

546
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,800
Sui He...

547
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,840
It’s because of me.

548
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,560
I’ll deal with her.

549
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,860
Let me see her.

550
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,500
Xu Feng,

551
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,440
because of you,

552
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,500
Heavenly Empress and Sui He
hurt Jin Mi in succession.

553
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,720
Do you want to

554
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,840
kill her?

555
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,040
I have sent Kuang Lu to ask
Water Immortal to pick her up.

556
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,660
Please go back.

557
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:31,980
Xu Feng,

558
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,940
I have paid so much for you

559
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,940
and even my power was taken away now.

560
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,740
I’ve lost everything,

561
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,580
while you still just love Jin Mi.

562
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,000
Why?

563
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,660
Why?

564
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,620
Xu Feng.

565
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,240
Jin Mi.

566
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,160
I hope to meet you

567
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,540
at the midnight in the hall

568
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,260
to talk something about Jin Mi.

569
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,120
When will you let me go?

570
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,300
Never.

571
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,520
You’re the princess of the Demon Realm.

572
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,060
Why do you waste time on me?

573
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,040
You deserve it.

574
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,880
I,

575
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,220
I didn’t hurt your friend,

576
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:57,980
so

577
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,840
I won’t let you look down upon me.

578
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,700
Finally, you’re the Mu Ci I know.

579
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,680
Where have you been these days?

580
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,760
Why did you make another Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

581
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,900
Originally, I wanted to kill Jin Mi

582
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,360
to deal with Autopsy Wild Silkworms
by Heavenly Empress.

583
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,440
However, at the last moment,

584
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,520
suddenly I felt that

585
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,080
I would rather die

586
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,500
than let you down.

587
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,540
I...

588
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,640
Don’t worry.

589
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,520
I’ll try to save you.
