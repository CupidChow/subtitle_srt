None
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

None
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 21"

None
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,660
Make a sound.

None
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,140
I, I' m here.

None
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:02,870
You violated the rules.

None
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,550
No, I didn’t.

None
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,760
You must have moved your body.

None
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,190
You have stepped back at least one foot.

None
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,290
And the ball of red threads has also fallen down.

None
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,940
My head is not square.

None
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,220
How can this round object stand still on my head?

None
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,860
Then measure the gap.

None
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,310
Before I threw the dart,

None
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,730
We were at least one Zhang apart,

None
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,760
namely, ten feet apart.

None
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,680
Your thread is too short, which is not accurate.

None
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,060
This one is one feet long.

None
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,630
Old fox,

None
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,230
you must have cheated in the read tread.

None
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,030
Devil Ji.

None
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,530
Didn’t you cheat?

None
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,840
You never score a hit with darts.

None
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,240
You know clearly about this.

None
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,180
If I hadn’t stepped

None
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,090
a little just now,

None
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,460
there would have been a
bleeding hole in my throat now .

None
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,140
So you admit that you violated the rule.

None
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,360
I am not

None
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,000
the human beings in your Cause and Effect Plate,

None
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,530
who are at your control.

None
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,630
If you don’t wanna be at my control,
then don’t play with me.

None
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,550
What a nuisance!

None
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,550
Yeah, it’s boring.

None
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,370
Neither Xu Feng nor Jin Mi is here.

None
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,420
I feel so bored,

None
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,010
so lonely and so empty.

None
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,360
Even match-making can’t lift my spirit.

None
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,380
Human beings have always been at my control.

None
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,720
Since these two guys are gone to
experience hardships in the Human Realm,

None
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,950
I, a dignified Xuanqing Jiuzhen Destiny Fairy,

None
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,700
have been reduced to being at others’ control.

None
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,260
How boring!

None
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,040
Is Moon Immortal here?

None
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,500
Little Jin Mi, you are back finally.

None
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,980
Was everything OK in your hardship experience?.

None
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,840
Where’s Xu Feng?

None
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,340
Didn't he come back with you?

None
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,780
Did you lose your mind?
Or are you blind?

None
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,480
She is Immortal Tai Si’s daughter,

None
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,079
Fairy Kuang Lu.

None
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,740
There’s nothing wrong with my eyes.

None
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,959
It’s just that little Kuang Lu

None
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:47,920
looks so much alive with little Jin Mi.

None
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,440
You are really dim-sighted from old age.

None
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,980
I remember that in my eldest nephew’s Xuanji Palace,

None
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,920
there is also a girl named Kuang Lu.

None
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,920
You are retentive, Moon Immortal.

None
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,580
I’m the Kuang Lu from Xuanji Palace.

None
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,040
I’m also from Mansion of Tai Si.

None
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,820
Come here,

None
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,580
little Kuang Lu.

None
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,220
What can I help you?

None
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,220
Are you here to inquire about
marriage or to ask for a red thread?

None
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,860
Today's my father's birthday.

None
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,159
Under my father’s order,

None
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,700
I’m here to invite you two

None
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,940
to drink wine and listen to dramas
at the Mansion of Tai Si.

None
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,140
It’s so hasty.

None
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,860
We haven’t prepared any birthday gifts.

None
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,659
Actually, it is a just a modest birthday.

None
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,200
My father doesn’t want to go in for it in a big way.

None
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,340
He just wants to invite some close friends spend som time together

None
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,560
and have fun.

None
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,500
To receive gifts is against my father’s intention.

None
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,940
Immortal Tai Si is so thoughtful.

None
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,400
We feel so bored now.

None
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,560
It’s really a lucky coincident.

None
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,660
Then we’ll go there, if you insist.

None
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,200
Let's go.

None
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,860
Wait.

None
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,240
Old fox, what tricks are you playing now?

None
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,820
What a sin Run Yu is commited!

None
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,060
You are such a beautiful and bright girl

None
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,760
with such tender skin.

None
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,060
But in order to match with

None
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,460
his cold and pale style,

None
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,340
you have to be dressed in such a plain color.

None
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,220
It’s so infuriating.

None
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,380
It has nothing to do with His Highness.

None
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,040
It’s out of my own will.

None
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,680
Alright. Stop.

None
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,580
People who understand this

None
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,320
know that you just came back from Xuanji Palace.

None
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
People who don’t understand this

None
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,360
must think that you are hastening home for the funeral.

None
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,360
Immortal Tai Si will feel very unhappy

None
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,420
if he sees his only daughter is dressed like this

None
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,220
on his birthday.

None
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,920
Pooh!

None
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,360
A cracked bell can never sound well.

None
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,200
Quiet but elegant colors are fashionable in Heavenly Realm.

None
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,480
Who is like you,

None
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,000
always dressed in a showy way?

None
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,080
Tawdry.

None
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,500
You are dressed elegantly,

None
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,900
looking like a patch a fog if seen from afar
and a patch of smoke if seen from near.

None
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,140
You look like neither a male nor a female.

None
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,980
In these thousands of years,

None
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,960
you have never been concerned with
love an romance, which is OK for me.

None
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,300
What’s worse, you have always visited me here.

None
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,480
My fame

None
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,580
is going to be ruined by you.

None
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,200
Devil fox.

None
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,360
Do you want me to throw you

None
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,560
into the Cause and Effect Plate

None
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,560
and make you experience the pain
of being apart from your loved one?

None
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,860
Mister Immortal is right.

None
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,640
After all, it’s my father’s birthday.

None
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,420
I’d better get dressed in bright colors.

None
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,080
Then you two go there first,
Mister Immortal and Miss Immortal..

None
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,960
I’m going to get changed.

None
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,980
Wait.

None
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,900
I have a ready-made dress here.

None
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,600
Breathtaking!

None
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,340
Come here.

None
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,280
Your eyes are so bright and
your smile is so charming.

None
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,620
After all, you are young.

None
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,400
You are charming with either light
or heavy make-up.

None
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,400
Do you like it?

None
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,740
Yes, I like it.

None
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,200
Thank you so much,
Mister Immortal and Miss Immortal.

None
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:08,900
Alike.

None
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,700
So alike.

None
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,980
Aren’t you really Jin Mi’s long lost sister?

None
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,840
I wonder what kind of girls

None
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,840
Night Immortal likes.

None
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,340
I just remember that Fish Fairy said he liked me.

None
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,340
Do I really look like her?

None
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,560
Whoever is dressed in red
looks good and looks all the same

None
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,920
in his eyes.

None
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,080
Stupid.

None
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,140
Leave him alone.

None
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,500
How come?

None
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,200
Fairy Jin Mi is the most beautiful
girl in the six realms.

None
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,260
She is both beautiful and kindhearted.

None
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,840
I envy her so much.

None
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,060
I’m really flattered

None
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,060
that you compare me with Fairy Jin Mi.

None
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,940
You look very pleasing to my eyes.

None
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,780
Here’s a red thread for you.

None
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,420
Although I’m not in charge of fairies’ marriages,

None
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,159
it can bring you good luck.

None
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,620
Thank you, Mister Immortal.

None
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,900
Can you give me one more thread?

None
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,520
What happened?

None
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,020
Am I OK now?

None
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,240
I’m fine.

None
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,820
I just had a slight tumble.

None
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,240
I am coarse-skinned, having got used to it.

None
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,740
I’m OK.

None
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,080
I didn’t expect that

None
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,760
we have got some connection during these days.

None
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,200
You came along the instant I had a tumble.

None
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,200
It seems that you slept well last night.

None
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,520
I added some medicine that can relieve
uneasiness of your mind and improve your sleep.

None
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,760
I saw that you were deep asleep.

None
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,540
Unlike the usual case, you didn’t

None
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,500
or kick around this time.

None
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,560
You finally had a good sleep.

None
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,640
you must have had a hard time

None
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,860
living a life in danger everyday.

None
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,940
Stop it.

None
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,160
Stop it.

None
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,280
Go inside.

None
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,720
I can do it myself.

None
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,260
Go inside and take rest.

None
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,000
Go.

None
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,750
How are you?

None
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,520
How are you feeling today?

None
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
I have been missing for many days.

None
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,760
At the moment, there must be a chaos outside.

None
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,000
If she knows that I can speak,

None
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,160
she will ask me many questions.

None
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,160
The present situation is very complicated.

None
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,780
I don’t know much about her.

None
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,140
And it’s not good to get her involved.

None
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,540
So the less she know about me,
the safer she will be.

None
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,440
Just like yesterday.

None
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,820
Did you hear anything?

None
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,980
I have been studying medicine for 15 years.

None
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,580
I’m very good at using the right antidote .

None
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,340
Normally, he can recover within three days

None
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,180
with this prescription.

None
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,290
It’s been ten days.

None
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,840
How come there’s still is no sign of his recovery?

None
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,560
Did I make a diagnostic error?

None
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,760
It’s a pity that I’m not able to
do justice to your kindness.

None
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,180
Don't worry.

None
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,860
It’s a coincidence to save your life in the mountain,

None
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,140
Doctors treat their patients equally.

None
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,400
As long as you are willing to do good deeds,

None
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,040
I will help you recover soon.

None
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,700
Gods and Buddhas,

None
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,600
Crow goes astray.

None
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,260
If he can recover,

None
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,860
Your believer, I will persuade
him to stop doing misdeeds

None
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
and to straighten up.

None
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,280
Why are you looking at me?

None
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,620
Why do you wear veil all day long?

None
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,600
I look so beautiful.

None
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,440
If I put off the veil to show you my face,

None
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,100
and if you grow some evil thoughts
after seeing my face,

None
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,420
I will bring about my own destruction.

None
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,020
You are making mountain out of a molehill.

None
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,380
I’m ugly and look disgusting.

None
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,280
Where are you from?

None
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,940
Have you lived here for a long time?

None
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,100
You go so far as to doubt my medical skills.

None
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,440
I won't tell you

None
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,600
that I am the Saint Girl of Saint Doctor Family.

None
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,620
Unfortunately, I know this now.

None
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,300
But it’s really a surprise that your the Saint Girl.

None
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,540
Is there no one else in Saint Doctor Family?

None
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,540
I come from where I should come from,
and I’m going to where I should go.

None
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,040
I’m here today, but I may be gone tomorrow.

None
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,840
May I have your name?

None
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,880
It’s very rude for you to ask my name.

None
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,120
You are really a bad-mannered bandit.

None
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,780
Alright. You can’t here anyway.

None
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,360
My name is Jin Mi.

None
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,780
looking for peace among the blooming flowers;

None
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,000
leading a life of floating clouds and water.

None
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,240
My name is awesome, right?

None
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,910
I have no name.

None
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,700
It’s just an experience of living
in the mortal world temporally.

None
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,360
When will it be sunny?

None
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,180
So that I can go to collect herbs for you.

None
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,500
Jin Mi.

None
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,180
Are you missing Mi, too?

None
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,260
Don’t worry.

None
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,040
She will be back soon.

None
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,580
Naughty boy.

None
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,600
Alright.
Go and play on your own.

None
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,660
Why are you dressed like this?

None
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,440
Today’s my father’s birthday.

None
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,920
I just came from Mansion of Tai Si.

None
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,340
I had asked you for leave, Your Highness.

None
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,220
Go back and take rest.

None
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,300
And

None
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,220
don't be dressed like this tomorrow.

None
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
It’s too loud.

None
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,240
Your Highness, do you think

None
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,900
this red dress

None
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,980
is not beautiful?

None
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,060
I don't like red.

None
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,600
This is the red...

None
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,120
red yeast rice wine made by my father.

None
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,860
He asked me to bring this to you.

None
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,200
I appreciate his kindness.

None
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,200
But I’m not a good drinker.

None
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,060
Keep it for yourself.

None
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,300
This wine

None
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,520
cannot compare with the
osmanthus wine made by Fairy Jin Mi,

None
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,800
but it has another connotation.

None
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,960
This wine is also named Heart of Jade.

None
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,400
Heart of Jade, loyal heart...

None
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,460
Since Immortal Tai Si shows his loyalty in this wine,

None
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,460
it would be disrespectful to refuse it.

None
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,920
These fancy carps are so beautiful.

None
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,200
They are just like

None
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,740
the dragons flying in the sky.

None
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:34,740
Fish is a fish.
Dragons are dragons.

None
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,640
How can they be alike?

None
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:38,380
They both have scales and tails.

None
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:41,599
And there is a saying about
fish leaping over the dragon gate.

None
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,380
Maybe dragons are derived from fancy carps.

None
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,520
Hearsay.

None
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,819
Did you ever see a real dragon?

None
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:49,819
Yes, I did.

None
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,920
I see him everyday.

None
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,760
I just haven't seen his real body.

None
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,460
But the dragon I know

None
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,460
is a real gentleman.

None
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,060
He keeps modest so as to
cultivate his moral character.

None
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,680
He helps others

None
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,040
and also learns from others.

None
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,040
He is like jade, warm and tender.

None
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,900
I think you are badly drunk.

None
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,640
So I’ll blame you for your bad manners.

None
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,980
Why are you laughing?

None
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,820
Your Highness, you get angry finally.

None
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,780
Go back and sober up.

None
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,940
I’m not drunk.

None
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,980
Your Highness, I have been with you for so long,

None
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,160
but I rarely saw you be happy or unhappy.

None
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,220
Only when Fairy Jin Mi was with you

None
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,580
would you show your cheerfulness.

None
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,140
When your were not happy,

None
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,540
you never let Fairy Jin Mi know.

None
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,120
You would stay alone

None
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,160
and swallow the bitterness.

None
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,520
Every time I saw you like this,

None
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,960
I felt very upset.

None
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,100
Now you are showing your anger in front of me.

None
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,180
You no longer keep your feeling to yourself.

None
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,180
It’s a good thing.

None
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,520
Your Highness, I hope you can often

None
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,360
release your true temperament,

None
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,200
and no longer keep your pains and worries

None
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,660
to yourself.

None
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,120
You can even criticize me

None
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,120
and lose temper in front of me.

None
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,780
I will be very happy if you can be like this.

None
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,000
You are spying on an immortal.

None
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,120
Do you know your sin?

None
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,760
Yes, I do.

None
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,300
You can punish me as you wish, Your Highness,

None
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,440
as long as you are happy.

None
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,240
I will let it pass this time.

None
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,280
But listen.

None
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,480
I haven’t been reduced to

None
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,700
being pitied by you.

None
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,900
Of course.

None
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,020
Your Highness, you are a dragon,

None
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,020
the son of the Heavenly Emperor,

None
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,780
the most noble

None
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,780
and the most powerful presence in the six realms.

None
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,080
So you don’t need pity from others.

None
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,180
It’s OK

None
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,260
even if you reach a deadlock

None
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,260
and can’t play an important role.

None
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,460
One day, the darkness will end

None
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,780
and you will succeed.

None
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,360
The Red String of the House of Marriage.

None
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,320
What do you mean?

None
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,320
I asked Moon Immortal for this.

None
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,260
It has no special meaning.

None
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,440
It’s just a sign a good luck.

None
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,020
May you get what you want

None
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,860
and get where your heart is.

None
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,160
May you get married with Fairy Jin Mi early.

None
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,540
Uncle.

None
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,520
Uncle.

None
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,020
Uncle.

None
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,580
Uncle..

None
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,020
Look. Centipede.

None
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,680
How do you feel?

None
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,240
Scared stiff?

None
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,540
Frightened, right?

None
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,500
It’s a centipede.

None
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,000
I’m going to use it to...

None
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,540
to make medicine for you some days later.

None
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,080
You swallowed it.

None
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,020
You ate it.

None
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,400
Are you a cock?

None
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,760
It’s OK.

None
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,140
It’s more effective compared with the dried ones.

None
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,240
Two years ago, when we were at war with Liangguo,

None
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
I was trapped in the Poison Valley for eight days.

None
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,720
With centipedes and scorpion as the only food source,

None
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,220
I won the natural barrier,Yunling Mountain.

None
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,420
Scare me? No way.

None
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,520
Today, I caught some funny little things

None
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,120
on the cliff.

None
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,800
Although it has a hard shell,

None
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,960
it’s body is very tender and soft.

None
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,580
It seems to taste good.

None
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,460
I’ll make it as the guiding medicine
and let you have it with the medicine.

None
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,920
I forgot that you can't hear.

None
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,580
This one.

None
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,940
Snail.

None
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,660
It’s a surprise that you are afraid of snails.

None
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,700
You are afraid of the poisonless one
instead of the poisonous one.

None
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,960
You are really funny.

None
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,560
Alright. Alright.

None
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,140
Then this one will the guiding medicine.

None
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,780
Long time passed, but you haven’t recovered yet.

None
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,540
Try this medicinal bath today.

None
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,160
OK.

None
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,640
You, a bandit

None
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,860
should be coarse-skinned and rude.

None
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,480
But why do you look so attractive?

None
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,600
What are the words that describe
a person like you in books?

None
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,700
Yeah, yeah.

None
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,040
Natural red lips,

None
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,780
natural black eyebrows,

None
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,040
soft and tender skin, and rosy cheeks.

None
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,480
These words can be used to describe you.

None
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,940
Definitely.

None
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,940
What’s more, you are also literate.

None
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,720
In your stockade,

None
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,720
maybe you are not the head,

None
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,460
but your rank can’t be lower than that

None
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,740
of an inept adviser

None
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,800
or a wife of the head.

None
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,060
I am really smart.

None
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,140
No, no.

None
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,420
Your need to bathe a bit more

None
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,720
so as to remove the residual toxic in your body.

None
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,920
Bathe a bit more.

None
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,920
Remove the residual toxic completely.

None
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,560
Sword, spear, two-edged sword and halberd

None
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,420
Axe, battle-axe, hook and fork.

None
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,320
Whip, hammer, rod and long spear.

None
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,460
Iron stick.

None
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,300
How many fights have you got involved in

None
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,180
to collect the scars caused by so many different weapons?

None
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,840
I dragged you out of the dead heap.

None
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,140
And it took a lot of effort to cure you.

None
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,620
Now your life is very precious.

None
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,920
You wasted so many herbs.

None
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,140
So you must cherish your life.

None
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,700
That day, I made a wish.

None
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,800
When you recover completely,

None
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,220
I must persuade you to be kind

None
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,120
and stop doing misdeeds.

None
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,920
OK.

None
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,460
You are so verbose.

None
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,440
When will you stop touching me?

None
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,120
This is winterworm summerherb.

None
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,360
It’s good for kidney and lung.

None
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,360
It can sustain and enhance
your body resistance to diseases.

None
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,720
You can’t hear.

None
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,560
They grow on the mountains.

None
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,940
In half of their life, they are worms.

None
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,400
And in another half of their life, they are herbs.

None
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,020
The winter worms die,

None
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,900
but when summer solstice comes,

None
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,320
they can turn into a good herb
for treating diseases and saving people.

None
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,220
They break through the soil.

None
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,680
Compared with flowers and butterflies,

None
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,600
they achieve the real rebirth

None
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,960
and “breaking the cocoon and becoming butterflies”.

None
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,700
Let's go.

None
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,240
Do you feel lonely during
the long stay in the mountain?

None
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,540
Time flies.

None
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,140
All things are floating clouds.

None
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,500
What is loneliness?

None
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,920
I have to recite a lot of medical knowledge everyday.

None
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,100
And I also have to try herbs and make medicine.

None
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,620
And I have to fool the elders and aunties in my family.

None
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,880
I don’t have time to feel lonely.

None
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,600
Only those literati and poets

None
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,220
like to make a fuss about an imaginary illness.

None
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,330
Does she know that I am
pretending to be deaf and dumb?

None
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,900
Crow, I find that only when I’m with you

None
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,720
can I feel so comfortable.

None
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,080
Probably it’s because you can't hear.

None
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,740
So I can talk freely.

None
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,800
And I don’t have to pretend to be serious,

None
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,560
maintaining the authority as the head of a family.

None
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,560
And I have to talk in a very serious way

None
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,880
and think much before uttering words.

None
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,120
Crow,

None
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,300
you are the best listener in the world.

None
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,720
So strange.

None
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,780
How come I have always palpitated in these days ?

None
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,740
"House of Marriage"

None
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,760
I haven't come to the wrong place.

None
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,720
Uncle.

None
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,020
I was forced to

None
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,700
drink several cups of wine just now.

None
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,920
I can’t walk steadily.

None
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,460
So I thought I came to your palace.

None
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,860
You like being alone.

None
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,860
Why are you here today?

None
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,600
You can’t stand the loneliness

None
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,680
and then come here to
ask me for Red Strings, right?

None
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,780
I’m here to return the Red String.

None
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,960
Kuang Lu is young knows little about the manners.
So she asked for the Red String.

None
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,560
It’s my fault.
I didn’t teach her well.

None
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,140
Uncle, please forgive me.

None
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,300
It’s just a Red String.

None
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,280
You can keep it for yourself.

None
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,280
You can give it to the one you fall in love with.

None
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,820
Uncle, you are kidding again.

None
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,160
In the Heavenly Realm,

None
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,640
who doesn’t know who I love?

None
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,980
My herbs.

None
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,980
I asked you to keep your eyes on them.
Why did you fall asleep.

None
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,260
Fortunately, the ash is cool.

None
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,900
After being stewed for one night,
now this aconite is hollow inside,

None
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,900
which means most of its toxic has been removed.

None
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,140
There is still a little toxic in them.

None
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,440
We still need to be steam them for seven hours

None
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,000
to remove the residual toxic in them.

None
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,320
I haven’t realized that being a doctor is not easy.

None
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,800
People say that we doctors

None
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,910
treat diseases and save people.

None
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,160
Actually, we compete for people.

None
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,440
We compete with the heaven,
the earth and all things in the world.

None
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,000
We compete with the King of Hell and time.

None
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,500
Everything in the world
contains the essence of medicine.

None
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,440
However, it is not easy to take
the essence from these things,

None
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,040
such as toxic things like aconites and centipedes.

None
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,120
We can do nothing but try our best.

None
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,060
Why am I telling you so much about this.

None
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
After all, you can't hear.

None
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,460
Crow, you can hear me.

None
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,760
Crow, can you hear me?

None
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,900
You can’t hear.
So why are you beating them.

None
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,280
Since you like beating so much,

None
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,880
you should be a musician.

None
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,880
It’s a pity for you to be a bandit.

None
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,740
You are really very concerned about me.

None
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,380
When the toxic in these aconites

None
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,460
is removed completely,

None
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,220
I will be able to make new medicine for you.

None
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:50,159
Three heavy sounds and
one light sound of the hooves.

None
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:51,699
And the horse don’t run fast.

None
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:52,600
Warm-blooded horses.

None
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,639
It is the Chilian Troop of Duke Nanping .

None
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,000
Search.

None
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
They seems to be soldiers.
Go.

None
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,400
Don’t care about these.

None
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,680
We’ll take a shortcut.

None
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,380
Be quick.
Search carefully.

None
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,560
Yes.

None
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,160
You guys go there.

None
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,760
What are you doing?

None
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,340
Have you searched that area?

None
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,080
Yes.

None
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,600
Nobody lives here.

None
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,020
Only hunters and the members
of the Saint Doctor Family

None
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,320
come here occasionally.

None
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,320
Search the nearby villages and towns.

None
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,640
Kill the ones

None
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,440
who pretend to be His Majesty.

None
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,400
Withdraw.

None
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,880
Yes.

None
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,920
Pretending to be me?

None
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,760
I’m afraid that you are
finding an excuse for killing me.
