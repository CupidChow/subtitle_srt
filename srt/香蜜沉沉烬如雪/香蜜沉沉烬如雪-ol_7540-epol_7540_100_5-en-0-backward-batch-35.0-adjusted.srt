1
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,220
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,260
"Episode 5"

3
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,280
Jin Mi.

4
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,640
Jin Mi.

5
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,200
A fairy sister from
Nine Luminaries Palace...

6
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,720
told me to hand you this letter.

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,160
It's for you.

8
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,320
What?

9
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
Why is he so happy
while reading love letter this time?

10
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,540
If I had known earlier,

11
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,790
I'd have kept it for Sui He.

12
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,790
See.

13
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,430
How about it?

14
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,840
Smooth.

15
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,440
Sincere.

16
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,800
And beautifully written.

17
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,140
The only thing is
it's too long.

18
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,040
It's better to leave out some parts.

19
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,300
Read it out.

20
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,830
Supreme Fairy Jin Mi,

21
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,880
The words are like me.

22
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,540
The letter is for me.

23
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,150
And she calls me Supreme Fairy.

24
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,720
The fairies nowadays...

25
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,800
have bad eyesight.

26
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,300
Someone's looking for Jin Mi.

27
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,980
You're even busier...

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,390
than me, the Fire Immortal.

29
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:02,160
Just go.

30
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,470
Here.

31
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,120
Hello, Supreme Fairy Jin Mi.

32
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,829
Hmm...

33
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,190
Hmm...

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,080
Do you agree?

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,240
Did you read...

36
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,630
the letter I wrote you?

37
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,420
The letter?

38
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,950
Yes, I did.

39
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,780
It was nicely done.

40
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,970
Genuine and sincere.

41
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:42,110
I'm deeply moved.

42
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,279
Really?

43
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,850
No one has ever...

44
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,640
written such a
touching letter to me.

45
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,360
Thank you.

46
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,490
Here. Thanks.

47
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,159
Thank you.

48
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,830
- Thank you.
- Everybody gets 1 each.

49
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,880
Get in line.

50
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,210
Thank you.

51
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,390
There are so many rice dumplings.

52
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,840
I'll eat them one by one.

53
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,170
I'll definitely...

54
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,200
get the Dumpling King...

55
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,760
with 500 years of magical prowess.

56
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,270
There's only 1 year
of magical prowess?

57
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:06,710
But...

58
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,330
it tastes good.

59
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,200
It is fragrant and sticky.

60
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,140
Even if there's no magical prowess,

61
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,470
they're worth eating.

62
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,840
One year.

63
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,440
Seriously?

64
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,840
Seriously?

65
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,710
Twenty rice dumplings.

66
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,960
All with only
1 year of magical prowess.

67
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,400
This is unfair.

68
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:02,230
Extremely unfair!

69
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Jin Mi.

70
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,960
How many have you eaten?

71
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,940
Everyone has gone home.

72
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,600
Why didn't you come and
help Liao Ting and I to clean up?

73
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,190
Twenty.

74
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,550
I already ate 20 rice dumplings.

75
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,700
But each of them
only contained 1 year of prowess.

76
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,980
I was angry and stuffed.

77
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,280
Then I fell asleep.

78
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,740
I wonder
which one of them...

79
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,050
ate the Dumpling King...

80
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,470
with 500 years magical prowess.

81
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,980
Indeed, I haven't heard...

82
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,400
who ate it.

83
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,710
This means...

84
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,640
the Dumpling King with
500 years prowess...

85
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,690
is not yet eaten?

86
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,510
So where are the
remaining rice dumplings?

87
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,010
This is the first time
the Heaven realm makes such a thing.

88
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,260
There won't be anymore left.

89
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,830
Just give up your hope.

90
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,030
By the way,

91
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,630
the prince wants you
at Xichen Palace,

92
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,790
to practise transformation trick.

93
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
You'd better go there.

94
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:01,350
Could it be that the immortal who...

95
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,590
got it did not eat it?

96
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,560
Speaking of this,

97
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,200
the prince did tell me to...

98
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,440
bring one to Xichen Palace for him.

99
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,330
I don't know if he's eaten it or not.

100
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,800
Greetings, Your Highness.

101
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,159
I heard that...

102
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
you're moving to
house of marriage lately?

103
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,420
Says who?

104
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,050
You must have heard wrong.

105
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,240
You personally teach me...

106
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,850
such a powerful magical prowess.

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,950
Why would I be so stupid...

108
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,480
and rely on others?

109
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
Your Highness,

110
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,460
I'll get the ink ready for you.

111
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,620
I'm reading today.

112
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,920
There's no need for ink.

113
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,680
Okay.

114
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,080
But it's late now,

115
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,690
I feel hungry.

116
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,880
Why don't you
heat up the rice dumpling...

117
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,670
using the spell I taught you...

118
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,470
so that I can eat it?

119
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,590
The mortals' dumplings...

120
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,360
taste really bad.

121
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,100
The wrapper...

122
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,480
smells funny.

123
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,630
And the rice inside...

124
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:09,190
are not the rice we normally use.

125
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,280
It's very soft.

126
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,710
Even if it's only a rice,

127
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,060
it has to be tough, right?

128
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,560
How can it be...

129
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,800
so soft?

130
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,490
And this is a big rice dumpling.

131
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,840
If you eat it at night,

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
you might choke.

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,270
If that's the case,

134
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,680
I'm more curious about
how it tastes.

135
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,960
Why did you say it tastes so bad.

136
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,550
Your Highness,

137
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,240
how about
I make you a flower cake?

138
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,360
It tastes a hundred times
better than the rice dumpling.

139
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,240
It'll melt in your mouth.
You won't choke.

140
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,700
Okay?

141
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,040
- Sure.
- Alright.

142
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,610
I'll make it right away.

143
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,680
Wait for me!

144
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,330
Just one moment!

145
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,350
Dumpling King.

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,040
Dumpling King.

147
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,220
Dumpling King.

148
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,090
Dumpling King with
500 years magical prowess...

149
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,810
is indeed extraordinary.

150
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,680
Flower cake.

151
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,790
This time,
I do have to thank the phoenix.

152
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,430
But,

153
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,680
he doesn't seem to like
flower cake very much.

154
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,740
Got it.

155
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,440
Your... Your Highness,
why are you here?

156
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,680
What are you doing?

157
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,560
Where's my flower cake?

158
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,170
But you don't like to eat flower cake.

159
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,680
Why do you want me to make it?

160
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,410
After a long thought,

161
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,030
I came up with a better gift...

162
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,980
which is 100 times
better than flower cake.

163
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,720
What's that?

164
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,520
The flower cake can satisfy my
hunger even if it tastes bad.

165
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,270
But what's the use
of a tree of flowers?

166
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,690
Leaves like phoenix's feathers.

167
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,090
Flowers like phoenix's crest.

168
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,320
Since you're a phoenix,

169
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,860
I'm giving you a red ebony...

170
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,120
as an appreciation gift.

171
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,340
It's also called Phoenix Flower.

172
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,450
Phoenix Flower?

173
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,510
It's said that Phoenix Flower...

174
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,800
blooms twice.

175
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,170
For the first time,
destiny arrives.

176
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,570
For the second time, destiny ends.

177
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,930
I've made the Phoenix Flowers here...

178
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,160
always bloom...

179
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,460
with my magical prowess.

180
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,690
Do you like...

181
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,910
the flower I give you?

182
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,000
Destiny comes and go.
It's doomed to end.

183
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,150
While flowers are doomed
to wilt and return to earth.

184
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,840
So there's nothing...

185
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,990
to comment about.

186
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,340
Moon Immortal was right.

187
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,340
Fire Immortal is perfect,

188
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,080
except that he's unromantic.

189
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,350
You are not interested in...

190
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,460
these beautiful flowers...

191
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,950
nor those...

192
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,290
pretty fairies.

193
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,860
So of all the things in the world,

194
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,280
what exactly do you like?

195
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,250
You decided this on your own.

196
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,180
I haven't questioned you,
but you're questioning me already.

197
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,490
I got it.

198
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,120
The thing you like most is...

199
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,510
punishing others.

200
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,690
You...

201
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,850
Phoenix Flower?

202
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,490
Your Highness,
someone asks to see you.

203
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,720
Who?

204
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,870
A group of people.

205
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,190
Your Highness.

206
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,310
I'm Ji Du from
Nine Luminaries Palace.

207
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,670
Greetings, Your Highness.

208
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,370
What's the matter?

209
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,640
I'm a rough fellow.

210
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,900
I came here today...

211
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,670
to ask for a marriage
with Fire Immortal.

212
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,280
Don't talk nonsense, Ji Du.

213
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,000
Your Highness,
princess, please don't be angry.

214
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,720
That's not what he meant.

215
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,680
He's here on behalf of Yue Bei...

216
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,480
to ask for a marriage
with Fire Immortal.

217
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,680
No, that's not the case.

218
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,190
He's here on behalf of Yue Bei...

219
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,210
to ask for the marriage with
Jin Mi who's in the prince's palace.

220
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,940
That's right.

221
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,600
A marriage with Jin Mi.

222
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,120
I didn't think that...

223
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,780
Jin Mi is good with girls.

224
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,180
Tell me.
What's the matter?

225
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,110
Judging from your appearance,
you're Jin Mi, right?

226
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,150
I heard that Yue Bei was...

227
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,320
disrespectful to you yesterday
outside Qi Wu Palace.

228
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,880
We from the Nine Luminaries Palace
dare to admit our mistakes.

229
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,230
These are the wedding gifts.

230
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,800
I think tthere's no need to
choose for an auspicious day.

231
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,310
Come with me...

232
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,840
to marry Yue Bei today.

233
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,360
Treated disrespectfully?

234
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,620
It was just...

235
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,070
a kiss on my cheek.

236
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,160
It's okay.

237
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,280
Doesn't matter.

238
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,020
I'm afraid I have to refuse it.

239
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,450
Jin Mi...

240
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,530
can't marry Yue Bei.

241
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,070
Why so?

242
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,660
Do you dislike Yue Bei?

243
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,180
Why don't you ask...

244
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,790
Jin Mi's opinion first, Your Highness?

245
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
Jin Mi,

246
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,290
do you like Yue Bei?

247
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,970
If both of you like each other,

248
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,050
just let us know.

249
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,040
Ji Du and I
will help you.

250
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,000
Do you...

251
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,430
Do you like her...

252
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
or not?

253
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,640
We're friends.

254
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,280
Of course I like her.

255
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,310
- But...
- Your Highness,

256
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,660
since Jin Mi said so,

257
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,290
we can set the marriage now.

258
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,430
Why would we separate the lovebirds?

259
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,190
Relax, Ji Du.

260
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,720
I didn't mean to stop you.

261
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,990
In fact, it's Jin Mi...

262
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,240
who is not capable of doing so.

263
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,680
As the saying goes...

264
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,070
a natural couple...

265
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,020
is formed by a man and a woman.

266
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,520
Jin Mi is also a girl,

267
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,800
of course she can't marry Yue Bei.

268
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,120
How is that possible?

269
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,850
She was supressed by the
Prowess Supress Hairpin.

270
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,740
So it's normal for you and Yue Bei...

271
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,360
to mistake her for a man.

272
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,220
How did he know
this is a Prowess Supress Hairpin?

273
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,450
Not even I know that.

274
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,280
Jin Mi is my attendant.

275
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,200
Things are easier...

276
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,750
if she dresses as a man.

277
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,530
It is also my fault...

278
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,210
that the misunderstanding occurred.

279
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,470
Please don't be angry at me.

280
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Jin Mi,

281
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,440
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,420
Your Highness,
sorry for disturbing you.

283
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,240
Let's go.

284
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Come on.

285
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,560
Hurry up.

286
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,820
Come here.

287
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,160
See what I've got for you.

288
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,460
What are these?

289
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,330
Xu Feng is so lucky.

290
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,550
He got a...

291
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,500
pretty girl
with just a random pick.

292
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,180
It was I who picked him.

293
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,720
That doesn't matter.
It's almost the same.

294
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,880
Anyway, both of you are one.

295
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,520
You're a grape elf,

296
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,910
so I purposely...

297
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,680
prepared this for you.

298
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,930
How? Do you like it?

299
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,050
- Get changed and let me see.
- No, I don't like it.

300
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,160
Not nice at all.

301
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,160
Are you questioning
my sense of beauty?

302
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,710
Not nice?

303
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,090
Impossible.

304
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,860
I mean, no way...

305
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,130
it's not nice.

306
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,190
The Moon Immortal's sense of beauty...

307
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,960
is of course good.

308
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
It's good.

309
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,600
A little girl
should look like a little girl.

310
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,280
If you don't like the purple one,

311
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,720
here, change into the red one.

312
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,880
Nice?

313
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,010
Yeah.

314
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,040
Nice.

315
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,810
It's her.

316
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:50,119
She... she's back.

317
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,160
I've always been here.

318
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,730
You look familiar,

319
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,040
but I can't remember...

320
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,320
Forget it.

321
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,540
As expected from Xu Feng's partner.

322
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,000
Red does suit you.

323
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,160
It just matches perfectly.

324
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,930
When Xu Feng sees this,

325
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,280
he'll be happy for sure.

326
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,840
If he's happy,

327
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,780
he'll be more kind to you.

328
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,460
People spare no effort to learn.

329
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,080
You fit perfectly...

330
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,700
to this saying.

331
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,640
They say you're very talented,

332
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,240
but who knows...

333
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,280
the effort you put in.

334
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,730
The annotations in the book...

335
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,420
are more detailed than the text.

336
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,840
I'm really impressed.

337
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,670
These aren't for me.

338
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,360
I wrote the annotations...

339
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,310
for that lazy Jin Mi.

340
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,590
If only she was thoughtful
and studious as you.

341
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,430
Then I don't have to worry so much.

342
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,060
Your Highness. Princess.

343
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,730
Why are you here?

344
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,520
There is a lot to do in Qi Wu Palace.

345
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,030
Instead of helping
Liao Ting and Fei Xu with the jobs,

346
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,970
you are attracting attention
in these clothes.

347
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,310
How can you do this?

348
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,880
Attract attention?

349
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,600
So, we share the same thought.

350
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,030
I think this is
attracting attention too.

351
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,510
It's really like attracting attention.

352
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,150
But I couldn't recall...

353
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,950
what do I look like dressed in this.

354
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,300
Now that I've seen you two,

355
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,660
it suddenly occurs to me that...

356
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,310
I look like...

357
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,900
a kind of bird in your tribe
very much, princess.

358
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,810
What is it called again?

359
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,560
It's very ugly,

360
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,950
with white spots
spread on its red feathers.

361
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,360
It's called...

362
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,560
crimson-bellied chicken!

363
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,080
That's right! That ugly chicken!

364
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,680
It's so ugly.

365
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,960
But there's nothing I can do.

366
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,030
The Moon Immortal made me wear this.

367
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,140
I've to follow what he
says as I'm younger.

368
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,050
Pity me.

369
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,360
I'm a decent grape elf,

370
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,270
but now I have to
be a silly...

371
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,870
and strutting chicken for once.

372
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,360
- You...
- Sui He,

373
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,840
I'm busy today.

374
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,480
I will talk to you
about spells another day.

375
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,570
Why are you standing there?

376
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,800
As an attendant,
you're really insensitive to your job.

377
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,970
Let's go.

378
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,450
Why do I feel like the
princess is angry?

379
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,110
The crimson-bellied chickens
and peacocks...

380
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,350
are of the same ancestry.

381
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,760
Sui He is related to them.

382
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
She's one who save face.

383
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,800
Why did you speak so carelessly?

384
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,690
Reflect on your mistakes
when we're back.

385
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,680
How many vermilion bird eggs
have you eaten?

386
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,520
Your nose bleeds so much.

387
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,130
Jin Mi,

388
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,640
Your appearance surely...

389
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,820
attracts others' attention.

390
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,750
This is what I do.

391
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,810
It's how it should be.
It's how it should be.

392
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,450
You're really shameless.

393
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,440
Why should I be embarrassed?

394
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,290
As flowers and fruits,

395
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,900
of course we have to attract
bees and butterflies.

396
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,830
If there is no bees or butterflies
to help in flowers' pollination,

397
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,130
how do we get fruits?

398
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,700
Without fruits,

399
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,160
there's no grape.

400
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,200
Being stupid is not your fault.

401
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,270
But being stupid
while looking so attractive...

402
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,870
is definitely your fault.

403
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,520
Your Highness.

404
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,150
What happened to your face?

405
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,490
Who bullied you?

406
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,540
Your Highness,

407
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,160
I wasnâ€™t bullied.

408
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,570
Maybe because it's too hot...

409
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,480
that there's too much heat in my body.

410
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,840
Go wash your face.

411
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,680
Then recite the
heat-clearing chant.

412
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,280
You'll cool down when you're calm.

413
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
Go.

414
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,420
Yes.

415
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,300
Hang on.

416
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,240
It's better if you use
the grape vine hairpin.

417
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,560
Why?

418
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,340
You don't want to?

419
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,040
I... I didn't mean to be
better looking than you.

420
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,380
It was just a coincidence.

421
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,620
Coincidence.

422
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,100
What did you say?

423
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
I understand that.

424
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,690
I dressed like a man,

425
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,770
and Yue Bei...

426
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,000
wanted to marry me...

427
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,770
instead of you.

428
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,970
That's why...

429
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,580
you're unhappy.

430
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
But don't worry.

431
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,000
I will be more careful next time.
I will.

432
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,410
You heartless girl.

433
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,780
Alright.

434
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,040
I'll just be more careful.

435
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,600
You...

436
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,050
are more obedient to my uncle
compared to me, his nephew.

437
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,790
You changed your clothes when the
Moon Immortal told you to.

438
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,680
Why aren't you...

439
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,390
so obedient on other days?

440
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,280
Red does suit you.

441
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,120
When Xu Feng sees this,

442
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,560
he'll be happy for sure.

443
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,080
If he's happy,

444
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,880
he'll be more kind to you.

445
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Of course it's not because of
the Moon Immortal.

446
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,020
I did this for the spi...

447
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,420
I did this for you.

448
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,550
Look at me,

449
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,960
are you happy?

450
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,210
You're not answering my question.

451
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,760
I'll just ask you.

452
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,080
Do you feel happy...

453
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,410
when you see me...

454
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,560
dressed like this?

455
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,560
I see.

456
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,280
She did this for me.

457
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,780
Is she...

458
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,640
Is she into me?

459
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,640
Moon Immortal is indeed calculating.

460
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,930
Dressing like a chicken
actually has its use.

461
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,960
The phoenix's taste is really...

462
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,520
Never mind.
I made him happy,

463
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,200
so what if I have to
sacrifice a little?

464
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,550
Maybe when he gets happier,

465
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,880
he'll give me
some magical prowess.

466
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,320
By the way,

467
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,040
uncle told me to tell you...

468
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,790
in even days, in the morning,

469
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,500
there will be a show at
house of marriage.

470
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,090
Go take a look if you have time.

471
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,760
Really? That's great!

472
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,360
I love watching opera.

473
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,280
If you have nothing to do,

474
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,040
concentrate on your practice.

475
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,480
Don't do wandering around.

476
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,720
Okay. So are you going
to the show by then?

477
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,270
By asking this,

478
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,590
do you want me to go...

479
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,150
or do you not want me to go?

480
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,560
- I don't want you to go.
- Why?

481
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,840
If you do,

482
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,540
you'll be surrounded by...

483
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,280
the female fairies.

484
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,420
Then,

485
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,150
I wouldn't be able to get a good seat.

486
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,760
Is she...

487
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,400
being jealous?

488
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,210
He's really afraid that
I'll steal the fairies away.

489
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,770
Foolish bird.

490
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,490
What would I want those fairies for?

491
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,830
It's better if you give
me some magical prowess.

492
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,440
Follow me.

493
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,970
Open all the cabinets,

494
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,290
and clean them.

495
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,340
Doesn't he have hands?

496
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,880
Your Highness,
what treasure is this?

497
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,570
This is the tooth of Tao Wu.

498
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,150
This is my precious collection.

499
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,600
Be careful.

500
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,400
Clean it.

501
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,770
Then put it back.

502
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,790
What about this?

503
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,440
This is the rib of Gu Diao.

504
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,280
The beast resembles a bird.

505
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,590
It fed on mortals,

506
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,300
and looked like a bird with horns.

507
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,880
It had a baby's cry,

508
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,340
and had killed countless people.

509
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,680
But...

510
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,800
it was easily subdued by me.

511
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,200
Did he purposely tell me this?

512
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,830
These are Hun Dun's head and tail.

513
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,270
This is the tail of Chu Huai.

514
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,080
This is...

515
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,640
one of the 9 brains of Jiu Ying.

516
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,490
All of these were...

517
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,450
feracious beasts that
harmed the six realms.

518
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,980
But they're now my trophy.

519
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Look around.

520
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,800
If there's anything you like,

521
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,070
I can give it to you...

522
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,800
as a decoration.

523
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
But if it's the heads...

524
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,460
of the ancient beasts that you want,

525
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,320
I can think about it depending on...

526
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,590
your performance.

527
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,760
No need.

528
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,000
You're indeed the god of war,
Your Highness.

529
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
Amazing.

530
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,180
Awesome.

531
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,720
The cabinets are almost full.

532
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,730
I'll need a new one.

533
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,120
This works.

534
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,740
When she's looking at
my great achievements,

535
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,400
her eyes are shining...

536
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,080
with admiration.

537
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,440
He is clearly warning me.

538
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,300
Such a narrow-minded bird.

539
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,880
How did I offend him?

540
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,960
Why is he scaring me?

541
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,800
Is it Jin Mi?

542
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,760
The little girl
brought up by Xu Feng...

543
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,720
has changed a lot.

544
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,810
You've become prettier as time passes.

545
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,940
He's really narrow-minded.

546
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,020
He is afraid that...

547
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,910
I'll steal his title of "The Most
Handsome Guy in Six Realm".

548
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,100
In case there's misunderstanding,

549
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,440
I've kept my grape vine
in magic-repressing bag.

550
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,120
Xu Feng is the best in six realms.

551
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,320
And Jin Mi,

552
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,710
you're extraordinarily beautiful.

553
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,320
You and Xu Feng...
make the perfect match.

554
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,640
Moon Immortal,

555
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,220
you're getting slimmer.

556
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,060
Seems like your diet works.

557
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,880
Congratulations.

558
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,820
Was I very fat?

559
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
Yeah.

560
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,170
It was bird tribe's fault.

561
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,440
Lately, the chickens they provide...

562
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,180
are even smaller than a pigeon.

563
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,570
They were terrifyingly thin...

564
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,780
that I couldn't get enough
food everyday.

565
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,880
I even wake up at night due to hunger.

566
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,770
Could it be plague caused by chickens?

567
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,910
No.

568
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,370
This is a long story.

569
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,840
They ought to know
who they're bullying.

570
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,210
The Flora realm is biting
off more than they can chew.

571
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,680
They even
go against the bird tribe now.

572
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,120
Aunt, don't be angry.

573
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,960
And you.

574
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,040
Why are you
only telling me now?

575
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,240
You're the mighty
princess of bird tribe.

576
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,570
The leader of the tribe.

577
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,940
Chief Zhang is nothing.

578
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,240
She's just temporarily
taking charge...

579
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,630
of the Flora realm for Flora Immortal.

580
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,920
Who is she to
tell us what to do?

581
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,990
I thought this was a small matter.

582
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,120
Morover, the prince went missing...

583
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,480
and Demon realm was advancing.

584
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,080
I didn't wish to argue with her.

585
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,350
That was why I yielded.

586
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,080
When I returned home,

587
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,590
I interrogated everyone in the tribe.

588
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,230
No one did what she mentioned.

589
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,720
But unexpectedly,
Chief Zhang won't let this go.

590
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,200
She insisted that...

591
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,920
a bird took away...
an elf from Flora realm.

592
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,920
Why is the elf...

593
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,480
so important?

594
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,190
I find it strange too.

595
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,120
But I couldn't trace
the flower elf.

596
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,560
Yet she said I tried to cover up
for my subordinate and got mad.

597
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,990
She even gave out Luoying order...

598
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,030
and started
to not provide us with food.

599
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,530
She said if the bird tribe
doesn't hand over the elf,

600
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,940
Flora realm will never
provide us food.

601
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,340
How dare she!

602
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,610
Besides worms,

603
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,280
our main food...

604
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,890
is flora and grains,

605
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,120
and also seeds.

606
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,550
Aren't they...

607
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,560
going against us by doing this?

608
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,860
The newly borns...

609
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,860
are looking very thin.

610
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,080
I do pity them.

611
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,400
That's why I'm here to
ask for your help, aunt.

612
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,130
The Flora realm is so arrogant...

613
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,360
because the Heavenly Emperor
is being soft with them.

614
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,510
But we...

615
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,640
can't lower ourselves to beg them.

616
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,370
Pass my order.

617
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,180
Open up the
8 granaries of Heaven realm.

618
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Yes.

619
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,560
As for that flower elf,

620
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,880
there must be something
mysterious about her.

621
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,560
Tell someone to check it out secretly.

622
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,050
Find out who she is,

623
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,920
and keep me up to date.

624
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,080
Yes.

625
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,140
As fox,

626
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,040
we can't live without chickens.

627
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,000
They were originally
provided by bird tribe.

628
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,260
But now,

629
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,650
we're running out of food.

630
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,780
The chickens who are able to
grow into the size of a pigeon...

631
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,270
had struggled a lot.

632
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,480
This is tortuous. How tortuous.

633
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,160
I wonder which unlucky
flower elf that is.

634
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,720
If I were still in Flora realm,

635
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,310
I'll persuade Chief Zhang...

636
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,630
to never stop...

637
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,710
providing them food,

638
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,850
but substitute all...

639
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,080
with croton.

640
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,320
Hey you,
why did you barge in?

641
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,590
I told you, my master
is having a guest today.

642
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,360
Mr. Hu.

643
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,530
She is...

644
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,340
More?

645
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,740
No.

646
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,160
Hong Hong,

647
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,680
I am terrified.

648
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,080
Do you know what did I
run into just now?

649
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,540
Is it the jade rabbit
from Guanghan Palace?

650
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,600
It is.

651
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,770
I've never seen
that rabbit for thousands of years.

652
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,360
It has become a lot fatter.

653
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,130
How many carrots do
you think it ate...

654
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,850
to grow into how it is now?

655
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,200
I wonder what
is it that...

656
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,690
brings you here...

657
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,840
to experience such suffering.

658
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,600
Let's not talk about it.

659
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,640
I'm so unlucky today.

660
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,410
Chief Zhang chased me
out of Flora realm.

661
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,970
After a long thought,

662
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,760
I think it's better to...

663
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,240
come to your place.

664
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,680
Why did she chase you out?

665
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,110
This is...

666
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,440
It's me.

667
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,670
Little grape.

668
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,220
Little one?

669
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,780
Oh my girl,

670
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,680
I found you at last.

671
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,670
You've troubled me a lot.

672
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,080
Why did you leave
without saying anything?

673
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,950
My carrot skin...

674
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,520
was almost peeled by the chiefs...

675
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,690
because of you.

676
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,920
They even
accused me of...

677
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,570
failing in protecting you,

678
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,560
and ordered me to look
for you immediately.

679
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,680
If I couldn't find you,

680
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,910
they'll throw me
into a rabbit's nest.

681
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,600
This is great.

682
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,280
I finally found you.

683
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,700
I didn't think that...

684
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,140
Chief Zhang who was always
strict with me...

685
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,520
has left me...

686
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,040
an important place in her heart.

687
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,650
Hurry up, go back with me.

688
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,420
I'm finally safe.

689
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,650
Wait a moment.

690
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,920
Where are you...

691
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,160
taking my nephew's wife to?

692
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,560
Your nephew's wife?

693
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,130
Little one,

694
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,480
are you...

695
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,800
wrongly matched...

696
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,730
by this bad-sighted fox?

697
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,840
His nephew...

698
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,640
looks like he'll have a lot of lovers.

699
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,800
He'd have at least 8 wives
if not 10 in the future.

700
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,620
How can you
And his nephew...

701
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,840
You... you...

702
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,460
Let's look for Supreme Lord Tao...

703
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,990
and borrow his sword...

704
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,790
to cut off the matching red line.

705
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,210
What're you talking about?

706
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,320
I'm here to learn from the phoenix.

707
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,760
Really?

708
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,120
That's better.

709
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,360
But you should go back now.

710
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:35,800
Otherwise there'll be a chaos.

711
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,780
Either the bird tribe...

712
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,650
or the Flora realm will extinct.

713
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,920
Let's go back...

714
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,080
and report to Chief Zhang.

715
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Mr. Hu,

716
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,080
Xu Feng is still training
the soldiers.

717
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:49,380
Why not wait for him to...

718
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,760
We've no time for that.

719
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,239
Come on, let's go.

720
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,730
Wait for me!

721
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:58,840
- Mr. Hu.
- Hurry up.

722
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,060
Slow down. Relax.

723
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,760
- You...
- Relax.

724
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:05,480
- Jin Mi.
- Fox fairy.

725
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,840
Hong Hong,

726
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,159
don't cause any more trouble.

727
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,280
We're running out of time.
If this is delayed,

728
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,850
Flora realm will be going into

729
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,280
a war with bird tribe.

730
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:17,830
Wait a second.

731
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,400
Could the lost flower elf
be Jin Mi?

732
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,290
That's it.

733
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,140
A... A... Am I not...

734
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,330
a grape elf?

735
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,690
Flower elf or grape elf,

736
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,750
what's the difference?

737
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,040
You're still elf, anyway.

738
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,240
Do you know that...

739
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,930
when Chief Zhang learnt that...

740
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,400
you were taken away by a big bird,

741
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,810
she was extremely furious?

742
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,160
Come on, go home with me.

743
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Hang on.

744
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,400
What's so special about Jin Mi?

745
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,560
Why does Chief Zhang treat
her so differently?

746
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,090
I've never heard that...

747
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,080
she has a child.

748
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,400
Is Chief Zhang saving Jin Mi...

749
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,880
for another man?

750
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,720
Hong Hong,
don't talk nonsense.

751
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,780
Jin Mi...

752
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,670
was brought up by Chief Zhang.

753
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,110
Of course she cares about her.

754
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,130
Won't you help
your neighbour...

755
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,570
to find her lost child?

756
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,070
Somehow, I think that
something is fishy here.

757
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,800
That's why, you can't
just take Jin Mi away.

758
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,830
I didn't expect
I'm still quite important...

759
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,350
in Chief Zhang's heart.

760
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,520
Hong Hong,

761
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,990
don't you old man mind...

762
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,480
the matter of...

763
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,700
Flora realm.

764
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,290
Who's old now?

765
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,760
Look into the mirror.

766
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,520
All these years,

767
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,320
my skin is better
taken care of than yours.

768
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,730
Mr. Hu.

769
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,040
Let me ask you.
If I follow you back now,

770
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,020
will Chief Zhang
peel my grape skin off?

771
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:35,180
She'll punish you for sure.

772
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,580
It suddenly occurs to me that...

773
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,240
there's something
I haven't completed...

774
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,440
in Heaven realm.

775
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,480
I'm going back that way.

776
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,920
- Bye, Mr. Hu.
- Come back here.

777
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,160
Little one,

778
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,530
you'd better think carefully.

779
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,360
Are you going back
with me now...

780
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,680
or do you want...

781
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
Chief Zhang...

782
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,440
to come find you in her anger?

783
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,570
Be wise.

784
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,900
I'd better leave with you now.

785
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,800
Fox fairy,

786
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,960
I caused this,

787
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,590
so I must go back.

788
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,680
But worry not.

789
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:08,990
After apologising,
I'll be back in no time.

790
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,940
Help me keep an eye on
the Golden Daluo Immortal.

791
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,230
But you're Xu Feng's attendant.

792
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,550
No matter what,

793
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,390
you have to wait for Xu Feng
to return from the training...

794
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,560
and bid him
good bye in a decent way.

795
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,460
There's no time for that.

796
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,530
Mr. Hu.

797
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,160
Xu Feng has never...

798
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,800
mistreated Jin Mi.

799
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,560
So the courtesy...

800
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,890
must be followed.

801
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,290
Forget it.

802
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,720
We're running out of time.

803
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,850
Let's go.

804
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,960
Rou Rou!

805
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,330
Why are you standing there? Run!

806
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,880
I'm going to avenge Rou Rou!

807
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,060
Jin Mi.

808
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,300
Little one, you...

809
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,990
- Run.
- Fish Fairy.

810
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,690
Fish Fairy.

811
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,850
I'll help you.

812
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,000
Jin Mi.
