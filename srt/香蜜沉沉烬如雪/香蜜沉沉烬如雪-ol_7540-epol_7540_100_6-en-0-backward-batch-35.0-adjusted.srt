1
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,180
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,700
"Episode 6"

3
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,960
Uncle,

4
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,530
report to father right away.

5
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,180
Qiong Qi is wrecking
the Southern Heavenly Gates.

6
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,090
Request for immediate assistance.

7
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,160
Little one, are you all right?

8
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,300
- Let me have a look.
- I'm fine.

9
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,020
Fish Fairy,
you must be careful.

10
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,090
Don't you worry.

11
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,170
Take care of Jin Mi.

12
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,080
Phoenix!

13
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Watch out!

14
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,920
Quick, get up.

15
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,280
Qiong Qi is deadly.
Don't go after him.

16
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,400
Are you two all right?
Are you hurt?

17
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,440
I've failed you, father.

18
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,770
I couldn't detain the beast.

19
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,940
I allowed Qiong Qi to destroy
the Southern Heavenly Gates.

20
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,260
I deserve to be punished, father.

21
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,800
You're being too harsh on yourself.

22
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,320
He is an ancient beast.

23
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,610
Ferocious by nature.

24
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,440
You, alone, are no match for him.

25
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,950
Follow me back...

26
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,250
to the Empyrean Cloud Palace now.

27
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,670
We need to figure out
a counter-measure,

28
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,870
- before he comes back stronger.
- Little one,

29
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,720
are you all right?

30
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,840
Yes.

31
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,480
It's said that
nine hundred years ago, Qiong Qi...

32
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,340
had caused havoc in the six realms.

33
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,240
He didn't just cause chaos
in the Demon Realm,

34
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,560
he even caused disturbance
in Floral Realm.

35
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,520
The Heaven Realm sent out...

36
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,080
masses of powerful Supreme Immortals,

37
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,120
it took a long time to
finally take him down.

38
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,960
Then, even...

39
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,200
Xuan Ling Lord Doumu
came forth to cast a seal.

40
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,800
It befogs me...

41
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,840
why Qiong Qi would appear again.

42
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,600
Qiong Qi's reappearance
is indeed precarious.

43
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,730
In my humble opinion,

44
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,890
it is now a critical time.

45
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,400
He must be quickly detained,

46
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,860
and be sealed once more.

47
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,400
If left unhandled,
he will cause danger to six realms.

48
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,200
There'll then be endless consequences.

49
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,880
Dear lord, I could not agree more.

50
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,200
In my humble opinion,

51
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,950
in the battles between
heaven and demon...

52
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,170
though the Demon and Heaven Realm
have called for truce,

53
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,820
feelings of unease
still lurk within them.

54
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,710
Waiting to be unleashed.

55
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,350
King of Yancheng may have withdrawn
at Wangchuan River.

56
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,080
That was but a feigned retreat.

57
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,720
Now that Qiong Qi has reappeared,

58
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,640
I believe, Demon Realm is
definitely involved in it.

59
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,380
I humbly ask,

60
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,210
to enter the Demon Realm
to capture Qiong Qi.

61
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,870
At the same time,
investigate the Demon Realm.

62
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,480
The Fire Immortal is right,

63
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,790
to undo the spell,
we need to find the spell caster.

64
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,640
This catastrophe sprouted
from the Demon Realm.

65
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,910
Please father, make a decision
as soon as you can.

66
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,560
The peace among the
six realms lasting until today,

67
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,760
had not been easy to maintain.

68
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,840
We must not allow the
Demon Realm to evoke,

69
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
overturning the peace.

70
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,460
- Orders for the Fire Immortal, Xu Feng.
- Yes, father!

71
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:17,000
Take this, Red Clouds Sword.

72
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,000
Protect Heaven and
intercept Demon Realm.

73
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,130
Take down all devils and demons.

74
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:22,159
Capture Qiong Qi.

75
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,480
Uncover the truth behind
Qiong Qi's return.

76
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
I oblige.

77
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,360
It's already so late.

78
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,990
Why isn't Phoenix back yet?

79
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,640
I wonder if he is badly hurt...

80
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,880
by Qiong Qi.

81
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,080
Veggie!

82
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,750
My poor Veggie!

83
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,320
How you've suffered.

84
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,280
Just 2 days,

85
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,120
and you've been cooked into a dish.

86
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,320
These soulless short-lived
Heaven Immortals!

87
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,640
What a sin!

88
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,920
This Veggie...

89
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,560
who are you talking about?

90
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,820
Have you forgotten?

91
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,800
The field by the Water Mirror,

92
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,910
the lover of the chives sister,

93
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,360
little Chinese flowering cabbage.

94
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,280
When you were young,
he used to praise you for your wits.

95
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,370
Have you forgotten?

96
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,120
Well, at a glance,
it does look a little familiar.

97
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,040
But how could you tell?

98
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,440
Of course I could.

99
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,930
It's Veggie!

100
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,730
Veggie has always had green leaves.

101
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,940
White stalks.

102
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,430
Rounded head.

103
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,760
Tender in texture.

104
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,390
Of course it's him.

105
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,600
Don't all Chinese flowering cabbages
look like that?

106
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,410
Your Highness,

107
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,230
Your Highness,

108
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,830
I heard you had a vicious battle at
Southern Heavenly Gates with Qiong Qi.

109
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,830
Were you hurt?

110
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,130
It was nothing major.

111
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,360
Go on down.

112
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Yes.

113
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,520
- Stop crying.
- Hello, Uncle.

114
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,010
Xu Feng.

115
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,600
This is...

116
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,040
A rotten tree cannot bear good fruit.

117
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,340
None of you Heaven-kind
have a kind soul.

118
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,960
Like father, like mother,

119
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,760
like son.

120
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,590
Xu Feng,

121
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,900
do you still remember...

122
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,390
when you secretly
set free the Jade Rabbit,

123
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,560
there was a Carrot Fairy...

124
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,750
that was thrust around through
the Heavenly Palace?

125
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,760
Well, he's the one.

126
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,520
I was young and oblivious.

127
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,640
For the wrong that I've done unto you,

128
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,520
I hereby apologize.

129
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,800
But,

130
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,620
Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Empress
are rulers of the six realms...

131
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,380
They are not someone who can be
criticized by a petty fairy like you.

132
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,040
Mr. Hu.

133
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,160
Let's all get along peacefully.
Speak nicely.

134
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,220
Your dishes here are
the least bit tasty.

135
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,440
Little one,

136
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,810
follow me back to the Water Mirror.

137
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,740
And debrief to the fellow Floral Fairies.

138
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,910
I recently heard that
the Floral Realm...

139
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,310
had a fall out with the bird tribe...

140
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,720
for a mere fairy.

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,080
Is this uproar...

142
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,160
due to Jin Mi?

143
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,800
So what if is?

144
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,430
What if it's not?

145
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,310
The Floral and Heaven Realm...

146
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,630
haven't communicated
for thousands of years.

147
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,760
Yet today, the Floral Fairies have to
attend to this personally...

148
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,510
for just a fairy.

149
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,230
Seems like there'll be lots
to weather in the coming days.

150
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,680
The Floral Realm
is none of your business.

151
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,000
Are you going back for this?

152
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,400
Very well.

153
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,120
Qiong Qi is causing havoc.

154
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,540
Father has sent me to
patrol the Demon Realm.

155
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
I'll leave tomorrow.

156
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,260
I'll be gone for a good few years.

157
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,670
If you stayed in Heaven,
with no one to train you.

158
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,920
It'd be a waste of time anyway.
Better yet to go back.

159
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,240
Phoenix, you fool!

160
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,140
How can you let Jin Mi go?

161
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,000
That's great!

162
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,360
Now that we've bid farewell.

163
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,240
Let's go then.

164
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,350
Wait a minute.

165
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,130
Now... now's not the time to leave yet.

166
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,360
Why... why's that?

167
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,810
I've not done packing my bags.

168
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,440
Jin Mi, how are you more
clutter-brained than me?

169
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,800
You're no ordinary human.

170
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,400
What bags do you need?

171
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,280
Whatever pretty clothes you desire,

172
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,640
you need only snap your fingers,

173
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,000
and you have everything you need.

174
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,280
I... I...
It's not clothes that I want.

175
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,800
It's... it's books that
I want to take along.

176
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Books?

177
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,080
Yes, yes.

178
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,690
Since... since I came here,

179
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,880
I've been studying this
mental cultivation.

180
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,830
There's a few chapters of scripture...

181
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,920
that I've not understood.

182
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,440
So I'd like to take them back,

183
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,750
so that I can ask Chief Peony,
isn't that good?

184
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,350
Your Highness,
Can I...

185
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,440
Can I take a few books
from your study?

186
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,830
I am truly glad,

187
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,440
that you have a
curious heart to learn.

188
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,760
The books in the study
are yours to take.

189
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

190
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,200
That's more like it.

191
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,280
You've finally matured.

192
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,050
Little one,
besides just playing a fool,

193
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,600
you now yearn self-improvement.

194
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,480
Very well. We shall
leave tomorrow then.

195
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,840
We shall leave tomorrow.

196
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,170
All right.

197
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,350
- We'll leave tomorrow.
- Take more books.

198
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,160
Take more books.
Don't worry about the weight.

199
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,440
- If it's heavy, I'll help you.
- All right, all right.

200
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,920
Wait a while.

201
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,910
That should do it.

202
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,640
You've finally learn
not to feed me scalding water.

203
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,960
Qiong Qi was so scary today,

204
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,000
thanks for saving me.

205
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,360
Thank goodness, you are grateful.

206
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,120
I very much appreciate being alive.

207
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,390
So I must give thanks,

208
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,720
for being my saviour.

209
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,240
I wonder how she plans to thank me.

210
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,120
How are you going to thank me?

211
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,280
Didn't I just thank you?

212
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,110
Forget it.

213
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,960
It's like I'm serenading a cow.

214
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,530
We were doing fine,

215
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,240
yet he suddenly gets mad at me?

216
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,760
What ridiculous mood swings.

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,080
Rest assured,

218
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,760
I will definitely defeat Qiong Qi...

219
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,040
and avenge you.

220
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,600
If you really do defeat him,

221
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,880
even if you
make me gardener then,

222
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,160
I'd be more than willing.

223
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,240
I'd even plant
a whole garden with Phoenix Flower.

224
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,850
What's the matter?

225
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,870
Are you all right?

226
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,080
Help me up over there.

227
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,530
Yes, of course.

228
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,980
Slowly.

229
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,050
Phoenix.

230
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,900
Are you okay?

231
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,390
I'm fine.

232
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,620
I'll be okay, with just a
change of luck after 12 days.

233
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,000
- Phoenix.
- No big deal.

234
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,750
What's with that face?

235
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,010
Your brows and eyes
are all scrunched up.

236
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,840
I was just thinking,

237
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,120
you're not using your powers
to stay strong, right?

238
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,520
Why would I stay strong for?

239
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,040
Then, get up and walk 2 rounds for me.

240
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,400
I'm up.

241
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
Not enough.

242
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,600
This can't determine
if you're really okay.

243
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,040
I must see for myself.

244
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,950
What are you doing?

245
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,840
I want to see
if your back is recovered.

246
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,400
How would I know if I don't check?

247
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,220
- Let go.
- No.

248
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,400
Let me see.

249
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,550
Qiong Qi is so strong.
No way you'd recover so easily.

250
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,350
If I don't see it myself,
I won't believe it.

251
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,290
If I say I'm fine, I'm fine.
Tugging and pulling, what a mess.

252
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,400
Let me see.
I'll stop once I see.

253
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
Let me see.

254
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,480
Even immortals have scars too.

255
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,100
Why do you have so many?

256
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,360
What happened here?

257
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,240
They were from former battles.

258
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,890
How long do you plan to keep looking?

259
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,980
Fine, fine.

260
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,800
Do you all wild fairies...

261
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,400
know no bounds between men and women?

262
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,160
And always tug at people's clothes?

263
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,670
It's fine that it's me.

264
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,400
But you can never
tug on other people's clothes.

265
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,000
Understood?

266
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,050
Understood.

267
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,160
You're amazing.

268
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,480
You can recover from
all injuries by Qiong Qi's.

269
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,440
But why do you have
so many scars?

270
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,040
Wars wait for no men.

271
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,550
When have I the time to heal?

272
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,830
So as time passes,

273
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,240
scars naturally stay.

274
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,800
But they are just external injuries.

275
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,120
It's nothing.

276
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,560
Don't you feel pain?

277
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,080
They've long recovered.

278
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,520
I guess being Supreme Immortal
is not easy too.

279
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,040
Obviously.

280
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,480
The Way of Heaven...

281
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,290
is paved with endless pain
but sparse healing.

282
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,480
Do everything...

283
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,880
in adequacy.

284
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,440
The higher the magical prowess,
the stronger one becomes.

285
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,720
The more responsibility and
bigger the mission one bears.

286
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,480
The more there are that...

287
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,720
one needs to protect.

288
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,320
I heard Chief Peony mention once,

289
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,590
in the Floral Realm,

290
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,200
if Ganoderma essence is applied,

291
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,520
those badly injured can heal,

292
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,120
normal people can get stronger...

293
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,080
from ingesting it.

294
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,800
Seeing that Your Highness
has saved my life,

295
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,200
I'll give you one.

296
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,640
Ganoderma essence is rare
and sacred in the Floral Realm.

297
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,880
You need not bother
Chief Peony for my sake.

298
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,440
Mr. Hu said before,

299
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,320
people who look good,

300
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,640
spend all their effort in
caring for their face.

301
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,920
Therefore, their brains
are usually empty.

302
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,760
You, are the perfect example.

303
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,400
You're the one who kidnapped me here.

304
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,000
Why would Chief Peony save you?

305
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,440
If that's the case,

306
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,000
how would you give it to me?

307
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,580
It's just some grass.

308
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,560
I'll just cast it out for you.

309
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,750
You, cast it out?

310
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,000
Don't look down on me.

311
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,840
That's actually really easy.

312
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,640
You better think about
how you should thank me,

313
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,800
after I cast it out.

314
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,600
All right,

315
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,930
I'll be waiting then.

316
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,240
Just you wait.

317
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,120
Wait and see.

318
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,720
If you can plant the Ganoderma,

319
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,950
I'll give you 200 years worth
of magical prowess.

320
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,360
What say you?

321
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,900
I know you're just teasing me.

322
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,340
But us fruit planters,

323
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,720
do not share the same thoughts
with the birds.

324
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,360
Three hundred years.

325
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,440
All right, 300 years then.

326
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,620
I... I...

327
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
I... I've planted it!

328
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,280
I've grown the Ganoderma!

329
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,440
Look!

330
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,470
Three hundred years
of magical prowess.

331
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,760
Losers pay the rake!

332
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,170
What are you?

333
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,040
What's wrong?

334
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,160
Ganoderma essence is a
sacred to the Floral Realm.

335
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,700
How can a nobody like you
grow something like that?

336
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,750
Let me ask you,

337
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,870
how are you related
to the late Floral Immortal?

338
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,920
The late Floral Immortal had
great magical prowess.

339
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,440
High above all immortals.

340
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,440
If only I could be related to that.

341
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,800
I'm not joking around, who are you?

342
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,140
I'm just a grape,
what's wrong with you?

343
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,270
Have you changed your mind
about the magical prowess?

344
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,640
You can just say so.

345
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,140
Why are you being like this?

346
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,080
Fox fairy, why are you here?

347
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,440
As the wind breezes by,

348
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,160
separating Heaven and Earth
to a million miles.

349
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,910
So, what?

350
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,680
Moon Immortal was right,

351
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,440
to hold down a man,
is to first hold his kiss.

352
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,960
But why do I feel weird?

353
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,920
The rest is still usable.

354
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,440
Keep it.

355
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,600
Don't waste my Ganoderma!

356
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,600
Never to meet again in all eternity,

357
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,120
despite how frantic the world becomes.

358
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,400
In a love letter, I found the place
where we meet in every life.

359
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,960
There I'll wait for us to
watch the setting sun.

360
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,560
In a love letter, I found the place
where we love in every life.

361
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,400
There I'll sing in the moonlight.

362
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,520
In a love letter, I found the place
where I make a wish in every life.

363
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:04,040
There I'll plant a red lotus to fill
the memories with its lovely scent.

364
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,040
In a love letter, I found a place...

365
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,130
Rou Rou.

366
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,140
Phoenix got hurt because
he tried to save me.

367
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,030
Yet,

368
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,400
this cunning bird...

369
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,000
said he's fully recovered.

370
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,880
Who knows if he's really recovered?

371
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,240
He even sacrificed his life for me.

372
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,920
If I left just like that,

373
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,640
it'd be too unfair...

374
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,240
right?

375
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,800
Even if not for him,

376
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,390
but for you,

377
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,320
I too, must go to Demon Realm
to find Qiong Qi.

378
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,880
To avenge you!

379
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,880
In a love letter, I found the place
where we meet in every life.

380
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,990
There I'll wait for us to
watch the setting sun.

381
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:01,940
In a love letter, I found the place
where we love in every life.

382
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,680
There I'll sing in the moonlight.

383
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,640
In a love letter, I found the place
where I make a wish in every life.

384
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:19,420
There I'll plant a red lotus to fill
the memories with its lovely scent.

385
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,240
In a love letter, I found the place
where we love in every life.

386
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,920
Congratulations, Your Highness.

387
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,640
What of?

388
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,720
I heard that Your Highness
caused great pain...

389
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,140
to Qiong Qi with your powers.

390
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,190
The Heavenly Emperor personally gifted
the Red Clouds Sword...

391
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,050
which can kill immortals and
subdue demons.

392
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,680
That sword is Heaven Realm's
greatest treasure.

393
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,040
The Heavenly Emperor's action
of doing so speaks volumes.

394
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,780
Your aunt is too, greatly thrilled.

395
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,790
Therefore, I have come forth
especially to congratulate you.

396
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,080
It was only a duty,
there's nothing to be congratulated.

397
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,720
What is it that brings you here
so early in the day?

398
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,720
Your Highness,
you are journeying far.

399
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,320
I came to send you off.

400
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,240
Also, I heard some rumours yesterday.

401
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,360
Saying that, Jin Mi is the person
Chief Peony is after.

402
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,630
Is this true?

403
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,960
You sure are well-informed.

404
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,640
Seems like Qiwu Palace
should do an in-house clean up.

405
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,290
No wonder I couldn't
find a single soul...

406
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,320
as I searched the entire bird tribe.

407
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,640
Jin Mi is really headstrong.

408
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,040
Just by her alone,

409
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,010
she caused so much trouble
to the bird tribe.

410
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,400
You can't blame Jin Mi,

411
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,420
it was I who took her here
to Heaven Realm.

412
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,860
I'll apologize to Chief Peony.

413
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,650
To clear up the misunderstanding.

414
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,870
Surely.

415
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,180
So long as the Floral Realm and
the bird tribe are on good terms,

416
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,490
I'll have a peace of mind.

417
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,400
Just that, I used to think
I knew Jin Mi.

418
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,240
Yet she even hid her identity from me.

419
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,760
I'm just so disappointed.

420
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,270
You've always been benevolent.

421
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,160
Don't compare yourself to Jin Mi,
that clutter-brain.

422
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,050
Phoenix has great powers.

423
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,070
Hopefully he doesn't figure it out.

424
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,790
Ouch.

425
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,840
Your Highness,

426
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,320
this shirt has got some dirt on it.

427
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,600
Your Highness,

428
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,590
it might be because
this scroll is aged.

429
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,580
It's not properly dusted,
thus dusting the shirt.

430
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,630
Your Highness, shall I get a
change of clothes for you?

431
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,560
Your Highness,
how about this purple one?

432
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,200
It's a little too bright.

433
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,120
Then, Your Highness,
what about the black one?

434
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,430
That's too gloomy.

435
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,580
No worries.

436
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,240
A little dust is fine.

437
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,790
I'll just wear this.

438
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,800
That's right.

439
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,390
Ouch!

440
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,860
It hurts!

441
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,280
"Bank of Wangchuan River"

442
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,680
Young man, are you looking for a ride?

443
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,920
Exactly.

444
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,350
Sorry to trouble you, sir.

445
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,470
Please.

446
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,680
Please stand firm, young man.

447
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,400
The fairy in the sleeve pocket too,
hold on tight.

448
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,080
I'm going to take off.

449
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,280
Fairy in sleeve pocket, hold on tight.

450
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,840
That...

451
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,120
I don't know how but I slept
in the wrong place, last night.

452
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,320
How unfortunate.
How unfortunate indeed.

453
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,470
This is Wangchuan River.

454
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,280
If you don't wish to be the food of
the souls in the river, sit still.

455
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,000
Where's your grape vines?

456
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,970
I worried that wearing it
would wound your pride,

457
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,020
so I kept it.

458
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,700
Why would my pride be wounded?

459
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,670
Obviously because I worry,
I'd snatch away...

460
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,730
your reputation as the most
handsome man in the six realms.

461
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,480
My whole 10,000 years of watching...

462
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,040
River of Unmindfulness,
this is my second time...

463
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,080
seeing such a stunning lady.

464
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,230
Isn't your business
doing too bad then.

465
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,060
Only 2 ladies in 10,000 years.

466
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,330
I still remember,
about 10,000 years ago...

467
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,910
there once was a lady...

468
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,500
who came to me for
a handful of water from this river.

469
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,110
That lady had the skin of a goddess.

470
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,490
She walked like she was
on a field of flowers.

471
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,040
Her feature's stunning.

472
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,720
But she looked miserable.

473
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,900
Unlike this lady here,
who's bright and naive.

474
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,490
Sounds like an interesting story.

475
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,850
I'll tell this to the Moon Immortal
when I get back.

476
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,470
He'd definitely be delighted.

477
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,710
Then what happened?
What happened next?

478
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,230
Then from the shore,
came a man with brocade clothing.

479
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,220
Hurriedly he spilled the water
from the hands of the lady.

480
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,100
After a struggle between the two.

481
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,660
The girl leaped up,
seeming to dive into the river.

482
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,520
Then the man panicked.

483
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,640
As if he'd gone mad,
and tried to pull her back.

484
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,710
In the end,
the 2 of them disappeared...

485
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,240
and was nowhere to be seen.

486
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,560
River of Unmindfulness.

487
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,780
Looking back, it's all
become a distant memory.

488
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,200
So it's a story with a bad ending.

489
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,920
Stand firm.

490
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,660
Told you to be careful.

491
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,880
You clumsy mess.

492
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,840
What a moody birdy.

493
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,730
Don't leave me here alone.

494
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,800
I'll be scared all alone here.

495
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,970
You're a elfin.

496
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,590
What could possibly scare you?

497
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,120
Oh yeah.

498
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,390
You've got a point.

499
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,850
What? I'm no elfin.

500
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,370
I'm a fairy.

501
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,600
From today on,

502
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,320
you will be my personal maid
in the Demon Realm.

503
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,520
Assist me closely.

504
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,960
And I'll make sure you don't get
captured by demons. How's that?

505
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,360
All right.

506
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,390
Why did you make
my hair into 2 pigtails?

507
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,100
This is so old-fashioned!

508
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,540
Why did you make
my hair into 2 pigtails?

509
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,360
I hate pigtails.

510
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,560
I think it looks great.

511
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,120
Two pigtails don't look good at all!

512
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,080
I think it looks great.

513
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,840
Mr. Demon,
come buy this tail.

514
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,990
I have only the freshest.

515
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,400
Once you put it on,
I assure you will be in disguise.

516
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,160
How real!

517
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,680
It's still warm.

518
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,120
Do you have bunny ears?

519
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,560
I do, I do, I do!

520
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,520
Wow, really?

521
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,280
Now I can go back and
give Mr. Hu a scare.

522
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,850
Do I look cute?
Cute, aren't I?

523
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,160
You have such great taste.

524
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,000
This rabbit ears are made
according to...

525
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,560
- the Jade Rabbit of Guanghan Palace.
- Really?

526
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,160
Don't get tricked.

527
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
All right!

528
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Ms. Demon,

529
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,380
you have not given me
any magical prowess.

530
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,600
What magical prowess?

531
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,720
I'll pay on behalf of her.

532
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,250
Fish Fairy?

533
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,200
Fairy Jin Mi.

534
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,350
- Why are you here?
- You seem well.

535
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,410
- Thanks Fish Fairy.
- Cute, right? You like it?

536
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,840
This.

537
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,700
It's my maid who is buying,

538
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,190
of course I should be paying.

539
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,320
How could I trouble
The Night Immortal.

540
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,200
It's no trouble between brothers.

541
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,230
Brothers?

542
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,790
You are brothers?

543
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,680
The Heaven Realm is truly weird.

544
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,830
First there was the Fox uncle.

545
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,160
Now there's a handsome fish brother.

546
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,020
Everyone is connected in this world.

547
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,280
Looks like you know each other.

548
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,230
That day, Fish Fairy was
feeding the deer in Heaven,

549
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,520
and I ran into him.

550
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,860
Fish?

551
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,750
The Night Immortal,

552
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,590
when did you decide to
forgo being a dragon,

553
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,050
but become a fish instead?

554
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,330
The Night Immortal?

555
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,780
I heard that a while back...

556
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,880
The Fire Immortal became a crow
back in the Floral Realm.

557
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,600
Me becoming a fish
is nothing compared to that.

558
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
You.

559
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,620
You're the Night Dragon, the Night Immortal?

560
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,239
I guess having a tail with scales,
doesn't mean you're a fish.

561
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,340
You could be
a low-profile dragon too.

562
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,570
It never occurred to me,
that Jin Mi, you...

563
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,280
are the Fire Immortal's maidservant.

564
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,100
How very interesting.

565
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,210
What brings the Night Immortal
to the Demon Realm?

566
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:51,409
You coming here personally
to capture Qiong Qi...

567
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,670
has made me worry.

568
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,110
So I came to lend a helping hand.

569
00:33:54,469 --> 00:33:55,870
Qiong Qi is truly ferocious.

570
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,290
I may not be able to protect you.

571
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,520
Rest assured.

572
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,960
I won't drag you down.

573
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,600
- Let's go then.
- Let's.

574
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,400
What a big room!

575
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,010
Where... where should I sleep?

576
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,300
You're my personal maid.

577
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,030
Of course you have to serve me.

578
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,440
That doesn't seem very good.

579
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,800
I'm not used to sharing a bed.

580
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,360
This is a suite.

581
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,920
Of course you'll have your own bed.

582
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,790
Tonight, I'll be discussing the
battle plan with his highness.

583
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,110
You go prepare some
fine wine and food...

584
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,480
and send it to my room.

585
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,360
He knows just how to make me busy.

586
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,160
Why are you here in Demon Realm too?

587
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,160
Mr. Hu...

588
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,120
The past year...

589
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,000
has been a great memory.

590
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,920
Immortal,
you have a letter.

591
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,280
Immortal.

592
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,160
This was written by Jin Mi to you.

593
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,700
Jin Mi?

594
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,440
Little one!

595
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,520
Little deer,

596
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
morning.

597
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,120
Here.

598
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,970
Have a bit of grass.

599
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,170
This grass
is hard to find in this Demon Realm.

600
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,910
Don't just feed on dreams,

601
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,080
have some greens too.

602
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,360
Then, you'll be healthier.

603
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,480
Have some grass.
Grass.

604
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,320
Come on, come get it.

605
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,000
Here you go.

606
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,290
Jin Mi, don't force it.

607
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,970
Fish Fairy.

608
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,060
Jin Mi, you may not know...

609
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,180
but the Beast of Dreams
only feeds on dreams.

610
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,360
So, it can't eat grass.

611
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,550
Let it out at night,

612
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,930
and it'll go hunting for dreams.

613
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,990
Then it'll eat.

614
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,520
Only eats dreams?

615
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,100
I wonder if the dreams taste any good.

616
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,180
Is it sweet? Salty?

617
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,520
This Little one,

618
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,840
hit a jackpot and had...

619
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,200
pretty girls in his dreams.

620
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,450
But this dream...

621
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,330
why did it change at the end?

622
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,600
There are 2 types of dreams.

623
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,160
One is a blue dream from memory.

624
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,900
The other is a yellow dream of desire.

625
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,940
When people dream
of the things that had once happened,

626
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,600
then, the dream beads
will glow with a blue light.

627
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,410
Which is the blue coloured
dream of memory.

628
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,600
If it's a dream that has
never really happened,

629
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,870
but just imagination.

630
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,720
Then the dream bead
will let out a yellow glow.

631
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,630
Which is the yellow coloured
dream of desire.

632
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,510
People often dream
of reality at the very beginning...

633
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,890
of their dream.

634
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,270
But then...

635
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,020
it gradually fills with...

636
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,400
all sorts of imagination.

637
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,720
This dream will change from
a blue dream of memory...

638
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,720
to a yellow dream of desire.

639
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,660
It sounds super complex.

640
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
To put it simply,

641
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,350
can I say, that a
yellow dream is fake...

642
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,720
and a blue dream is real?

643
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,040
If it's both blue and yellow,

644
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,490
then it's half fake and half real.

645
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,910
That's right.

646
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,360
Jin Mi, you are correct.

647
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,880
Oh yes, breakfast is served.

648
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,990
Let's go eat.

649
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,760
Don't worry about me, you go ahead.
I'll be there in a bit.

650
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,730
All right, I'll be going first.

651
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,560
Little Beast of Dreams.

652
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,640
The dream you just spit out
was really meaningful.

653
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,890
Give me another, won't you?

654
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,000
Isn't that Phoenix?

655
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,760
This must be the erotic dream that...

656
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,240
Moon Immortal mentioned.

657
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,990
Fancy that!,

658
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,620
The rascal, Phoenix.

659
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,600
He always looks so serious.

660
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,800
Yet he has such erotic dream.

661
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,240
This girl...

662
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,240
Why does she look exactly like me?

663
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Tell me,

664
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,640
who's that woman
hugging the Fire Immortal?

665
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,970
Isn't this woman
the Demon Realm general?

666
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,670
I have no idea too.

667
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,970
I was just looking too.

668
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,320
With that whip of yours,

669
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,920
I couldn't see anything.

670
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,360
And who are you?

671
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,120
How dare you spy on the dreams
of the Supreme Immortal?

672
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,290
Me?

673
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,000
I am his highness
The Fire Immortal's maidservant.

674
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,740
The Fire Immortal,
where is he?

675
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,470
Come, come, I'll tell you.

676
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,650
He's eating right now.

677
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,850
Just go straight, turn left,
left and left again.

678
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,050
When you get there,
turn right and you'll see him.

679
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,230
Go on!

680
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,590
I got to find a good spot
to watch it unfold.

681
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,110
The food in Heaven Realm are bland,

682
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,400
After a long time, it feels dull.

683
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,920
Eating spicy and sweet food
once in a while...

684
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,220
is quite a pleasure.

685
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,040
Coming out from the Second Prince
who eats only fruits of bamboo,

686
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,720
only drinks from the purest spring,

687
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
that's rather interesting.

688
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,250
Cheers,

689
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,880
Fairy Jin Mi.

690
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,580
No one came to see you yet?
