None
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

None
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 47"

None
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,579
It seems you’re in good spirits today.

None
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,300
What brings you here, Moon Immortal?

None
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,460
I don’t want to

None
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,820
stay in Heaven Realm any more.

None
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,260
Ever since Run Yu became the Heavenly Emperor,

None
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,360
Heaven Realm is as deserted as the Xuanji Palace.

None
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,120
It’s the landscape here

None
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,290
still with the feeling of warmth.

None
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,600
Moreover, Yuan Ji has left.

None
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,140
Now I can talk to no one,

None
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,640
so I come here to divert myself.

None
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,260
Fairy Yuan Ji is in charge of the fates of human beings.

None
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,820
Where has she gone?

None
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,760
Experience hardships in Human Realm.

None
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,680
She goes to Human Realm to experience hardships

None
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,600
as a fairy in charge of the fates of human beings?

None
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,720
Does she observe the conditions of the people?

None
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,640
She is shrewd.

None
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,360
She won’t experience hardships herself.

None
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,360
It's Run Yu,

None
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,980
who is filled with hate.

None
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,720
He keeps thinking about what Xu Feng and Jin Mi

None
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,000
have experienced in Human Realm,

None
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,160
so he made an excuse

None
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,160
to send Yuan Ji in Human Realm too.

None
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,360
Now

None
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,560
nothing can stop him.

None
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,079
Well, has Jin Mi regained consciousness?

None
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,040
Don’t mention her.

None
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,220
She has come to herself,

None
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,920
so I don’t want to stay in Heaven Realm.

None
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:02,940
She has come to herself?

None
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,600
Why didn’t she summon me?

None
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,800
You still want to meet her?

None
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,760
Such a ungrateful one

None
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,900
should be hacked to death,

None
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,200
throw into Taihu Lake

None
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,400
and be eaten by the catfish.

None
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,200
I still don’t understand something.

None
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
It’s known to all that

None
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,880
she likes Xu Feng,

None
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,980
but at last…

None
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,600
Maybe

None
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,760
she has made a choice

None
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,440
between Xu Feng and Run Yu.

None
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,360
Could it be...

None
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:32,860
What?

None
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,420
The late Heavenly Emperor
destroyed his own primordial spirit,

None
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,660
but he was just poisoned
with the Evil Incense Ashes.

None
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,700
Why was he so cruel to himself?

None
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,459
He witnessed

None
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,240
his son died

None
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,120
and the other son seized the throne.

None
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,220
Maybe he was utterly dissipated.

None
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,460
He is to blame.

None
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,380
If he didn’t destroy his own primordial spirit,

None
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,980
he wouldn’t have come to this

None
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,159
as he was protected by the Phoenix Hairpin.

None
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,140
Strangely,

None
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,900
after that day,

None
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,159
Xu Feng’s Phoenix Hairpin was missing as well,

None
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,860
leaving no hope for me.

None
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,140
Run Yu is to blame.

None
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,020
You know what,

None
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,940
Run Yu is my brother.

None
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,500
Su Li

None
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,820
was my foster mother.

None
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,180
What?

None
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,380
I have suffered too many blows recently.

None
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,540
You…

None
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,280
You…

None
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,280
But I didn’t help him seize the throne.

None
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,600
I am different from him.

None
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,620
But I have known Jin Mi for long.

None
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,860
She stands to sense.

None
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,400
I saved her by accident back then,

None
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,420
and she insisted to return
the 1,000-thousnad-year magic power to me.

None
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,050
So I think

None
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,550
Xu Feng must have done something unforgettable.

None
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,260
I think

None
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,060
I shouldn’t stay here.

None
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,280
All the people in the world are blind.

None
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,680
I,

None
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,800
I’d better go to experience hardships
in Human Realm with Yuan Ji.

None
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,620
You’re old.

None
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,220
You should have a benignant look.

None
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,660
Jin Mi, I become an accomplice at last.

None
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,720
How can I face you now?

None
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
Hope I can

None
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,720
make it up to you in the future.

None
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,460
"Qiwu Palace"

None
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,860
Immortal.

None
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,740
Where are Liao Ting and Fei Xu?

None
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,500
Moon Immortal has summoned them.

None
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,320
Can we help you?

None
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:48,690
No need.

None
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,360
I just want to walk around.

None
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,260
I am putting on weight,

None
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,320
but I find other parts don’t grow fat,

None
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:22,400
except for this part.

None
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,920
Phoenix flower blooms in two seasons.

None
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,980
One brings fate,

None
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,159
and the other takes away fate.

None
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,360
People will part with each other eventually.

None
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,539
Blooms and dead flowers will fall without exception.

None
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,740
How could this happen?

None
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,040
Come to life.

None
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,940
Why are they dead?

None
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,160
Why?

None
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,480
Why are they dead?

None
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,560
Why are they dead?

None
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,640
Come to life.

None
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,600
Why are they dead?

None
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,660
Come to life.

None
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,400
How could this happen?

None
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,560
Why are they dead?

None
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,040
Jin Mi, what are you doing?

None
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,500
He killed your father.

None
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,680
He killed your father.

None
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,940
It’s really you.

None
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,860
How dare you come here?

None
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,860
Fox Fairy, I…

None
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,840
Stop that!

None
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,080
I tried hard to bring you and Xu Feng together,

None
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,420
but you took this opportunity to kill him.

None
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,680
He killed my father.

None
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,700
Impossible!

None
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,820
He is not a man of that sort.

None
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,340
I have known him since he was a little boy.

None
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,340
I know him well.

None
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,340
He wouldn’t do that.

None
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,760
I don’t want to believe it,

None
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,880
but it’s the truth.

None
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,460
My father was killed by Glazed Pure Fire.

None
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,220
Phoenix personally admitted that

None
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,880
the matter was related to him.

None
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,360
Moreover,

None
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,320
the dream of the Beast of Dreams can prove it.

None
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,760
I saw it personally.

None
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,320
Dream?

None
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,030
Just a dream?

None
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,460
It is Phoenix’s real dream.

None
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,280
He killed my father personally.

None
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,380
How can you make sure it’s real?

None
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,820
The real dream shows

None
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,860
what one sees in the daytime.

None
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,790
Seeing is believing.

None
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,120
How could it be false?

None
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,540
Seeing is not necessarily believing.

None
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,120
I don’t believe it,

None
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,820
because I just believe here.

None
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,920
Even if the Heavenly River flew backward,

None
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,240
Xu Feng would never be a murderer.

None
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,200
Why do you bring me here secretly?

None
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,180
Do you know

None
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,680
who entered the Qiwu Palace?

None
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,360
Who?

None
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,220
Jin Mi.

None
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,740
Jin Mi?

None
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,720
How shameless she is.

None
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,460
The Heavenly Emperor

None
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,480
took care of her all the time
when she was in a coma,

None
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,680
so we didn’t have any opportunity.

None
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,140
Now she has come to herself

None
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,500
and can go everywhere.

None
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,260
I think

None
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,480
it’s a good opportunity.

None
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,860
What do you mean?

None
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,160
The second Prince loved her dearly,

None
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,140
but she killed him in return.

None
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,300
The second Prince was nice to us.

None
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,420
We must avenge him,

None
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,540
or we will fail him.

None
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,840
What’s your plan?

None
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,100
Lead her to Linyuan Abyss and push her down.

None
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,320
No.

None
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,700
There are the spies of
the Heavenly Emperor everywhere.

None
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,740
It’s too noticeable.

None
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,840
I have an idea.

None
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,100
Shoot it.

None
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,200
First, we have to figure out

None
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,880
where the Internal Dan essence is in her body.

None
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,900
Then,

None
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,380
we pretend to forgive her

None
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,010
and ask her out to drink.

None
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,610
While talking about the old days,

None
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,640
make her drunk

None
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,280
and stab her Internal Dan essence.

None
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,600
Then she will die.

None
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,600
Good idea.

None
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,390
Let’s do it.

None
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,380
-Go.
-Go.

None
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,100
How do you figure out

None
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,300
where the Internal Dan essence is in her body?

None
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,980
Mister Immortal.

None
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,500
If I knew you wanted to court death,

None
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,760
I wouldn’t have saved you

None
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
and taken you to the House of Marriage.

None
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,460
If you really want to kill Jin Mi,

None
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,000
the Heavenly Emperor won’t spare you.

None
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,500
And I’ll also be implicated.

None
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,880
Mister Immortal, she killed the second Prince.

None
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,580
Yes.

None
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,540
If you kill her,

None
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,160
will Xu Feng come back to life?

None
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,820
When I met her just now,

None
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,940
I wanted to hack her to death.

None
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,980
But it’s useless.

None
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,840
Xu Feng won’t come back to life.

None
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,300
It’s a doomed love affair.

None
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,540
I shouldn’t have brought them together blindly.

None
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,220
Mister Immortal, we…

None
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,100
You’d better

None
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,620
go back to the House of Marriage.

None
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,150
You can’t hurt Jin Mi

None
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,610
just by yourselves.

None
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,140
Live a peaceful life from now one.

None
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,760
Don’t implicate me.

None
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,700
Yes.

None
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,620
As a man sows, let him reap.

None
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,960
No.

None
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,900
I haven't made a mistake.

None
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,420
No.

None
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
I like you.

None
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,940
I,

None
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,650
I like you as well.

None
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
Fish Fairy?

None
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,960
Kuang Lu?

None
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,280
Fish Fairy, let’s be together this life.

None
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,960
What do you think?

None
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,160
OK.

None
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,380
Don’t betray me.

None
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,600
Jin Mi.

None
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,800
Tjhe Yun Elixir really cracks.

None
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,880
Mi,

None
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:34,440
sorry.

None
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,099
Even if you don’t know what love is in this life,

None
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,760
I don’t want to lose you.

None
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,140
Forgive me, okay?

None
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,640
Fish Fairy. Mi.

None
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,660
Sorry.

None
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Fish Fairy,

None
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,980
I like you.

None
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,480
I like you as well.

None
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,840
Fish Fairy,

None
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,440
let’s be together this life.

None
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,320
What do you think?

None
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,160
I know it’s a dream,

None
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,800
but I don’t want to wake up.

None
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,840
Yun Elixir?

None
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,300
What’s it?

None
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,580
Is that the Yun Elixir?

None
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,160
Why is it in my body?

None
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,300
Why did Fish Fairy repair it without telling me?

None
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,280
The flowers have been
arranged properly in Human Realm.

None
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,680
Please do it for me.

None
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,680
No problem.

None
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,240
I’ll go to visit Jin Mi in Heaven Realm tomorrow.

None
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,000
I wonder how she is.

None
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,680
Chief Peony.

None
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,840
Chief Peony.

None
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,640
Little one…

None
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,100
Little one is back.

None
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,700
Jin Mi,

None
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,440
you have avenged Water Immortal

None
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,200
and Wind Immortal

None
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,680
and done your filial duty.

None
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,460
They don’t want to see you’re sad.

None
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,780
You should bestir yourself.

None
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,840
Chief Peony,

None
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,520
I come

None
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,160
to ask you something.

None
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,300
What’s it?

None
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,660
In front of my parents

None
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,020
and Auntie Lin Xiu,

None
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,100
please tell me the truth.

None
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,160
What’s the origin of Yun Elixir in my body?

None
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,080
How do you know about this?

None
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,320
I accidentally saw it from
the dream of the Beast of Dreams.

None
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,520
And I saw Run Yi repaired it.

None
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,720
Repair?

None
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,690
It’s gone.

None
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,400
How could this be?

None
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,980
Sure enough.

None
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,940
It’s really related to Yun Elixir.

None
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,040
After I stabbed Xu Feng to death that day,

None
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,640
I was heartbroken

None
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,580
and felt something exploded in my body.

None
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,500
Phoenix!

None
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,660
I thought I had such a feeling

None
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,460
because I hated him deeply.

None
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,920
Now it seems to be caused by Yun Elixir.

None
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,060
But why is Yun Elixir in my body?

None
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,820
Your mother gave it to you.

None
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,660
My mother?

None
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,900
She was lovesick

None
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,680
and suffered much when she was alive.

None
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,660
I love the Heavenly Emperor only.

None
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,320
Go back to marry Lin Xiu.

None
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,620
So when you were born,

None
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,560
she gave Yun Elixir to you.

None
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,080
The one who takes Yun Elixir won’t fall in love.

None
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,380
Without love, she will be strong

None
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,340
and live a carefree life.

None
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,440
This is the best blessing I can give her.

None
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,700
You won’t fall in love.

None
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,880
She hoped you could be strong

None
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,880
and live a carefree life.

None
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,880
It’s for your own good.

None
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,320
She didn’t want you to repeat her mistake.

None
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,060
Without love, I will be strong.

None
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,160
Why did she think that?

None
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,220
The current Heavenly Emperor

None
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,380
doesn’t have an amorous nature as his father.

None
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,360
We can see that

None
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,540
he loves you only.

None
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,010
You should cherish his love

None
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,020
and don’t fail him.

None
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,280
But I just

None
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,560
feel guilty for Fish Fairy.

None
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,140
You still miss Fire Immortal?

None
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,020
I don’t know.

None
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,940
I always miss him.

None
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,360
As long as I miss him,

None
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,700
I’ll feel pain in my heart

None
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,200
and guilty.

None
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,140
He killed my father.

None
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,240
I fail my father.

None
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,880
But,

None
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,460
but I can’t control myself.

None
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,220
As long as I close my eyes, he appears.

None
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,560
I…

None
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
The late lord didn’t want to see this,

None
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,960
so she gave Yun Elixir to you.

None
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,160
Since you have got rid of Yun Elixir,

None
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,740
you have to suffer.

None
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,440
Don’t think about rights and wrongs anymore.

None
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,040
Now you’re Water Immortal with mighty power.

None
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,440
The new Heavenly Emperor takes the throne
and enjoys a good reputation worldwide.

None
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,240
He stands high in popular favor.

None
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,520
You’ll become the new Heavenly Empress.

None
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,380
Everything will go smoothly,
and you’ll have a good life afterwards.

None
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,360
Mom,

None
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,160
thank you for being considerate to me.

None
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,360
But as my mom,

None
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,580
you can’t deprive me of the right to love.

None
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,640
I was controlled by Yun Elixir,

None
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,500
so I did many stupid things

None
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,980
as I was childish.

None
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,700
Now I have got rid of Yun Elixir,

None
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,740
so I can’t avoid love anymore.

None
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,370
"Linyuan Tower"

None
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,640
Get out.

None
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,320
I can rest my heart

None
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,360
as you lead a miserable life.

None
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,760
You killed my mother,

None
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,120
and your son killed my father.

None
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,220
I killed Xu Feng

None
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,060
to avenge my father.

None
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,320
Avenge?

None
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,260
For what?

None
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,860
You killed my son?

None
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,140
Yes.

None
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,280
Xu,

None
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,880
I told you repeatedly

None
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,900
to leave this woman alone,

None
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,040
but you didn’t listen to me

None
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,640
and asked me

None
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,600
whether I killed Luo Lin.

None
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,900
What did you say?

None
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,520
Did you ever fight against Water Immortal?

None
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,100
What’s wrong with him?

None
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,840
He and Wind Immortal were killed.

None
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,220
Did this have something to do with you?

None
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,300
Now Run Yu has lost his advantages.

None
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,720
He won’t shake your standing
for the Heavenly Emperor

None
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,240
even if he marries Jin Mi.

None
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,760
Even the prison can’t keep your ambition.

None
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,240
You thought you did these for me,

None
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,120
but you just put me in an immoral situation.

None
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,000
Impossible.

None
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,860
Son, how stupid you are.

None
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,200
I tried every means to plan and prepare

None
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,860
for you,

None
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,380
but you

None
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,320
trusted this woman.

None
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,660
I’m the most sincerest to you in this world.

None
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,780
If you listened to me,

None
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,180
you wouldn’t be killed by her.

None
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,460
I didn’t…

None
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,060
I didn’t kill him by mistake.

None
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,400
Tell me.

None
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,660
If Xu Feng didn’t kill my father,

None
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,420
then who killed my father?

None
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,920
It’s me.

None
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,360
Impossible.

None
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,120
When my father died,

None
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,900
you were in prison.

None
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,120
You couldn’t kill him.

None
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,060
The murderer must be someone else.

None
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,480
Who is the murderer?

None
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,700
Tell me.

None
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,820
Listen.

None
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,240
You will never know.

None
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,080
I won’t tell you.

None
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,580
Moon Immortal.

None
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,040
Liao Ting, Fei Xu,

None
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,080
drive her out.

None
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,120
I may kill Phoenix by mistake.

None
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,940
You want to reverse the case?

None
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,280
You have wronged one.

None
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,860
Don’t wrong anyone else.

None
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,760
I know

None
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,600
you hate me.

None
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,560
I know you all hate me.

None
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,060
Don’t worry.

None
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,620
If I find out the truth

None
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,220
and really killed Phoenix by mistake,

None
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,120
I’ll kill myself.

None
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,220
It’s useless.

None
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,300
If

None
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,700
I really killed Phoenix by mistake,

None
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,080
I don’t want to live alone.

None
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,580
Even if you die,

None
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,560
Xu Feng won’t come back to life.

None
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,940
But,

None
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,260
but Xu Feng can’t be wronged.

None
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,340
"Pixiang Hall"
Hurry up. The guards will wake up soon.

None
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,940
Mi, have you found it?

None
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,180
Not yet.

None
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,800
Where did you find it last time?

None
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,960
Right there.

None
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,180
Why can’t we find it?

None
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,060
We can’t give up.

None
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,120
Go on.

None
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,600
Look for it separately.

None
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,180
The ward.

None
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,600
It’s sealed.

None
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,100
It’s strange.

None
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,000
Let me help you.

None
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,900
How could this be possible?

None
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,240
How could this be possible?

None
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,680
The Beast of Dreams didn’t go to the Qiwu Palace.

None
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,000
It stayed in my room.

None
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,550
How could this be possible?

None
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,670
It’s impossible.

None
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,120
Jin Mi,

None
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,620
what you have seen

None
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,060
is your own dream.

None
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,640
No.

None
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,020
You suspected Xu Feng.

None
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,360
You dreamed of what you though
in the day at night,

None
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,080
so you had such a dream.

None
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,500
Impossible.

None
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,900
It’s different from what I saw before.

None
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,820
It’s fake.

None
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,820
It must be fake.

None
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,560
The authenticity of the Dream Register
remains to be verified.

None
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,180
No matter whether it tells the truth,

None
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,060
someone must cause trouble.

None
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,400
The blue one is a real dream.

None
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,340
The blue dream is real.

None
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,240
I…

None
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,560
I didn’t witness my father’s death.

None
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,500
So it’s not my dream.

None
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,140
If it’s my dream,

None
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,300
I must have an impression.

None
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,500
Impossible.

None
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,560
It’s not my dream.

None
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,400
Impossible!

None
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:09,980
Jin Mi,

None
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,680
Maybe someone

None
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,280
did something to the dream on purpose.

None
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,260
Phoenix.

None
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,860
I really wronged Phoenix?

None
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,980
I killed him by mistake.

None
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:44,960
Mi.

None
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,240
-Immortal.
-Immortal.

None
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,040
Immortal.

None
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,460
Immortal.

None
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,560
Immortal, you’re finally back.

None
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,880
Where have you been?

None
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,800
His Majesty is worried about you.

None
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,980
Where is he?

None
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,380
In the Qizheng Hall.

None
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,420
Mi, I don’t see you all day.

None
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
I’m quite worried about you.

None
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,400
You just came to yourself,

None
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,730
so you should have a good rest to recuperate.

None
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,940
Before you recover completely,

None
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,320
please don’t go around.

None
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,520
If you really want to go out,

None
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,040
take Kuang Lu with you.

None
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,040
With her company,

None
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,400
I can feel at ease.

None
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
I’m afraid

None
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,680
I really wronged Xu Feng.

None
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,660
Why did you say that?

None
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,220
After my father was killed,

None
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,440
I saw a dream from the Beast of Dreams.

None
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,380
It was about Phoenix killing my father.

None
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,320
I thought it was Phoenix’s real dream,

None
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,940
but today

None
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,640
I went to Pixiang Hall with Moon Immortal

None
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,860
and found the record of the Beast of Dreams

None
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,220
about that day.

None
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,820
Then I found that

None
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,120
the Beast of Dreams didn’t go to the Qiwu Palace.

None
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,120
Instead, it stayed with me.

None
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,740
Your Majesty,

None
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,720
It wasn’t Xu Feng’s dream.

None
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,300
It was my dream,

None
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,420
but I didn’t see personally Phoenix killed my father.

None
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,220
If I had that dream because I had a doubt,

None
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,400
it should be a yellow imaginary dream.

None
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,600
But I remember clearly

None
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,520
I saw the blue real dream

None
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,520
that day.

None
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,280
So,

None
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,760
so

None
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,200
someone must have done something to that dream

None
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,720
and turned the imaginary dream

None
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,080
into the real dream.

None
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,880
Who do you think did it?

None
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,720
You led

None
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,500
the Beast of Dreams there that day.

None
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:22,920
Mi,

None
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,540
to investigate the case of
the late Water Immortal’s death,

None
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,920
I collected thousands of dreams.

None
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,560
Before I checked them one by one,

None
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,700
my father took them away and sealed them.

None
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,120
I really didn’t see the dream you mentioned.

None
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,360
The Chief of the Pixiang Hall

None
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,900
is responsible for the files of Heaven Realm.

None
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,620
He should have an impression

None
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,760
whether it’s a yellow imaginary dream

None
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,140
or a blue real dream.

None
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,140
OK.

None
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,300
I’ll call in him

None
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,140
and ask him about it.

None
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,800
"Qizheng Hall"

None
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,620
Your Majesty,

None
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,640
the Pixiang Hall reports that

None
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,120
the chief committed suicide.

None
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,140
Your Majesty.

None
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,760
Your Majesty.

None
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,160
Why are you scared?

None
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,940
I saw Water Immortal

None
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,680
wasn’t her usual self today,

None
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,360
so I followed her secretly.

None
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,960
I found that

None
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,900
she and Moon Immortal

None
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,520
slipped into the Pixiang Hall secretly.

None
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,080
The Chief of the Pixiang Hall must die.

None
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,640
"Pixiang Hall"

None
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,360
Your Majesty.

None
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,300
Why did he commit suicide?

None
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,480
Your Majesty,

None
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,100
this is a suicide note we just found.

None
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,860
In the note, he confessed

None
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,740
he changed the file without authorization.

None
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,660
So he suicides for fear of punishment.

None
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,500
Have you compared the handwriting?

None
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,120
Yes, I did.

None
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,420
It was really written by him.

None
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,100
Since he committed suicide for fear of punishment,

None
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,820
why did he take the trouble to

None
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,900
write this note?
