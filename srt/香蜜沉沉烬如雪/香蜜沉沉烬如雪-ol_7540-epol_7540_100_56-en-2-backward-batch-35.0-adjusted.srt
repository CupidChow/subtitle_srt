1
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 56"

3
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,140
You are really here, my Lord.

4
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,840
What’s up?

5
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,060
After the things that happened
at the Cave of Jiu Ying,

6
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,340
you have been avoiding meeting me.

7
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,040
I’m afraid that

8
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,740
you would believe what Jin Mi said again

9
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:07,640
and misunderstand me.

10
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,800
She fooled me several times.

11
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,920
How is it possible that I would believe her again?

12
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,940
In these days,

13
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,579
I have been very busy with
the affairs of Demon Realm.

14
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,400
I didn’t avoid meeting you.

15
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,840
Don’t worry.

16
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,160
Xu Feng,

17
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,360
if Heavenly Emperor hadn’t come

18
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,120
would you kill Jin Mi?

19
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,180
Definitely.

20
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,920
That's good.

21
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,060
Would I really kill her?

22
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,840
The medicine soup of Floral Realm is really nutritious.

23
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,900
Within two days,

24
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,860
my magic power will be recovered.

25
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,100
Yan You.

26
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,400
I was wondering who it was.

27
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,200
It turns out to be you, little Lian Qiao.

28
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,280
I am sorry.

29
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,220
I am here to give you the medicine.

30
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,100
I didn’t peek at you when you were bathing.

31
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,520
You didn’t?

32
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,900
Why is your face burning like this?

33
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,180
My face is always like this.

34
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,860
Your medicine soup has been spilled.

35
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,460
How can I drink it?

36
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,700
I’ll cook one more bowl of medicine soup for you.

37
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,360
Why is my face so hot?

38
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,959
My heart is beating so fast.

39
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,300
Have I got a weird disease?

40
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,460
Your Highness.

41
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,140
Mu Ci.

42
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,520
Your Highness.

43
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,100
I know

44
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,760
you have always been fond of Liu Ying.

45
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,240
You can even sacrifice your life for her.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,120
So

47
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,680
you will definitely make Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,740
Right?

49
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,780
Let go of her.

50
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,020
When you make Spirit-Vanishing Arrow successfully,

51
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,440
I will naturally let you go.

52
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,560
No way.

53
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,160
I’m wondering

54
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,880
how many stabs Princess of Bian City can bear?

55
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,720
Your Highness.

56
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,580
Don't promise him.

57
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,060
Your Highness.

58
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,260
No.

59
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,640
I’ll make it.

60
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,300
I’ll make it.

61
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,220
That’s good.

62
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,640
When you make Spirit-Vanishing Arrow successfully,

63
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,500
I will let you go.

64
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,160
My Lord.

65
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,460
Mu Ci’ s magic power is so weak

66
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,420
that he can’t even see through my shape-shift magic.

67
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,300
Can he make Spirit-Vanishing Arrow successfully?

68
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,900
Liu Ying

69
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,380
is his weakness.

70
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,280
I believe he will make Spirit-Vanishing Arrow

71
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,380
even if he may die for it.

72
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,920
My Lord, Water Immortal wants to meet you.

73
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,140
Please punish me, my Lord.

74
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,940
You are not to blame.

75
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,720
Even I have to regard Water Immortal

76
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,600
with reverence.

77
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,400
You may go.

78
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,480
Yes, my Lord.

79
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:56,740
What?

80
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,220
Water Immortal, are you blaming me

81
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,360
for not having given you a hearty welcome?

82
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,420
So you disdain to talk to me.

83
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,040
Xu Feng.

84
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,640
Water Immortal, you are so brave.

85
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,240
You came here on your own.

86
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,600
And you addressed me disrespectfully by name.

87
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,140
Aren’t you afraid that you may be unable to go back?

88
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,060
Or

89
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,540
you bet I don't dare to kill you?

90
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,160
I was wrong, phoenix.

91
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,560
I’m sorry.

92
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,240
I know that I was wrong.

93
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,520
You didn’t kill my dad.

94
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,460
I got you wrong.

95
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,880
Sorry, phoenix.

96
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,980
Could you let me explain?

97
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,080
Dreams about what one saw.

98
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,960
I went to the Pixiang Hall.

99
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,160
I went there to check the documents

100
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,520
about the dreams eaten records of Beast of Dreams.

101
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,420
But when I got there,

102
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,620
I saw your dream about what you saw.

103
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,200
That dream is about what
happened on the day my dad died.

104
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,160
At that time, all the evidences,

105
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,520
All the evidences showed that you were the murderer.

106
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,180
I had no choice but to believe it, phoenix.

107
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,540
Half an year later, when I woke up,

108
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,060
I found that someone had cheated in those evidences.

109
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,160
So I realized that I had done you wrong.

110
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,020
But it was too late at the time.

111
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,480
Phoenix,

112
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
I’m sorry.

113
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,100
I’m really sorry.

114
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,220
What a nice play!

115
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,820
Last time,

116
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,860
You teamed up with Run Yu,

117
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,300
killing me by using only a strand of hair

118
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,800
and gaining a complete victory.

119
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Now I just become Demon Lord.

120
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,360
And you appear and play the same trick again.

121
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,120
Do you two really think I’m so stupid

122
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,620
that I would fall in the same place twice?

123
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
Phoenix,

124
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,180
let me explain.

125
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,900
OK. I won’t touch you.

126
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,980
But please believe me.

127
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,560
It’s not true. You got me wrong.

128
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,000
It’s Sui He.

129
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,220
Sui He can use Glazed Pure Fire.

130
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,020
Do you know this?

131
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,640
She can use Glazed Pure Fire.

132
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,340
You are lying.

133
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,500
No, I’m not.

134
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,580
To make your arguments convincing,
you have to speak on good grounds.

135
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,640
You stabbed me in the back.

136
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,480
But now you are claiming
that it’s someone else’ s fault.

137
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,540
It’s really a good play.

138
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,560
Lord Puchi is the witness.

139
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,160
Lord Puchi is the witness.

140
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,000
I went to take the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying

141
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,540
for Lord Puchi.

142
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,340
He was injured because of Sui He.

143
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,160
It was Sui He who hurt him with Glazed Pure Fire.

144
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,760
Do you know about this, phoenix?

145
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,860
Could you listen to me?

146
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,940
Could you believe me?

147
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,680
Phoenix, I beg you.

148
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,500
Please believe me. OK?

149
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,240
When I was dying,

150
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,260
It’s Sui He who saved me.

151
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,640
When I had nothing to my name,

152
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,100
it’s Sui He who accompanied me.

153
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,500
In terms of viciousness,

154
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,040
Sui He cannot compare with you.

155
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,700
I know.

156
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,300
I know.

157
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,680
I was wrong.

158
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,460
I was wrong.

159
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,780
I’m sorry, phoenix.

160
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,380
But,

161
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,500
but I am willing to bear

162
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,920
all the retributions.

163
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,760
I just want to tell you

164
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,500
that Sui He is not the kind of person you think.

165
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,520
She is not the kind of person she appears to be.

166
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,620
She admitted to me

167
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,540
that she killed my dad

168
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,340
and shifted the blame on you.

169
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,660
She is the culprit.

170
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,600
She’s wicked.

171
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,100
She is not the kind of person she appears to be.

172
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,460
Phoenix, please believe me.

173
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,620
Thank you for reminding me, Water Immortal.

174
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,620
If without the comparison today,

175
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,260
I wouldn’t realize

176
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,940
how precious Sui He is to me.

177
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Get out of here,

178
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,860
before I change my mind.

179
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,540
I’m really afraid that I can’t help

180
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,320
but kill you.

181
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,400
Phoenix.

182
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,320
Phoenix.

183
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,060
With a pot of wine

184
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,300
and dust all over mu body

185
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,500
As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.

186
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,260
Ying.

187
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,640
Father.

188
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,200
Have you found him?

189
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,760
I searched the whole Demon Realm,

190
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,200
but I couldn’t find him.

191
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,360
Maybe he is still worried

192
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,900
that he would be a burden for you.

193
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,620
But

194
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,980
we agreed that we would get married
on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month.

195
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,840
He wouldn’t leave without saying goodbye.

196
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,760
Getting married?

197
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,360
How could you hide this from me?

198
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,520
We made this decision hastily.

199
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,580
It’s my fault that I didn’t tell you before.

200
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,540
Spirit-Vanishing Family hasn’t got its due justice.

201
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,200
Mu Ci is weak.

202
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,080
Originally we just wanted you and Xu Feng

203
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,200
as the witnesses on our wedding.

204
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,540
I just want to stay with him peacefully
for the rest several years.

205
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,840
You are really getting more and more independent.

206
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,940
How do you know that
I will agree with you on this matter?

207
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,520
I know you, father.

208
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,260
Let's go.

209
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,940
I’m going to look for him with you.

210
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,000
The sixth day of the sixth lunar month

211
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,740
You can’t defeat me nor kill me.

212
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,240
You must be very angry. Right?

213
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,600
It’s not strange.

214
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,840
Xu Feng doesn’t want you anymore.

215
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,980
Now he just believes me.

216
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,160
Feeling pain, right?

217
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,660
Blame yourself.

218
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,220
You were engaged with Run Yu.

219
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,620
But you still came to hang around Xu Feng.

220
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,360
So I had to find a way to separate you two.

221
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,140
Such being the case,

222
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,520
the one who caused your dad’s death

223
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,260
is you.

224
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,520
What?

225
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,520
You want to fight in the Yujiang Palace?

226
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,780
Okay.

227
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,780
Go ahead.

228
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,680
Kill me.

229
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,920
And let Xu Feng save me again.

230
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,600
I’m wondering if you can make him love you again.

231
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,240
It seems that you won’t get satisfied.

232
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,120
I’m here not to kill you.

233
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,180
I’m here to tell you

234
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,420
I will tell everyone the truth

235
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,320
that you are the murderer

236
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,620
and let you clear Xu Feng’ s name.

237
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,360
I won't let you stay with Xu Feng

238
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,540
and hurt him.

239
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,800
Hurt him?

240
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,880
I’m telling you,

241
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,220
it’s the thing that I will never do.

242
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,560
This is where we are different.

243
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,260
For Xu Feng,

244
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,660
I can sacrifice everything

245
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,280
including myself.

246
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,000
But you,

247
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,900
when others play a little trick,

248
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,200
you would kill him.

249
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,300
You don’t deserve him at all.

250
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,319
Mu Ci,

251
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:50,020
you will definitely come
on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month.

252
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,560
Right?

253
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,320
Your Highness,

254
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,640
I’ll keep our appointment

255
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,840
on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month.

256
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,060
Little one,

257
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,260
you have been sitting here for one day.

258
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,040
What happened to you?

259
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,060
Sui He is right.

260
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,660
I’m to blame.

261
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,020
Because of me, my dad

262
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,380
and auntie Lin Xiu died.

263
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,320
And I killed Xu Feng mistakenly.

264
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,560
I don't deserve his love at all.

265
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,060
What are you talking about?

266
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,980
The one who is sinful

267
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,580
is the person who killed
Wind Immortal and Water Immortal.

268
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,000
It has nothing to do with you.

269
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,740
I was wrong in that I didn’t believe him.

270
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,000
And he

271
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,140
will never believe me again.

272
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,620
Little one.

273
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,740
Oh no.

274
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,900
The flowers of our Floral Realm are all gone.

275
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,040
How?

276
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,200
Spring Flowers and Autumn Fruits.

277
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,380
Has he figured it out ?

278
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,180
Jin Mi.

279
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,960
Little one.

280
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,640
-Jin Mi.
-Little one.

281
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,140
Where are you going?

282
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,440
Xu Feng.

283
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,120
Is this gift

284
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,340
beautiful?

285
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,780
Yes, it is.

286
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,420
I have never expected that

287
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,780
the beautiful scenery would appear in Demon Realm.

288
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,080
I can't believe my eyes.

289
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,500
Because of the affairs of Demon Realm

290
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,200
I have neglected you these days.

291
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,300
This gift is a compensation for you.

292
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,300
Xu Feng,

293
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,220
you are very considerate.

294
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,100
Here you are.

295
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,860
What’s its name?

296
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,020
It’s so beautiful.

297
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,320
Phoenix flower.

298
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,720
Phoenix flower?

299
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,740
Phoenix,

300
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,100
I’ll give you one piece of my real body,

301
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,420
offering you a moment of
spring flowers and autumn fruits.

302
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,860
I made a little gadget

303
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,440
for you.

304
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,620
What is it?

305
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,380
It is called Spring Flowers and Autumn Fruits.

306
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,720
Put it in your heart,

307
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,360
use magic power to motivate it,

308
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,760
and you will be able to create a beautiful scenery
of spring flowers and autumn fruits.

309
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,140
It’s uneatable.

310
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,140
And it can’t be used as a weapon.

311
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,420
It’s useless.

312
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,440
You are right.

313
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,440
OK.

314
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,360
Then I’ll take it back and turn it into a weapon.

315
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,460
I’ll put it in my soul.

316
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,760
And I promise I will take good care of it.

317
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,040
Jin Mi.

318
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
The scenery of blossom in the spring
and yield in the autumn is really very beautiful.

319
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,360
Sorry to have bothered you

320
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,720
to rack your brains to earn my affection and trust

321
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,640
in order to help Run Yu become Heavenly Emperor.

322
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,320
Xu Feng,

323
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,380
you are the sun in summer,

324
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,120
and I’m am the frost and snow in winter.

325
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,040
But now

326
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,640
is it really impossible to
make the four season complete?

327
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,500
Do like this scenery?

328
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,900
Sui He,

329
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,040
the 15th day of next lunar month is an auspicious day.

330
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,920
Let's hold our wedding on that day.

331
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,800
Are you serious?

332
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,180
Xu Feng, do you know that

333
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,660
this is one piece of my real body?

334
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,300
Do you know that

335
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,100
this woman killed my father?

336
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,540
From the love letter,

337
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,180
I find the places
where we will meet in each life.</i>

338
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,100
I will wait for you there

339
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,740
to enjoy the sunset together.

340
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,540
From the love letter,

341
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,260
I find the places
where we will fall in love in each life.</i>

342
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,600
The gift given by you

343
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,900
is really extraordinary.

344
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,760
I have made the best use of it.

345
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,220
Now I should give it back to you.

346
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,860
I plant a red lotus

347
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,980
to make the days filled with fragrance.

348
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,420
From the love letter,

349
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,220
I find the places
where we will fall in love in each life.</i>

350
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,060
I will sing there,

351
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,980
playing the moonlight.

352
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,760
Phoenix,

353
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,660
I do love you.

354
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,260
I love you.

355
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
I remember very clearly

356
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,460
the two words you gave me

357
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,620
when I was dying

358
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,220
—never ever.

359
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,340
I have always regarded
these two words as a golden rule.

360
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,460
I bear them in my mind firmly.

361
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,440
I don’t dare to

362
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,440
to forget them.

363
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,440
Because I ate Yun Elixir,

364
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,480
Since my childhood,

365
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,880
I had always been immune from romantic love.

366
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,600
At that time, I didn't know

367
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,880
anything about love.

368
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,320
Yun Elixir.

369
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,540
This object you make up sounds very unique.

370
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,940
From now on,

371
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,340
if you say again that you love me,

372
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,220
I will kill you immediately.

373
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,560
I will cut a slice of you

374
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,980
every time you say it.

375
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,380
Unwilling to get involved in troubles,

376
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,740
but things go contrary to the wish.

377
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,180
The flower in my heart has withered.

378
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,700
Time can’t go back.

379
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,260
The memory haunts me,

380
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,540
making me grieved.

381
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,580
I only wish I would never regret in the rest of my life.

382
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,740
Fly away along with the flower aroma.

383
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,300
With a pot of wine

384
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,020
and dust all over my body

385
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,120
As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.

386
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:30,640
People come and go in my life
despite the vanity and right and wrong.</i>

387
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,760
I will get drunk again when flowers bloom.

388
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,380
Unwilling to get involved in troubles,

389
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,780
but things go contrary to the wish.

390
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,940
The flower in my heart has withered.

391
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,820
Time can’t go back.

392
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,620
The memory haunts me,

393
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,380
making me grieved.

394
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,300
I only wish I would never regret in the rest of my life.

395
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,940
Fly away along with the flower aroma.

396
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,200
It turns out to be an awesome weapon.

397
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,160
It can’t hurt others.

398
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520
But it can hurt myself

399
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,600
with only one blow.

400
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,960
As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.

401
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:55,180
People come and go in my life
despite the vanity and right and wrong.</i>

402
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,720
I will get drunk again when flowers bloom.

403
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,800
I hope that time of all lives won’t wither again.

404
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,420
Mi.

405
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,340
Mi.

406
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,440
I know that you are very upset.

407
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,280
You can't forget him.

408
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,920
But Mi,

409
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,360
you two can't be together again.

410
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,180
Don't go to see him anymore.

411
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,000
Let go of him.

412
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,660
And let go of yourself.

413
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,400
Okay?

414
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,580
I have no right to try to persuade you.

415
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,240
I’m just like you.

416
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,840
We two are idiots.

417
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,020
Where am I?

418
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,200
Who...

419
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,300
Who am I?

420
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,540
The sixth day of the sixth lunar month...

421
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,000
Who am I?

422
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,720
Who is she?

423
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,400
How is it going?

424
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,340
My Lord.

425
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,780
It seems that Mu Ci is dying.

426
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,160
I think his magic power has been exhausted.

427
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,120
Then give him some power

428
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,420
and let him continue making the arrow.

429
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,840
If you can’t make Spirit-Vanishing Arrow,

430
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,820
your Liu Ying

431
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,060
will be killed like this.

432
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,940
Liu Ying.

433
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,000
Liu Ying.

434
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,000
Mu Ci,

435
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,660
where are you exactly?

436
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,520
You promised me

437
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,560
that you would let me accompany you
to the end of your life.

438
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,280
Where are you?

439
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,320
Nether Fury.

440
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,260
How come?

441
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,000
Mu Ci,

442
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,780
where are you?

443
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,800
What are you doing?

444
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:30,060
Congratulations, Your Highness,
for you are going to become Demon Empress.

445
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
You all may get up off your knees.

446
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,120
Thanks, Your Highness.

447
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,660
The wedding day is coming soon.

448
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,200
I have to bother you a lot.

449
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,140
Please be sure to make
the wedding a grand event.

450
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,220
I won’t treat you badly.

451
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,560
Yes, Your Highness.

452
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,280
The wedding of me and my Lord

453
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,840
is a joyous event happening
once in a blue moon in Demon Realm.

454
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,680
Proclaim this news to the public

455
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,600
especially to Heaven Realm and Floral Realm.

456
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,640
Yes, Your Highness.

457
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,840
You may go.

458
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,520
Yes, Your Highness.

459
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,760
Water Immortal got injured badly.

460
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,820
With me being here,

461
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,540
she will be fine.

462
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,660
Your Majesty,

463
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,840
you just care about Water Immortal.

464
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,900
Have you ever cared about yourself?

465
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,300
You can get hurt.

466
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,020
Your heart may ache.

467
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,679
My heart

468
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:42,719
has already been given to her.

469
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,440
So it can’t ache anymore.

470
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,840
Your Majesty, if one day

471
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,860
your magic power is exhausted,

472
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,020
who

473
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:53,440
will feel sorry for you?

474
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,760
As long as I can stand behind her,

475
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,239
watch her,

476
00:33:57,699 --> 00:33:58,639
and protect her,

477
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,139
I will feel satisfied

478
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,219
even if my magic power is exhausted.

479
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,400
Maybe

480
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,500
she will change her mind.

481
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,880
I’m sorry,

482
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,780
Fish Fairy.

483
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,300
How come these flowers reappear?

484
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,180
Mr. Hu shouldn’t

485
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,360
have made a fuss over nothing

486
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,560
and bothered Chief Peony.

487
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,120
Yan You.

488
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,040
Yan You.

489
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,580
Where is he?

490
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,820
It can’t be that he has left as he has
almost recovered completely, can it?

491
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,880
It’s Jin Mi's book.

492
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,620
According to this book,

493
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,860
if one blushes and his or her heart beats fast,

494
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,960
he or she must start to understand love.

495
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,560
Why is my face so hot?

496
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,340
Why is my heart beating so fast?

497
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,720
Jin Mi has gone back to Heaven Realm again.

498
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,640
And Mr. Hu has been nowhere in sight these days.

499
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,680
Now Yan You is also gone.

500
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,080
I don’t have anyone to talk to.

501
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,000
Who can remove my confusion?

502
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,400
Little Lian Qiao, what’s your confusion?

503
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,000
Tell me about it.

504
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,940
Let’s see if I can help you.

505
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,920
It turns out that you like reading this book, too.

506
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,200
So your confusion

507
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,920
must be about romantic love. Right?

508
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,320
Don't be shy.

509
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,960
About romantic love,

510
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,000
I know a lot.

511
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,220
If you have any confusion, let me know.

512
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,820
Not me.

513
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,300
It’s my friend

514
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,940
Every time she sees a man,

515
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,540
she blushes and her heart beats fast.

516
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,860
But she’s very happy.

517
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,140
When she can’t see him,

518
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,340
she misses him.

519
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,800
According to what is mentioned in this book,

520
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
does she start to understand love?

521
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,180
That's right.

522
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,220
Your friend has started to understand love.

523
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,540
Then what should she do?

524
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,640
What?

525
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,000
She should express her affection to him.

526
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,500
Express her affection to him?

527
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:02,920
Yes.

528
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,340
You see, if you like a person,

529
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,640
you must want to stay with him every day. Right?

530
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,240
So you have to be brave
and express your affection to him.

531
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,400
Let me tell you.

532
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,840
Your friend is a girl.

533
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,340
If a girl takes the initiative to express
her affection to the person she likes,

534
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,740
she will be most likely to succeed.

535
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,000
Really?

536
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:18,820
Of course.

537
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,000
I like you.

538
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,160
Well,

539
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,200
I know that I’m very charming.

540
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,360
But you shouldn’t like me.

541
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,700
Why not?

542
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,820
Because

543
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,600
I...

544
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,020
I don’t like you.

545
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,920
But you said

546
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,520
if a girl takes the initiative to express
her affection to the person she likes,

547
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,380
she will be most likely to succeed.

548
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,420
That’s true.

549
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,920
But there are still a few chances

550
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,460
of failure.

551
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,780
We don’t match each other.

552
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,180
You should forget me as early as possible.

553
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,420
I have something at hand.

554
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,220
I’ve got to go now.

555
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,260
See you. See you.

556
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,800
I just came back from the hardship experience.

557
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,140
Could you please hurry up?

558
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,420
At your rate,

559
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,740
we can’t finish this game within three days.

560
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,360
Give me some more time to think about it.

561
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,140
When I decide where this piece I should place,

562
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,420
maybe I will be on my way to win this game.

563
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,920
You said this two hours ago.

564
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,080
Today I must be out of my mind so that

565
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,560
I would agree to play this game with you.

566
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,100
Mister Immortal,

567
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,500
here is the wedding invitation
card from Demon Realm.

568
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,480
Is it the Demon Lord’s wedding invitation card?

569
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,700
Xu Feng is not clear-minded.

570
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,200
He’s going to marry Sui He. Shocking!

571
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,020
I’m not in the mood to play it now.

572
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,400
It seems that there will be
a big disaster in the six realms.

573
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,660
What do you mean?

574
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,960
I can’t tell you. I can’t tell you.

575
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,080
Yuan Ji,

576
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,160
we are close friends.

577
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,680
You can tell me everything.

578
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,500
Tell me about it.

579
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,220
This is beyond our control.

580
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,100
Everything has been doomed.

581
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,540
We can’t stop it.
