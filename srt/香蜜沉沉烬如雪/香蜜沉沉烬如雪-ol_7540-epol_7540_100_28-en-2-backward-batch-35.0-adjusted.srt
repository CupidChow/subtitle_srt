"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 28"

3
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,800
Great! Great!

4
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,760
Well said!

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,960
Well said!

6
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,040
Right at that moment,

7
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,800
leader of the enemy
came to the front of King Yi.

8
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,800
They both held long swords
and rushed to each other…

9
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,560
Wrong.

10
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,320
Yes. Back then, King Yi

11
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,360
was really trapped

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,640
and besieged by the enemy,

13
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,800
being in a very dangerous situation.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,079
However, King Yi showed no fear on his face

15
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:14,240
but upheld his sword and rushed to the enemy

16
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,680
to defeat them greatly.

17
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,079
King Yi escaped from the siege at last.

18
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,240
As the saying goes,

19
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,320
destroy the leader and the gang will collapse.

20
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,320
King Yi stretched out his sword

21
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,720
and beat away the long spear
in hands of the leader of the enemy.

22
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,640
Before the leader of the enemy realized it,

23
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,560
King Yi had placed his sword

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,400
around his neck.

25
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,600
Great! Great! Great!

26
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,360
Lady,

27
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,920
are you the story teller?

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,640
You want to replace my job?

29
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,760
I just feel that

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,680
what you said was not the truth,

31
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,440
so I said something.

32
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,240
I’m sorry. You go on. Go on.

33
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,800
Sorry. Please go on. Go on.

34
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,720
Go. Go.

35
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,480
Let’s go. Let’s go.

36
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,560
Jin Mi,

37
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,600
how come you know a lot about King Yi?

38
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,480
Well,

39
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,840
when I acted with him a few days ago,

40
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,240
I heard Qin Tong telling
these stories on the battlefield.

41
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,480
Then I remember them.

42
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,000
How about later?

43
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,880
What happened after you were besieged by them?

44
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,920
Water.

45
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,760
Your Majesty, I have something to report.

46
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,839
You can leave.

47
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,040
Your Majesty,

48
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,839
you haven’t told me the later stories.

49
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,920
Our play of pretending sick

50
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,320
won’t end in a day.

51
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,720
You can come here tomorrow.

52
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,680
It’s not urgent.

53
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,040
It’s to be continued.

54
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,720
All right. I’m leaving now.

55
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:17,960
Saint Girl, you are finally back.

56
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,159
Please go

57
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,800
to see His Majesty with me now.

58
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,760
His Majesty?

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,960
What’s wrong with him?

60
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,280
You can learn it after you go to see him.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,680
Please.

62
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,360
His Majesty invites Saint Girl only.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,500
"Peace reigns over the land"

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,120
Your Majesty, what happened?

65
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,960
Come to take a seat.

66
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Sit here.

67
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,200
You like to make Phoenix Lantern, right?

68
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,880
We can make one today.

69
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,000
But I don’t know how to make it.

70
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,520
I know. You can help me.

71
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,320
Are you OK? I’m fine.

72
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,370
"Beiyuan Villa"

73
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Your Majesty, I hinder you.

74
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,360
You are clear about this.

75
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,320
But its look is not so bad.

76
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,400
This is the Phoenix Lantern we make together.

77
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,520
Can I keep it?

78
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,520
Sure.

79
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,520
Don’t give me such an ugly lantern.

80
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,360
I won’t give you this lantern.

81
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,000
But, follow me.

82
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,880
Wind blows gently.

83
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,960
Separated heaven and earth are far from each other.

84
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,280
But so what?

85
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,000
<i>Moonlight links the missing.</i>

86
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,480
<i>Write a love letter as the starting.</i>

87
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,280
<i>A paragraph for ten thousands years
and one line for a thousand years.</i>

88
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,320
<i>A thousand years…</i>

89
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,120
These Phoenix Lanterns are all the gifts for you.

90
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,160
Do you like them?

91
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,000
<i>From the love letter, </i>

92
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,920
<i>I find the places we will meet in each life.</i>

93
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,840
<i>I will be there...</i>

94
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,920
They were made by me when I first learned how to make it.

95
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,040
I wanted to throw these ugly lanterns away.

96
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,480
You made all of them?

97
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,880
<i>I will sing there,</i>

98
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,840
<i>playing the moonlight.</i>

99
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,760
<i>From the love letter,</i>

100
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,160
<i>I find the places where I will make wishes.</i>

101
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,840
<i>I will plant a red lotus</i>

102
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,120
<i>to fume times with its aroma.</i>

103
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,720
<i>From the love letter,</i>

104
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,120
<i>I find the places where
we will fall in love in each life.</i>

105
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,760
<i>I will sing there,</i>

106
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,040
<i>playing the moonlight.</i>

107
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,760
If you don’t like them,

108
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,680
just throw them away later.

109
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,840
I like them. I like them all!

110
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,840
<i>From the love letter, </i>

111
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,920
<i>I find the places where
we will meet in each life.</i>

112
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,400
<i>I will wait for you there</i>

113
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,400
<i>to enjoy the sunset together.</i>

114
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,960
No. Jin Mi, sober up.

115
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,960
He is King Yi and you are
Saint Girl of the Saint Doctors’ Family.

116
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,960
How can you have love for him?

117
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,400
Why is his smile so charming?

118
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,480
I must be too nervous recently,

119
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,440
so I have such wild thoughts.

120
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I’ll recover after taking a Mind Relief Pill.

121
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,760
<i>From the love letter, </i>

122
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,920
<i>I find the places where
we will fall in love in each life.</i>

123
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,640
<i>I will sing there,</i>

124
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,280
<i>playing the moonlight.</i>

125
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,640
Jin Mi.

126
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,160
Your Majesty.

127
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,600
I’m a little tired.
Please forgive me for leaving now.

128
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,560
I miss such a good chance again.

129
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,160
Should I stop her just now?

130
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,800
I think

131
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,880
you should stop her.

132
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,760
Send these lanterns to her palace.

133
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,160
Your Highness,

134
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,520
I learned that His Majesty
personally made a yard of Phoenix Lanterns

135
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,000
for…

136
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,040
For what?

137
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,360
For that Saint Girl.

138
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,000
What? She?

139
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,200
Unexpectedly, I belittled her.

140
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,000
OK. You can leave.

141
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,640
Yes.

142
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,320
In this world,

143
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,840
no one can rob my cousin away.

144
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,640
You!

145
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,360
Princess Sui He,

146
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,000
as ordered by Heavenly Empress,

147
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,960
I come to restore your memory.

148
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,680
Sorry to offend you.

149
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,840
Jin Mi,

150
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,360
you even compete with me

151
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,920
in Xu Feng in the mortal world.

152
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,280
Sorry to offend you just now.

153
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,920
How come Jin Mi is still alive?

154
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,800
My fault.

155
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,440
I lost the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

156
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,600
Without Spirit-Vanishing Arrow,

157
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
you should try to perish her as well.

158
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,480
She can’t be with Xu Feng.

159
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,600
Got it?

160
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,800
Yes.

161
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,880
Dong Ruixi is dead.

162
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
My Lord, you can rest assured.

163
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,200
He won’t cause any threat to you.

164
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,480
Is there any trace left behind?

165
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,520
Although Minister Fu doubts it,

166
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,400
he can’t find any proof.

167
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,960
He has confirmed that Dong Ruixi
committed suicide to avoid punishment.

168
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,600
Dad.

169
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,200
I want to talk with you.

170
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,680
You can leave now.

171
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,360
Yes.

172
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,560
Dad.

173
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,680
Now Xu Feng,

174
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,040
cousin is healthy.

175
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,320
My marriage with him should be on the agenda.

176
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,520
Sui He.

177
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,320
Dad.

178
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,880
I know what you want.

179
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,640
But after the Meeting of Commanding Officers,

180
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,920
it will be hard to drag him down from the throne.

181
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,000
But if you marry me to him,

182
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,840
our son later

183
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,360
will also call you grandpa.

184
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,840
You will still be powerful

185
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,680
with supreme authority.

186
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,800
Since Sui He insists on this,

187
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,920
I can agree to her.

188
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,320
Now King Yi and I are irreconcilable.

189
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,160
If she really can marry Xu Feng,

190
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,960
I can keep my power.

191
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,440
But if Xu Feng refuses to marry her,

192
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,640
I can launch the uprising later.

193
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,240
Dad.

194
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,880
You win.

195
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,480
OK.

196
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,360
I will ask them to send memorials in a few days

197
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,720
to urge Xu Feng to get married

198
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,600
to realize your love dream.

199
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,680
You are the nicest to me.

200
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,160
I grounded you in your room a few days ago,

201
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,359
have you forgiven me?

202
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,280
You can’t ground me later.

203
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:33,920
OK.

204
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,440
I promise.

205
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,119
I promise.

206
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,800
"Beiyuan Villa"

207
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,160
They wanted to drag me down
from the throne yesterday,

208
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:51,079
but now they hand in memorials one by one

209
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,360
to remind me of my marriage with Sui He

210
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,880
for the sake of my inheritor.

211
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,320
Duke Nanping

212
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,840
always has ways to irritate me.

213
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,240
I think

214
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,680
what these ministers say seems right.

215
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,400
Your Majesty has reached the marriage-age

216
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,720
and should get married indeed.

217
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,760
They don’t know my thoughts,

218
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,320
but you don’t know me either?

219
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,520
But I heard from the old that,

220
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,640
if a man is not close to women for long,

221
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,240
he will easily…

222
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,760
What?

223
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,000
He will easily,

224
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,720
get irritated as you.

225
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,840
Qin Tong,

226
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,400
you worry about more and more recently.

227
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,840
Your Majesty,

228
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,200
Saint Girl sent a memorial just now.

229
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,560
Should I

230
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,320
let her go?

231
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,720
It depends on your heart.

232
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,760
The Spirit-Vanishing Arrow actually hangs still.

233
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,240
Xu Feng,

234
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,880
it seems that this is the heavenly fate.

235
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,360
You can leave.

236
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,960
What are you looking at?

237
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,160
Moon Immortal.

238
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,680
How come you are here as well?

239
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,240
I worry about Xu Feng and Jin Mi,

240
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,840
so I specially come here to take a look.

241
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,320
Lord Yan You, why are you here?

242
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,080
I’m an old friend of Jin Mi’s.

243
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,720
So I come here to see whether she is fine.

244
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,960
You know what?

245
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,280
When Xu Feng was leaving,

246
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,560
I tied him with Jin Mi

247
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,240
with a red rope.

248
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,240
Maybe they two

249
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,720
now have been married.

250
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,560
How come Xu Feng seems so worried?

251
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,800
Do you know what he worries about?

252
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,680
Duke Nanping in Huaiwu has a daughter

253
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,240
called Sui He.

254
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,400
She has a marriage agreement with Xu Feng.

255
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,240
Now his ministers hand in memorials

256
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,080
to advise him to marry her as soon as possible.

257
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,240
Sui He?

258
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,680
Which Sui He?

259
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,160
That Princess of Bird Family?

260
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,880
No, no, no.

261
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,560
I don’t like Sui He.

262
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,120
She is not worthy of Xu Feng.

263
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,000
How can I do?

264
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,440
I have an idea.

265
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,400
It may help Xu Feng.

266
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,760
Tell me.

267
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,840
Great.

268
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,640
Good idea.

269
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,720
Lord Yan You, you are really creative.

270
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,200
Qin Tong,

271
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,840
bring me several pots of osmanthus flower wine.

272
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,800
How come Your Majesty
is in such an aesthetic mood?

273
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,840
After coming back from the battlefield,

274
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,360
I have never seen you drinking wine.

275
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,800
It’s hard to win this battle.

276
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,080
I need to brave myself with wine.

277
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,080
I’ll go fetch some.

278
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,720
I sent the memorial

279
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,720
for begging to go back to
Saint Doctors’ Family days ago,

280
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
why doesn’t Crow reply me?

281
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,800
If I continue to stay here,

282
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,040
how can I manage my love?

283
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,040
I’d better leave

284
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,000
to be far away from him,

285
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,480
missing him in the rest of my life.

286
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,640
Your Majesty, you are drunk?

287
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,560
Today, Duke Nanping unites
all officers to hand in memorials,

288
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,080
urging me to marry Sui He.

289
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,280
Your Majesty has great  civil and military skills

290
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,240
and Princess is noble and elegant.

291
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,920
It’s a good thing for you to be a perfect match.

292
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,360
Good thing?

293
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,040
Your Majesty,

294
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,360
have you seen my memorial

295
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,480
of begging to go back to Saint Doctors’ Family?

296
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,560
You once promised me a wish.

297
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,640
I thought

298
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,600
you wanted a decree for pardon
about not being buried alive with me.

299
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,480
That’s the century-old family rule.

300
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,440
I,

301
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,920
dare not to disobey it.

302
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,880
At the first sight of your eyes,

303
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,120
I felt you were very familiar.

304
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,600
Living with you every day later,

305
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,840
I didn’t want to leave even if I had been recovered.

306
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,880
After I came back,

307
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,080
I planned to find you after pacifying the court.

308
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,400
Unexpectedly, Duke Nanping

309
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,280
called you to Beiyuan Villa.

310
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,360
I was happy and frightened.

311
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,760
I was happy

312
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,320
because I met you earlier.

313
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,360
I was frightened

314
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,680
because I worried you would be in dangers.

315
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,840
My identity as Saint Girl

316
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,160
won’t be changed.

317
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,640
When I’m alive,

318
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,240
I’m your person.

319
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,920
Even I’m dead,

320
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,440
I will be your dead person.

321
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,480
That’s the century-old family rule
of the Saint Doctors’ Family.

322
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,200
I will accompany you no matter I’m alive or dead.

323
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
What are you saying?

324
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,800
I don’t want you to be buried alive for me.

325
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,880
Instead, I want you to live well.

326
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,080
I don’t want you to be my dad person.

327
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,600
I just want you to be my woman.

328
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,600
I surely don’t want to be buried alive.

329
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,960
But if I violate the family rule,

330
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,480
I won’t be alive tomorrow

331
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,600
before I’m buried alive.

332
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,840
If you are willing,

333
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,800
I can find a way

334
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,560
to let you get rid of the identity of Saint Girl.

335
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,290
Escape by pretend-dead.

336
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,400
You only need to pretend ill for several days

337
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,840
and you will be claimed death.

338
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,440
Then I will hide you in the folk.

339
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,000
After a period of time,

340
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,160
you will be welcomed back to the palace

341
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,360
as the daughter of an officer.

342
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,680
No.

343
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,960
Even you have 1,000 ways to protect me,

344
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,800
the Saint Doctors’ Family will have 1,001 ways

345
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,960
to kill me.

346
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,560
Do I need to fear the Saint Doctors’ Family?

347
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,880
If they make you buried alive with me,

348
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,840
I will bury all of them alive for you.

349
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
Your Majesty,

350
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,200
please don’t do this.

351
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,520
I love medicine since my childhood.

352
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,880
It was true in the past

353
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,480
and won’t be changed in the future.

354
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,680
Moreover, you have never met my face.

355
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,320
Under my veil,

356
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,000
my face is so ugly.

357
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,000
Am I so superficial

358
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,400
in your eyes?

359
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,880
No.

360
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,840
You are a wise king in my eyes.

361
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,800
But you have your heavenly fate

362
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,800
and I have my duties.

363
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,240
The match of King Yi and Saint Girl

364
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,640
will ruin the rules.

365
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,800
If someone takes advantage from this,

366
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,280
it will be a taint for you,

367
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,320
which will be adverse for you.

368
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,040
My love for you

369
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,840
is even a taint in your eyes?

370
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,760
Your Majesty, you shouldn’t garble my words.

371
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,600
I just think that

372
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,720
you should set store by overall interests

373
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,840
and create a peaceful and prosperous state

374
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,520
for common people.

375
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,360
Does creating a peaceful and prosperous state
for common people

376
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,360
conflict with being together with you?

377
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,280
Am I so unreliable

378
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,160
in your heart?

379
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
I won’t approve of

380
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,000
your memorial.

381
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,080
It seems that you are drunk greatly.

382
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,800
I’d like to cook a bowl of sober soup for you.

383
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,240
No need to leave.

384
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,840
I’ll leave.

385
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,920
"With your heart, we’ll never be apart."

386
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,840
Your Majesty,

387
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,320
I think

388
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,560
that you haven’t got married and have no child,

389
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,280
will make people restless.

390
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,400
You should get married earlier

391
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,000
and take several consorts

392
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,840
for reproduction.

393
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,480
A wise king should have a wife and consorts.

394
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,680
In my opinion,

395
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,320
taking consorts is not urgent.

396
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,840
What’s important to determine the queen earlier.

397
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,240
Recently, Liangguo has still sought chance

398
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,520
to eliminate our state.

399
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,360
Tu people from the south

400
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,040
and Huoluo people from the north

401
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,320
have repeatedly invaded our state

402
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,720
and provoked our bottom line.

403
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,400
Under such a current situation,

404
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,760
I have no mind to think over my marriage.

405
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,360
However, Your Majesty...

406
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,920
As long as we can’t eliminate enemies

407
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,760
to unite the state,

408
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,840
I’ll

409
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,120
never get married.

410
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,160
The marriage of Your Majesty with Sui He
was determined by the late King.

411
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,000
Since Your Majesty is healthy now,

412
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,840
Your Majesty should marry her to have heir

413
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,280
for the state earlier.

414
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,560
It’s late.

415
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,680
Just leave.

416
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,280
I’m leaving.

417
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,640
Saint Girl,

418
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,800
I heard that today

419
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,600
Duke Nanping and Minister Fu
urged King Yi to get married earlier,

420
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,160
but King Yi said

421
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,800
he won’t get married

422
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,600
before enemies are eliminated

423
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,280
to unify the state.

424
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,960
I didn’t expect that King Yi
is so firm and unyielding.

425
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,840
His tough and lofty belief

426
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,680
are really admirable.

427
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720
Be careful.

428
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,560
Has the memorial you submitted
got the approval from His Majesty?

429
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,480
How long do you want to stay here?

430
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,720
I have no idea, either.

431
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,680
I think as His Majesty has so many
important matters to concern about,

432
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,640
he can’t consider us at the time being.

433
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,920
You live comfortably here,

434
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,520
but do you know...

435
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,360
Do you still want to go back to
the Saint Doctors’ Family?

436
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,720
If l leave,

437
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,920
will I meet him again in my life?

438
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,120
It doesn’t matter to
stay here for several more days.

439
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,960
It doesn’t matter.

440
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,760
Goodbye.

441
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,720
Your Highness,

442
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,920
you actually can ask us

443
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,920
to do these things

444
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,400
instead of coming here personally.

445
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,960
I’ve been looking forward to

446
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,760
the marriage with cousin for a long time.

447
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,600
Now that the wedding date is to be set,

448
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,560
naturally I want to do it personally

449
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,880
to make it perfect.

450
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,000
Everyone knows your love for His Majesty.

451
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,560
His Majesty will take
good care of you in the future.

452
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,480
Although it’s just
a short moment in the mortal world,

453
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,200
it’s great

454
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,880
to marry Xu Feng.

455
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,840
Yan You.

456
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,400
What do you want to do?

457
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,080
It seems that you’ve recovered
your memories in Heavenly Realm.

458
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,760
What a pity!

459
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,040
I still like the silly and innocent you

460
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,200
a few days ago.

461
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,400
Freeze.

462
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,320
You...

463
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,160
Although you have the memories,

464
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,360
you’re still a human.

465
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,960
Princess Sui He,

466
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,840
you shouldn’t have expected that

467
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,280
you’ll be treated by me in this way, right?

468
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,320
Yan You,

469
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,920
what on earth do you want to do?

470
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,800
I want to do many things to you.

471
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,480
Where should I begin?

472
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,159
As soon as I return to the Heaven Realm,

473
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,880
Just wait and see!

474
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,040
See what?

475
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,280
I’m so good-looking

476
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,520
that I can't be better.

477
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,199
Cause I’m afraid that girls
in heaven and on earth

478
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:51,280
will be jealous of my beauty.

479
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:52,800
You’re shameless.

480
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,120
Shameless?

481
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,600
I’m shameless?

482
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,560
In this regard,

483
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,199
I’m absolutely inferior to you.

484
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,760
I can remember clearly what you did to me

485
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,120
in the Heaven Realm back then.

486
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,600
Today,

487
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,880
let’s make it clearly.

488
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,840
Yan You.

489
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,320
What?

490
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,960
The princess is missing.

491
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,280
Originally, she was talking
with me in the carriage,

492
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,760
but somehow I fainted.

493
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,760
When I came back to life,
she was found nowhere.

494
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,480
Qi Chong.

495
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,080
Yes.

496
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,160
Send people to search around the city

497
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,840
to find princess at all costs.

498
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,440
Yes.

499
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,680
Honghong, Honghong,

500
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,440
we’ve made an appointment to meet each other.

501
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,000
Where has she been?

502
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,640
Lian Qiao, Lian Qiao

503
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,920
come here.

504
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,120
What’s wrong, Mr. Hu?

505
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,720
Do you know where

506
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,960
Moon Immortal has been?

507
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,680
He said he was too urgent

508
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,440
to wait for you to match

509
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,760
Jin Mi and his second nephew in the mortal world.

510
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,200
He just left us behind.

511
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,960
Well, this old fox

512
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,320
always acts at will.

513
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,600
Your Majesty,

514
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,000
Duke Nanping reported that

515
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,320
Princess Sui He is missing.

516
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,200
Duke Nanping hopes that you can also send people

517
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,440
to search for the princess.

518
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,800
What does he want to do?

519
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,560
Well,

520
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,480
Sui He is different from her dad.

521
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,960
Send someone to search for her.

522
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,680
No need.

523
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,920
The princess

524
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,760
is here right now.

525
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,840
What?

526
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,560
Just now she came with a man

527
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,600
called Puchi Jun

528
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,360
and asked for the decision of Your Majesty.

529
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,400
Your Highness.

530
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,320
Your Highness.

531
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,240
Your Highness.

532
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,040
Do you think

533
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,400
Xu Feng will agree with our marriage?

534
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,720
Yan You,

535
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,760
let me go,

536
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,680
or you’ll pay dearly for it

537
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,360
when I return to the Heaven Realm.

538
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,280
Anyway, under your careful plan,

539
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,200
I’m already a criminal,

540
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,920
so I fear nothing.

541
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,480
What’s more,

542
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,160
I’m very happy to marry you

543
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,760
in the mortal world.

544
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,960
Cousin, I...

545
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,200
I won’t allow you to utter even a word from now on.

546
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,200
Are you Puchi Jun?

547
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,200
I’m Puchi. Please take my respect.

548
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,200
Why do you

549
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,200
want to meet me?

550
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,560
I’m a hanger-on in Duke Nanping Palace.

551
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,200
Accidentally, I was acquainted with Princess Sui He.

552
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,200
Though we have a great disparity in status,

553
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,640
we felt familiar at first sight
and fell in love with each other.

554
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,320
I know she’s engaged to you,

555
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,040
so I shouldn’t have held

556
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,400
an improper desire for her.

557
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,280
However, love won’t

558
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,720
be controlled by reason.

559
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,160
Now we are really in love with each other,

560
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,000
please permit us.

561
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,960
Sui He,

562
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,960
do you also love him?

563
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,240
It’s my turn.

564
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,920
Cousin.

565
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,760
Cousin,

566
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,560
we are really gone on each other,

567
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,920
please permit us.

568
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,560
Yan You,

569
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,240
you even have a helper.

570
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,200
How dare you conjure the Puppet Incantation to me!

571
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,480
When I return to the Heaven Realm someday,

572
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,040
I’ll grind bones of you two to dust.

573
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,200
My waist.

574
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
My waist.

575
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,080
Your Majesty,

576
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,520
I’ve prepared for the worst

577
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,240
as I came here.

578
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,160
If you want to punish,

579
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,480
just punish me.

580
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,880
Don’t hurt the princess.

581
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,000
Isn’t she Princess Sui He?

582
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,560
Love arising secretly

583
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,000
becomes deeper and deeper.

584
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,800
It’s really a blessing

585
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,680
to meet the one you love and loves you

586
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,840
in a short life,

587
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,600
so never give up easily.

588
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,760
Since you love each other,

589
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,080
I would like to help you.

590
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,480
I’ll abolish the engagement with Sui He,

591
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,600
to return her freedom

592
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,560
to marry anyone she likes.

593
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,960
You’re wise, Your Majesty.

594
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,240
Thanks for your permission.

595
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,080
Please rise.

596
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,960
We’ll love each other afterwards

597
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,320
to live up to your help.

598
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,040
Isn’t Princess Sui He always

599
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,400
persistent in King Yi?

600
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,080
Why does she change her mind suddenly?

601
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,160
Moreover, King Yi

602
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,160
even agreed with them,

603
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,240
which is more wonderful than opera.

604
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,400
Don’t you go to listen to the storytelling?

605
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,320
Storytelling isn’t

606
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,080
as wonderful as this.

607
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,320
Let’s go.

608
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,440
Please rise.

609
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,920
This plan is really amazing.

610
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,560
Let’s go.

611
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,080
Your Highness.

612
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,160
I’ll go to the mortal world.

613
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,440
Perhaps someone can give me the answer

614
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,360
about Spirit-Vanishing Arrow and Magic Fireballs.

615
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:01,960
Who?

616
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,520
Kuang Lu,

617
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,280
guard the Xuanji Palace.

618
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,440
I’ll be back soon.

619
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
What’s the connection between

620
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,280
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow and Magic Fireballs?

621
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,840
Who can

622
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,760
answer this?
