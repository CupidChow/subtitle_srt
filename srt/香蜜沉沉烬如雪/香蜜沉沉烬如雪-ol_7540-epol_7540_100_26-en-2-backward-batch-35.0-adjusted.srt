"Episode 26"

3
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,900
Jin Mi,

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,140
here is a letter from Auntie.

5
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,840
Dear Jin Mi,

6
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,360
I have read your letter and learned everything.

7
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,090
The kings have been caring for us through the ages,

8
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,510
and in return, our family has been
working for them for generations.

9
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,480
We vow to live or die with King Yi.

10
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,860
Duke Nanping is a traitor.

11
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,440
He is steeped in crime, wanting to replace King Yi.

12
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,940
Evildoers will not live.

13
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,120
You should observe the rules of our family

14
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,440
and assist King Yi in saving the people.

15
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,800
Don’t just care about our survival,

16
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,200
so that King Yi can bring order out of chaos.

17
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,180
When the crooked ministers are eliminated,

18
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,120
our family can smile in the underworld.

19
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,540
Jin Mi, what to do?

20
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,579
What to do?

21
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,580
My Lord, the Saint Girl wishes to meet you.

22
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,100
Let her in.

23
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:39,620
Yes.

24
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,780
Duke Nanping.

25
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,840
You’ve been working very hard.

26
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,040
His Majesty spat blood and fainted this morning.

27
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,060
You’re a genius.

28
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,940
I come to

29
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,780
ask about the prescription.

30
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,780
You ask me about prescription?

31
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,020
What a surprise.

32
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,700
Go ahead.

33
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,740
Recently,

34
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,940
I dispense medicines as your order,

35
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,980
but

36
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,860
if you want the poison to take effect ten days later,

37
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,300
I have to consider the dosage
of each medicinal herb accurately.

38
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,340
I heard that His Majesty
has the habit of taking medicated diet,

39
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,440
so I need

40
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,800
a list of his meals

41
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,260
in the past year.

42
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,720
It must specify the amounts of
the main and supplementary ingredients

43
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,600
and the food intake of each meal.

44
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,940
It’s easy.

45
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,620
The Food Supervisor is responsible for this.

46
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,680
I’ll order him to make such a list

47
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,400
and send it to you.

48
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,520
Thank you.

49
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,170
"With a heavenly mandate, be everlasting and mighty."

50
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,380
Duke Nanping, it’s the mandate of heaven.

51
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,040
Hope you can be triumphant at one stroke.

52
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,260
Then I’ll expect quietly for the good news.

53
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,980
Okay.

54
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,700
He changes his mind constantly.
I can’t work for him.

55
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,730
Saint Girl, please stop.

56
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,150
Princess Sui He wants to talk to you.

57
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,060
Princess Sui He.

58
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,020
You’ve been working very hard.

59
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,120
Have a seat.

60
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,880
Thank you.

61
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,540
Sibin Stone Needles?

62
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,040
You have good taste.

63
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,260
They were made by
the King of Medicine, Immortal Sun

64
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,480
before his death.

65
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,700
They were lost for nearly 100 years

66
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,980
and didn’t appear in the city until some time ago.

67
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,860
Princess Sui He bought it
at an auction for a high price.

68
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,240
Hope you like them.

69
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,700
Thank you so much.

70
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,080
As the saying goes, no gains without pains.

71
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,600
They’re very precious.

72
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,340
You can use them or hand them down in your family.

73
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,280
A hero deserves a treasured sword, and a famous doctor needs jade needles.

74
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,820
You have been loyal to my father.

75
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,740
Just accept them.

76
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,260
Oddly enough,

77
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,580
today she is different from

78
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
the girl I met last time.

79
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,940
These girls serve her

80
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,860
or keep watch on her?

81
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,160
How about having a walk with me?

82
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,800
Okay.

83
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,700
What do you want?

84
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,360
Don’t pretend.

85
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,260
I didn’t know until today that

86
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
my father planted you

87
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,020
by the side of His Majesty.

88
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,380
We’re

89
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,220
on the same side.

90
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,860
You and my father are birds of a feather.

91
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,700
You want to kill His Majesty.

92
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,580
Don’t get me involved.

93
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,539
We’re different.

94
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,220
It’s not that easy.

95
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,460
Your family observes strict rules.

96
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,520
Once His Majesty dies,

97
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,740
you’ll die as well.

98
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,520
Even if you succeed in escaping,

99
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,660
I won’t let you go.

100
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,760
Duke Nanping may

101
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,360
ask her to sound me out.

102
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,180
I have to be careful.

103
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,320
You’re right.

104
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,520
But I’m just a nobody.

105
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,720
I’m too humble

106
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,860
to compare myself with His Majesty.

107
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,380
What’ll you do

108
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,480
if you have to be responsible for

109
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,140
the survival of your family?

110
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,500
I just know that

111
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,140
if His Majesty is alive,

112
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,980
my father can live an easy life in old age.

113
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,440
If my father succeeds,

114
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,880
His Majesty will die definitely.

115
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,480
She is different from her father.

116
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,660
She likes His Majesty.

117
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,400
At such harsh times,

118
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,080
forget it, I can’t tell her my real intentions.

119
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,340
Aren’t you afraid that

120
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,160
your father heard what you said?

121
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,880
So what?

122
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,740
He’ll just lock me up

123
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,160
as he does these days

124
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,260
to make me blind, deaf and dumb

125
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,560
and prevent me from

126
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,800
hearing of His Majesty.

127
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,280
Even a vicious tiger will not eat its cubs.

128
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,820
I’m his daughter.

129
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,260
What else can he do to me?

130
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,720
I can do nothing to him either.

131
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,580
If he succeeds one day,

132
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
I can do nothing to him.

133
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,100
But I’ll torture

134
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,020
you traitors

135
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,960
to avenge His Majesty.

136
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,780
I show great admiration  for you.

137
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,380
You just said

138
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,880
you would avenge His Majesty,

139
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,160
but you don’t dare to turn to your father.

140
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,160
Instead, you transfer your anger on us.

141
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,500
As the saying goes,

142
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,300
well,

143
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,580
he who only stole a hook is to be beheaded,

144
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,580
while he who manipulated his country
is to become a seigneur.

145
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,940
Princess Sui He, I have to leave.

146
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,960
It’s Princess Sui He.

147
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,280
Go. Go.

148
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,400
Help.

149
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,060
Snake.

150
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,300
Help.

151
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,100
Princess Sui He.

152
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,720
Don’t move.

153
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,680
It’s of severe toxicity,

154
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,060
but don’t worry.

155
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,960
It’s Liuyeqing.
It won’t bite you.

156
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,320
Don’t move.

157
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,940
Hurry up. Take it away.

158
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,980
Hurry up.

159
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,260
What did you spread?

160
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,060
Realgar powder.

161
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,720
It can expel snakes and insects.

162
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,300
Your Highness

163
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,900
What did you do to Princess Sui He?

164
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,240
Your Highness

165
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,420
Snake.

166
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,580
Leave.

167
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,060
Your Highness

168
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,140
Are you alright?
Are you hurt?

169
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,300
Burn this bamboo forest.

170
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,620
I don’t want to see that disgusting thing any more.

171
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,840
I’ll order to do that.

172
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,720
Well,

173
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,480
I almost forgot the medicinal liquor of Immortal Run Yu.

174
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,000
Wait, Princess Sui He.

175
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,300
I just saw that the snake is complete and strong.

176
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,120
Could you give it to me?

177
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,620
That is a good material for making wine.

178
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,240
Besides, you order to burn

179
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,400
all the green bamboos in order to kill a snake.

180
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,620
What a pity.

181
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,560
They’re valueless bamboos.

182
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,220
They’re not worth mentioning at all compared with Princess Sui He’s health.

183
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,200
Forget it.
Catch it quickly.

184
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,000
I don’t want to see it again.

185
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,700
Thank you.

186
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,660
It’s realgar.

187
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,220
It runs that way.

188
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,080
Fortune-teller,

189
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,080
why do you sleep here?

190
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,340
I recall the sages

191
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,900
and feel the wind of the bamboo forest here.

192
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,880
Beauty, what are you doing here?

193
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,060
I come to catch a snake.

194
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,460
Snake? Where is it?

195
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,760
Maybe it’s not here.

196
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,880
You scared me.

197
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,040
Fortune-teller, you walk haltingly

198
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,280
and your feet are puffy.

199
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,360
You may be poisoned.

200
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,480
Were you bitten by the snake?

201
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,520
Moreover, why do you
have a strong smell of realgar?

202
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,140
Did that snake

203
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,760
run over you?

204
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,520
Was I bitten by the snake?

205
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,820
Hurry up.
Feel my pulse.

206
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,000
I feel dizzy.
Am I poisoned?

207
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,580
I have felt it.

208
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,060
You have a strong pulse and sufficient blood and qi.

209
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,300
It’s like

210
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,240
that of a woman who has been pregnant for four months.

211
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,920
You’re fine.

212
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,140
Beauty, we should take pleasure
in the welfare of living things.

213
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,100
Why do you

214
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,980
want to catch the snake?

215
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,080
I’ll use it to make wine.

216
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,580
Don’t you know?

217
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,780
It can dissipate cold, dispel dampness

218
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,260
and promote blood circulation to arrest pain.

219
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,760
Pitifully, it has run away, or…

220
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,400
Well,

221
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,360
it’s the most beautiful snake

222
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,820
I have ever met since childhood.

223
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,000
Really?

224
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,900
Beauty, you have excellent medical skills

225
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,540
and good taste.

226
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,800
You can’t do that.

227
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,800
You have to leave a way out

228
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,520
for the common women in the world.

229
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,660
I’m flattered.

230
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,220
In fact, my medical skills...

231
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,460
Her memory has been erased?

232
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,660
She was so scared

233
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,960
when seeing my real body just now.

234
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,280
And she is confused

235
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,180
at the sight of me now.

236
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,340
I’ll try.

237
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,700
Princess Sui He, hope that you are well.

238
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,160
She doesn’t recognize me?

239
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,340
How dare you.

240
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,400
You can’t address Princess disrespectfully by name.

241
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,040
Why do you trespass on our backyard?

242
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,580
Calm down.

243
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,320
In fact, he is a fortune-teller.

244
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,020
He knows the previous life and the future life.

245
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,080
He is half an immortal.

246
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,400
I’m Puchi Jun,

247
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,000
a new hanger-on.

248
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,700
Sorry to

249
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,540
offend you just now.

250
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,500
What a strange name.

251
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,140
She really becomes an ordinary person?

252
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,060
Sorry, I dominate the mortal world.

253
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,940
You’re noble and beautiful.

254
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,980
You must be famous and
go through ups and downs in this life.

255
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,340
Don’t be glib-tongued.

256
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,380
Why does my father recruit

257
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,800
people from all walks of life?

258
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,800
"Hongchang Restaurant"

259
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,380
Puchi Jun.

260
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,900
What a funny name.

261
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,720
It’s not a name given by your parents, right?

262
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,400
Yes. To be honest,

263
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,500
it was given

264
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,220
by my wife.

265
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,500
What do you think? Is it pleasant to hear?

266
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,980
It’s funny but suitable.

267
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,580
You must love

268
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,920
your wife dearly.

269
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,120
Yes.

270
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,200
Why do you

271
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,880
work for Duke Nanping?

272
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,360
I idle away my time.

273
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,080
Duke Nanping has over 3,000 hangers-on.

274
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,120
He doesn’t personally

275
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,180
recruit all of them.

276
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,720
After we said goodbye to each other last time,

277
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,780
I lived a miserable life.

278
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,280
His men asked me

279
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,960
to tell their fortunes.

280
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,960
Alas.

281
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,760
Since you’re a fortune-teller,

282
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,000
tell my fortune.

283
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,820
Nine out of ten divination practice are wrong.
It’s a trick.

284
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,780
What do you want to know?

285
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,460
I, I want…

286
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,460
Beauty,

287
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,000
your frown

288
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,920
almost pokes your veil.

289
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,180
What worries you?

290
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,780
What’ll you do

291
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,220
if someone threats you with your weakness

292
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,000
and forces you

293
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,599
to do something against your will with a knife?

294
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,280
I’m the ruler of my destiny.
Ignore him.

295
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,339
He threats me with my weakness.

296
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,740
If I obey, I’ll make a mistake.
If I disobey, I’ll suffer.

297
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,480
We are in the same boat.

298
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,500
We are in the same boat?

299
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,600
Puchi Jun, you know fates well

300
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,620
and foretell things accurately.
What worries you?

301
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,760
Come on.
Forget all these.

302
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,080
Drink until drunk when you can

303
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,780
and lift the problems until you can’t lift it.

304
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,760
Come on. Cheers.

305
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,140
Cheers.

306
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,930
"Peace reigns over the land"

307
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,520
Your Majesty, you’re seriously ill.
As the chancellor,

308
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,400
I can’t share your worries.

309
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,240
I let you and the people down.

310
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,220
I feel guilty.

311
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,900
Don’t say that.
Stand up.

312
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,710
I’m not a qualified king, so I get sick.

313
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,060
It has nothing to do with you.

314
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,400
Do you have something important?
Why do you come personally?

315
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,380
Your Majesty, I want to submit a memorial.

316
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,980
Get married?

317
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,460
Why do you always ask me to get married

318
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,520
but not pay attention

319
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,500
to the state affairs?

320
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,380
Please pardon me for my boldness.

321
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,160
Now you’re in poor health, but still have no child.

322
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,040
I worry it’ll endanger our state,

323
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,960
so it’s time to get married.

324
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,440
It can remove the evils,

325
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,900
and you will have sons

326
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,460
to govern our state.

327
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,560
You’re right,

328
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,900
but now I’m in poor health.

329
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,940
I worry I’ll waste those girls’ youth,

330
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,740
so I’ll think about it after recovery.

331
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,540
It’s very glorious and meritorious

332
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,540
to be your consorts and
give birth to children for you.

333
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,060
Nobody will refuse such a good thing.

334
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,420
You mean,

335
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,460
I won’t recover?

336
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,300
I don’t mean that.

337
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,880
If you refuse to get married,

338
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,040
please read another memorial.

339
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,900
You’re really considerate.

340
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,620
I’m flattered.
All the ministers jointly submit the memorial

341
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,720
to beg you to select someone
with good quality and super talent

342
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,780
from the royal family as the crown prince

343
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,380
to consolidate the state.

344
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,780
It’s your real intention.

345
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,960
You say so much,

346
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,160
but your real intention is to
ask me to select the crown prince.

347
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,320
It’s not my idea,

348
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,460
but all the ministers

349
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,020
actively ask me to do it.

350
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,580
Stop talking about it.
I’ll think about it.

351
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,500
I hope you can recover early.

352
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,940
I’m leaving.

353
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,350
"Beiyuan Villa"

354
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,580
Your trick

355
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,480
really makes trouble for me,

356
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,520
but it’s also a good thing.

357
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,920
Their anxiety will make Duke Nanping slack.

358
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,780
As “The Art of War” describes,

359
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,990
When we are able to attack, we must seem unable;

360
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,490
when using our forces, we must appear inactive;

361
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,700
when we are near, we must
make the enemy believe we are far away;

362
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,830
when far away, we must
make him believe we are near.

363
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,820
It’s a truth.

364
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,960
I don’t understand.

365
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,160
Duke Nanping

366
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,260
sent you

367
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,460
to kill me,

368
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,180
but he didn’t expect

369
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:10,320
you’d be my helper and save me.

370
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,820
You help me a lot.

371
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,300
Am I right?

372
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,860
Chancellor Fu and other ministers worry I’ll die

373
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,240
and result in the turbulence,

374
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,680
so they want me to
get married to remove the evils.

375
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,460
By then I’ll try my best

376
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,120
to offer you

377
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,020
prescriptions of enriching yin and nourishing kidney

378
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,400
to have many babies.

379
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,120
You’re so foolish.

380
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,820
In fact,

381
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,180
I don’t like those women.

382
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,000
I mean, I don’t like those women outside the palace.

383
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,940
You had always lived in Saint Doctors’ Family
since your childhood.

384
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,300
Do you want to change your life?

385
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,320
For example,

386
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,100
for example, be an ordinary girl,

387
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,740
or,

388
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,900
or, be my wife.

389
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,920
I daren’t.

390
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,940
I grew up in the mountains.

391
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,900
What’s more, I’m boring and know nothing

392
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,680
except treating illnesses and make pills.

393
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,300
I don’t know how to serve as your wife.

394
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,140
In your heart, am I shallow

395
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,600
and not worth marrying?

396
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,440
I

397
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,740
don’t need to marry anyone.

398
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,060
I can live alone.

399
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,980
Your Majesty, your robe.

400
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,240
Jin Mi,

401
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,940
His Majesty falls in love with you?

402
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,220
No.

403
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,400
You fall in love with him?

404
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,360
No.

405
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,360
I won’t fall in love with him.

406
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,000
Jin Mi, keep the rules of our family in mind.

407
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,800
Auntie Jing Jie and presbyters
won’t allow you to do that.

408
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,940
I see.

409
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,660
I won’t fall in love with him.
Don’t worry.

410
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,620
Jin Mi.

411
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,420
Immortal Run Yu,

412
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,860
you, you startle me.

413
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,420
But I’m summoned by you.

414
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,120
Oh, yes.

415
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,720
Immortal Run Yu, Look.

416
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,320
What’s this?

417
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,320
This is the wine I present to you.

418
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,680
I have brewed the wine you want

419
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,920
for you.

420
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,440
Jin Mi, thank you.

421
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,940
Does your epiphyllum bloom?

422
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,180
Yes.

423
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,220
So beautiful.

424
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,620
This yard looks like a fairyland now.

425
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,840
So fragrant.

426
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,900
Immortal Run Yu,

427
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,940
what’s the Heavenly Palace like?

428
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,660
It’s cold and cheerless.
Only some epiphyllum,

429
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,340
an innocent deer

430
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,020
and a young immortal maid accompany me.

431
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,080
He looks sad.

432
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,540
Am I wrong?

433
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,880
It’s so hard to know immortals’ thoughts.

434
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,080
Stop talking about it.

435
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,500
Immortal Run Yu, is there some unique scenery

436
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,240
in the Heavenly Palace?

437
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,980
Can you tell me to widen my horizon?

438
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,700
OK.

439
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,520
There is a rainbow bridge outside my palace,

440
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,900
and I can see the boundless Milky Way

441
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,660
full of bright stars on it.

442
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,620
It’s very beautiful.

443
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,700
Whenever I miss someone,

444
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,960
I’ll go there.

445
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,520
No wonder,

446
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,020
no wonder whenever I meet you

447
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,460
in my dream,

448
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,360
I always see the rainbow bridge.

449
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,600
You seem to miss that fairy

450
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,040
very much.

451
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,220
Well, Immortal Run Yu,

452
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,420
you told me

453
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,440
that fairy promised to admire the beauty
of epiphyllum with you at night.

454
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,660
Did she do that?

455
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,720
She failed to do it.

456
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,820
It’s really a pity.

457
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,720
No,

458
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,740
because I can do it

459
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,380
with you tonight.

460
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,160
Your Majesty.

461
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,700
Your Majesty.

462
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,940
Who’s he?

463
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,780
He, he’s my friend.

464
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,300
Maybe you don’t believe me.

465
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,100
In fact, he’s an immortal

466
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,260
in the Heavenly Palace.

467
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,160
An immortal?

468
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,080
Xu Feng,

469
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,720
you look so majestic after
being the king in the mortal world.

470
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,330
You’re so bold.

471
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,000
You can’t address His Majesty disrespectfully by name.

472
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,780
Wait a minute.

473
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,380
I can guarantee he’s really my friend.

474
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,360
He’s really an immortal.
Believe me.

475
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,880
He’ll catch up with us.

476
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,780
Hurry up. Kill Fire Immortal
and then ask King of Gu City for reward.

477
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,500
Tell me whether you’re Mu Ci or not.

478
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,480
Who do you want to kill with Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

479
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,400
He’s not injured. I just freeze him,

480
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,960
and he can move after one hour.

481
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,600
Jin Mi, let’s go out to get some air

482
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,080
to get rid of such a embarrassing night.

483
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,460
I disagree.

484
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,160
No, you can’t defeat him as he is an immortal.

485
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,140
Immortal Run Yu,

486
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,820
please forgive us.

487
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,100
Are you busy?

488
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,560
If so, you can leave first.

489
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,820
I seldom meet such an opponent like him.

490
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,260
I’m loath to leave.

491
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,260
OK, I can also take this opportunity
to limber up my muscles and joints.

492
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,840
Well,

493
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,030
I won’t conjure.

494
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,060
Let’s fight hand to hand

495
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,880
and stop at where we should, OK?

496
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,460
OK.

497
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,620
No, you can’t.

498
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,560
You’re so busy.

499
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,200
There is a fight everywhere.

500
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,920
Puchi Jun,

501
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,720
it’s very late. Why are you here?

502
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,160
I ate too much at night,

503
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,620
so I’m here to help digestion.

504
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,020
I’m very thirsty after going for a walk.

505
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,520
Can you give me some water to drink?

506
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,840
Yan You, why are you here?

507
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,040
Yan You?

508
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,660
I remember you told me

509
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,660
Puchi Jun was the name given by your wife.

510
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,820
A name given by his wife?

511
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,200
Immortal Run Yu, you, you know each other?

512
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,720
He is an immortal, and I’m half an immortal,

513
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,960
so I know him.

514
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,860
No wonder you can tell fortune.

515
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,500
What’s your relationship with Jin Mi?

516
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,260
He,

517
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,660
he’s,

518
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,520
also my friend.

519
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,440
You were reserved in the Heavenly Palace,

520
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,620
but now you’re

521
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,960
a jealous man.

522
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,100
What?

523
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,720
What do you mean?

524
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,400
Yan You, shut up.

525
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,820
I, I defeat Fire Immortal.

526
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,140
Your Highness, I revenge you.

527
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,340
Are you happy?

528
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,220
Jin Mi,

529
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,780
I planned to admire the beauty of epiphyllum

530
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,200
with you quietly

531
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,240
and carelessly tonight,

532
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,140
but I fail to

533
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,860
realize such a small wish.

534
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,060
Immortal Run Yu, faith moves mountains.

535
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,800
The fairy you wait

536
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,620
will come back to you sooner or later.

537
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,280
OK, I’ll wait for her in the Heavenly Palace.

538
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,120
But, he…

539
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,640
Don’t worry. He is fine.

540
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,460
Tonight we cause a sensation.

541
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,760
Sorry, Jin Mi.

542
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,179
I must remove

543
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,360
all your memories about tonight.

544
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:23,820
Lord Yan You, you have so many enemies.

545
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,080
Why do you offend the demons of Demon Realm?

546
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,960
Because we want

547
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,560
the same treasure.

548
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,140
Because of this arrow?

549
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,960
Where do you get it?

550
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,800
It’s also a good thing if you know it.

551
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,240
Maybe only you can stop my foster mother.

552
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,720
Well, don’t you know this is Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

553
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,940
A lot of money is not more precious
than a professional skill.

554
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,860
It’s not easy for me to get it.

555
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,220
You go to admire the beauty of epiphyllum
in the moonlight again?

556
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,220
Can you do something special?

557
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,300
It won’t be always attractive after repeated admiration.

558
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,440
I’m experienced in it.

559
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,880
Your Highness, how about having a fight?

560
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,560
I haven’t forgiven you

561
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,240
for damaging my epiphyllum before.

562
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,300
You shouldn’t blame me,

563
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,800
because your epiphyllum
was damaged by the Fire Immortal

564
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,060
Is the name “Lord Puchi”

565
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,240
really given by your wife?

566
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,380
You really believe Jin Mi will be your wife?

567
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,280
It’s just a joke.

568
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,660
The one who wants your fiancee

569
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,960
is in Beiyuan Villa now.

570
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,220
He goes after your fiancee aboveboard,

571
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,180
and everyone knows it in the six realms.

572
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,660
Should I teach him a lesson for you?

573
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,140
I should be to blame for it.

574
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,100
I was so tolerant before,

575
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,480
so you always covet my fiancee.

576
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,400
You finally exercise your rights as her fiance?

577
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,360
If so, you will be my first enemy.

578
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,920
Jin, Jin Mi.

579
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,420
Jin Mi, wake up.

580
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,560
Jin Mi.

581
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,460
Qiang Huo.

582
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,120
You…

583
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,320
Your Majesty.

584
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,960
Your Majesty. Your Majesty, wake up.

585
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,960
Your Majesty.

586
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,460
What’s going on?

587
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,240
The snake venom in the wine
hasn’t been removed?

588
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,860
All of you drank this jar of wine?

589
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,600
Your Highness, you’re back.

590
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,500
Let’s go.

591
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,620
Your Highness.

592
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,440
"Shengjing Court"

593
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,800
Search the information about
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow for me.

594
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,480
OK, Your Highness.

595
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,660
A mermaid suddenly shed red tears,

596
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,700
let’s be together forever after this meeting.

597
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,500
Lord Beichen.

598
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,940
Is it a pen name

599
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,880
Father no longer uses?

600
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,380
Is it painted by Father?

601
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,340
Are these Magic fireballs?

602
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,460
Why does she have Magic fireballs?

603
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,640
Who’s she?

604
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,120
Your Highness, I find it.

605
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,500
Your Highness.

606
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,220
Your Highness.

607
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,880
Do we go back to Xuanji Palace?

608
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,650
I want to walk alone.

609
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,530
Go back first.

610
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,440
Mu Ci.

611
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:45,960
Mu Ci.

612
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,210
Mu Ci.

613
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,040
I have told you Mu Ci is dead.

614
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,040
Xu Feng is my adopted brother,
and Jin Mi is my good friend,

615
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,520
so you can’t hurt them.

616
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,480
If you hurt them

617
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,900
with Spirit-Vanishing Arrow again,

618
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,040
I won’t forgive you.

619
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,080
Now Spirit-Vanishing Arrow is missing.

620
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,100
I can’t find it, either,

621
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,900
so you don’t need to follow me.

622
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,380
Good.

623
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,300
If so, nobody can find it and will be hurt.

624
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,860
Return the brass strip to me.

625
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,180
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

626
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,720
You…

627
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,520
Your Highness, stop pretending.

628
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,360
Your Highness.

629
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,240
Your Highness.

630
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,700
Your Highness, are you OK?
