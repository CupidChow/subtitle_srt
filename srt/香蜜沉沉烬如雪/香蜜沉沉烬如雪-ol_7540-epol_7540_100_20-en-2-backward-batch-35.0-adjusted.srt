1
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
Ashes of Love

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
Episode 20

3
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,880
He has really become a human.

4
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,000
Help me.

5
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,400
Help me.

6
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,040
She’s from the Heaven Realm.

7
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,400
Nether Fury reappears in the world

8
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,320
It turns out that the Mieling Family still exists.

9
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,960
The person from the Mieling Family
who can summon Nether Fury

10
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,080
is definitely not ordinary.

11
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,400
Is it him?

12
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,880
Xuan

13
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,720
Demon Lord.

14
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,680
Xuan.

15
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,040
Has the prince turned better?

16
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,040
Still the same.

17
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,480
There is no sign for him to wake up.

18
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,440
The Fire Immortal said the prince would wake up

19
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,640
three days after having the Golden Reinvigorating Elixir.

20
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,160
So many days have passed,

21
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,160
but the prince still hasn’t waken up.

22
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,160
I think people from the Heaven Realm

23
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,720
is really not trustable.

24
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,000
Xu Feng.

25
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,480
I think

26
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,800
Fire Immortal deliberately

27
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,960
ignored the safety of the princes.

28
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,360
Now Prince Xuan Shou is unconscious.

29
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,680
And Prince Chi Shou is mad.

30
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,200
The future of the Demon Realm is worrying.

31
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,840
This is clearly the scheme of Heaven Realm

32
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,920
to oppress we Demon Realm.

33
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,960
If Xuan can’t wake up,

34
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,440
I will not let

35
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,159
Xu Feng, the villain from the
Heaven Realm get away with this easily.

36
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,120
He killed so many soldiers

37
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
Is he a desperate bandit?

38
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,920
A doctor with conscience should treat
patients equally regardless of their identity.

39
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,920
But this bandit look

40
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,160
this bandit has fine skin and soft skin.

41
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,680
He just got skin trauma.

42
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,400
So the blood on his body belongs to others.

43
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,960
Among so many people,

44
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,680
only you have survived.

45
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,400
You are so lucky.

46
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,760
The situation is a little tricky.

47
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,760
But you are lucky enough

48
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,760
to meet me, an outstanding doctor.

49
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,360
Otherwise, your will be in danger.

50
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,360
I am going to get you medicine now.

51
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,600
Just lie down.

52
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,120
Your wounds are not a bruise.

53
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,960
They are obviously caused by sharp weapons.

54
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,720
How come?

55
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,720
I remember at the time

56
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,520
his long knife was coming at me.

57
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,840
She’s from the Heaven Realm.

58
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,760
I suddenly felt warmth in my heart at that time.

59
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,080
When I realized what’s happening,

60
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,520
I found I just got skin trauma.

61
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,200
That guy is a coward.

62
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,040
He ran way when he failed to kill me in one strike.

63
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,480
So I don’t know

64
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,600
what has happened exactly.

65
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,200
It’s a narrow squeak.

66
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,960
Fortunately, God blesses me.

67
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,560
It’s good that you are fine.

68
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,240
Do you remember who did this?

69
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,240
The guy wore a mask.

70
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,080
I couldn’t see his face clearly.

71
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,640
Strange

72
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,040
We Saint Doctor Family lives in isolation.

73
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,920
And we are always friendly to others

74
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,920
Who wants to you?

75
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,440
I don't think his goal is me.

76
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
It’s just because I was in the way.

77
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,400
By the way,

78
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,800
be sure not to

79
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,960
tell the elders and aunt about this.

80
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,160
I just got skin trauma.

81
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,080
I don’t want them to get worried.

82
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,880
Understand?

83
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,280
I finally found you.

84
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,560
What...what are you doing here in the middle of the night?

85
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,360
I was about to ask you this question, too.

86
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,960
This millennium snow ginseng

87
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,280
is used as the guiding herb of
Longevity Qiankun Pill for King Yi.

88
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,280
Why do you take it in the middle of the night?

89
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,400
Yes.

90
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,040
I am going to use it to make medicine for King Yi.

91
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,240
Don't fool me.

92
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,920
The medicine has not been refined yet.

93
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,280
Why do you need this guiding herb?

94
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,680
Are you going to

95
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,240
use it to treat someone irrelevant ?

96
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,120
Don’t say nonsense.

97
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,120
I didn’t meet anyone irrelevant.

98
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
When I bandaged your wound,

99
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,240
you hesitated in speaking.

100
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,440
There must be something weird.

101
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,680
Is it true that you met someone

102
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,920
when you entered the mountain?

103
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,520
Doctors should be benevolent,

104
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,680
doing good deeds for other regardless of their identity.

105
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,440
Do you forget what

106
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,520
auntie teaches in daily life ?

107
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,600
Sure enough.

108
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,080
Who is it?

109
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,560
It’s good for you

110
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,120
not to know about this matter.

111
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,520
If you auntie and the elders know about this

112
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,320
you will get into trouble.

113
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,360
I can bear to see you get killed.

114
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,760
Only we two know about this.

115
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,640
As long as you don't tell others, I won't die.

116
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:38,960
Qiang Huo.

117
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,520
But

118
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,960
Jin Mi, you are the Saint Girl in our family.

119
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,760
Give it to me.

120
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,840
Give me.

121
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,000
Tell me.

122
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,840
In the one hundred years’ history
of we Saint Doctor Family,

123
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,480
we have served six Kings.

124
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,600
Did any Saint Girl

125
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
really make the medicine for longevity successfully?

126
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,200
Did any King Yi really become immortal?

127
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,160
If there is really medicine that can make people immortal,

128
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
why does the sixth generation King Yi exist?

129
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,600
The powerful people pursue long life.

130
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,880
But it’s just a dream

131
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,920
that can’t be realized.

132
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,240
And we still try to make this kind of medicine.

133
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,800
We know it;s impossible.
We are just fooling ourselves as well as others.

134
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,480
Why shouldn’t we give these herbs

135
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,040
to those in need.

136
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Anyway, I won’t let you to seek your doom.

137
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,200
We all have no reason to get killed because of you.

138
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,600
Qiang Huo. Listen.

139
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
I am a Saint Girl.

140
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,480
Don’t worry.

141
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,360
You all can count on me.

142
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,640
The worst result is that I pay him with my life.

143
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,640
Anyway, my life is at the hand of King Yi.

144
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,760
You don't cherish your life,

145
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,720
but I can't bear to see you get killed.

146
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,160
I can obey you in terms of other matters.

147
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,400
But I can’t obey you in terms of this one.

148
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,000
Qiang Huo.

149
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,560
Sorry.

150
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,160
You...again.

151
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,440
Sorry, Qiang Huo.

152
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,600
Dress for females.

153
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
Am I...

154
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,040
Am I dead?

155
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,080
And my soul comes out from my body?

156
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,800
The sleeping manner of this guy

157
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,400
is so bad.

158
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,280
He even took off his clothes when asleep.

159
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,000
The millennium snow ginseng is so awesome.

160
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,880
Why does this guy look so familiar?

161
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,880
Is he dumb?

162
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,280
How come I lost my voice?

163
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,920
Not me.

164
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,400
I also am deaf.

165
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,320
He is also deaf.

166
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,080
Why did I take this damn sword back?

167
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,480
It’s only myself to blame.

168
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,680
I...

169
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,720
I...

170
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,040
Doctor.

171
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,800
It’s me. Is she the one who saved me?

172
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,000
I bandaged your wounds.

173
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Finally he realized the truth.

174
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,200
I am your benefactor.

175
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,760
I saved you with good intention.

176
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,200
But you are so ungrateful.

177
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,600
You almost made my waist broken just now.

178
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,560
Your clothes

179
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,560
Your clothes are dirty.

180
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,560
With blood.

181
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,720
Very smelly.

182
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,400
You can't wear it.

183
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,920
You can't wear it.

184
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,120
What happened to me?

185
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,280
Who is the man in black?

186
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,640
Was he sent by Duke Nanping?

187
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,320
What do you want to say?

188
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,240
Write it down with this.

189
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,560
What’s wrong with me?

190
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,360
It’s so surprising that this bandit

191
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,120
are well-educated.

192
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,720
Good handwriting.

193
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,040
Different deceases should be treated
with different kinds of medicine.

194
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,680
Would you mind telling me about your daily diet?

195
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:37,960
Stewed razor clam with snake gourd,
stewed reeve muntjac with kusnezoff monkshood root,

196
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,720
hellebore and liquorice soup,
stewed chicken with ginseng and phumile,

197
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,040
Stewed partridge with fritillary.

198
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,440
How can a bandit

199
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,440
afford to these good meals.

200
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,720
The reason why you fainted

201
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,080
is the exhaustion of physical strength

202
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,640
after you fought with others.

203
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,640
But your deafness and dumbness

204
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,840
has been brewing for quite some time.

205
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,160
Some herbs can produce poison if combined together.

206
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,560
Poisoning?

207
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,480
Banlou,

208
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,720
snakegourd fruit, fritillaria

209
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,520
Zhushen,

210
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,440
Xinshao and Panlilu

211
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,340
In your daily meals

212
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,120
there were several dishes that are
poisonous if combined together.

213
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,840
You ate them everyday,
so the poison has been accumulated in your body.

214
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,160
If not treated in time,

215
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,040
you will die within one year.

216
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,160
Is there any treatment for this?

217
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,960
The uncommon decease

218
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,120
happens to extraordinary people.

219
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,440
It’s just a piece of cake.

220
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,800
You looked so wicked just now.

221
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,320
You almost strangled me to death.

222
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,800
Then I’ll let you try some powerful herbs.

223
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,600
In the past, I checked these herbs by eating them myself.

224
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,720
Nowadays...

225
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,440
Your Highness.

226
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,040
You don’t like the knifes and swords.

227
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,240
How come you start to train the Phoenix Troop?

228
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,760
Because my cousin likes it.

229
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,800
Only the one who has strong power can be the king.

230
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,920
If I don’t even understand any military affair,

231
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,800
how can I become a helpful wife of my cousin.

232
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
If His Majesty knows about your good intention,

233
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,240
he must be very happy.

234
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,280
By the way, don’t let other know

235
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,480
that we are secretly doing military training here.

236
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,480
When my cousin comes back,

237
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,840
I will give him this surprise.

238
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,480
Yes, Your Highness.

239
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,920
Ask them to practice hard.

240
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
If they do well, I will give them big reward.

241
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,360
Yes, Your Highness.

242
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,600
Bad news, Your Highness.

243
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,640
What happened?

244
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,720
Something bad happened to His Majesty.

245
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,600
What?

246
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,640
This time, Fire Immortal is
experiencing hardships in the Human Realm.

247
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,520
Is it true?

248
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,680
I saw him in person.

249
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,880
Fire Immortal is really a human being now.

250
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,360
He got injured badly after fighting
against about only one hundred people.

251
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,880
Since he is a human being and badly injured,

252
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,640
why didn’t he kill him?

253
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,680
My Lord.

254
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,760
I did want to kill him.

255
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,000
But when I was about to kill him,

256
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
a girl with a mask suddenly appeared.

257
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,080
I thought she was just a human.

258
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,800
But when I swept the knife toward her,

259
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,120
the knife was bounced back by a magic power.

260
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,080
She seems to have a something magic to protect herself.

261
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,880
I’m afraid there would be some
hidden soldiers from Heaven Realm.

262
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,120
I didn’t dare to take any action,

263
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,200
so I chose to come back and report this to you first.

264
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,480
You are useless.

265
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,480
You can’t even handle a badly injured human.

266
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
You are not capable of being a demon.

267
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,960
Go back and be a human.

268
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,760
Leave, now.

269
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,520
Thanks, My Lord.

270
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,520
The Mieling Family reappeared.

271
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,680
And the Fire Immortal becomes alert.

272
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,760
Is it that God wants me to die?

273
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,040
Congratulations, my Lord.

274
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,000
This is the sign of good luck.

275
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,680
Among the beings in Demon Realm

276
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,600
you are the most capacious one.

277
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,240
You words are not consistent.

278
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,720
Why did you say so?

279
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,160
If we use common knives or swords to kill Fire Immortal,

280
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,800
it will help him end his hardship experience

281
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,240
and returns to the Heaven Realm earlier,

282
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,600
which won’t bring any benefit to us.

283
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,640
So in your opinion,

284
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,880
we can just make him

285
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
live happily in the Human Realm?

286
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,600
My Lord, do you forget

287
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,800
the Mieling Arrow?

288
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,080
Fire Immortal is experiencing hardships,

289
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,240
and coincidentally the Mieling Family
reappears in the world.

290
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,320
Isn’t it a good chance for us?

291
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,800
You mean

292
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,920
To steal the Mieling Arrow

293
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,920
and use it to kill Fire Immortal?

294
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,640
You are so wise, my Lord.

295
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,000
We can take this good chance

296
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,160
to get justice for the two princes.

297
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,640
In the past, with the Fire Immortal,

298
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,440
the Heaven Realm made discreet remarks on Demon Realm,

299
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,320
attempting to impose their artificial rules

300
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,600
on us

301
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,560
and disturbing us.

302
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,640
Even if not for the sake of

303
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,800
my miserable sons,

304
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,960
I won’t make any compromise again.

305
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,240
You have always been reliable.

306
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,640
This matter is left up to you.

307
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,920
Remember.

308
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,040
Don’t let

309
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,200
King of Bian City, the old guy know about our plan.

310
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,040
Yes, my Lord.

311
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,880
Xu Feng,

312
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,040
I must take revenge on you for my sons.

313
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,040
My sons,

314
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,000
I want to kill Fire Immortal and Qiong Qi

315
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,760
to take revenge for you.

316
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Your Majesty.

317
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,960
Look.

318
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,800
So this is Mieling Arrow
made from your blood and bones.

319
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

320
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,640
How to use it?

321
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,680
Shoot the arrow with strong power.

322
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,440
It can kill all living beings,

323
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,120
destroying their souls.

324
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,360
And they will be dead forever.

325
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,680
Very good.

326
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,040
I have already told Fairy Yuan about this.

327
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,360
Take actions without any worries.

328
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

329
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,080
If Jin Mi, the sprite returns to the Heaven Realm.

330
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,560
It will be your fault.

331
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

332
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,880
I must have been bewitched.

333
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
How come I took such a risk

334
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,040
to treat him with the precious herb.

335
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,000
Is it the so-called conciseness of doctors?

336
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,560
Leave t it. Leave it.

337
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,040
Since you are the first patient

338
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
that I have taken care of in person

339
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,600
I did this for you as a greeting gift.

340
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Use my grape to remove the bitterness.

341
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,160
Is it sweet?

342
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,520
It is very sweet, right?

343
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,120
It seems that it’s very sweet.

344
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
So sour.

345
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,960
Extremely sour. It’s not sweet at all.

346
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,240
Liar.

347
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,800
How dare you to tease me.

348
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,920
I like sour food.

349
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,560
You turn out to be a jealous man.

350
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Your wife will be unlucky.

351
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,760
When will I recover?

352
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,400
Within half a month, you will recover completely.

353
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,960
May I have your name?

354
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,160
Life in the mountains is slower than that in outside world.

355
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,160
The world has changed a lot.

356
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,800
Maybe you should ask me how old I am

357
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,760
Since the moment when I can keep a record of things,

358
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,640
I have learned these mysterious

359
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,160
and ambiguous words.

360
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,160
Otherwise, how can I build my authority
among the people of my family,

361
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,640
including the old ones

362
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,640
and the young ones.

363
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,280
Judging from your appearance, you are of my age.

364
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,280
But in terms of skills,

365
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,560
you can call me master.

366
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,560
She is young,

367
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,840
but her words and manners are inconsistent with her age.

368
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,840
Is she really a wise person?

369
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,080
Or is she just bluffing?

370
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,760
Why do you provoke those soldiers?

371
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,480
They are from Liangguo.

372
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,040
They are from Liangguo.

373
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,680
So what?

374
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,040
They invade my country and took women and kids

375
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,280
They have done so many misdeeds.
We all have the right to punish them.

376
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,040
Your have a great mind.

377
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,360
Why didn’t you join the army?

378
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,880
Why are you a bandit instead?

379
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,000
I got it.

380
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,600
The world is in chaos.

381
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,800
Soldiers and bandits are family.

382
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,640
I got it. Got it.

383
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,240
You are admirable.

384
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,400
I’m not kidding.

385
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Why is this bandit

386
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,080
so bad-tempered?

387
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,080
Everything was OK just now.

388
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,400
But now he suddenly becomes angry

389
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,960
and ignore me again.

390
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Your face is so dark, like a crow.

391
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,320
Well, you really look like crow.

392
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,720
I will call you crow from now on.

393
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,680
Crow.

394
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,680
Crow.

395
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
Why did you save my life?

396
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,400
Don't talk about the conciseness of doctors.

397
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,000
I don’t believe it at all.

398
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,280
You look handsome.

399
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,040
You should thank your parents,

400
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
endowing you with such good look.

401
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,800
I won't feel bad

402
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
about using those precious herbs to treat you.

403
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,880
It’s the rule of survival.
The doctors are just following the rule.

404
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,400
The person chosen by the God will be blessed.

405
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,880
Don’t forget to share the bless with people in need.

406
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,720
Hundreds of people died,

407
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,960
making the mountain smelly.

408
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,560
Only you survived.

409
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,600
Who else should I pick?

410
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,640
You were picked by me.

411
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,080
So you might as well try the medicine for me,

412
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,080
which can be regarded as a bless
you give us Saint Doctor Family.

413
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,240
Other people use hands to play chess,

414
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,400
but we use them to write and chat.

415
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,880
I have no time to chat with you now.

416
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,200
I’m going to go down the mountain

417
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,200
and buy some food.

418
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,200
See you.

419
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,840
Don’t worry.

420
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,480
I will manage to find some clothes that fit you.

421
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,640
But you look pretty

422
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,160
in dress for females.

423
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,040
Village girl.

424
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,880
Your Highness.

425
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,880
Many days has passed.

426
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,120
Haven’t you got in touch with His Majesty?

427
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Shence House has sent out twelve teams of soldiers

428
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,120
to every county to look for His Majesty secretly.

429
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,720
It won’t work by just sending twelve teams of hidden guards.

430
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,160
Why not send a larger troop?

431
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,480
At the moment, the soldiers of Lingguo are stationing
at the border, attempting to invade our country.

432
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,720
During this time of troubles, people are in panic.

433
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,440
The dukes negotiated and has reach an agreement

434
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,560
that this matter should be handled secretly.

435
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,320
The situation is very urgent now.

436
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,320
If something bad happened to my cousin,

437
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,800
who can take the responsibility?

438
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,600
I will devote my life to His Majesty.

439
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,800
Here is a message.

440
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,680
It’s very urgent, General Qin.

441
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,320
What is it?

442
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
According to the messengers, His Majesty and his followers

443
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,440
were attacked by the soldiers of Liangguo
at the Luoye Moutain ten days ago.

444
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,760
Did they see His Majesty?

445
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,040
His Majesty is missing.

446
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,080
All the guards died.

447
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,320
All of them die for their duty.

448
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,800
How many enemy soldiers did they encounter?

449
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
There about two hundred bodies
of the enemy soldier in the mountains.

450
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,120
They all were killed.

451
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,400
On the day when His Majesty went hunting,

452
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,800
he just took 18 guards,

453
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,800
who weren’t well armed.

454
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,400
I am going to discuss this with dad and find a solution.

455
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,200
Your Highness.

456
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,840
You haven’t got married yet.
How come you say this?

457
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,480
Where’s your manner?

458
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,680
I have been engaged with him for 18 years.

459
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,920
The engagement

460
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,480
was made by the past king.

461
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,600
People of Huaiwu know about this.
Nobody dares to laugh at me.

462
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,440
I have already consider myself

463
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,080
as a member of the Palace of King Yi.

464
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,920
I will live and die with him.

465
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,200
If he is fine, it will be great.

466
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,800
If he dies,

467
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,360
I am will be his widow.

468
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,480
I’m serious.

469
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,800
I just have one daughter, you,

470
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,280
you hurt my feelings so much by saying like this.

471
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,560
I’m not filial. Sorry to make you sad, dad.

472
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,480
I said like this just to make you know

473
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,840
that I will do anything

474
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,520
for my cousin.

475
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,160
I understand.

476
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,680
I understand all.

477
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,280
Alright.

478
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,360
Stand up.

479
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,840
Calm down.

480
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,320
I also just heard the news,

481
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,720
and discussed it with grand preceptors

482
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,520
We have both internal and external troubles.

483
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,280
So we must find a perfect solution..

484
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,640
Speed is the soldier’s asset.

485
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,000
I will wait until the mid-night.

486
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,560
If you still can't find a solution.

487
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,440
I took my Phoenix Troop first

488
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,680
to look for him in the Luoye Mountain.

489
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,720
Don’t take risk.

490
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,200
I will handle this.

491
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,400
Don’t not worry.

492
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,280
I will persuade the grand preceptors

493
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,520
to take His Majesty back.

494
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,200
Thank you, daddy.

495
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,680
I am waiting for your news.

496
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,880
Why?

497
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,440
You are deaf and dumb.

498
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,480
But you have sound hands and legs.

499
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,200
Why do you make me help you get changed?

500
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,200
Do the doctors in the outside world

501
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,880
have the duty of help patients get changed?

502
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,480
Who made the rule?

503
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,880
Hurry.

504
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,680
Help me get changed.

505
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,680
I, a Saint Girl

506
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,480
am reduced to be your servant.

507
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,800
It’s too bad.

508
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,240
The soldiers of Liangguo

509
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,920
are so useless.

510
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,960
They, so many of them couldn’t even

511
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,040
handle King Yi.

512
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,400
We even need to cope with the aftermath for them.

513
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,560
You lead some soldiers to search around Luoye Mountain.

514
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,840
Take his dead body.

515
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,440
Yes.

516
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,880
These are good herbs that can cool the blood, stop bleeding,

517
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,800
remove blood stasis and expel pus.

518
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,280
The juice of the herbs penetrates from the pores of your hands.

519
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,280
It can address both the symptoms
and the root causes, which is very effective.

520
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,160
Finally I have someone to help me wash these

521
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,360
stinging herbs.

522
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,239
The white powders are for external application.

523
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,440
She always covers her face with the veil.

524
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,120
She has profound medical skills,
and deals with affairs wisely.

525
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,680
Sometimes she fails to master the worldly wisdom.

526
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,920
Is she from the Saint Doctor Family?

527
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,040
This is not what a gentleman should do.

528
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,960
Since she saved me, she won’t hurt me.

529
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,800
Everyone has something embarrassing to mention.

530
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,800
She will let me see her face

531
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,000
when she is wiling to.

532
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,600
Sorry to have troubled you these days.

533
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,440
Take a good rest.

534
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,320
Although he is a bandit who killed many people.

535
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,320
But I find he’s not a bad guy

536
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,440
during these days of being together.

537
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,080
He’s very disciplined.

538
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,880
So being a bandit is not what he desires.

539
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,640
In troubled times, everyone
has his or her own difficulties.

540
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,160
I shouldn’t tease him anymore.

541
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,360
I should provide medical treatment to him.

542
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,160
Girl, look at our wind chime.

543
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,120
And this one.

544
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,600
Look. It’s so beautiful.

545
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,680
Buy one.

546
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,800
He uses invisibility spell even on the street.

547
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,800
So sneaky

548
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,080
Is he a hidden guard?

549
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,400
Declare that you will reward
your hidden guards and demons

550
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,320
if they arrest and kill the remaining
member of Mieling Family.

551
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,320
Search for the Mieling Arrow.

552
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,600
I don’t know how many members of Mieling Family are still alive,

553
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,120
and how many Mieling Arrows are existing.

554
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,120
Do you know about this, my Lord?

555
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,480
Take them all back.

556
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,040
You don’t have to take the first one back.

557
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,680
Take it and use it to kill Xu Feng in the Human Realm.

558
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,720
If you catch the living members of Mieling Family

559
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,960
or know where they are,

560
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,560
Tell me immediately.

561
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,920
Mu Ci.

562
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,240
Xu Feng

563
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,480
Yes.

564
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
If this news leaks out...

565
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,240
Trespassing my house

566
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,360
and eavesdropping

567
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,520
are the manners of your family?

568
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,920
Kill me if you wants. Don’t mention my father.

569
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,400
I will kill you.

570
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,120
And I will also kill your father.

571
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,320
I think you are also scheming against the Demon Lord.

572
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,600
Hiding from the Demon Lord,

573
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,880
you secretly are looking for Mieling Arrow
and members of Mieling Family.

574
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,880
Your wide ambitions

575
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,440
are so obvious.

576
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,440
Kill her.

577
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,000
Liu Ying has repeatedly interfered with me.

578
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,960
Transmit my order.

579
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,440
Say it’s Demon Lord’s requirement.

580
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,600
Kill

581
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,000
Liu Ying, who is from Bian City.

582
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,120
Yes, my Lord.
