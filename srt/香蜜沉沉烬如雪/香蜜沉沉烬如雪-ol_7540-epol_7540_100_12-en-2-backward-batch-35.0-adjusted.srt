1
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,940
“Ashes of Love”

2
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,090
"Episode 12"

3
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,530
Earth Immortal, how may I help you?

4
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,190
Greetings to Night Immortal.

5
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,360
I'm going to report myself
at the mansion of Lord Lao.

6
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,450
I've come here to bid farewell to
Your Highness and Mister Ling Guang.

7
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:07,620
Unfortunately, Lord Fire Immortal and
Mister Ling Guang are not here.

8
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,960
And this fairy is?

9
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,510
The birthday of the Heavenly Empress is coming up.

10
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,430
Every immortal will celebrate the birthday.

11
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,390
If you catch up the Celebration now,

12
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,470
you would probably get a blessing from the Heavenly Empress.

13
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,200
Thank you so much for telling me that! My lord.

14
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,070
I've always heard that Night Immortal
is the kindest in the Heaven realm.

15
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,050
Now I can see that you are just as good as others said.

16
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
You don't have to thank me.

17
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,940
And for the so called goddess....

18
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,940
Don't you think the sun is too bright today? It may hurt your eyes.

19
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,220
ohhhhhh

20
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,490
Yes, yes, yes! You are right, my lord!

21
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,600
I'm getting old, and my vision gets blurry sometime

22
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,040
I didn't see anything at all!

23
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,550
If there's no order to take

24
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,340
I'd better get going now

25
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,260
Leave

26
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,940
Good-bye, my lord.

27
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,579
The Fish Fairy, today is the celebration of Heavenly Empress' birthday

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,200
Wouldn't you go attend the celebration?

29
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,440
No worries, I'm not in a hurry

30
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,460
There’s a lot of time before the Celebration starts.

31
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,320
What’s more,

32
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,600
there are more than millions gods and fairies
from Heaven to Earth, and from all directions.

33
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,800
No one would notice if I was not there. It's not a big deal for me.

34
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,220
But Phoenix has already visited the Heavenly Empress in the early morning

35
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,070
Would the Heavenly Empress get angry if you don't go?

36
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,500
Phoenix and I are different for the Heavenly Empress.

37
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,760
If I visited her earlier, she would have been upset

38
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,140
Why would she be like that?

39
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,210
The Heavenly Empress is not my biological mother.

40
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,960
Sorry for being so nosy. So...
which goddess is your biological mother?

41
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,300
My biological mother is not a goddess and has no position in the Heaven Palace.

42
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,380
I heard that she is only a spirit

43
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,680
can't be more common.

44
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,940
Though she is just a little spirit, so unnoticeable

45
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,680
She still cannot escape her miserable fate
and keep herself from danger. She is dead

46
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,140
I don't have any memory of my childhood,

47
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,280
and also don't know who on earth is my biological mother

48
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,140
I just know that after the death of my biological mother

49
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,040
I was adopted by Heavenly Empress

50
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,860
There used to be time that Heavenly Empress and I could get along with each other.

51
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,760
But, as time goes

52
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,700
Heavenly Empress became more and more worried that

53
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,860
I would compete with Phoenix for the throne

54
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,720
That's why Heavenly Empress gradually isolates me

55
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,920
What about you? Who is your parents?

56
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,180
Mr. Hu told me, I am a grape vine that empowered by Chief Peony

57
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,980
A grape vine?

58
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,780
But you just make hail happens

59
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,180
That’s supposed to be water-related magic

60
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,040
Oh, Phoenix told me that my body is suitable for being cultivated by water.

61
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,940
So, I started learn water-related magic.

62
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,020
Now that I can't make buns with my magic

63
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,040
I will still keep my word. Let's go out to get some buns, Fish Fairy!

64
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,080
Let's go!

65
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,640
These are your buns, enjoy the meal!

66
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,640
Little two (waiter), a plate of buns please!

67
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,970
OK, wait a minute!

68
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,300
Little two? What is that?

69
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,280
Is there little three, little four, little five?

70
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,360
Little three (nickname for the mistress), Can I have the menu please!

71
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,820
Little three!

72
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,450
Are you insane! Don't bother us having lunch!

73
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,300
What’s wrong with them? Are they afraid that I would cut in line?

74
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,600
Fairy Jin Mi,

75
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,600
in mortal world, "little three" can't be used casually.

76
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,240
Are you ready to order?

77
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,360
Things are so weird in human world,

78
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,370
why I can call people "little two", but cannot call them "little three"

79
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,600
That is so pedantic.

80
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,280
Fruit pancake?!

81
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,400
You guys are so cruel!!

82
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,740
Fairy Jin Mi, the "fruit" is not what you thought of.

83
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,460
The "fruit" here just refers to the crust.

84
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,490
Oh, I get it.

85
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:14,280
it almost freaks me out.

86
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:20,409
So can I have this, and two cups of soymilk?

87
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,520
Alright.

88
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:26,200
Does Fairy Jin Mi know that the breakfast in human world is very delicious and has many kinds.

89
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,960
It can compete with the breakfast in Heaven. Sometimes, human breakfast can be better than ours.

90
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,700
I'm ready to try the human delicacy

91
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,890
This are your crab buns, enjoy the meal please!

92
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,900
Sorry, Fish Fairy

93
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,560
Never mind.

94
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,140
Fish Fairy, your magic is awesome.

95
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,040
to be honest

96
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,040
I think you should attend the Birthday Celebration
of Heavenly Empress.

97
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,300
I know that the relationship between you two are not close

98
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,060
but it would get worse, if you don't go

99
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,880
Even though Heavenly Empress maybe upset for your presence,

100
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,560
You've tried your best to do what you should do as the son of Heavenly Empress.

101
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,560
You don't own anyone.

102
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,180
like the relationship between me and Chief Peony

103
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,600
though I'm really afraid of her,

104
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,560
it is impossible for me not to attend her Birthday Celebration

105
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,380
I agree with you

106
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,580
okay, I will return to Heaven Realm after finishing the breakfast.

107
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,720
my lord

108
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,200
why are you coming here?

109
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,940
My lord, you asked me earlier to find a good-looking china for dews collected at night

110
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,080
how do you think about this one?

111
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,500
To be honest, you don't need to show me how good it is

112
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,440
What your father Immortal Tai Si has

113
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,980
is absolutely nice

114
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,570
you've already found out who I am

115
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,240
How long do you want to hide your true identity?

116
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,000
The dew that is irradiated by the starlight is precious

117
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,720
For the past three years,

118
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,290
you have been guarding the sky

119
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,240
and gathering the dew.

120
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,440
It must have taken a lot of effort.

121
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,270
Is it a gift to the empress?

122
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,310
Let's go.

123
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,050
they are all going to attend the Birthday Celebration.

124
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,900
leave me here alone

125
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,670
it is so boring!

126
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,250
I should not let Fish Fairy go to the Celebration

127
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,920
who can hang out with me!!!!!

128
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,120
Lord Puchi! I know it's you!

129
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,670
I'm on the way to the Birthday Celebration, and just got to the 4th layer of the sky

130
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,930
I felt a strong power that dragged me here

131
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,260
Tell me when your power starts being so strong

132
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,620
Maybe because Phoenix has given me a thousand-year power

133
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,800
last night, I was so smart to ask Phoenix to give me a huge red packet

134
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,300
That could be the reason

135
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,860
But we haven't met for a half day

136
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,580
why you are so hurry to call me here

137
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,200
Is it because you are dying to see me?

138
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,800
Not at all. Phoenix and Fish Fairy went to the Birthday Celebration

139
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,120
I am so bored for staying here, alone

140
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,960
Since you are here

141
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,500
Let's hang out together!

142
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,920
Today is a Big day for Heaven Realm! All gods have to celebrate Heavenly Empress's Birthday.

143
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,040
Don't you want to join the Celebration and have fun?

144
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,780
I do want to go

145
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,620
No no. I can't

146
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,610
I can't go

147
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,030
There are so many gods gathering together

148
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,960
If the Chief Peony knows that I were there

149
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,230
She would catch me back home

150
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:26,070
I've heard that Heavenly Empress have prepared

151
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,820
thousands holy peach ( looks like donut peach) to treat the gods

152
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,400
The holy peach is from the holy peach tree

153
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,860
which has grown for thousand years and watered by holy water

154
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,220
It gives fruits every three thousand years.

155
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,040
it tastes juicy and delicious,
and it is good for empowering your magic

156
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,260
Take me there please!

157
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,370
Don't you be afraid of exposing yourself?

158
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,760
there would be so many gods gathering there

159
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,120
if i'm lucky enough, I would met Da Luo Jin Xian,

160
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,860
He could save my friend Rou Rou!

161
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,440
If I couldn't meet him, I could still treat my self with the holy peach to empower myself

162
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,580
Lord Puchi, Lord Puchi

163
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,280
Take me there, please, please!

164
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,440
We are friends!

165
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,560
If you take me there, I will keep away from you and be careful,

166
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,050
it you wouldn't take me there

167
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,530
Well, I could find a way on my own!

168
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,450
Since we are friends, I can take you there

169
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,010
Do you guys have invitations?

170
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,920
I'm a close friend of the God - Under-the-moon,

171
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,090
let us pass please

172
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,550
That's unfortunate.

173
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,920
Today is a big day, it's the birthday of Heavenly Empress.

174
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,580
The Northern Heavenly Gate and the Southern Gate
won't open for those who don't have invitations.

175
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,340
I am a very close friend of the God -Under...

176
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,100
Come on.

177
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,660
I've never expected that mentioning the title of the God Under the Moon still wouldn't let us pass...

178
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,460
these two heaven Guardians are so strict and stubborn

179
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,240
Wait!

180
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,490
How can you get this?!

181
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,980
What?

182
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,860
I've find a pass card, we don't have to waste our time arguing with those guards. let's go!

183
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,220
Excuse me, please

184
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,670
See!

185
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,790
My apology! Please get in!

186
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,490
Wow.

187
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,460
I‘ve never thought that the feather can work as a pass card

188
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,400
Phoenix is really a bird with so many pass cards

189
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,020
It is the treasure of Fire Immortal, of course, it represents power

190
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,460
Take care of it, it would help you someday

191
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,530
Why you have to leave so early?

192
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,660
It won't be late if you stay till the Birthday Celebration ends

193
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,200
I've got the message from fatgher in the early morning,

194
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,920
saying that the lords of the cities
started fighting each other again

195
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,780
I have to leave as soon as I can, to calm down the fight

196
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,540
I just got in and gave birthday wishes to Heavenly Empress

197
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,360
It is emergency, if I am not polite enough
according to Heaven manners,

198
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,720
please forgive me

199
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,160
Okay, take care of yourself, if you need help, just let me know

200
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,170
I am still confused about one thing

201
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,640
I hope you could explain to me honestly

202
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,270
I will

203
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,630
Don't you love Fairy Jin Mi?

204
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,180
Why I heard that Princess Sui He is going to get married with you?

205
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:25,240
I'm not interested in getting married

206
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,860
It maybe just rumors spread by Heavenly Empress

207
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,760
Sorry, Brother Feng, I misunderstood you

208
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,290
That you just played around and never took Fairy Jin Mi seriously

209
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,120
But,

210
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,180
Fairy Jin Mi and I

211
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,800
are unable to be together

212
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,720
My beauty, are you alright?

213
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,210
I dont know why

214
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,930
my heart feels so painful

215
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,230
Let me see!

216
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,850
Stop!

217
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,660
Do you feel better?

218
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,320
I feel much better now

219
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,060
I feel the pain this time!

220
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,450
Let’s go

221
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,240
It is so spacious

222
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,790
There are so many people here

223
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,520
You’ve lived in the Water Mirror for a long time
and haven't experience so much before

224
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,440
Today, I will show you the world!

225
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,160
Sit, sit, take your seat!

226
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,820
So much food!

227
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,190
Do you wanna eat this?

228
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,860
-No, I want to eat that one
-okay, I will take this!

229
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,300
Don't be so surprised, you are so inexperience!

230
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,780
This is the Wushan Goddess, Yao Ji

231
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,080
She is chubby in a very sexy way,

232
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,480
but her waist is kinda thick, not my type

233
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,810
This is the Nvying from Xiangshui

234
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,300
People love her weak posture

235
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,360
But a goddess who is as weak as Tou Fu is not attractive either

236
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,280
It would be better to add some heroic spirit

237
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,850
Who is it?

238
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,310
The female hero, Jing Wei, who used to be a bird,

239
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,940
pecking stones to bury the sea, and force the king of the Dragon to move around

240
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,540
But her personality is so strong, no man could bear it

241
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,990
Lord Puchi, you are so knowledgable, why you know everything

242
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,500
Have you heard The Beauty Encyclopedia before?

243
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,120
I wrote it!!

244
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:46,960
But there are not so many beauties nowadays

245
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:50,190
Speaking of the ex- god of flower Zi Fen

246
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,990
She is the most beautiful one that no one can compare with

247
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,120
Sad that the beauty always can't live long

248
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,820
Lord Lao is here.

249
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,200
Who are those two?

250
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,380
The man is Water immortal, the woman is Wind immortal

251
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,930
They are unhappy couples

252
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:45,890
They got married for many years, but still treated each other respectfully as guests

253
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,040
They don't even have a kid till now

254
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:55,720
I feel that Water immortal looks so elegant

255
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,440
Your taste is really good

256
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:57,880
The Water immortal has been ranked no.1 on the most handsome faces among whole realms for 10 thousand years

257
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,460
But he's also getting old now

258
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,620
Of course, it also because of the handsome young man like me,

259
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,080
So that the rank of Water immortal has been lowered

260
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,120
I don't know why

261
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,540
But I feel so calmed and relaxed after I saw Water immortal

262
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,580
And he looks so familiar to me

263
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,980
Familiar to you? you'd better be kidding me

264
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,680
Water immortal is detached from the outside

265
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,880
And he is indifferent to others

266
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,760
It is possible that looking at him could make you feel calmed and relaxed

267
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,120
But he is not the type of guy who would look familiar to you

268
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,150
Except Floral Realm

269
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,120
The birthday celebration of Heavenly Empress gathers all goddess from Heaven to Earth

270
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,440
Does it indicate that Heavenly Empress would arrange the marriage of Fire Immortal at the Celebration?

271
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,220
Hey friends! So today is the day for the selection for Phoenix's potential wife?

272
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,620
Yeah, you are right!

273
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,860
I bet you a holy wine that Jing Wei would win!

274
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,780
But I heard that Fire Immortal likes male fairies rather than female fairies

275
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,940
Earlier before, there is a good-looking Page Boy attendant with him

276
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,790
Fire Immortal seems to love that young attendant very much

277
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,660
Later, the attendant uses some magic to turn himself into a female fairy

278
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,580
So she is abandoned by Fire Immortal

279
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,850
Fire Immortal is in high position, which seems to be powerful

280
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,080
But he can't make decisions on his own marriage

281
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,080
His marriage is just a power game

282
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,200
Heavenly Empress, Heavenly Empress, Fire Immortal, Night Immortal are coming

283
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:05,760
Happy birthday, Heavenly Empress, wish you live long and prosper!!

284
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,150
Everyone, sit down please!

285
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,180
Thank you all for coming to my birthday celebration!

286
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,800
You guys bring so much fun in the Palace

287
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,100
I feel so happy now

288
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,780
Alright, let's start the banquet!

289
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,160
You’ve just promised me that

290
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,360
You will never let Lord Puchi get close to Fairy Jin Mi

291
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
Now what is this?!

292
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,820
My bad, I will try to let him out

293
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,580
Let them be this time. I don't want to make troubles on the birthday celebration. watch out for these two

294
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,320
Why the bird gets upset again for no reason

295
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,260
Has he found out that I tricked him for one thousand year magic power?

296
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,520
Fish Fairy!

297
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,730
Why Fish Fairy becomes weird too

298
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:03,940
Coming to this Birthday Celebration really makes him feel so bad

299
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:07,540
Let’s eat something, take this, take this

300
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,360
Lord Liaoyuan

301
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,670
send order to General Po Jun, double the Heaven guardians to guard the Heaven Palace

302
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,970
Yes, your honor

303
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,500
Who is this one?

304
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,840
He is Rat Fairy

305
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,590
Rat Fairy?!

306
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,210
Rat is the scariest thing in the world, I don't like mice

307
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,380
He is not a common rat

308
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,140
He’s our boss in the Chinese zodiac

309
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,920
He is really smart and talented. He is a good player of chess

310
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,360
When your favourite Water immortal was detached from the outside world,

311
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,610
the Rat Fairy is the only one that accompanied with the Water immortal to play chess

312
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,000
Did he?

313
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,250
So he is a nice guy

314
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,900
Run Yu wishes Heavenly Empress

315
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,520
live long and prosper

316
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,540
Night Immortal has become increasingly frugal recently

317
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:22,520
you come to the banquet only with the wooden hair pin

318
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:23,040
I appreciated your simple personality

319
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,140
But...

320
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,940
It looks like something from Floral Realm

321
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,740
Reply to Heavenly Empress

322
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,060
It is just a usual hair pin made from a vine

323
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,760
How can such a usual thing

324
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,580
get into the eyes of Night Immortal?

325
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,510
The vine is a gift from a very special friend of mine

326
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,820
It is meaningful to me

327
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,450
Jade hairpin, diamond hairpin,

328
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,080
gold hairpin,

329
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,060
those are very rare and expensive

330
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,540
But for me, they are all worthless compared with this vine hairpin

331
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,320
Today is Heavenly Empress's Birthday Celebration,

332
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,360
I think the vine hairpin is a perfect match

333
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,600
Exactly, Fish Fairy is really my best friend!

334
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,600
This vine looks interesting

335
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,620
Could you tell me who gave you this?

336
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,680
Whether this one attends the banquet today?

337
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,160
Reply to Heavenly Empress, this friend
is neither a god nor a spirit, she is not here today

338
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,300
What a pity!

339
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,000
It must be a very special existence

340
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,560
Next time, if there's a banquet

341
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,580
Please remember to send him an invitation!

342
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,040
Fish Fairy is so smart!

343
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,920
But Heavenly Emperor is so sharp

344
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,500
He has never met me before

345
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,380
but he could tell my personality only by a grape vine

346
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,300
such an accurate comment on my personality

347
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,160
Rat! Rat!

348
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,340
The Fairy guest, watch your manner!!

349
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,000
What are you doing?

350
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,350
This is The Empyrean Heaven! it is impossible to find a rat here!

351
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,770
Hahhah, Sorry that my little friend scared you guys! It is totally my fault!

352
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,880
You, such a naughty thing!

353
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,820
Who are you?

354
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,870
Why do you hide your true identity with the illusion magic at my banquet!

355
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,000
Heavenly Empress!

356
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,330
It's you! God of Flower from Flower Palace -- Zi Fen!

357
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,540
You took a good care of your skin!

358
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,540
You look so young,

359
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,050
and prettier than before!

360
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,510
God of wine! Are you drunk or insane?!

361
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,520
Zi Fen has been dead for thousand years

362
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,940
Exactly!

363
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,860
God of Wine, you'd better be sober now!

364
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,540
This is not Zi Fen!

365
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,440
This is the attendant of Xu Feng -- Jin Mi!

366
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,440
The red threads in my palace are all messed up.

367
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,140
It made me dizzy trying to untie those knots

368
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,870
So that I forgot the time.

369
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,500
Hope that my brother and sister won't blame me.

370
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,790
This is Jin Mi, it's really nice to see Heavenly Empress and Empress

371
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,140
Jin Mi... you look just like her...

372
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,140
Could you tell me where you are from, Fairy Jin Mi?

373
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,540
Brother, you are so isolated from the outside world

374
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,980
Jin Mi just lived in Phoenix's Palace

375
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,860
Phoenix has taken care of her for a long time

376
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,980
My son, could you tell me where you could find a fairy so pretty like this?

377
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,280
Jin Mi is randomly picked up by Phoenix

378
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,940
No, Fairy fox misunderstood

379
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,260
I picked up Phoenix by accident

380
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,490
I feel shy to mention it...

381
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,500
But I have saved Phoenix's life for three times

382
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,140
Are you the one who gave the night spirit the hairpin made from a vine

383
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,720
and helped Fire Immortal go through trials and tribulations?

384
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,660
Yes, that is me

385
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,860
as you just said

386
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,760
Heavenly Empress and I have to thank Fairy Jin Mi for saving our son's lives

387
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,220
My pleasure! Not worth to mentioning it!

388
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,780
It’s not a big deal

389
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,230
Could you tell us

390
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,730
where did you meet Fire Immortal by accident?

391
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,580
in The Water Mirror!

392
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:30,100
Oh! Why did I say that! Chiefs would definitely catch me back home.

393
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,460
Fairy Jin Mi, Are you a Flower Fairy?

394
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,820
NO

395
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,870
I am just a spirit of fruit

396
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Fruit?

397
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,060
I am a spirit of grape

398
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,420
Could you tell us how old are you?

399
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,790
Around 4 thousand years

400
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,980
I could understand that Heavenly Empress and Empress want to find a good match for the Phoenix

401
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,980
But she is just a shy little girl

402
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,080
Please don't be so straight forward

403
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,600
I heard that Sui He prepared something special for Empress's Birthday

404
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,300
She prepared a dance called Feathers Dancing in Clouds

405
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,650
Don’t know if Heavenly Empress is ready to watch it with me

406
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,800
Sure

407
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,000
Let’s go and sit there

408
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,710
Take a seat

409
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,260
All the bird fairies and I, wish Heavenly Empress Happy Birthday!

410
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,100
Wish the Empress live long and prosper

411
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,060
You are so sweet Sui He

412
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:29,980
I wouldn't ask for more if Phoenix could be as considerate as you

413
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,020
Thank you so much for the compliment!

414
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,280
I was nothing compared to Fire Immortal

415
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,190
Fire Immortal is such a fierce fighter conquering around

416
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,260
We are family

417
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,240
We should spend more time together and become more intimate

418
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,520
Please sit by Xu Feng's side

419
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,240
And it would be more convenient for me to talk with you

420
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,030
Today is auntie's birthday.

421
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,860
Let’s drink more holy wine to celebrate

422
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:17,180
Mi, how do you feel when watching this scene? Aren't you jealous?

423
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,620
You do feel jealous!

424
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,210
I don't feel anything at all

425
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,970
I just feel so familiar with this scene

426
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,620
Heavenly Empress, see these two

427
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,920
Sitting there

428
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:37,080
The scene is like the picture that hangs on the wall at my personal palace

429
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,220
The picture depicts a lovely couple walking in the spring drizzling rain

430
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:47,230
I remember that there's a title for the picture, "A Perfect Match of Pearl and Jade"

431
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,990
Oh, yeah! I remembered it!
It is exactly A Perfect Match of Pearl and Jade!

432
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,910
I saw the scene from the Picture book
--Tianxiang Secret book

433
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,740
So the Peacock Fairy has done spirit training with Phoenix

434
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,090
You are talking nonsense!

435
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,840
I did not make it up

436
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,180
I just wonder if the Peacock Princess is willing to share me some tips about spirit training

437
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,300
So that we can increase our magic power and make a progress together!

438
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,460
How dare you say that!

439
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,180
How dare you say those offensive things!

440
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,380
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess! Drag her out of this holy palace and kill her immediately!

441
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,550
Wait!

442
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,240
Today is Heavenly Empress's birthday, it is supposed to be a day full of joy!

443
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,580
It is not a day for killing. Reconsider your decision please, Mother!

444
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,020
This kid is from Floral Realm. I'm afraid that she knows nothing about Heaven disciplines

445
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:31,940
Please be merciful, Heavenly Empress!

446
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,240
What she said is just so offensive and indecent

447
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,380
It offended our dignity and honor

448
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,380
It is impossible for me to forgive it

449
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,140
Calm down, Heavenly Empress

450
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,880
If you want to punish her, please punish me first

451
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,440
Jin Mi is my best friend

452
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,380
If it is not me telling her that today is the birthday celebration

453
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,100
Jin Mi wouldn't be here

454
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,090
I will take full responsibility of that

455
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,680
your hairpin has the other pair, hasn't it?

456
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,140
So, if the spirit of grape is the one you just mentioned? Is she your best friend who gave you the hairpin?

457
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,480
If my memory is correct

458
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,740
Night Immortal just mentioned that the one who gave you the vine hairpin is not here

459
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,420
So you were lying to us

460
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,680
Do you intend to take the blame

461
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,660
to cover her up?

462
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,120
I am willing to take any punishment

463
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,720
and won't complain a word!

464
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,300
Phoenix Feather!

465
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,660
I don't know that Phoenix Feather is as powerful as an Amulet!

466
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
Xu Feng!

467
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,800
Hope Heavenly Empress would forgive her this time!

468
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,180
Empress, please, give her one more chance

469
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,980
How dare you! The Snake Fairy!

470
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,290
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess, catch them!

471
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,180
Yes, Your highness!

472
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,220
Sorry for interrupting your birthday, Heavenly Empress

473
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,960
I will take the responsibility and the punishment after coJin Mig back

474
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,320
Xu Feng!

475
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,500
It is my fault, I can't let Fire Immortal take the responsibility

476
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,220
I'm gonna go and make up for my mistake

477
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,680
I'll come back later!

478
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,639
Oh my god

479
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:56,820
I moved so fast, sorry for those poor Heaven guardians since they are unable to catch us!

480
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,880
I am such a powerful man!

481
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,880
Lord Puchi

482
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,440
Thank you so much! You saved my life again!

483
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,300
So... How would you pay back to me

484
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,020
What do you want?

485
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,389
How about being my woman

486
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,889
We can explore the secrets of spirit training

487
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,860
Spirit training?

488
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,639
Do you wanna turn into ashes?!

489
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,360
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess are coming soon, come with me!

490
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,400
I wonder why Fire Immortal wants to turn me into ashes

491
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,300
I don't have time to talk nonsense with you

492
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,560
If you keep trying step over my bottom line, I would turn you into ashes in seconds

493
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,580
Maybe he is the only one who can protect Jin Mi

494
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,740
My little beauty, Sad that we have feelings with each other but intervened by others

495
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,400
No worries, I will train myself hard, then take you back!

496
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,180
Going to the Birthday Celebration was

497
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,840
Just for a bite of the holy peach to increase my magic power

498
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,300
would you catch me back to the Heaven Palace and let Empress kill me?

499
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,910
let her kill you?

500
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,600
I only have one Phoenix Feather

501
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,860
and I give it to you

502
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,680
Why you still cannot understand my heart?

503
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,340
Even though...

504
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,800
We are destined to be separated

505
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,520
Thank you

506
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,240
Please wear this Phoenix Feather

507
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,280
Wish it could protect you for me,
protect you to be safe and secure

508
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,230
I'm gonna send you back to Floral Realm right now

509
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:56,610
After you come back home, we will never meet each other again

510
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,380
Fairy Jin Mi

511
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:12,840
Fish Fairy!

512
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,590
Are you alright?

513
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:18,840
Chief Peony

514
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,540
It is great that Fire Immortal has made this decision

515
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,660
Chief Peony

516
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:29,190
No worries, I am a rational person

517
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,820
Now that I know that Jin Mi is related to me, I definitely don't wanna bring any trouble to her

518
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,820
Fire Immortal is such an understanding person

519
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,820
Please keep the secret

520
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,040
for peace of Floral Realm

521
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,880
What? What’s the secret?

522
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,540
Stop asking!

523
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,410
If not the flowers here sent us signals,
it would be so hard for us to track you

524
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,820
How long do you plan to hide from us!

525
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,290
Today is the Birthday Celebration of Heavenly Empress

526
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,820
Jin Mi got in accidentally and exposed her true identity. Heavenly Empress and Empress became suspicious about her identity

527
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,550
At this moment

528
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:01,080
The Heaven Guardians are looking for Jin Mi

529
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,680
What? Jin Mi!

530
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,780
I don't mean to bring troubles to you guys!

531
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,920
There was a rat which freaked me out

532
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,100
I'm not surprised at all.. if you were not a trouble maker

533
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,680
Moon Immortal would be the Heavenly Empress someday

534
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,780
Your Highness, Fire Immortal. We took an order from the Empress,

535
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,300
Fire Immortal, please don't be in the way

536
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,410
Jin Mi is the spirit of Floral Realm

537
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,040
No matter what mistakes she made, she can only
be judged according to the Rules of Floral Realm

538
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,420
Anyone who's not from Floral Realm has no right
to do anything to her

539
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,920
There are 36 Heaven Generals and
millions Heaven Guardians in Heaven Realm

540
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,210
If I remembered correctly,

541
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,020
none of them is under charge of Heavenly Empress

542
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,010
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess,

543
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:41,300
you guys probably forgot whom you guys should follow

544
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,880
Calm down, Your Highness, we are followers of the you

545
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,510
Certainly, we should take orders from you

546
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,400
So, take my order right now, bring Heaven Guardians back to Heaven Realm immediately!

547
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,500
I will explain to Heavenly Empress in person

548
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,060
Yes, your Highness.

549
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,780
Two Chiefs

550
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:11,030
It is me who broke in the Water Mirror and took Jin Mi out

551
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,080
I did not expect to make so many troubles. My apology!

552
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,590
Two honorable immortals from Heaven
bursted into our place many times

553
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,380
We have just figured out why Fire Immortal
accidentally got in our place

554
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,060
Could you explain the intention of breaking into our place?

555
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,060
Fairy Jin Mi is such an outgoing and energetic lady.
She is curious about everything

556
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,890
But she seems unhappy to be restricted in the Water Mirror

557
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,270
As a friend of Fairy Jin Mi

558
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:35,910
I just want her to have more freedom

559
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,730
I dont think you are honest to us

560
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,370
Fire Immortal is pretty straight forward

561
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,280
Why can't Night Immortal tell us the truth

562
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,080
I have never done anything that cross the line, so I am telling the truth

563
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,100
I do treat her as my friend

564
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,120
Two Chiefs, please don't blame on Fish Fairy

565
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,540
Fish Fairy is a good dragon, and I like him

566
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:01,830
What did you just say?!

567
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,260
I said, Fish Fairy is a good dragon, I...
