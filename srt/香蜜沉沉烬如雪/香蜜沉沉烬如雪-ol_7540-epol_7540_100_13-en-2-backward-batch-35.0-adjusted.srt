1
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,390
“Ashes of Love”

2
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,980
"Episode 13

3
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,900
Thanks for your favour, Fairy Jin Mi.

4
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,920
I like you, too.

5
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,100
How come you and the Night Immortal...

6
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,820
Do you know who is Jin Mi?

7
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,800
Do you know why Jin Mi can create flowers?

8
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,520
Do you know about the Liuzi Pond in my Qiwu Palace?

9
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,840
Do you know the name of the past Floral Immortal?

10
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,500
Do you know that Jin Mi is water by nature?

11
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,280
Do you know that the past Floral Immortal’s real body
is a piece of water lily?

12
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,840
Do you know

13
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,720
you, me, and Jin Mi

14
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,060
are half-siblings?

15
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,160
Oh my God.

16
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
How come I, a grape

17
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,340
have so many

18
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,420
birds and beasts relatives?

19
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,800
If this is true,

20
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,300
then the Heavenly Empress would be my stepmother.

21
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,720
So horrible!

22
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,960
It’s OK.

23
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,160
Even though we three are siblings,

24
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,860
the situation is not bad.

25
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,680
Fairy Jin Mi, tell me.

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,400
Besides me,

27
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,560
do you like Xu Feng?

28
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,160
Yes, I like him.

29
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
What about the Moon Immortal?

30
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,640
Of course.

31
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,420
What about Yan You?

32
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,400
Yes.

33
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,280
What about Liao Ting and Fei Xu, the servants of Qiwu Palace?

34
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,120
Yes.

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,060
What about Chief Peony?

36
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,220
If Chief Peony

37
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,180
won’t be so hard to me in the future,

38
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,620
I will like her all the better.

39
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,460
Forget it. You are so heartless.

40
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,640
If you still want to be alive,

41
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,240
then go back to the Floral Realm with me.

42
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,960
No. I don’t want to.

43
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,380
I’m useless.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,320
I didn’t expect that His Highness would be bewitched by Jin Mi to such a degree

45
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:43,420
that he ruined your birthday.

46
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,519
That sprite went to the banquet in disguise, so I don’t blame you.

47
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,820
But she dared

48
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,820
to show her real body in front of Heavenly Emperor and Highness who is in charge of water.

49
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,280
What’s her intention?

50
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,920
The Heaven Realm is a quiet place,

51
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,640
but the Rat Fairy even brought a rat to the banquet,

52
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,360
making such a mess.

53
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,620
Although it is unintentional, it is really absurd.

54
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,320
So funny.

55
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,780
The Snake Fairy went to the banquet with a sprite.

56
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,840
And the sprite was scared by the Rat Fairy.

57
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,000
I’m not sure.

58
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,940
I will check it out.

59
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,640
To say something improper,

60
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,280
His Highness and the Night Immortal

61
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,880
have unusual relationship with this girl.

62
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,780
If left unrestrained,

63
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,720
I’m afraid they will make the same mistake as the Heavenly Emperor

64
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,720
and Water immortal.

65
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,800
In addition, the Snake Fairy,Yan You, has always been infamous.

66
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,220
Aunty, don’t forget

67
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,660
why he was demoted thousands of years ago.

68
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,240
Is it possible

69
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,240
that another Zi Fen exists in the six realms?

70
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,240
I don’t allow

71
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,280
something that can bring disasters and chaos to the Heaven Realm to happen again.

72
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,760
Leave it. Go back and take some rest now.

73
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,080
Yes, aunty.

74
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,520
Your Majesty.

75
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,140
Go and check the information

76
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,780
about those lower-level fairies who came to the banquet today,

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,640
especially the twelve zodiac fairies.

78
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,440
Check it carefully.

79
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,540
I’m wondering

80
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,520
which sprite dared to ruin my birthday banquet.

81
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

82
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,680
How is Jin Mi?

83
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,420
She’s fine.

84
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,860
Besides, her magic power is stronger.

85
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,180
I cooked some soothing medicine for her.

86
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,280
Let her drink it and go to bed early.

87
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,940
This time Jin Mi showed her real body in the Heaven Realm.

88
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,840
I am afraid that her birth information will be uncovered.

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,900
It’s ridiculous that the Fire Immortal

90
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,180
thinks he is Jin Mi’s half brother,

91
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,260
closest relative.

92
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,100
He?

93
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,180
He doesn’t deserve it at all.

94
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,300
There is nothing wrong about making him misunderstand and give up the hope completely.

95
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,680
Don’t forget

96
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,820
how the past Floral Immortal died.

97
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,820
This is a deadly feud.

98
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,420
No matter what happens,

99
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,580
Jin Mi shouldn’t have any connection with the sons of Heavenly Empress and Heavenly Emperor

100
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
any more.

101
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,280
Do you know who is Jin Mi?

102
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,780
Do you know why Jin Mi can create flowers?

103
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,420
Do you know about the Liuzi Pond in my Qiwu Palace?

104
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,900
Do you know the name of the past Floral Immortal?

105
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,120
Do you know that Jin Mi is water by nature?

106
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,180
Do you know that the past Floral Immortal’s real body is a piece of water lily?

107
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,300
Do you know

108
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,380
you, me, and Jin Mi

109
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:04,780
are half-siblings?

110
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,960
What is the connection between Liuzi Pond and my ability to create flowers?

111
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,600
What is the relation between the past Floral Immortal’ s real body and name and me?

112
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,280
How come we three become half brothers and sister

113
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,760
in a blink of an eye?

114
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,280
The Heavenly Empress becomes my stepmother.

115
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,080
Phoenix’s thinking is really leaping.

116
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,080
The past Floral Immortal wanted Jin Mi to be a free and happy fairy

117
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,580
without getting involved in any worldly

118
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,960
romantic relationship.

119
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,220
We should definitely keep this secret

120
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,660
as long as possible.

121
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,780
What's more,

122
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,300
Jin Mi haven’t experienced her destined disaster.

123
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,440
So it is really improper for her to leave the Floral Realm.

124
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,920
From now on,

125
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,220
we take turns to spend the night on watch, staying in the courtyard.

126
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,200
Yes.

127
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,539
But now,

128
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:05,200
everyone has seen Jin Mi’s real body.

129
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,760
I am afraid that the Heavenly Emperor will come and ask for explanation.

130
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,260
How dare he!

131
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,760
If he dares to ask about this,

132
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,100
then let him go to the Floral Immortal’s Mausoleum and reason with the past Floral Immortal.

133
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,960
What a close call!

134
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,040
I can’t hear clearly what they were saying,

135
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,740
but I think it is something good for me.

136
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,060
Although it’s very boring to practice in Water Mirror,

137
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,000
it’s better than being taken and killed

138
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,400
by the God of Thunder and the Goddess of Lightening.

139
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,660
What do you think, Rou Rou?

140
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,220
So sleepy.

141
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,120
I have run away.

142
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,760
But he still catches me back in my dreams.

143
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,360
Why is Heavenly Emperor so stingy as his wife is?

144
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,440
I venture to take you

145
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,240
to this Fantasy Land.

146
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,200
I hope that you don’t mind.

147
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,160
Not to condemn me...

148
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,500
Your Majesty, you are too modest.

149
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,440
I didn’t expect that

150
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,660
I would actually meet Your Majesty in the dream.

151
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,140
This is Fantasy Land

152
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,480
a place where the Immortals travel and practice.

153
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,120
Occasionally the illusion appears in the Human Realm.

154
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,660
Human beings would call it “Mirage”,

155
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,240
thinking that it is formed .

156
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,940
by the breath of toads in the sea.

157
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,020
When I first heard this,

158
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,420
I couldn’t help but laugh,

159
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,360
thinking that human beings were ignorant.

160
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,980
Until 90,000 years ago,

161
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,760
when I traveled here at night

162
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,140
and saw her stepping on the water

163
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,680
with lotus following after her every step.

164
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,800
Removing the mist

165
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,540
that hid her face when she glanced back,

166
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,700
I started to know what is fantasy,

167
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,660
and what is mirage.

168
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,920
I’m Taiwei, from the Heaven Realm.

169
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,220
May I have your name?

170
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,980
Since she passed away,

171
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,940
there have been no flowers in the Heaven Realm.

172
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,760
I haven’t been here for a long time.

173
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,580
So alike.

174
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,260
Just now in the mist,

175
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,380
I nearly got the wrong person.

176
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,260
But when I look at you carefully,

177
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,120
I find nothing alike.

178
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,380
She didn’t like laughing.

179
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,260
During the 90,000 years when we knew each other,

180
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,800
I saw her laugh only ten times.

181
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,740
Her occasional laughing wouldn’t last long.

182
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,640
She is not as bright and sweet

183
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,140
as you.

184
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,120
If without me,

185
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,080
during these 90,000 years,

186
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,100
she would have laughed a lot,

187
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,200
and wouldn’t have ended her life in loneliness

188
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,940
like this.

189
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,420
The dead person has gone.

190
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,820
Please restrain your grief, Your Majesty.

191
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,660
There have been no plants in the Heaven Realm and this Fantasy Land

192
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,300
for over four thousand years.

193
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,440
I heard that you can create flowers.

194
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,540
You might as well plant some green lotus here.

195
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,660
Why did he suddenly mention planting flowers?

196
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,020
He’s really Phoenix’s father.

197
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,080
Even his thinking is so leaping, too.

198
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,620
According to Phoenix,

199
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,760
he seems to be my father, too.

200
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,540
So I should fulfill my filial duty.

201
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,860
OK.

202
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,100
Sure enough.

203
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,520
Sure enough.

204
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,060
Please retrain your grief, Your Majesty.

205
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,420
I can only do this

206
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,560
to comfort you.

207
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,720
Do you know who I was talking about?

208
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,100
I’m still so young, and I have stayed in the Water Mirror for long time.

209
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,380
The people I know

210
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,640
are some

211
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,240
vegetables and fruits.

212
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,600
I really don’t know any reserved person

213
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,640
who only laughs once ten thousand years

214
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,800
like you talked about just now.

215
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
But as for those shallow ones who laugh ten times a day,

216
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,700
there are plenty of them.

217
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,880
Please don’t mind my lack of experiences.

218
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,280
I don’t know who you were talking about, Your Majesty.

219
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,980
The person I talked about just now

220
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,940
is the Floral Immortal Zi Fen.

221
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,680
You are more than four thousand years old.

222
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,700
Is it possible that you have never seen Zi Fen?

223
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,960
Never.

224
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,620
I didn’t expect that

225
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,380
she actually hated me so much

226
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,940
that she even didn’t want to see her child.

227
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,540
Your...Your Majesty.

228
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,580
You..you can’t say something that is not true.

229
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,720
This dream is too strange.

230
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,560
Why does the Heavenly Emperor

231
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,740
come to my dreams?

232
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,260
The past Floral Immortal is a piece of lotus.

233
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,800
And I am a grape.

234
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,460
How come she is my mother?

235
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,060
The father and the son’s thinking

236
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,740
are so leaping.

237
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,260
No, this is my dream.

238
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,220
It seems that my thinking is leaping.

239
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,880
It’s Phoenix’s fault.

240
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,880
In the daytime, he always talks about things that are not real.

241
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,620
I’m dreaming so deeply. It’s time to wake up.

242
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,880
It seems that it is not a common dream.

243
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,040
Forget it. Since I’m in dream now, I should enjoy it.

244
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,960
I don’t have many chances to meet the Heavenly Emperor.

245
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,760
It’s better to ask him for some magic power.

246
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,700
To have a dream of getting much magic power

247
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,540
is so worthwhile.

248
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,480
Your Majesty.

249
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,380
If you like to watch me plant flowers,

250
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,040
I can often plant flowers for you.

251
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,600
And it’s also OK if you assign me to be a gardener in the Heaven Realm.

252
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,460
But...

253
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,560
But..

254
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:53,960
What’s wrong?

255
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,660
If you have any difficulties, let me know.

256
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,640
My magic power is not strong.

257
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,480
Although I have practiced hard

258
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,120
I’m still an elf.

259
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,180
I know some tricks of planting flowers and grasses,

260
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,180
but I still need the power from the outside

261
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,340
to create them.

262
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,680
So you have seen my poor performance, Your Majesty.

263
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,600
Zi Fen must have sealed your spirit.

264
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,040
How about this?

265
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,460
I’ll give you some magic power.

266
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,000
And you go back and practice for 49 days.

267
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,920
Then your real body will show up.

268
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,040
How can I afford to the magic power you give me,

269
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,940
Your Majesty?

270
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,260
Good girl.

271
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,160
You don’t have to be so distant to me.

272
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,780
It is a matter of righteousness

273
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,720
that I give you some magic power.

274
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,660
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.

275
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,960
But your power is not strong,

276
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,300
so I can only give you five thousand years’ magic power.

277
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,840
Five thousand years.

278
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,000
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.

279
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,160
Thank you so much, Your Majesty.

280
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,600
If I hadn’t make that mistake tens of thousands of years ago,

281
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,440
the Chiefs of Floral Realm wouldn’t have considered the Heaven Realm as enemy.

282
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,600
And we wouldn’t have had to see each other in dreams at night.

283
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,060
Sorry to make you feel wronged.

284
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,500
I don’t feel wronged.

285
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,000
Not at all.

286
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,900
You give me five thousand years of magic power in one night.

287
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,400
You don’t even feel wronged. Why should I feel wronged?

288
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,780
I hope this is not just a dream.

289
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,520
As for what I owe Suifen,

290
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,800
I will slowly make compensation for you.

291
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,740
But you should keep one thing in mind.

292
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,040
Go ahead, Your Majesty.

293
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,740
I will do whatever you ask me to do at all costs.

294
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,600
You should keep in mind

295
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,100
that you can’t have any romantic relationship

296
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,880
with Xu Feng and Run Yu.

297
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,080
Understand?

298
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,200
Don’t worry, Your Majesty.

299
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,340
It’s easy.

300
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,460
It’s easy.

301
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,500
Are you thinking about the grape elf

302
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,620
who appeared at the birthday banquet of the Heavenly Empress?

303
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,960
That elf and she do have some resemblance.

304
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,180
For when I saw that elf

305
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,820
I keep thinking about Zi Fen.

306
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,540
In these years,

307
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,680
you never mentioned Zi Fen in front of me.

308
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,100
But I know,

309
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,800
in your heart

310
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,960
she has never left.

311
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,080
Linxiu,

312
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,240
it’s really unfair for you

313
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,420
to marry me.

314
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,400
I’m not blaming you.

315
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,960
In these years, we have respected each other like guests,

316
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,320
living a peaceful life. I’m already satisfied.

317
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,380
It’s just that seeing your heart still closed,

318
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,740
I feel sad for you.

319
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,160
Linxiu.

320
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,160
If you miss her,

321
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,280
then just go to see her.

322
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,540
OK.

323
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,460
All right.

324
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,820
It’s too late now.

325
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,680
Go to bed early.

326
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,020
You, too.

327
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,980
You took action first without my permission,

328
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,340
letting that sprite go back to the Floral Realm.

329
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,860
And then you come to report your guilt now.

330
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
Mother, please don’t be angry.

331
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,180
You, the Fire Immortal

332
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,640
are the noble son of the Heavenly Emperor.

333
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,180
Everyday so many people watch you.

334
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,000
But you make friends

335
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,700
with that bad-mannered sprite who even hasn’t entered the immortality.

336
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,020
And because of her,

337
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,340
you even argued with me in public.

338
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,360
How can I feel relieved?

339
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,440
Jin Mi has saved my life for many times.

340
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,640
And because her power is weak,

341
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,080
I have to help her.

342
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,560
Jin Mi is young and ignorant, knowing little about the manners and rules.

343
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,460
But she is not malicious.

344
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,100
Tell me.

345
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,120
Do you really just want to repay her?

346
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,880
Or you already have affection for her?

347
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,580
No.

348
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,380
Good.

349
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,560
Then promise me

350
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,380
that you will never see that sprite again.

351
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,400
Then I will forgive her.

352
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,980
Yesterday I promised Chief Peony

353
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,860
that I will not see Jin Mi again.

354
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,420
Mother, you can feel relieved now.

355
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,980
Relieved?

356
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,960
Only when you really become the Heavenly Emperor,

357
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,700
leading the Heaven Realm,

358
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,760
marrying Sui He and having kids

359
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,960
can I really feel relieved.

360
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,100
You’re thinking too much, Mother.

361
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,780
I have to go to the drill ground and train the soldiers.

362
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,280
I need to leave now.

363
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,560
If I hadn’t have thought much,

364
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,020
how can you enjoy the current status?

365
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,860
Your Highness, you just rested for a little while after the night patrol.

366
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,060
Why bother to go to Floral Realm in a hurry,

367
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,020
making yourself tired?

368
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,020
I heard that Chief Peony has always been strict with younger generations.

369
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,680
This time, I secretly took Jin Mi to the Human Realm without her permission,

370
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,820
and even nearly made a disaster in the Heaven Realm.

371
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,020
I am afraid that Chief Peony will not forgive Jin Mi easily.

372
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,540
I am going to the Floral Realm.

373
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,820
You don't have to follow me.

374
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,020
Yes, Your Highness.

375
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,140
Oops!

376
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,360
She will not forgive Jin Mi easily.

377
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,800
The Heavenly Empress have already borne grudge against you, Your Highness.

378
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,360
At this time, if you go there hastily,

379
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,920
I am afraid things will get worse.

380
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,080
And the problems will be more difficult to solve.

381
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,460
Xu Feng was so sure yesterday

382
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,960
that Jin Mi is Father’s daughter.

383
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,940
The way Father looked at Jin Mi yesterday

384
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,900
was really unusual.

385
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,800
I’m going to ask Father for help.

386
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,760
OK.

387
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,880
Then I’ll go to the Floral Realm to make a thorough inquiry.

388
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,360
Be careful.

389
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,700
I, Jin Mi, a fruit elf

390
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,960
pretended to be a descendant of the past Floral Immortal

391
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,220
and got five thousand years’ magic power from the Heavenly Emperor.

392
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,780
You are a great person and won’t care about the faults of the petty ones.

393
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,280
You won’t blame me, right?

394
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,280
I don't know what you like to eat.

395
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,900
If you need anything,

396
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,120
you can tell me in my dreams.

397
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,240
I will take good care of you

398
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,060
at all costs.

399
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,940
Here, I would like to express my thanks to you.

400
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,900
In fact, I should celebrate such a lucky thing

401
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,620
with everyone.

402
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
But I am not in the Heaven Realm,

403
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,920
so I can only invite Lord Puchi to celebrate this thing with me.

404
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,080
Heavenly...Heavenly Empress.

405
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,080
I could call Lord Puchi before with small part of my power.

406
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,440
I didn’t expect that I would be able to call Heavenly Empress

407
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,880
after my magic power gets much stronger.

408
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,720
Your Majesty.

409
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,500
Why are you here?

410
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,440
Before you die,

411
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,460
I would like to teach you some manners.

412
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,560
Your Majesty.

413
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,620
What are you doing?

414
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,220
What manner?

415
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,280
I don't care who you are.

416
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,000
And I don’t care what relationship you have

417
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,200
with Xu Feng and Runyu.

418
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,120
Just because of your face,

419
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,320
I would like to kill you thousands of times.

420
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,420
You and Zi Fen really have a bond.

421
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,940
You will die a worthy death here.

422
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,380
I don’t know what you mean.

423
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,320
How long ago?

424
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,740
It’s been half an hour.

425
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,160
Mother, please don’t be impulsive and angry.

426
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,420
If Father you are a bit late, I am afraid that Jin Mi will...

427
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,340
Jin Mi is my child.

428
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,820
If I go to stop Tuyao hastily,

429
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,880
she won’t let Jin Mi go easily.

430
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,640
How about this?

431
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,360
You pass on my order quickly.

432
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,580
Ask your Mother to come back, telling her that there are things to discuss

433
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,820
about rewarding fairies and forgiving the sins in the Heaven Realm

434
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,300
after her birthday.

435
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,480
Since Jin Mi is Father’s child,

436
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,160
she is also my sister.

437
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,440
Please don’t worry, Father.

438
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,940
I will try my best to protect her.

439
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,000
Mister Water Immortal.

440
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,960
Don't you know the law of superiority and inferiority ?

441
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,500
Why are you here to interfere with me

442
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,420
instead of going to making wind and rain?

443
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,860
I certainly know the law of superiority and inferiority.

444
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,180
But the past Floral Immortal and I are old friends.

445
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,300
Today, I’m here to show my worship.

446
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,500
But I didn’t expect that

447
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,620
this child was almost killed by someone.

448
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,620
I’m here to punish a little floral elf.

449
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,020
It’s none of your business.

450
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,760
Jin Mi is an elf of the Floral Realm.

451
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,600
Since it is in the Floral Realm,

452
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,760
only the Floral Immortal and Chief Peony have the right to decide who is guilty and deserves punishment.

453
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,760
Zi Fen has passed away.

454
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,560
In front of her tomb,

455
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,400
how can you bear to lay murderous hands

456
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,260
on such a low-level elf?

457
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,820
You said you knew the law of superiority and inferiority.

458
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,400
But actually,

459
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,080
you are here just for the sake of Zi Fen.

460
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,480
You do this,

461
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,880
just because this sprite

462
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,120
looks a little like Zi Fen, right?

463
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,320
In view of the public and personal concerns,

464
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,820
I can’t let you do this.

465
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,420
Do you think you can stop me?

466
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,540
Mother, I’ve been looking for you for long time.

467
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,780
Fish Fairy.

468
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,120
Mister Water Immortal.

469
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,320
Fish Fairy, please save me.

470
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,200
Mother.

471
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,160
I haven’t allowed you to stand up.

472
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,340
Mother,

473
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,280
I’m here just to perform Father’s order.

474
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,280
He asked you to go back to the Empyrean Heaven quickly

475
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,800
to discuss things about rewarding fairies and forgiving sins in the Heaven Realm.

476
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,120
Your Majesty, you are a motherly model in the Heaven Realm.

477
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,040
So you should assume your personal command in the Heaven Realm, minding your words and behaviors.

478
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,060
If you disturb the Chiefs of Floral Realm,

479
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,740
bringing the arguments to His Majesty,

480
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,140
I am afraid it will damage your good reputation

481
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,080
of virtue and kindheartedness.

482
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,900
Very good.

483
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,400
Night Immortal, you can do things independently now.

484
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,000
You are more and more powerful,

485
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,920
daring to conspire against me with others.

486
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,860
I don’t dare.

487
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,020
Mother,

488
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,560
please.

489
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,820
Mister Water Immortal. Fairy Jin Mi.

490
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,620
See you.

491
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,420
Thank you so much, Mister Water Immortal.

492
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,500
Fairy Jin Mi, are you here to accompany Zi Fen by her tomb?

493
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,960
It’s just a trivial thing.

494
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,140
Jin Mi...Jin Mi.

495
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,040
looking for peace among the blooming flowers;

496
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,740
leading a life of floating clouds and water.

497
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,040
These are two lines of poem

498
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,900
that hung in front of Zi Fen’s desk when she’s alive.

499
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,980
I copied these two lines of poem, mounted and hung them for her.

500
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,720
I didn’t know

501
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:52,480
Zi Fen still has a child left in the world.

502
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,240
Mister Water Immortal.

503
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,800
According to what you said,

504
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,940
am I really the child

505
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,480
of the past Floral Immortal and the Heavenly Emperor?

506
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,040
Lord Puchi

507
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,160
Jin Mi.

508
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,120
Can you improve your accuracy?

509
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,580
You will get my bone broken sooner or later.

510
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,660
I’m being so rude. Mister Water Immortal.

511
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,200
Yan You, are you here to play?

512
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,500
No, no, no.

513
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,320
I never go about in the hope of finding girls.

514
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,060
I trespass the Floral Realm,

515
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,340
just because Jin Mi called me.

516
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,220
Your magic power becomes stronger.

517
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,220
Is it you who called Mister Water Immortal?

518
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,740
When you call Yan You,

519
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,080
what spell do you use ?

520
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,440
My magic power is weak.

521
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,620
I just use the common call spell.

522
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,680
The real body of Yan You is a water snake.

523
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,260
Can you call water?

524
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,920
The Fire Immortal said that my body constitution is coldness-oriented.

525
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,100
So he let me practice some water-related magics.

526
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,660
I created hail stone twice.

527
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,620
But I have never tried to call water.

528
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,280
Then try it.

529
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,640
Me?

530
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,480
Now?

531
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:33,840
Fine.

532
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,320
Then I’m going to try it today

533
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,080
in front of Mister Water Immortal.

534
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,640
Call!

535
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,320
You still can't call water with your magic power.

536
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,120
I’ll try again.

537
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,000
Call!

538
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,880
Jin Mi, you are just a common elf.

539
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,020
Why parade your ability?

540
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,880
How about this?

541
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,920
Such a big cloud.

542
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,260
It’s so dark.

543
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,540
Jin Mi

544
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,440
Chief Peony.

545
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,520
Mister Water Immortal, what’s wrong with Jin Mi?

546
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,280
Look!

547
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,100
It’s snowing.

548
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,500
I can call snow.

549
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,160
I can call it.

550
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,940
Your Highness.

551
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,380
Why did Highness who is in charge of water go to the Floral Realm?

552
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,880
It seems that he went there to worship the past Floral Immortal.

553
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,659
The Heavenly Empress was going to kill Jin Mi

554
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,260
and destroy the past Floral Immortal’s Mausoleum.

555
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,280
I didn’t expect that Mister Water Immortal would arrive in time

556
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,179
and save Jin Mi’s life,

557
00:33:57,739 --> 00:33:59,360
even at the cost of offending the Heavenly Empress.

558
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,460
Water Immortal has never cared about the worldly things.

559
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,199
But when he saw Jin Mi

560
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,179
his reactions were too unusual.

561
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,219
I’m going to the Floral Realm again.

562
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,699
If the Heavenly Empress attempts to hurt Jin Mi again, inform me quickly.

563
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,660
How is Jin Mi?

564
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,980
Is it because of too much lost of magic power?

565
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,460
That heavy snow was called by Jin Mi.

566
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,220
If Jin Mi is not water by nature,

567
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,820
how can she call Yan You?

568
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,840
What’s the real identity of Jin Mi?

569
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,600
If Jin Mi is just a common elf,

570
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,060
why are you and Chief Begonia

571
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,560
being so nervous?

572
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,460
I’m just a floral fairy of the Floral Realm.

573
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,520
Water Immortal, don’t you

574
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,380
know what you have done?

575
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,240
Do you need others to tell you the truth?

576
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,520
Jin Mi looks like Zi Fen so much,

577
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,960
but she said she was a grape.

578
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,020
I really can't figure out the reason for this.

579
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,280
Jin Mi has been taken care of by you since she was born.

580
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,580
Today, only the Chiefs of Floral Realm

581
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,660
can tell me the truth.

582
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,480
I said that Jin Mi’s tendency to be confused is born by nature.

583
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,220
It turns out that there is some reason for this.

584
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,560
Did you say...

585
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,020
Is Jin Mi really...

586
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,180
Don’t ask me, Water Immortal.

587
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,940
I can’t tell you everything.

588
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,740
We Chiefs swore in front of the Floral Immortal.

589
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,120
If we leak out anything about Jin Mi’s birth,

590
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,280
we will destroy our souls.

591
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,840
Please forgive me, Water Immortal.

592
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,960
The essential Qi in Jin Mi’s body is in disorder.

593
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,500
Did you give Jin Mi magic power?

594
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,980
This is the first time I privately met Jin Mi.

595
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,520
The magic power in Jin Mi’s body is so strong

596
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,520
and overwhelming.

597
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,720
With my ability,

598
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,740
I can't dissolve it.

599
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,540
For the sake of Jin Mi’s life,

600
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,280
we don’t have other choices .

601
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,400
How is Jin Mi?

602
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,260
The Yang Qi in Jin Mi body is very strong.

603
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,200
I don't know who

604
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,560
gave her so much Yang Qi,

605
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,200
which contradicts her Yin nature.

606
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,480
If I weren’t here today,

607
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,060
I am afraid that she would be in danger.

608
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,160
Thank you so much, Mister Water Immortal.

609
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,160
If something wrong happened to Jin Mi,

610
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,020
how

611
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,120
can we explain to the past Floral Immortal?

612
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,480
Jin Mi

613
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,460
turns out to be my child.
