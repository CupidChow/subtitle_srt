00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 27"

3
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,520
Mu Ci.

4
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,120
Stop!

5
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,670
Since I can’t grab Spirit-Vanishing Arrow,

6
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,050
I can kill Princess of Bian City
as another task to His Majesty.

7
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,920
Mu Ci, will you stay with me

8
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,720
only if I am hurt?

9
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,440
I really went to find you,

10
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:10,640
but no one knew your whereabouts.

11
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,320
In the several hundred years when you disappeared,

12
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:17,040
I had been waiting for you
at the bank of Wangchuan River.

13
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,120
Are you leaving again?

14
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,880
I am not leaving.

15
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,960
You haven’t recovered.

16
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,840
Don’t always move.

17
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,210
Lie down to have a rest.

18
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,760
"Beiyuan Villa"

19
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,640
"Peace reigns over the land"

20
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,440
Your Majesty, it’s late.

21
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,680
You should go to bed.

22
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,620
Don’t put off till tomorrow
what should be done today.

23
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,910
I’ll finish the memorials first.

24
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,920
Leave me alone.

25
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,400
Yes, I am leaving.

26
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,800
Grab Spirit-Vanishing Arrow and kill Xu Feng.

27
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,159
Foster mother,
is what you want me to do really right?

28
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
Whether the arrow falls or not

29
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,440
depends on my hair.

30
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,840
Is there any good news?

31
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,840
I am incompetent and lost Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

32
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,800
You stayed in the human world for so many days,

33
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,640
and you just bring me such a surprise.

34
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,800
Your Majesty, His Highness went down
the Human Realm to experience hardships,

35
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,080
which shocked the six realms.

36
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,400
I’m afraid many people

37
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,960
will harm the second Prince.

38
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,480
Who?

39
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,880
Besides Demon Realm,
Snake Fairy Yan You also wants to do so.

40
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,080
I doubt that

41
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
he stole Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

42
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,840
When my birthday feast was disturbed last time,

43
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,320
I already doubted

44
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,000
Yan You must be related to it.

45
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,520
This time, he made a comeback.

46
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,560
I am afraid the masters
behind Snake Fairy and Rat Fairy

47
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,440
are the same one.

48
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,360
You go to investigate who it is.

49
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,160
Especially, you need to watch
Water Immortal and Night Immortal carefully.

50
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,840
Night Immortal

51
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,480
has gone down the Human Realm
to meet Jin Mi secretly

52
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,800
and destroyed Your Majesty’s plan many times.

53
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,440
Did he do anything bad to Xu Feng?

54
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,600
No.

55
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,680
Damned it. Run Yu always goes against me.

56
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,320
He deserves death.

57
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,240
You can’t treat him lightly.

58
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Has Sui He’s memory been opened?

59
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,280
I have been searching for
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow recently,

60
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,720
so I haven’t opened

61
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
Princess Sui He’s memory yet.

62
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,600
To destroy Jin Mi is important,

63
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,600
but you can’t delay opening Sui He’s memory.

64
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,480
If her memory is opened,

65
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,720
she can help you in the human world.

66
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,560
You two can make a decision
as the occasion requires.

67
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,400
Yes.

68
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,360
Do not let me doubt your value.

69
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,200
If you can’t find Spirit-Vanishing Arrow back,

70
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,960
I will make another one with your heart blood.

71
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,480
Mu Ci.

72
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,600
You haven’t recovered yet.
Why do you walk around?

73
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,160
After waking up, I found you were gone.

74
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,600
I thought you had left again,

75
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,200
so I went to look for you.

76
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,520
There is no prey on the mountain,

77
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,760
so I went to pick some fruits.

78
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,360
Eat some first.

79
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,920
You haven’t recovered yet,

80
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,240
so don’t walk around.

81
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Can you give it back to me now?

82
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,160
You are obedient this time.
I will spare you.

83
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,080
Mu Ci, you haven’t told me

84
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,840
how you were doing these years.

85
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,120
Where are you going?

86
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,360
I’m going to fetch some water.

87
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,960
You must come back.

88
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,080
I thought you wouldn’t come back.

89
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,120
What do you want to eat?
I’m going to cook for you.

90
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,440
Don’t get busy.

91
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,960
You have almost fully recovered.

92
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,040
If there is nothing else,

93
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
you should go back to
Demon Realm as soon as possible.

94
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,080
You go back to Demon Realm with me.

95
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,240
I can’t go back to Demon Realm again.

96
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,680
Why?

97
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,040
Stop asking me.

98
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,960
I have changed.

99
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,120
Please don’t be so obsessed with me, Your Highness.

100
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,480
You saved me again and again,

101
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,880
which shows you still care about me.

102
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,000
Then why are you so heartless?

103
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,640
Because without me,

104
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,400
you can live a better life.

105
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,920
Mu Ci.

106
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,640
Forget me.

107
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,970
"Yunmeng Lake"

108
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,840
On the vast land, ghosts hide in the dark.

109
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,360
Above the dense fog, clouds fly.

110
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,720
Fog.

111
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,160
Fog. Fog.

112
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,000
Fog. Fog.

113
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,480
Fog. Fog. Fog.

114
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,840
Good-for-nothing.

115
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,800
You can’t even do the
simplest water and fog skill well.

116
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,000
I remember when you were 3,

117
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,560
you learned tidal bore skill without teacher.

118
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,800
You could tread and move wave and drive torrent.

119
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,360
Why do you become worse now?

120
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,520
Do you deserve to be my son?

121
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,680
Stop crying.

122
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,840
You have made no progress.

123
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,400
How can I leave without worry?

124
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,640
Do you know?

125
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,200
There are wicked and crafty people

126
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,680
who want to kill you for an award outside.

127
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,160
Stop crying.

128
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,280
Go.

129
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,280
Master.

130
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,880
Yan You, did you make it?

131
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,280
I am incompetent,
so I couldn’t grab Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

132
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,640
Why did you lose?

133
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,120
Master,

134
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,880
in the cycle of heaven,
the son pays his mother’s debt.

135
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,600
He will be punished.

136
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Why not submit to the will of Heaven

137
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,640
and let him grow and die
without outside interference?

138
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,520
Submit to the will of Heaven?
Grow and die without outside interference?

139
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,400
Is this a joke?

140
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,240
I can’t wait for so long.

141
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,200
I want him to pay with his life.

142
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,960
General, the lanterns

143
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,960
can be handled by the
Lantern Chief of Shanqin Bureau.

144
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,640
But you are asked to

145
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,600
buy paper and bamboo strips in person.

146
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,080
I think His Majesty

147
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,640
doesn’t regard you as an outsider at all.

148
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,560
You don’t understand.

149
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,240
These are not ordinary lanterns.

150
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,160
They are secret weapons

151
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,120
of His Majesty.

152
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,720
Of course the best moonlight paper

153
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,560
and toughest bamboo strips must be selected.

154
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,240
Weapon? What weapon?

155
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,780
To deal with Liangguo?

156
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,680
Though the opponent is not Liangguo,

157
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,240
for His Majesty,

158
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,800
it is as hard as a tough battle.

159
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,800
Oh, I see.

160
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,240
Then you are the best person to do it.

161
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
It’s late. Let’s go back.

162
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,160
General, general.

163
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,680
Well…

164
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,240
We seem to be here just now.

165
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
I see this tree for the second time.

166
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,600
Well…

167
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,320
General,

168
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,520
did we encounter ghosts?

169
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,680
Nonsense. I’m going to find someone to ask.

170
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,480
You wait for me here.

171
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,280
Excuse me, I’d like to ask the way.

172
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,480
This time,

173
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,320
I will go first.

174
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,440
Life is tough.

175
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,720
Though you treated me so well all my life,

176
00:15:53,200 --> 00:16:00,640
we can’t avoid sickness and death.

177
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:13,600
If there is next life,
I really don’t want to be human.

178
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:26,120
I only want to be with you forever.

179
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,640
I would wait for you.

180
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,280
Honey, I feel so bad.

181
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:48,960
Just let me go without pain, OK?

182
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,320
Sir, no!

183
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,000
Take the tael silver to buy medicine for aunt.

184
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,880
Are these enough?

185
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,080
Kid, I appreciate your kindness.

186
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:32,720
But I am leaving.

187
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,400
Honey,

188
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,440
this is a good man.

189
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:56,800
You must pay him back
if you have the chance in the future.

190
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,680
Take…

191
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,960
…care.

192
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,560
Aunt died a natural death, which is a happy thing.

193
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,160
Please restrain your grief.

194
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,400
She and I have been together for 60 years.

195
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,280
We have never been apart.

196
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,080
The 60 years in human world have gone in a flash.

197
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,320
I should go.

198
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,640
Where are you going?

199
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,400
I’m going to the place I should go.

200
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,080
Don’t take it too hard.

201
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
If you want, you can
go to the military camp with me.

202
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,080
We soldiers lost our parents since childhood,

203
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,560
and we are willing to support you.

204
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,080
Your military camp is right in front.

205
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,120
You will get there after taking a turn.

206
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,880
Thank you.

207
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,880
Young man,

208
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,640
you are kindhearted.

209
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,560
I,

210
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,640
I owe you a favor.

211
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,320
If you meet any difficulty in the future,
go to find me with it.

212
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,200
General, the old man looks weird.

213
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,680
You gave all your money.

214
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,920
Will you be cheated?

215
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,840
He doesn’t have children and just lost his wife.

216
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,080
He’s quite poor.

217
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,240
How could he

218
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,880
bury his dead wife beside a river

219
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,360
and leave?

220
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,240
In addition, this old woman

221
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,200
looks so much older than him.

222
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,800
General, I guess you were cheated.

223
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,920
I don’t plan to get back the money.

224
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,960
Just take it as a good deed.

225
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,320
Aunt, I just met you once.

226
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,760
It’s just a trifle. I dare not accept it.

227
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,360
I’ll leave the seal for you.

228
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,000
Let’s go.

229
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,880
General, what happened to you?

230
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,480
General.

231
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,640
General, did that thing come back again?

232
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,880
I’m going to relieve myself.

233
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,040
Damn it. Why does it always go with me?

234
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,360
Is it immortal or monster?

235
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,360
Immortals,

236
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,800
I have never done any guilty deed

237
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,960
and I am open and poised.

238
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,800
Since he insisted giving me this gift,

239
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,280
I will accept it.

240
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,400
Please don’t go with me.

241
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,080
Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family

242
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,720
will announce King Yi’s illness.

243
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,080
I will ask King Yi to abdicate and choose another wise king.

244
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,840
But Minister Fu…

245
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,400
If King Yi knows he can’t live long

246
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,440
and is unwilling to abdicate,

247
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,090
leaving Huaiwu’s future

248
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,320
and well-being of the people,

249
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,240
Minister Fu and others will not agree.

250
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,520
What did you say, Dad?

251
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,240
You go back first.

252
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,160
We are leaving.

253
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,360
King Yi is seriously ill
and doesn’t have any child.

254
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,120
He should abdicate and
hand over the regime as soon as possible.

255
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,400
If he dies one day suddenly,

256
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,800
the court and the state will be peaceful.

257
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,680
I guess you have planned this for a long time.

258
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,320
I guess the ministers

259
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,440
will recommend you

260
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
as the new king tomorrow.

261
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,960
I do so for the future of Huaiwu.

262
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,920
Sui He, I know

263
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,480
your passion for Xu Feng.

264
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,900
But as you can see,

265
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,520
even Saint Girl said he couldn’t be saved

266
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,480
and would die soon.

267
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,000
Why do you destroy the happiness of your life

268
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,160
for such a dying man?

269
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,920
Dad, Saint Doctors’ Family
has the best medical skill.

270
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,560
As long as Saint Girl is given more time,

271
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,280
she will be able to save my cousin.

272
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,640
Why are you so obsessive?

273
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,160
Think about it.

274
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,480
If I take the throne one day,

275
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,000
you will be the princess.

276
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,840
By then, you can choose any good man you want.

277
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,240
You will find a satisfactory husband.

278
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,600
Though the world is big, Cousin can’t be copied.

279
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,600
I only love Cousin.

280
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,560
No, I need to meet Cousin.

281
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,840
Stop!

282
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,120
Qi Chong!

283
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,840
Your Excellency Duke.

284
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,760
Send princess back to her room.

285
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,200
Without my order,

286
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,080
she can’t leave the room.

287
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,800
Yes!

288
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,480
Princess, please.

289
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,880
Even if you bring my cousin down from the throne,

290
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,000
I will only marry him in my life.

291
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,040
Here comes His Majesty!

292
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,960
May you healthy, Your Majesty!

293
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,360
Stand up.

294
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,480
Thank you, Your Majesty!

295
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,040
What is the important thing today?

296
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,000
Your Majesty,

297
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,920
I originally couldn’t bear to

298
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,040
disturb Your Majesty when Your Majesty is ill.

299
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,000
This matter is related to fate of the state.

300
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,840
It really can’t be delayed.

301
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,880
What is so important?

302
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,380
Tell me.

303
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,320
Your Majesty is ill and doesn’t have any child.

304
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,760
In addition, it is a period of trouble.

305
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,920
So we believe

306
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,720
Your Majesty should put the state and people first

307
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,150
and abdicate to a virtuous man.

308
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,360
In this case,
we won’t fail the spirit of the ancestors.

309
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,800
You think I am ill
and can’t shoulder the important task.

310
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,620
The previous king died early.

311
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,870
Your Majesty acceded to the throne
at a very young age.

312
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,170
With a young king, the state was doubted,
with internal and external problems.

313
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,550
Fortunately, Duke Nanping
made vigorous efforts to turn the situation,

314
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,840
delivering the state from distress.

315
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,170
The former example is before our eyes.

316
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,800
Hope Your Majesty
can set store by overall interests.

317
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,890
Following the example of Yao and Shun’s abdication

318
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,140
has long been set in the fundamental principles.

319
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,280
According to you, if I don’t abdicate,

320
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,080
I will be a sinner of Huaiwu.

321
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,760
I dare not.

322
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,000
Then tell me.

323
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,840
If I abdicate, who can take over the throne?

324
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,840
We must recommend an upright wise king

325
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,480
who possesses both integrity and ability.

326
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,000
An upright wise king with integrity and ability?

327
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,600
I wonder if Duke Nanping
wants to form alliances with various dukes

328
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,040
or Minister Fu wants to unite the country.

329
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,640
Your Majesty, I deserve death.

330
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,280
If I have the intention to rebel,
I would stand condemned by God.

331
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,160
Your Majesty, I dare not.

332
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,520
Liu Si said so much to ask you to abdicate,
so he is guilty.

333
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,320
Please punish him, Your Majesty.

334
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,280
Your Majesty, my royalty
could be discerned by the sun and moon.

335
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,840
Mr. Liu,

336
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,680
you said I am seriously ill

337
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,240
and will die soon.

338
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,800
Where did you

339
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,920
get the news?

340
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,520
Recently, Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family
went to the palace to treat your illness.

341
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,520
We’ll know by asking her.

342
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,080
OK. Summon Saint Girl.

343
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,120
Summon Jin Mi, Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family.

344
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,680
Jin Mi, Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family
pays a visit to Your Majesty.

345
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,360
Forego the formalities.

346
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,920
Thanks, Your Majesty.

347
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,000
Tell me

348
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,440
what illness I have got.

349
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,720
Previously, Your Majesty
got up before dawn, ate late and overworked,

350
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,560
so he was indeed a little weak.

351
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,840
But,

352
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,240
after being nursed by me,

353
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,920
Your Majesty is strong and has recovered.

354
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,000
Your Majesty, I’ve received news
from the men sent to Saint Doctors’ Family.

355
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,680
How is it?

356
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,560
Everyone of Saint Doctors’ Family is safe.

357
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,120
Our men

358
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,240
are protecting them well.

359
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,920
Duke Nanping’s men all died.

360
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,120
Duke Nanping is always careful and heartless.

361
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,480
Arrange more men to project Saint Girl.

362
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,760
Do not let Duke Nanping

363
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,440
get close to her.

364
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:25,960
Yes.

365
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,960
Previously, you said

366
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,080
Your Majesty’s kidney yang and blood are weak,
so his six yang have problems.

367
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,560
As for this,

368
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,080
I was indeed inexperienced before,

369
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,200
so I made some erroneous judgment.

370
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,960
But these diagnoses are extremely private.

371
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,240
I remember I have never told Your Excellency these.

372
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,360
I wonder where Your Excellency got the news.

373
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,240
As Saint Girl, how could you make such an error?

374
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,040
How dare you treat Your Majesty slightly?

375
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,240
Your Excellency Duke, please don’t be angry.

376
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,120
Your Majesty, I made such an error

377
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,600
because

378
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,120
someone tampered with Your Majesty’s diets.

379
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,760
The diets on the diet list seem nourish,

380
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,720
but their properties go against each other.

381
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,640
Most of them are strong drugs of
eighteen incompatibilities and nineteen counteractions.

382
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,920
If Your Majesty takes them for a long time,

383
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,800
the consequence will be unthinkable.

384
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,160
Where is the diet list from?

385
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,640
The diet list…

386
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,080
Your Majesty,

387
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,320
Saint Girl asked me
about the diet list some days ago.

388
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,190
I asked Dong Ruixi, Manager of Food Supervisor,

389
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,650
to copy one.

390
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,160
Now it seems

391
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,760
Dong Ruixi is very suspicious.

392
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,960
Summon Dong Ruixi.

393
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,200
Dong Ruixi, is the diet list made by you?

394
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,960
Your Majesty, it is made by me.

395
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,400
Do you know the tonic diets on it

396
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,400
would kill me?

397
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,720
Who is behind this?

398
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,640
Tell me your accomplice, and I will spare you.

399
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,960
Your Majesty,

400
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,720
I don’t have accomplice

401
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,720
and I have never acted on anyone’s instigation.

402
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,000
Your Majesty, this man is vicious

403
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,720
and wanted to kill you invisibly.

404
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,440
He must been beheaded as a warning to others.

405
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,920
Your Majesty, this matter has many doubtful points.

406
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,280
I suggest putting Dong Ruixi into prison
and investigating this matter.

407
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,440
Put him into prison.

408
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,600
Go.

409
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,840
Go.

410
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,320
Minister Fu.

411
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,000
Here I am.

412
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,400
You’ll be responsible for this.

413
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

414
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:28,960
Officials.

415
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,160
When people have many “weapons,”
the sate will be in chaos.

416
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,560
When people have more skills,
strange things will appear.

417
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,960
Hope you can fulfill their duties

418
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,680
and learn from Duke Nanping

419
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,240
who is upright with both ability and integrity.

420
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,640
Having such an upright minister,
I am rather content.

421
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,160
Thanks for your praise, Your Majesty.

422
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,960
We will follow Your Majesty’s order.

423
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,840
Your Excellency Duke,

424
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,680
the men sent to Saint Doctors’ Family lost contact.

425
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,190
Remember.

426
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,690
Do not let Dong Ruixi speak again.

427
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,239
I see.

428
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,639
Buddha,

429
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:07,679
please bless my cousin

430
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,280
to let him pass this disaster safely.

431
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,840
Your Highness.

432
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,320
Your Highness.

433
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,440
Did you get some news?

434
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,080
The Meeting of Commanding Officers is over.

435
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,600
His Majesty is healthy.

436
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,760
Previously, his diets were tampered

437
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,480
so Saint Girl misdiagnosed.

438
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,800
So my cousin is healthy?

439
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,800
Saint Girl said His Majesty is very strong.

440
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,640
I know my cousin will be blessed

441
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,640
and will be fine.

442
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,520
Well, who tampered

443
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,360
my cousin’s diets?

444
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,040
It’s Dong Ruixi, Manager of Food Supervisor.

445
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,280
Does he have accomplice
or is he instructed to do it?

446
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
No, he did it alone.

447
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,880
This time, King Yi’s men arrived on time

448
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,690
and saved the whole Saint Doctors’ Family.

449
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,270
That’s really lucky.

450
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,080
He always keeps his word.

451
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,680
Now King Yi has recovered,

452
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,240
so you don’t need to act

453
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,240
and I don’t need to decoct medicinal herbs.

454
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,360
It’s indeed a little boring.

455
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,800
How about we go to listen to storytelling?

456
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,520
Recently, we have been trapped in Beiyuan Villa.

457
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,440
I feel so bored.

458
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,280
OK. Let’s go.

459
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,600
Do you just leave?

460
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,880
Jin Mi, wait for me.

461
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,840
"Changhong Restaurant"
The God of War, King Yi, holding a long sword,

462
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,960
rode a horse towards the large number of soldiers.

463
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,600
He shouted

464
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,480
and the enemy became terror-stricken,

465
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,600
and suffered one defeat after another.

466
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,040
Great! Great!

467
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,800
Well said!

468
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,040
Well said!

469
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,240
Right at that moment,

470
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,280
the leader of the enemy
came to the front of King Yi.

471
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,960
They both held long swords
and rushed to each other…

472
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,720
Wrong.
