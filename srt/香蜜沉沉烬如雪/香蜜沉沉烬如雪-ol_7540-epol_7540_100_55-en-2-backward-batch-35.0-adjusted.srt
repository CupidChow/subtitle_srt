"Episode 55"

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,579
"Cave of Jiu Ying"

4
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,120
There is really someone
trespassing the Cave of Jiu Ying.

5
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,700
Go and report to Princess Sui He.

6
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,300
OK.

7
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,320
Little one, let me see where you are.

8
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,760
Let me see where you are.

9
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,000
Little one.

10
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,960
Don't sway. Don't sway.

11
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,140
You are making me dizzy.

12
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,900
Let me see where you are now.

13
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,020
Don’ sway your hands.

14
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,000
Little one, you are so clever

15
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,480
that you make me help you in this way.

16
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,240
Mr. Hu,

17
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,560
this underground palace is so big.

18
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,200
Where is the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying?

19
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,460
The Internal Dan of Jiu Ying

20
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,900
is in the Cave of Jiu Ying,

21
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,600
which is the innermost part
of the underground palace.

22
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,280
Yes.

23
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,860
That’s the right path.

24
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,060
Go along this path.

25
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,360
Go straight to the inside.

26
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,160
Move along.

27
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,160
Move along. Move along.

28
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,900
Move along. Move along. Move along.

29
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,840
Move along. Move along.

30
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,200
You are at the door now, right?

31
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,180
That’s the door.

32
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,160
Outside the door is the ward.

33
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,960
The fire of supreme yang

34
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,600
or the water of supreme yin can break it.

35
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,220
Little one,

36
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,100
you have only one hour.

37
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,220
Hurry up.

38
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,160
Otherwise, you will be in danger.

39
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,180
It’s here.

40
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,420
The Internal Dan of Jiu Ying is in the cave.

41
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,220
Open it.

42
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:44,720
OK.

43
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,260
Little one, time is running out.

44
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,100
Little one.

45
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,659
Break the ward.

46
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,460
OK.

47
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,120
I guessed you would come here
to take the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying

48
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,720
in order to save Yan You.

49
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,340
Jin Mi,

50
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,340
Today, I will

51
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,180
let you die here.

52
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:12,000
My Lord,

53
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,440
the soldiers reported

54
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,500
they saw Water Immortal and Princess Sui He

55
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:16,920
enter the underground palace one after another.

56
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,460
Little one.

57
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,420
Hurry. Let me check.

58
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,980
The Wall of Jiu Ying.

59
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,460
That's it.

60
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,180
It has nine eyes.

61
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,100
That red one is the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying.

62
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,640
Take the Internal Dan before it wakes up.

63
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,200
Otherwise, you will be in danger.

64
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,320
Got it.

65
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,659
Red...

66
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,940
Which one is red?

67
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,620
What?

68
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,700
You can't even tell which one is red?

69
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,720
Don't piss me off. OK?

70
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,820
You have only one chance.

71
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,040
You must get the real Internal Dan.

72
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,680
Otherwise,

73
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,640
you will be swallowed up by the soul of Jiu Ying.

74
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:35,900
Hurry up.

75
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,860
Time is almost up.

76
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,520
I know,

77
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,540
but I don't know which one is red.

78
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,700
Let me check for you. Let me check for you.

79
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,600
Mr. Hu,

80
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:06,340
check which eye is red for me.

81
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,820
I was dazzled

82
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,700
by a shiny thing just now.

83
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,680
I can't see anything clearly now.

84
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,320
What?

85
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,120
Dear, I have been trapped here
for thousands of years.

86
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,780
Please help me out.

87
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,700
Another one who wants to take my Internal Dan?

88
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,060
You are bringing about your own destruction.

89
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,920
Why are there always some daredevil people?

90
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,940
You have one. I have one.

91
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,940
Guess where the Internal Dan is?

92
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,700
Little one,

93
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,740
Jiu Ying has been awake.

94
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,900
Get out immediately.

95
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,680
Jin Mi, get out.

96
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,480
Get out immediately.

97
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,700
The Internal Dan is its vital part.

98
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,400
When in danger,

99
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,020
its reaction must be the most obvious.

100
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,420
I found it.

101
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,200
No one can take away my Internal Dan.

102
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,920
How do you know

103
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,800
that the green one is my real Internal Dan?

104
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,320
Shut up!

105
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,820
The green one is not my Internal Dan.

106
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,180
Everyone knows that the red one is my Internal Dan.

107
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,320
If you take the wrong one,

108
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,920
you will be inhaled to my soul

109
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,600
and become one part of me.

110
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,740
Are you really going to take the risk?

111
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Are you really going to take the risk?

112
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,900
Are you really going to take the risk?

113
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,980
Are you really going to take the risk?

114
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,920
Are you really going to take the risk?

115
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,820
Are you really going to take the risk?

116
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,660
Are you really going to take the risk?

117
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,360
Are you really going to take the risk?

118
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,540
Are you really going to take the risk?

119
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,240
Mr. Hu,

120
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,480
did you see it?

121
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I found it.

122
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,940
It’s the red Internal Dan.

123
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,060
Red?

124
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,060
Is it true that

125
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,460
I have become color-blinded?

126
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,780
I will talk with you later.

127
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,240
It is a surprise that you got it.

128
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,620
It seems that I underestimated your ability.

129
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,860
What are you doing here?

130
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,940
Give me the Internal Dan, right now.

131
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,440
What do you want it for?

132
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,300
I won’t let you get the things

133
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,840
you want.

134
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,560
OK.

135
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,040
I’ll give it to you.

136
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,960
Take it.

137
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,220
Sui He, get out of my way.

138
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,620
Good birds never stand in the way.

139
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,820
I’ll take this chance to kill her

140
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,400
and remove the cause of future troubles.

141
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,940
How come you can use Glazed Pure Fire?

142
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,980
Auntie.

143
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,420
I have given you all of my power.

144
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,980
With Glazed Pure Fire,

145
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,820
you must revive Bird Family

146
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,660
and help my son, Xu Feng
to become Heavenly Emperor.

147
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,100
It’s worthwhile for me to have
curried favour with you for so many years.

148
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,360
Now I have so much magic power.

149
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,440
I wonder who dares to stand in my way.

150
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,220
Tell me.

151
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,780
Did you,

152
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,900
Did you kill my daddy?

153
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,820
Yes, I did. So what?

154
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,480
I also know that Xu Feng was saved by you.

155
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,400
But now he thinks it’s me who saved him.

156
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,840
Jin Mi,

157
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,860
it’s impossible for you and Xu Feng
to be together again.

158
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,100
Today

159
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,820
I’ll take revenge for my daddy and auntie Lin Xiu.

160
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,300
It’s her.

161
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,400
It’s her who killed my daddy.

162
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,420
My Lord, help me.

163
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,560
Little one.

164
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,600
What the hell is this?

165
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,040
It’s as unreliable as Honghong at critical moment.

166
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,340
Your Majesty.

167
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,160
Why do you look so flurried?

168
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,880
Where is Mi?

169
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,500
Little one has gone to the
underground palace of Demon Realm.

170
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,520
After she took the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying,

171
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,680
I lost contact with her suddenly.

172
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,680
I don’t know what’s going on now.

173
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,820
She has already admitted

174
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,060
she killed my daddy and auntie Lin Xiu.

175
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,560
Phoenix,

176
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,320
we both were cheated by her.

177
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,000
Nonsense!

178
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,260
If I could kill the past Water Immortal,

179
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,980
I wouldn’t have been hit by you.

180
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,360
You used Glazed Pure Fire just now.

181
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,500
It’s you who killed my daddy.

182
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,040
It’s you who framed Xu Feng.

183
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,060
It’s her.

184
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,060
It’s her who has been framing you.

185
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,860
Frame?

186
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,520
Is it her or you

187
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,440
who hurt me?

188
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,480
My Lord,

189
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,140
this woman is so vicious.

190
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,440
She killed you.

191
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,240
And she is angry with me
because I brought you back to life.

192
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,480
She’s determined to kill me.

193
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,640
It’s Run Yu who asks you

194
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,900
to sneak into Demon Realm again and again. Right?

195
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,860
Don't think that I’m as gullible as I was before

196
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,380
so that I will be fooled by you again.

197
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,920
Today,

198
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,800
if you hurt Sui He,

199
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,780
I will kill you.

200
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,720
My Lord has offered you a chance.

201
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,980
Get out of here. Right now.

202
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,840
How to repay parents' love.

203
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,160
Even you betray me, too.

204
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,940
No, please.

205
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,820
No, please.

206
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,180
No, please.

207
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,000
I have only one phoenix hairpin.

208
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:42,260
I gave it to you.

209
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:44,800
Can't you still understand my affection?

210
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,220
Put on this phoenix hairpin.

211
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,540
Let it help me protect you from dangers.

212
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,620
No, please.

213
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,140
No, please.

214
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,200
Mi,

215
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,560
hold on a little bit more.

216
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,940
I’ll take you back.

217
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,340
They really work in collusion.

218
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,500
My Lord, are you really
going to let them go like this?

219
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,020
Why are you here?

220
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,820
I consumed much magic power
in order to bring you back to life.

221
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,320
I heard that the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying
can increase magic power.

222
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,700
So I’m here to take it.

223
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,460
I didn’t expect that Jin Mi was here, too.

224
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,320
And she was going to kill me.

225
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,200
If you wanted the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying,

226
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,260
you could have told me.

227
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,100
Why did you come here to take it yourself?

228
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
I just don't want you to worry about me.

229
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,960
You may go first.

230
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,420
Are you still obsessed with her

231
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,120
and missing her?

232
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,520
Won’t you sop

233
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,340
until you are killed in collusion

234
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,740
by them two?

235
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,680
Xu Feng does believe me.

236
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,440
He does.

237
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,680
Little one.

238
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,420
Little one.

239
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,020
Little one.

240
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,000
Little one.

241
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,120
Mr. Hu.

242
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,840
Come here.

243
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,640
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

244
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
How is Lord Puchi?

245
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,040
Don’t worry.

246
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,240
His Majesty is sending the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying

247
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,540
into his body.

248
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,820
He will wake up soon.

249
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,660
Don’t worry. Don’t worry.

250
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,880
That's good.

251
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,540
Little one.

252
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,460
What's wrong with your eyes?

253
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,380
My eyes?

254
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,640
What's wrong with my eyes?

255
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,160
I’m asking you.

256
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,140
What?

257
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,180
Are you going to hide this from me?

258
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,100
That stinks.

259
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,980
I asked you to take the red Internal Dan.

260
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,940
But you took the green one.

261
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,400
Did I take the green one?

262
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,160
Don’t you know this?

263
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,740
Little one,

264
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,120
can’t you

265
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,800
distinguish colors?

266
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,800
I see.

267
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,380
Why are you so silly?

268
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,480
For that phoenix,

269
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,620
you even gave up your ability to distinguish colors.

270
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,860
Little one,

271
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,060
you are the daughter of the Floral Immortal.

272
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,000
Alright. Alright.

273
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,200
Don’t tell Chief Peony about this.

274
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,140
You know her.

275
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,380
If she knows this,

276
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,960
she will nag at me for a hundred years.

277
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,820
Mr. Hu, what happened?

278
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,220
Don't scare me.

279
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,680
Are you crying?

280
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,700
No, I’m not crying.

281
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,740
Aren’t you crying?

282
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,380
I haven’t seen you crying
in the previous thousands of years.

283
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,580
My tears are carrot-colored.

284
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,620
Look.

285
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,480
Unfortunately, you can't distinguish colors now.

286
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,100
Don't cry, Mr. Hu.

287
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,980
Carrot color

288
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,380
is quite unusual.

289
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,080
But it’s no pity not to see it.

290
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,840
Right?

291
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,680
Although I can only see black and white,

292
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,640
I think

293
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,160
the world of black and white

294
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,380
is not bad.

295
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,320
I’m not afraid of the sunlight.

296
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,120
What’s more, I got a blessing in disguise.

297
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,560
Well, what you said does make sense.

298
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,680
Fortunately, you don’t have
the ability to distinguish colors.

299
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,840
Otherwise, you may

300
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,340
have died in that Cave of Jiu Ying.

301
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,440
In these years, many people with strong power

302
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,420
have died for the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying.

303
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,400
According to the stories

304
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,640
and what is mentioned in books,

305
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,420
the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying is red.

306
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,680
This is where Jiu Ying is sinister.

307
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,480
It plays diversion trick

308
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,060
so that

309
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,320
many immortals and demons
have become the its sacrificial offerings.

310
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,740
Where am I?

311
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,640
Why am I here?

312
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,600
Has he run away again?

313
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,020
I thought it would take much effort to catch you.

314
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,340
I didn’t expect you to be so weak.

315
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,200
But with your remaining magic power,

316
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,080
you can make one more
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow. Right?

317
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,960
Don’t even think about this.

318
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,520
Sorry, Liuying.

319
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,880
I am afraid I can’t keep our appointment
on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month.

320
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,200
Commit suicide? It’s not easy!

321
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,620
I will let you

322
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,200
make one more Spirit-Vanishing Arrow willingly.

323
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,120
Lord Puchi, you are awake now.

324
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,280
You're awake finally.

325
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,360
Mi,

326
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,920
I heard that you had risked your life

327
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,880
to take the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying for me.

328
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,600
I’m very moved.

329
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,040
Beauty, I knew there is a place for me in your heart.

330
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,980
You are welcome.

331
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,940
It’s good that you are OK now.

332
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,380
Yan You,

333
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,580
which jerk did this to you?

334
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,700
Fox Fairy,

335
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,680
why are you here, too?

336
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,880
Mi.

337
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,180
I let Lian Qiao ask Fox Fairy to come over

338
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,960
as a witness.

339
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,240
This time my injury

340
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,400
was caused by Sui He’s Glazed Pure Fire.

341
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,680
On that day, I went to Demon Realm with Jin Mi

342
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,360
to see that proud phoenix.

343
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,000
But she disappeared suddenly.

344
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,240
I met Sui He when I was looking for Jin Mi.

345
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,100
Why are you following me?

346
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,740
I heard you said you were

347
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,520
the Demon Lord’s life saver.

348
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,600
I thought I was very shameless.

349
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,620
But when compared with you,

350
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,240
my shamelessness is nothing.

351
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,960
We both

352
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,900
know that it’s Jin Mi who saved Demon Lord.

353
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,080
You falsely claim the contribution as your own.

354
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,720
Aren’t you afraid that Xu Feng will blame you

355
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,920
when he knows the truth one day?

356
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,720
How do you know that
it is Jin Mi who saved Xu Feng?

357
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,840
I went to the Snake Mountain with Jin Mi.

358
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,340
I have seen how

359
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,900
she risked her life

360
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,360
to get the Light of Xuanqiong,
the guiding medicine of Jiuzhuan Golden Elixir.

361
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,680
This time,

362
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,320
I will not let you ruin my happiness

363
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,580
like I did in the Human Realm.

364
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,460
You haven’t changed at all in these years.

365
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,900
You are still a shrew.

366
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,740
You are only good at bluffing.

367
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,420
Today, I will let you shut up forever.

368
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,660
How can you use Glazed Pure Fire?

369
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,240
Were Water Immortal and Wind Immortal

370
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,060
killed by you?

371
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,260
You are not that stupid.

372
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:48,920
Yan You,

373
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,200
nowadays you are no match for me.

374
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,240
Today, you came on your own.

375
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,780
I will get even with you

376
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,800
for what you did to me in Human Realm.

377
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,020
I never expected

378
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,200
that I have suffered a series of setback by you

379
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,440
Sui He,

380
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,740
I used to love you with all my heart.

381
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,500
I could do anything for you.

382
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,260
But now

383
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,880
you are going to kill me.

384
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,580
Even so,

385
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,480
I still can't forget you.

386
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,960
I hate myself.

387
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,540
I hate that I can’t forget your charms.

388
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,720
and your every twinkle and smile.

389
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,640
I laugh at myself for being too shallow.

390
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,900
I hate myself for being humble.

391
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,740
But I still can't forget you.

392
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,840
You turn a blind eye to me,

393
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,080
and want to hurt me

394
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,400
and kill me

395
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,460
But I still...

396
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,500
I still love you.

397
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,800
Leave it.

398
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,600
If I’m killed by you,

399
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,400
I will die without anything to regret
and with my dream fulfilled.

400
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,340
I only hope that

401
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,920
one day you will remember that

402
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,080
a snake named Yan You loved you so much.

403
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,120
For the sake of my love for you,

404
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,600
could you fulfil my last small wish?

405
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,760
Go ahead.

406
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,940
Step forward a little bit.

407
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,760
I’m running out of strength.

408
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,020
Damn it.

409
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,460
You used Evil Ashes, playing the same trick of Run Yu.

410
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,440
Having been hurt by my Liuli Fire,

411
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,400
you won’t be alive for long

412
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,220
even if you can run away,

413
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,200
Who should I turn to?

414
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,360
Lord Puchi.

415
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,840
Lord Puchi.

416
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,060
Lord Puchi.

417
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,980
Fortunately, I’m smart enough.

418
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,680
Otherwise, it’s unlikely for me to run off

419
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,980
after being hurt by Sui He’s Glazed Pure Fire.

420
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,240
Fortunately, Jin Mi made the summoning spell.

421
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,620
Otherwise, I would have been caught and killed

422
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,800
by Sui He.

423
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,000
Wait.

424
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,740
What do you mean by

425
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,800
saying you can’t forget Sui He?

426
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,940
I’m ashamed of this.

427
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,420
When I started to become a fairy,

428
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,100
I was a pure and cute snake.

429
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,340
Your Majesty, I’m Sui He, from Bird Family.

430
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,460
This is Yi amber.

431
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,360
It’s made from the eyeballs of colorful-feathered birds.

432
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,780
It not only has a unique radiance

433
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,980
but also means eternal love.

434
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,100
I take this occasion to present to you, Your Majesty.

435
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,300
Your name is Sui He. Right?

436
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,720
You are so considerate.

437
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,800
According to the rules of seniority,

438
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,900
you should call Tu Yao auntie.

439
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,720
Really?

440
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,380
I don’t remember that I have such a relative.

441
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,440
I’m going to take a seat first.

442
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,740
Miss Immortal,

443
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,920
I’m Yan You.

444
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,140
Your smile

445
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,520
is really unforgettable.

446
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,940
What a nuisance!

447
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:48,219
Yan You,

448
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,800
why are you so smart?

449
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,699
This is the flower I picked in the Human Realm.

450
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,639
Here you are.

451
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,540
It’s so beautiful.

452
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,960
There have been no flowers
in Heavenly Realm for thousands of years.

453
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,840
Did you pick it specially for me?

454
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,659
Well...

455
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,400
The flower and me...

456
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,600
Which one is more beautiful?

457
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,260
Your eyes are brighter

458
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:24,200
than a thousand luminous pearls put together.

459
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,240
Yan You,

460
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,100
would you take a walk with me

461
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,520
in this garden tomorrow?

462
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,780
<i>The flower in my heart has withered.</i>

463
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,580
<i>Time can’t go back.</i>

464
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,260
<i>The memory haunts me</i>

465
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,300
<i>making me grieved.</i>

466
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,180
<i>I only wish I would never regret in the rest of my life.</i>

467
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,420
<i>Fly away along with the flower aroma.</i>

468
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,000
How dare you!

469
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,900
How dare you do such a licentious thing
in Heavenly Realm!

470
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,360
Your Majesty. Sui He.

471
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,440
This matter is not the way it seems.

472
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,540
There must be some misunderstandings.

473
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,100
Take them away.

474
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:32,940
Go.

475
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,180
Your Majesty.

476
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,060
Sui He.

477
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,380
Believe me.

478
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,020
I can definitely explain it clearly.

479
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,080
Go.

480
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,620
Snake Fairy Yan You and Fairy Qi Yao

481
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,580
are licentious and shameless.

482
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,420
Yan You, now you are devoid of your fairy identity.

483
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,240
Qi Yao, you are demoted to be a human being.

484
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,360
And you are not allow to
be promoted to be a fairy forever.

485
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,620
Your Majesty,

486
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,240
there are some misunderstandings.

487
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,540
Let me explain.

488
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,860
Explain?

489
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,460
It’s a guilt deliberately imposed on us.

490
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,700
How can you explain this clearly?

491
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,940
Just because Fairy Qi Yao and
Heavenly Emperor made eyes at each other,

492
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,680
Heavenly Empress takes her as the pain in the neck.

493
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,940
Sui He perceived Heavenly Empress’s thoughts.

494
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,640
So she played this trick

495
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,660
to make Fairy Qi Yao get out of the way

496
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,720
in order to please Heavenly Empress.

497
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,780
Because of this, she

498
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,700
gradually becomes the leader of the Bird Family.

499
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,000
But originally

500
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,620
I intended to fulfill her wish.

501
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,720
So I didn’t mention this thing to anyone.

502
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,260
Since then,

503
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,000
I have never dared to fall in love with anyone again.

504
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,060
I am afraid that one day

505
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,100
my heart will be trampled on the ground again.

506
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,880
Everyone thinks Yan You is a playboy.

507
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,260
But nobody knows that

508
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,980
it’s because you were hurt by your loved one.

509
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,780
Who didn’t do some stupid things

510
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,740
when he or she was young?

511
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,480
We have to experience a lot

512
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,060
so as to become mature.

513
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,740
But it’s OK. I am not that stupid now.

514
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,640
By the way,

515
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,360
when I went to the Cave of Jiu Ying,

516
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,700
Sui He also used Glazed Pure Fire
when fighting with me.

517
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,380
I think she went there

518
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,980
in order to take the Internal Dan

519
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,720
and make you devoid of the chance to wake up.

520
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,960
Why does Sui He have such a strong magic power?

521
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,320
And why can she use Glazed Pure Fire?

522
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,700
Is it Sui He

523
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,320
who killed Luo Lin and Lin Xiu?

524
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,020
That's right.

525
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,260
It’s her.

526
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,140
She admitted it to me in person.

527
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,040
It’s really her.

528
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,020
Then tell Xu Feng immediately.

529
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,080
Kill this vicious woman as soon as possible.

530
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,020
I told him.

531
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,420
But he didn’t believe me.

532
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,060
I used to lie to him and hurt him.

533
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,760
How is it possible that he would trust me again?

534
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,820
Mi,

535
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,420
if you don’t clear the misunderstandings,

536
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,800
then phoenix

537
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,040
is really going to get married with Sui He.

538
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,420
By that time,

539
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,480
if that vicious woman becomes Demon Empress,

540
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,760
there will be no peace in the six realms any longer.

541
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,860
He’s right.

542
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,260
Jin Mi,

543
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,680
there are some misunderstandings
between you and Xu Feng.

544
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,020
You should clear them early.
