00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,180
“Ashes of Love”

2
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,079
"Episode 11"

3
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,980
Hey, brothers!

4
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,460
Greetings to Lord Fire Immortal.

5
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,950
Your Highness, your
visit to this place...

6
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,160
has showered glory and
added colours around here.

7
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,960
Save your pleasantries.

8
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,160
Qiwu Palace has lost a servant.

9
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,960
I'm here to look for her.

10
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,100
Did you see a very beautiful young
lady...

11
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,180
or a fairchild with grape vine?

12
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,520
- Have any of you seen her?
- No.

13
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,860
Your Highness,

14
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,040
we have never seen the person
that you're looking for.

15
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,140
This is weird.

16
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,820
Jin Mi's scent is clearly
strong around here.

17
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,240
Are all the Earth Immortals
in this area here?

18
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,860
Your Highness, an Earth Immortal
named Zhang Fude is not here yet.

19
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,140
Where is his area of jurisdiction?

20
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,000
Over there.

21
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,200
Since you've experienced "playing",

22
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,140
Now we've come to the last thing...

23
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,520
in the 4 greatest pleasures of life.

24
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,700
Let you have a taste of it.

25
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,880
This is the legendary
House of Springs.

26
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,460
Let me bring you there.

27
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,060
I'm sure you'll like it.
Let's go.

28
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,180
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

29
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,920
Look at these handsome men.

30
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,280
Hurry, please come in, come in.

31
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,780
Come in.

32
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,420
Receive the guests!
Receive the guests!

33
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,800
Where do you come from?

34
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,800
What is this smell? It stinks!

35
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,760
It's the scent of cosmetics.

36
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,320
Look at these girls.

37
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,360
They put cosmetics on their faces
and receive the guests.

38
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,080
Misters, do you know any girls here?

39
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,180
- Get us the most popular girl here!
- All right.

40
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,160
Peony, Peachblossom, receive the guests!

41
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,800
Peony?

42
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,040
Chief Peony is here.

43
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,280
Don't go!

44
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,380
Mister, where are you going?

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,460
Come back! Come back!

46
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,040
Where are you going?

47
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,280
If you're not fond of them,

48
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,300
we have Begonia and Daffodils too.

49
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,440
- What's the matter?
- They scared the hell out of me.

50
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,880
Didn't you hear what she say?
Mudan, Chief Peony.

51
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,100
If Chief Peony finds out,
and take me back, I'll be doomed.

52
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,220
I will be punished.

53
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,920
Luckily I was quick,
I ran straight away.

54
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,260
I was careless.

55
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,840
I forgot that you're a girl.

56
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,220
- My bad, my bad.
- I'm a girl...

57
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,960
Does this have anything
to do with my gender?

58
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,080
Of course it does.

59
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,620
Let me bring you somewhere else.
Let's go.

60
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,940
What is this?

61
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,160
This play is called "Dong Xian".

62
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,560
It is a story about Emperor Ai and his
favourite official, Dong Xian.

63
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,720
Let's go.

64
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,960
Mister, we're here.

65
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,900
What are you doing?

66
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,680
What is this place?

67
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,740
Mister, you're funny.

68
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,200
This is the theater.

69
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,480
Ying Ge, let me take good care of you.

70
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,300
Jin Mi!

71
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,920
Phoenix.

72
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,720
Why are you here?

73
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,600
I know.

74
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,900
Are you here
to have some fun too?

75
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,040
Have fun? I'm looking for you.

76
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,940
Amazing, amazing.

77
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,960
What a heavenly looking man!

78
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,400
How did you know he's from the Heaven?

79
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,940
He knows you're from the Heaven.

80
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,140
Demon! Demon!

81
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,200
Lord Fire Immortal, are you trying to
give Jin Mi a hard time again?

82
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,700
I remember that,

83
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,300
she doesn't owe you
any magical prowess anymore.

84
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,780
I also remember I told you that,

85
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,760
if you ever dare to advance to
Qiwu Palace,

86
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,060
I will never let you get away with it.

87
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,300
Immortal Jin Mi is my important guest.

88
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,040
Yan You, you've always been a thief.
What now?

89
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,520
Are you trying to steal my guest too?

90
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,280
How am I supposed to take it?

91
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,300
I wonder am I the influential one,

92
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,920
or this little grape is
the influential one.

93
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,300
I get to see Fire Immortal and
Night Immortal...

94
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,520
two supreme immortals get together.

95
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,860
Which show is the Night Immortal
performing tonight?

96
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,860
"The Gathering Of Heroes"?
"General and Premier Make Up"?

97
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,420
Xu Feng, leave with
Immortal Jin Mi first.

98
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,380
Yan You and I
would like to have a good talk.

99
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,680
- I...
- Come with me.

100
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,240
Phoenix, Phoenix.

101
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,140
Why have you come to the mortal word?

102
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,640
Are you bored?

103
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,560
That's why you've come here
to take a walk.

104
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,420
Take a walk? I...

105
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,260
Don't beat me.

106
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,200
Beat you?

107
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,020
I'd rather beat myself.

108
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,200
Fish Fairy.

109
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,400
That was quick.

110
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,560
I get to see 2
supreme immortals today,

111
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,000
I've lived a full life.

112
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,780
I couldn't find Jin Mi anywhere.

113
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,340
I didn't know that it was your trick.

114
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,020
You've put in so much effort...

115
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,160
in hiding Jin Mi's scent in the town.

116
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,540
Why is that so?

117
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,799
Jin Mi is an acquaintance of mine.

118
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,640
She was locked up,
I would definitely help her.

119
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,700
It is said that,
you live in seclusion.

120
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,080
Oblivious of your surroundings.

121
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:08,539
I didn't know that you'd be such a
warm-hearted and considerate man.

122
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,560
You have become her guardian,

123
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,920
yet I was wronged.

124
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,440
Chief Peony of Floral Realm
thought I kidnapped Jin Mi,

125
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,740
caused havoc in Qiwu Palace.

126
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,240
Do you know about it?

127
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,480
I'd never expected it to cause
such a great disturbance.

128
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,700
It's my bad to cause Chief Peony
wronged you.

129
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,480
If you really mean
to take care of Jin Mi,

130
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,980
that was a great help for me.

131
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,460
Who knows...

132
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,200
you'd even sent her to a brothel.

133
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,160
I wasn't aware that Jin Mi had gone
to the theater.

134
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,700
I was careless.

135
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,140
Chief Peony is looking for me again.

136
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,340
I mustn't let Phoenix sell me out.

137
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,660
You've been talking for a long time,
you must be thirsty.

138
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,720
I heard that,

139
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,260
the 4 greatest pleasures are eating,
drinking, playing and enjoying.

140
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,480
If you're thirsty,
I've brewed some osmanthus-flavored wine.

141
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,620
Would you like to give it a try?

142
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,460
Eating, drinking, playing
and enjoying?

143
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,980
Who taught you that?

144
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,400
I have come here to apologize
to Your Highness.

145
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,860
- What did you do wrong?
- I was wrong

146
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,300
I shouldn't have
hankered after wine,

147
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,660
let Yan You took
Mister Ling Guang away,

148
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,380
Brother.

149
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,700
It's said that there's a stockaded
village a thousand miles from here.

150
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,440
A gang of bandits lives there.

151
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
Getting here is tough.

152
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,800
Why don't we enforce justice on behalf
of heaven and put an end to it.

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,920
- Good idea.
- No, no, no.

154
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,080
Those bandits
are the 36th generation heirs...

155
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,000
of my great grandson's children
of my mortal brothers.

156
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,100
Your Highness, please forgive me.

157
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,720
I'm so thirsty, give me some water.

158
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,820
I'll be right back.

159
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,620
Find a way!

160
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,980
Here, drink up.

161
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,660
Are you alright?

162
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,160
Hurry, find a way.

163
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,940
Make them drunk,

164
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,180
and help me to escape.

165
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,260
Is little bit of osmanthus-flavored wine enough?

166
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,540
Are you kidding?

167
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,220
I stole the wine recipe
from the Wine Immortal

168
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,200
Even the Emperor wouldn't
be able to get on the boat,

169
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,920
the immortals
would fall on the cloud.

170
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,440
Don't worry, leave it to me.

171
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,360
What a righteous person.

172
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,240
Starting from tomorrow,

173
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,280
Go to Lord Lao's elixir chamber
and be a the servant who makes fire.

174
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,700
Your Highness.

175
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,280
Lord Lao's elixir chamber
is hot as an oven.

176
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,500
I'm afraid of heat.

177
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,640
I'm afraid,
before the elixir pill is cooked,

178
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,440
I will be cooked by then.

179
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,600
Can I have another punishment?

180
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,360
Another one?

181
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,960
Alright.

182
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,980
The Bian City Mansion
in Demon Realm...

183
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,020
still needs another soul hunter.

184
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,260
Why don't you work there
for a few years?

185
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,440
Lord Fire Immortal,
thank you for your kindness.

186
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:35,300
I'd rather make fire in Lord Lao's
elixir chamber.

187
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,980
Great.
Go there tomorrow.

188
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,880
Yes.

189
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,760
I was wrong, I was wrong.

190
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,820
What did you do wrong?

191
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,160
I shouldn't have taught Jin Mi
to gamble.

192
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,220
I have limited knowledge.

193
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,060
I heard something about
the 4 greatest pleasures in life.

194
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,060
But I don't know what is it.

195
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,020
I was drunk.

196
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,600
The 4 greatest pleasures in life...

197
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,540
are lyre-playing, chess,
calligraphy and painting.

198
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,660
That was a slip of the tongue.

199
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,460
In that case, We've wronged Yan You.

200
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,300
No, no, no.

201
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,420
My biggest mistake was to have brought Jin Mi
to that filthy place.

202
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,960
Supreme Immortals, great men like you
rarely stoop to pettiness.

203
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,820
Please let me off.

204
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,000
Luckily her immortal root
is still secure.

205
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,300
She wasn't polluted by
the filthy environment.

206
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,640
By the way,

207
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,500
you've done a great job in
brewing this wine.

208
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,680
Really?

209
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,440
If you like it,

210
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,980
I can give you the secret recipe
of brewing.

211
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,280
Deal.

212
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,260
The day when night-blooming
cereus blooms,

213
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,940
I will definitely clean my palace,

214
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,560
- wait for you to come and teach me.
- All right, deal.

215
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,760
Brother, it's been a long time,

216
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,780
since we last get together
and drink wine.

217
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:50,680
Here.

218
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,880
You're right.

219
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,380
Before, we always drank together.

220
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,360
Now that we're occupied
with the duties,

221
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,160
we rarely have a chance
to drink together.

222
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,380
Are you running out of wine?

223
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,840
I'll get you some wine.

224
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,480
Brother, you seem to
pay much attention to Jin Mi.

225
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,680
Fire Immortal, what do you mean?

226
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,020
Jin Mi is not someone
that we can hope for.

227
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,800
I'm coming!

228
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,040
Today, let's drink until we're drunk.

229
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,160
Here.

230
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,700
This wine has a strong delayed effect.
Stop drinking.

231
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,600
Don't worry.

232
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,640
Even the mortals know,

233
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,040
a thousand glasses of wine are too
few when drinking with bosom buddies.

234
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,480
Here, drink up.

235
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:51,320
Cheers.

236
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,200
Fish Fairy, Fish Fairy.

237
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,220
- He's drunk.
- He's drunk?

238
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,900
Alright, let's drink.
Continue drinking.

239
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,900
There's no wine anymore.

240
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,680
You're also drunk.

241
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,180
I won't get drunk.

242
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,660
I don't get drunk even after
thousands of cups of wine.

243
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,740
Why are you still sober?

244
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:02,920
Phoenix.

245
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:04,780
Phoenix.

246
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,400
You...

247
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,740
Release me! You're vicious!

248
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,400
Phoenix.

249
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,200
Who are you, little demon?

250
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,700
Phoenix, it's me.

251
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,960
Do you still remember that...

252
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,240
you still owe me thousand years
of magical prowess.

253
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,200
If you have no objection,

254
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,760
that'd be a silent consent.

255
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,000
It is compulsory to return
things that you borrow.

256
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,980
I'll take it by myself then.

257
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,060
Darn Phoenix, he's drank so much wine,

258
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,319
yet he's still guarding
his magical prowess against me.

259
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,780
Forget it. Of all strategies,
retreat is the best.

260
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,700
Jin Mi.

261
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,280
I was going to make you
Flower Biscuits.

262
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:54,440
There's no need, I'm not hungry.

263
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,820
If you're not hungry,

264
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,880
should you give me the magical
prowess that you owe me?

265
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,400
- You're right, how much do I owe you?
- One thousand years.

266
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,480
Alright, come here.

267
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,720
Wait.

268
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,800
Phoenix, our prowess
contradicts each other.

269
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:22,420
Will giving me so much magical prowess
in such a short time harm me instead?

270
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,300
This Magic Water Pill will ease
the fire in my magical prowess.

271
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,120
That'd be great.

272
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,000
That's very kind of you.

273
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,160
The purity of Phoenix's
magical prowess...

274
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,060
is outstanding.

275
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,520
Phoenix.

276
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:17,960
Phoenix.

277
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,060
Could it be that
he wants to cultivate with me?

278
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,640
What an amazing day!

279
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,440
There are so many magical prowess
waiting for me.

280
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,900
In Fox Fairy's art book,

281
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,820
there are a lot of methods
of cultivation.

282
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,380
When in need, we'd regret for
not acquiring enough knowledge.

283
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,360
I should have studied them properly.

284
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,780
What did the man in theater do?

285
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,040
Ying Ge, let me take good care of you.

286
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,500
Phoenix.

287
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,080
Let me take good care of you.

288
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,480
It won't help...

289
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,800
even if you shout!

290
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:18,820
Phoenix.

291
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,140
Just do as I say.

292
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,220
The wind has blown us apart.

293
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,920
Separated from the heaven and earth.

294
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,940
They can't do anything to us.

295
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,100
As the moonlight
has linked our feelings.

296
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,780
This is a mistake.
These are all mistakes.

297
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,540
What's the mistake?

298
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,040
I know your feeling for me.

299
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,700
I feel the same.

300
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,940
But destiny fools people,
this is against the virtues.

301
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,940
If we insist to be together,

302
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,980
we will be punished by heaven and
perish like a smoke.

303
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,160
Just perish like a smoke then.

304
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,720
I'm so sleepy.

305
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:39,320
In spite of the beautiful
natural view...

306
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,520
Why are you still being hung here?

307
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,280
Fire Immortal, are you confused?

308
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,160
None of you untied me.

309
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,980
Your Highness, when are you going
to release me?

310
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,260
Just stay here.

311
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,560
You have a beautiful girl
in your room,

312
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,820
yet you've come here
to waste your time,

313
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,280
and let out long sigh.

314
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,220
You've wasted a great gift
and a wonderful night.

315
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,220
You think everyone's a thief
when you're a thief.

316
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,220
Let me ask you.

317
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,220
Why do you still stick around Jin Mi?

318
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,500
Are you envious? Jealous? Or curious?

319
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,860
Do you wish to know the relationship
that we had?

320
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,340
If you wish to know, put me down.
I will tell you.

321
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,540
You care so much about Jin Mi.

322
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,920
Don't you want to know...

323
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,860
why she's so persistent when it comes
to magical prowess?

324
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,960
Luckily my face is fine.

325
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,960
Otherwise all the girls in six realms
will live in regret.

326
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,240
If you lie to me,

327
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,740
you will not have any girl
for your entire life.

328
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,700
That's a long story.

329
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,860
Rou Rou.

330
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,400
Jin Mi, run.

331
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,180
I will fight it out with you!

332
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:44,880
Rou Rou!

333
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,540
Look, a great immortal is here.

334
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,800
He will save you.

335
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,820
Great immortal.

336
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,080
Are you here to save my friend?

337
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,560
Don't worry. The great immortal
is going to save you, Rou Rou.

338
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,020
Your friend was hurt by
Qiong Qi's plague needles.

339
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
He also crushed her heart vessels.

340
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,520
I have limited magical prowess,
I'm afraid...

341
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,720
That's impossible.

342
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,440
Why would your magical
prowess be limited?

343
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,520
You are here to save her.

344
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,100
You will save her, right?
You must save her.

345
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,700
I can give you all my magical prowess.

346
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,860
I don't need my magical prowess.

347
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,600
I don't even need my life.

348
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,620
As long as you can save her.
I beg you, can you save her please?

349
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,060
You must never do that.

350
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,000
With your prowess,
you can hardly keep your own life,

351
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,800
not to mention saving
other people's life.

352
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,740
I don't care about my own life!
I just want to save her!

353
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,340
Great immortal, please save her!

354
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,060
Please save her!

355
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,780
You will save her, right?

356
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,300
I'm here, Rou Rou.

357
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,460
I'm very happy to have you by my side
by the past thousands years.

358
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,700
If...

359
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,140
If there's another life,

360
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,960
let's be friends again.

361
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,000
No way, Rou Rou.

362
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,000
You will be fine.

363
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,360
Rou Rou.

364
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,240
Rou Rou.

365
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,820
Are you okay?

366
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,980
The matter of life and death
is predestined.

367
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,900
If she's destined to be
an immortal,

368
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,760
your friend will cultivate and
gain a form to see you again.

369
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
That time,

370
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,600
you mustn't let her down.

371
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,860
She's always eager for
magical prowess,

372
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,600
because she wants to return my favour
as soon as she can,

373
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,340
and also wish to rescue
Succulent fairy..

374
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,780
She's stubborn.

375
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,340
She insists to pay me back
no matter what I say.

376
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,980
But,

377
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,080
that's what made her cute.

378
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,960
Otherwise I wouldn't be her friend.

379
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,880
She was attacked by plague needles,
her spirit has perished.

380
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,500
How can she revive?

381
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,720
I just made it up.

382
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,100
I just wanted to give her
the willpower...

383
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,360
to live.

384
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,280
I didn't know she had gone through
such a sad tragedy.

385
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,940
Why didn't she tell me?

386
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,820
Sometimes she seems heartless,

387
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,660
but sometimes, she's very considerate.

388
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,420
Based on my understanding,

389
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,380
she's considered you as her kin,

390
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,760
she doesn't want you to be sad.

391
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,320
All right, I won't interrupt
your night.

392
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:25,980
Good bye.

393
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,460
Fairy Jin Mi is so impassioned.

394
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,140
You're up.

395
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,360
The night breeze has made me sober.

396
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,700
I've heard your conversation.

397
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,200
Do you think...

398
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,560
what he said is true?

399
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,640
Just trust him for the moment.

400
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,780
Yan You...

401
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,240
isn't an ordinary man.

402
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,800
You're right.

403
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,240
Although 900 years ago...

404
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,620
eighty percents of Qiong Qi's power
had been sealed by Lord Doumu,

405
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,940
but he was still unbeatable with
the remaining power.

406
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,060
Yet Yan You managed to
chase him away on his own.

407
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,880
I tried to test him earlier.

408
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,020
His magical prowess is
pure and profound.

409
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,420
It's even greater than
the other 11 Zodiac Immortals.

410
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,480
I wonder where did he learn that.

411
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,940
That's odd.

412
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,780
When I was fighting with him earlier,

413
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:22,800
he surrendered himself
after a few moves.
When I was fighting with him earlier,

414
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,780
he surrendered himself
after a few moves.

415
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,360
I thought he has low cultivation.

416
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,560
Could it be that he had withheld
most of his magical prowess?

417
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,780
Could it be that...

418
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,700
he purposely withheld
his true capability?

419
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,180
He didn't hide it from
the God of Wars,

420
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,400
but he hid it from a Night Immortal.

421
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,380
That's rather strange.

422
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,020
He came to Qiwu Palace a while
back to look for Jin Mi.

423
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,960
He seemed to be familiar
with the surroundings.

424
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,340
He practices Water Spell

425
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,040
but he wasn't afraid of my
unrefined fire magical prowess.

426
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,260
Could it be him?

427
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,960
I'll go get him.

428
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,640
Don't alert the enemy.

429
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,200
Now that we know he's an immortal,
it's easier.

430
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,260
We'll wait and observe first.
See who is the mastermind.

431
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,020
We must never let
a dangerous man like him...

432
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,140
to get close to Fairy Jin Mi.

433
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,780
This is the last thing that
I can do for you.

434
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:43,860
From now on,

435
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,420
you must protect yourself.

436
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,740
Phoenix.

437
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Fish Fairy.

438
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,700
Have you slept well?

439
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,240
Very well.

440
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,320
Did the Osmanthus wine
make you suffer?

441
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,120
The wine that you brewed is rich
but not strong.

442
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,140
It's a great wine.

443
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,580
Too bad I have low alcohol tolerance.

444
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,720
That's embarrassing.

445
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,300
Fairy Jin Mi, you've come at
the right time.

446
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,940
I was organising
the last match that we didn't finish.

447
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,719
The weather in this morning is good,

448
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,400
why don't we finish it?

449
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,020
That'd be great.

450
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,280
By the way, Fish Fairy.
Where is Phoenix?

451
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,600
Our mother's birthday is coming soon.

452
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,380
When I finished my duty
at 3 to 5 in the morning,

453
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,000
I saw Xu Feng left in a hurry.

454
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,460
I think he must have returned
to Heaven Realm to greet mother.

455
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,880
Fairy Jin Mi, your hairpin...

456
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,739
looks very unique.

457
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,540
I found it out of nowhere.

458
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,060
If you like it,

459
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,560
we are friends anyway,
I can give it to you.

460
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,760
But I think...

461
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,480
this phoenix feather looks striking.

462
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,300
It's not as elegant as
the grape vine that you used to wear.

463
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,480
You're really my confidant.

464
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,440
I think the grape vine is pretty too.

465
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,140
It's classic yet simple.

466
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,240
It doesn't catch attention,
yet it's splendorous.

467
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,560
If you like it,

468
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,940
I can give you one.

469
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,340
My pleasure.

470
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:51,980
Thank you for letting me win.

471
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,000
How about this?
Let me treat you to breakfast.

472
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,500
I won some yellow and
white stuffs yesterday.

473
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,020
I heard that it's very useful
in the mortal world.

474
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,320
We can use it to buy things
that we eat, wear or use.

475
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,140
We can pay to be an official,

476
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,460
we can also use it to get
a wife and kid.

477
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,560
Oh, I forgot.

478
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,680
You're already engaged.

479
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,260
Otherwise I'd get you some wives.

480
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,200
What a waste.

481
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,660
Thank you for your kind offer.

482
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,700
Breakfast sounds like a good idea.

483
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,400
just forget about
getting wives for me.

484
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,220
In the name of Grand Supreme
Lord Lao, I command you!

485
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,440
Change!

486
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,280
It works.

487
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,160
Turn into a bun. Turn into a bun.

488
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,000
Change!

489
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,200
Turn into a bun. Turn into a bun.

490
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,760
Turn into a bun!

491
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,300
It seems that the bun
has turned into a hail.

492
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,280
He's definitely startled by my spell.

493
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,640
Earth Immortal, how may I help you?

494
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,380
Greetings to Night Immortal.

495
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,380
I'm going to report myself
at the mansion of Lord Lao.

496
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,340
I've come here to bid farewell to
Your Highness and Mister Ling Guang.

497
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,940
Unfortunately, Lord Fire Immortal and
Mister Ling Guang are not here.

498
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,440
And this fairy is?
