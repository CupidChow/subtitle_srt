1
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,120
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,160
"Episode 8"

3
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,120
Xuan Shou!

4
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,660
My son...

5
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,530
what has happened to you?

6
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,290
The Fire Immortal.

7
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,079
My sons had followed you
to fight with Qiong Qi.

8
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,950
When Chi Shou was back,

9
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,870
he became mentally unstable.

10
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,160
Xuan Shou has come back now,

11
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,860
he is also in a coma.

12
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,200
Yet, you remained unhurt.

13
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,500
I believe in Supreme Immortals,

14
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,750
that's why I entrusted
my sons with you.

15
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:17,500
I can't believe you used
the chance to harm them.

16
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,030
Calm down, King of Yan City.

17
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,910
Xuan Shou is fine now.

18
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:23,829
I've transferred 500 years
of magical prowess to him yesterday...

19
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,600
and fed him a Golden Reinvigorating
Elixir from Supreme Lord Lao.

20
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,920
It'll put him to sleep...

21
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,080
for 3 days and 3 nights.

22
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,330
He'll wake up once he
regains his energy.

23
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,910
Fire Immortal,

24
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,090
you are indeed Heavenly Emperor's son.

25
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,750
You've inherited your silver tongue...

26
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,040
from your father,

27
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,720
passing the buck...

28
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,190
and regarding yourself
as a savior now.

29
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,720
What I said is true,

30
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,340
I never meant to pass the buck.

31
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,950
It is you who need to behave.

32
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,770
Heavenly Emperor is of noble status.

33
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,340
You can't blaspheme against him.

34
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,950
- You...
- Please don't be angry,

35
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,600
Demon Lord and the Fire Immortal.

36
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,790
With all due respect,

37
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,980
Demon Lord, it is unfair of you...

38
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,770
to keep pointing finger
at The Fire Immortal.

39
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,310
After all, he isn't the
one who hurt your sons,

40
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,610
but Qiong Qi is.

41
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,450
I think...

42
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,220
if you want to hold
someone accountable,

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,360
you should blame...

44
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,820
the one who let Qiong Qi off.

45
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:18,910
Qiong Qi was released by someone.

46
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,450
It is true?

47
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,440
Did you find any proof?

48
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,750
I did.

49
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,160
I noticed on the day
that Qiong Qi escaped,

50
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,710
the guards' duty roster of
Soul Suppress Palace...

51
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,300
was changed by someone.

52
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,760
During guard mounting,

53
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,090
Soul Suppress Palace
was left unattended...

54
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,370
for half an hour.

55
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,580
Later, on the ground
of Soul Suppress Palace,

56
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,910
I discovered...

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,310
a trail which was left by dragging
the Melding Soul Cauldron.

58
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:45,110
The Melding Soul Cauldron
is a treasure of Heaven.

59
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,200
Only supreme immortals
from the Heaven Realm...

60
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,910
like the Fire Immortal is able to...

61
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,250
shrink it as wish...

62
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,420
for carrying.

63
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,330
As Demon, we have no such power.

64
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,990
Moving the heavy cauldron
will surely leave...

65
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,730
a noticeable trail...

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,700
on the ground.

67
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,530
If Qiong Qi escaped by himself,

68
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,720
The Melding Soul Cauldron should have
been tipped over...

69
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,760
and hit the ground,
leaving only a mark...

70
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,610
and not a trail of dragging it.

71
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,200
So I'm sure...

72
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,150
that this disaster was caused...

73
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,090
by a distinguished person...

74
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,250
from the Demon Realm...

75
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,750
in order to provoke a dispute
among the six realms..

76
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,750
Did you...

77
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,240
release Qiong Qi?

78
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,180
Didn't your palms attack...

79
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,540
show that you'd affirmed...

80
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,370
it was done by me?

81
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,120
Why bother asking?

82
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,560
The Cauldron is protected
by the Demon Realm.

83
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,470
Everyone in the six realms. knows it.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,010
Tell me...

85
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,290
why did you abuse your power?

86
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,370
Doing such unrighteous
thing behind my back.

87
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,950
And making everyone think I'm evil.

88
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,750
You and I are not unrighteous,

89
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,020
but the Heavenly Emperor is.

90
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,290
Since the beginning of the world,

91
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,920
the six realms. have been autonomous...

92
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,200
and working on the principle
of check and balance.

93
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,290
But after the war between the
Heaven and demon,

94
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,500
the Heaven Realm has risen to power...

95
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,470
and kept bullying us.

96
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,320
How could you...

97
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,250
put up with it?

98
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,370
The Heaven Realm is having
great standing now,

99
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,620
showing the tendency of
ruling the six realms..

100
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,100
Whereas we lead...

101
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,240
a carefree life...

102
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,730
without any restriction.

103
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,110
Why do we have to...

104
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,460
take orders from
the supreme immortals...

105
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,790
of the Heaven Realm?

106
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,840
Even the small Floral Realm...

107
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,210
dares to challenge them.

108
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,550
We are not...

109
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,730
inferior to the Heaven Realm.

110
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,950
But why do we...

111
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,620
have to restrain ourselves...

112
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,700
and be blamed for everything?

113
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,120
I really can't...

114
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:20,250
swallow my anger.

115
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,770
So I purposely released Qiong Qi.

116
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,650
Firstly, I want to...

117
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,120
take revenge for what has happened
at River of Unmindfulness.

118
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,790
Secondly, I want to find out the
real situation of the Heaven Realm.

119
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,680
It is a paper tiger now,

120
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,080
not as strong as before.

121
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,990
Except for the Fire Immortal, Xu Feng,

122
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,370
no one else can...

123
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,650
take charge.

124
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,920
Although Xu Feng is very powerful,

125
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,700
it is hard to achieve anything
without support.

126
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,000
As long as we get rid of him,

127
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,330
the Heaven Realm is
nothing to be feared.

128
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,620
I swear by my life that
I'll follow Demon Lord...

129
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:10,640
and help you to wipe
up the Heaven Realm...

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,200
to unite the six realms..

131
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,200
This needs further deliberation.

132
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,060
I'll have to plan it well.

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,020
Right.

134
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,870
"Palace of Gu City "

135
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,280
My lord,

136
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,290
how's it?

137
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,120
Everything is done as you instructed.

138
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,910
The demon doctor taking care of
the two princes is our people.

139
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,330
Chishou will be crazy forever.

140
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,520
As for Xuan Shou,

141
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,230
I'm afraid that he won't recover.

142
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Good.

143
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,030
You used a borrowed knife to kill,

144
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,610
stirring up conflict...

145
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,280
between the Heaven and Demon Realms,

146
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,780
and also eliminating the 2 silly sons
of Demon Lord.

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,370
You killed 2 birds with a stone.

148
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,020
Brilliant.

149
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
My lord,

150
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,000
did you hurt by Demon
Lord's palms attack?

151
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,650
I'll go and find the doctor now
to check for you.

152
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,950
There is no need.

153
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,490
He won't sit on his throne...

154
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,500
as Demon Lord for long anyway.

155
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,490
Let him be arrogant for few more days.

156
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,660
Wait until...

157
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,660
I become the ruler of the six realms..

158
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,540
All the insults that I've received...

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,580
I'll definitely pay them back double.

160
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,580
The medicine is ready.

161
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,700
Come, drink it.

162
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,620
It is so bitter.

163
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,040
I know that it tastes bitter.

164
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,560
But the doctor has said,
good medicine always tastes bitter.

165
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,290
You'll get well after drinking it.

166
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,990
I've been cooking it all morning.

167
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,820
I don't want to drink.

168
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,700
Alright.

169
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,890
I'll have to grow a
Lingzhi for you then.

170
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,520
Don't move.

171
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,050
You're so well-behaved,

172
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,070
let me reward you with
a little red flower.

173
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,920
Come.

174
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,410
Come.

175
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,400
You've made such a mess of yourself...

176
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,160
cooking the medicine.

177
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,020
Don't ever go out...

178
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,600
with unkempt appearance...

179
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,160
and embarrass me.

180
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,600
I really think...

181
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,910
you've owed me...

182
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,990
a lot of food in previous life.

183
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,560
The first time we met,

184
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,120
you already fed me
with many weird things...

185
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,830
like honey,

186
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,160
Six Auspicious Treasures soup,
Lingzhi soup,

187
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,540
and that medicine just now...

188
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,500
which is bitter than
Chinese gold thread.

189
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,890
It tastes terribly bitter.

190
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
What?

191
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Raisin.

192
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,370
You made great contribution
in subduing Qiong Qi.

193
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,890
I'll ask my father to
give you credit for it.

194
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,650
Do you want to give me
something as reward?

195
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,620
Tell me.

196
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,040
How much magical prowess you want?

197
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,190
Eight hundred years?

198
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,010
Is 1000 years enough?

199
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,370
I'll transfer it to
you when we go back.

200
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,750
One thousand years.

201
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,850
Phoenix looks a bit stern...

202
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,290
but he is very nice.

203
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,510
What's wrong?

204
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,960
Are you too excited to say anything?

205
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,830
Do you know what you were doing?

206
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:09,830
I know.

207
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,110
Fox Fairy  said it‘s a "hug gratitude".
Hug gratitude.

208
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,760
How can I thank you without a hug?

209
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,080
What have I done wrong?

210
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,700
Uncle is always very light-minded.

211
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,580
It is true.

212
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,290
Princess.

213
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,760
You look good.

214
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,580
I guess you're better now.

215
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,160
Thank you, Princess.

216
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,370
I am fine.

217
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,830
I heard that you'll go back
to the Heaven Realm tomorrow.

218
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,450
Since Qiong Qi was captured,

219
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,880
I should go back and report it
to my father as soon as possible.

220
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,390
As for the kings of
Yancheng and Gucheng,

221
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,990
I'll have to trouble you
and King of Bian City...

222
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,170
to pay attention to them.

223
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,450
Don't worry.

224
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,110
If anyone wants to break
the truce pact...

225
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
and start a new war.

226
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,500
My father and I won't stand aside.

227
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,660
Thank you.

228
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,150
I will go to your place
to pay my gratitude tomorrow morning.

229
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,740
Who told you to do so?

230
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,190
If you really want to thank us,

231
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,990
you should go back to
get some good rest.

232
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,170
After you recover,
we shall feast together...

233
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,280
and fight for 3000 rounds.

234
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,470
I dare not disobey your order.

235
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
We'll find a day to do it.

236
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,510
Rou Rou,

237
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,360
Don't worry.

238
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,540
I've avenged for you.

239
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,660
I've locked up Qiong Qi.

240
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,600
Aren't I amazing?

241
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,120
Don't worry.

242
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,180
When I have enough magical prowess,

243
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,910
I'll go to Supreme Clarity Heaven
to find those Great Immortals...

244
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,200
and beg them to bring you back to life

245
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,720
Wait for me.

246
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,340
Jin Mi.

247
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,970
Jin Mi.

248
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,580
Rou Rou.

249
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,660
Is that you, Rou Rou?

250
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,990
Jin Mi.

251
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Jin Mi.

252
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,200
I'm here.

253
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,170
Rou Rou.

254
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,460
Rou Rou.

255
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,950
Where are you, Rou Rou?

256
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,410
I'm here.

257
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,080
Jin Mi.

258
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,290
Jin Mi.

259
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,790
I'm here.

260
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,910
The Melding Soul Cauldron?

261
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,620
Rou Rou.

262
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,290
You...

263
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,200
Are you in the cauldron?

264
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,450
Jin Mi, I'm in the cauldron.

265
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,520
Let me out quickly.

266
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,360
Jin Mi.

267
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,830
Save me.

268
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,660
I'm in pain.

269
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,450
Jin Mi, save me

270
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,660
I'm in pain.

271
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,900
Jin Mi.

272
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,120
Save me.

273
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,140
Save me

274
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,700
Jin Mi.

275
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,870
Hurry up and save me.

276
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,330
Rou Rou.

277
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Jin Mi.

278
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,160
Can you help me to
remove the fire seal?

279
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,580
The heat puts me in pain.

280
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,420
I can't see anything.

281
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,770
It is burning me.

282
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,910
Let me help you.

283
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,860
Jin Mi.

284
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,070
Help me.

285
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,380
Let me help you.

286
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,660
Jin Mi.

287
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,000
Are you okay?

288
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,500
I'm sorry, Phoenix.

289
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,500
I didn't mean it.

290
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,580
I heard Rou Rou was
calling me just now.

291
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,000
I...

292
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,080
Rou Rou?

293
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,990
- Who is Rou Rou?
- The girl who was here just now.

294
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,750
She is my best friend.

295
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,410
I really heard her
calling me from the cauldron.

296
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,000
I also don't know...

297
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,950
how did I open it.

298
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,120
I have no idea what happened next.

299
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,450
Why Rou Rou was in there?

300
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,710
There is no one else in the cauldron.

301
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,340
It is Qiong Qi's mind-tricking spell.

302
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,500
It can bewitch you...

303
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,680
and transform into something
you desire the most.

304
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,360
Your haven't reached high attainments.

305
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,160
It is normal that you were fooled.

306
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,390
Luckily I put a fire seal on him.

307
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,280
Half of his power is sealed.

308
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,000
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able
to hold on until I came in.

309
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,840
So it is an illusion,

310
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,740
not Rou Rou.

311
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,990
I am so useless.

312
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,330
What's wrong, Phoenix?

313
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,870
What happened to your hand?

314
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,400
Probably hurt by Qiong
Qi's plague needles.

315
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,620
Plague needles?

316
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,940
Phoenix.

317
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,120
Phoenix.

318
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,680
Phoenix.

319
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,370
Plague needles.

320
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,080
Back then Rou Rou was also
hurt by it.

321
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,790
How can I save you?

322
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,210
Will growing a Lingzhi help?

323
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,840
What should I do, Phoenix?

324
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,660
It's alright.

325
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,870
Don't worry.

326
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,360
My cultivation can stop the
plague needles from hurting me...

327
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,050
for a while.

328
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,360
As long as you can find night...

329
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,600
Night, what?

330
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,750
What is it, Phoenix?

331
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
Phoenix.

332
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,150
Phoenix.

333
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,400
Phoenix. Phoenix, what night?

334
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,700
Phoenix, what night?

335
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,200
You really fall for her.

336
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,580
I think you must have
read too many novels.

337
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
I'm right.

338
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,580
You have feelings for her.

339
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,500
If not, why do you always
keep her by your side..

340
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,120
And order her to do this and that.

341
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,840
I think Jin Mi is not bad.

342
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,530
She is pretty and quite interesting.

343
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,540
Why don't you...

344
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,610
Even if you don't want to admit it,

345
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,220
you will realize one day...

346
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,920
that you can't live without her.

347
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,080
And you are willing to
do anything for her.

348
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,250
Even sacrifice your life.

349
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,680
This is what the mortals say,

350
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,500
"you miss a step...

351
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,450
and fall deeply in love".

352
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,250
Uncle was right.

353
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,170
What? Phoenix.

354
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,450
Phoenix!

355
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,790
How's he?

356
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,280
This is the initial symptoms
of plague needle poisoning

357
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,410
I am unable to cure him.

358
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,840
- Alright, you may leave.
- Okay.

359
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,250
Night Immortal.

360
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,210
King of Bian City.

361
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,400
- Night Immortal.
- Princess of Bian City.

362
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,580
How's Xu Feng?

363
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,160
I've asked Immortal Qi Huang here
to give him treatment.

364
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,740
It doesn't matter if
it is inner injury.

365
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,000
But the Fire Immortal was hurt...

366
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,600
by Qiong Qi's plague needles.

367
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,140
- Plague needles?
- Plague needles?

368
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,070
It's the deadliest poison
in the world.

369
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,540
Immortal, how is he?

370
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,650
The poison is under his skin.

371
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,870
A day later, it'll
enter his blood veins.

372
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,160
The next day his bone marrow.

373
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,530
And his lungs the day after.

374
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,300
If we don't have the
antidote after 3 days.

375
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,390
The second prince will lose
all his magical prowess.

376
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,590
Your Highness,
this is very serious

377
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,910
Please inform Heavenly Emperor
as soon as possible.

378
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,040
I will tell him myself.

379
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,830
The priority now is to save Xu Feng.

380
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,000
Immortal, do you have any remedy?

381
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,910
Qiong Qi has been locked
up for very long.

382
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,960
There isn't much records
about the antidote in medical books.

383
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
Oh right,

384
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,010
Phoenix told me this
before he fainted.

385
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,950
He said night...

386
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,120
Night... I don't really get it.

387
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,580
Night...

388
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,590
Night...

389
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,580
Is it the Night Rattan?

390
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Yes.

391
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,910
I read it in an ancient book before.

392
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,030
It says that the Night Rattan is
an antidote to plague needle.

393
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,080
Great.

394
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,370
But where to find this Night Rattan?

395
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,300
The Night Rattan you said
does it grow in the Pure Fountain...

396
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,360
and 1 Night Rattan takes
10000 years to grow?

397
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,980
That's right. It is a sacred
plant of the Floral Realm.

398
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,040
But the flora and Heaven Realm
have long-standing feud.

399
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,460
If we want to persuade them...

400
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,340
to give the Night Rattan
to the second prince.

401
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,810
It won't be easy.

402
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,090
You know how to grow a Lingzhi.

403
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,250
Do you also know how to
grow the Night Rattan?

404
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,900
The Night Rattan has been hidden...

405
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,620
at Chuying Court in Floral Palace.

406
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,940
I've never seen it before.

407
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,250
No matter what,

408
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,040
we have to try our best.

409
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,780
I will go to the Floral Realm now.

410
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,890
No.
Fish Fairy, you don't know about this.

411
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,870
The chiefs of Floral Realm
are all very stubborn.

412
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,540
If you go there in a haste，
they won't give it to you.

413
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,620
What about you?
You are from the Floral Realm.

414
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,110
They'll listen to you, right?

415
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
I...

416
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,040
I'll get scolded if I go back.

417
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,570
I don't care.

418
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,200
Alright.

419
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,190
I'll go.

420
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,140
I'll get it no matter how.

421
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,660
I trust Fairy Jin Mi.

422
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,190
Let me go with you.
So that you have a backup.

423
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Alright.

424
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,740
Immortal Qi Huang,

425
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,430
bring Kuang Lu back
to the Heaven Realm.

426
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,080
Xu Feng's life is tied to the peace
of the six realms..

427
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,500
To avoid causing an upheaval,

428
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,260
please don't tell anyone about it

429
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,450
I'll bear all consequences.

430
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
Alright.

431
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,090
I will obey your order...

432
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,700
and keep my lips sealed.

433
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:02,980
King of Bian City,

434
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,350
in order to maintain
long-term peace of the two realms,

435
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,230
I hope you will conceal it.

436
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

437
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,660
I know what is right to do.

438
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,300
Thank you, King of Bian City.

439
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,230
There's no time to lose.
You go first.

440
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,120
I'll bring Xu Feng along and wait
for you outside the Floral Realm.

441
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,440
Phoenix, you can rest assured...

442
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,120
that I'll definitely save you.

443
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,440
Wait for me.

444
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,170
Little One.

445
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,240
Mr. Hu.

446
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,000
You still know to come back.

447
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,830
I miss you so much.

448
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,350
You also bring a pretty lady with you.

449
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,630
She is the Princess of Bian City
from the Demon Realm.

450
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Demon Realm?

451
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,340
Come.

452
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,070
- Come.
- What's it?

453
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,870
I've heard that those demons...

454
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,700
have long mouths and sharp fangs.

455
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,760
They eat the mortals...

456
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,690
and the fairy-to-be like you.

457
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,050
They are even scarier than rabbits.

458
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,330
Are you sure
you are not eaten by them?

459
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,250
No.

460
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,990
You still have your nose, eyes,
arms and legs with you?

461
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,810
Yes, they are here.

462
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,290
Don't talk nonsense.

463
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Old man,

464
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,990
Where did you hear these gossips?

465
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,870
Have you been to the Demon Realm?

466
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,070
Don't be angry.

467
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,370
We are here for something important.
Please ignore him.

468
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,320
I want to ask you.

469
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,450
Is Chief Peony in Floral Palace now?

470
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,260
You still want to see her?

471
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,030
She is still angry with you
for running away from the Water Mirror.

472
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,850
She is still angry?

473
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,870
Looks like she won't give
me the Night Rattan.

474
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,990
The Night Rattan?

475
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,450
You still dare to ask her for it?

476
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,670
I think you've lost your mind...

477
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,200
after going to the Demon Realm.

478
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,570
Why would Chief Peony
give you the Night Rattan?

479
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:50,040
Right.
There is no way she'll give it to me.

480
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,990
The Night Rattan.

481
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,250
It is a sacred plant
of the Floral Realm

482
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,660
For 1000 years,

483
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,950
I've only seen it once.

484
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,290
What do you want it for?

485
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,790
Oh right,

486
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,730
my transformation skills
have improved a lot.

487
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,760
I can transform into a table,
chair or water tank.

488
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,260
Maybe I can slip in there
and steal one.

489
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,830
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

490
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,880
Little One,
don't do stupid thing.

491
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,330
"Chuying Court"

492
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,080
It is here.

493
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,330
Let me look for it.

494
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,310
There are so many.

495
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,470
How to find it?

496
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,790
Jin Mi.

497
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,990
Chief... Floral Fairy.

498
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,230
Jin Mi.

499
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,290
You left the Water Mirror
without permission.

500
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,880
And now trespass to Chuying Court.

501
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,450
Do you admit your wrongdoings?

502
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,330
Chief Peony.

503
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,350
I'm Liu Ying, the Princess of Bian City.

504
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,000
Nice to meet you, Chief Peony.

505
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,690
I wonder what brings
the Princess of Bian City here?

506
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,480
I came here...

507
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,870
to borrow your sacred plant,

508
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
the Night Rattan.

509
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,770
The Night Rattan?

510
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,770
The Fire Immortal
was hurt by plague needles...

511
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,230
when he was fighting with Qiong Qi.

512
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,070
Without the Night Rattan
acting as an antidote,

513
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,170
he'll lose all his magical
prowess in 3 days.

514
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,370
I beg you to give me
the Night Rattan...

515
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,890
to save the Fire Immortal's life.

516
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,020
I'll surely repay your
kindness in future.

517
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,570
The Fire Immortal is the supreme immortal
from the Heaven Realm.

518
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,330
Plague needles can only engulf
his magical prowess.

519
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,500
It won't take his life.

520
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,170
How to save his life then?

521
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,390
With the help of Heavenly
Emperor and Empress,

522
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,900
he'll only need to practise for few
thousand years to regain his prowess.

523
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,910
Furthermore, we has vowed..

524
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,290
That in million years,

525
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,120
we won't grow a plant
in the Heaven Realm...

526
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,940
or borrow a single herb to them..

527
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,700
So the Princess of Bian City,

528
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,000
you should leave now.

529
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,830
- You...
- Chief Peony,

530
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,370
Phoenix was hurt by plague needles
because of me.

531
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,650
Shut up.

532
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,160
We will talk about
your business later.

533
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,980
But Phoenix's business is my business.

534
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Chief Peony,

535
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,830
since I left the Floral Realm,

536
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,340
Phoenix has been taking care of me,
It is true.

537
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,400
Not only has he taught
me mental cultivation,

538
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,730
he has also saved me for three times.

539
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,760
The first time, at
Southern Heavenly Gate,

540
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,850
I would have devoured by Qiong Qi
if it weren't for him.

541
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,510
The second time, at Chiren Mountain,

542
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,880
he took a palm attack for me.

543
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,170
Now is the third time.

544
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,580
Qiong Qi's plague needles
were aimed at me...

545
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,010
Enough! You ran away from
The Water Mirror Barrier...

546
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,410
and caused so much trouble.

547
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,000
Maids,

548
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,310
take her to the Water Mirror.

549
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,700
Ask Mr. Hu to watch over her.

550
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,500
Let her reflect on herself in there.

551
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,670
Chief Peony, just punish me,

552
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,070
it has nothing to do with Phoenix.

553
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,400
Please save him.

554
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,510
What are you doing here?

555
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,890
Take her away.

556
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,040
How senseless you are.
Quickly go away.

557
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,410
Chief Peony is so mad now.

558
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,670
Wait until she cools off.

559
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,420
- But...
- Jin Mi.

560
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
Don't worry, Liu Ying.

561
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,330
I'll definitely find the Night Rattan.

562
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,450
Wait for me.

563
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,300
You are such a old fogy.

564
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,620
You're the leader of the Floral Realm,

565
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,160
yet you show no compassion at all.

566
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,870
Since there's no use begging you,

567
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,160
don't blame me for being rude.

568
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,200
I have to get the night
rattan today at all cost.

569
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,160
Chief Peony,
pardon me.

570
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,160
Don't push us too far, Princess.

571
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,160
We don't allow others
to act wildly here.

572
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,100
Let me go.
You're bullying the minority.

573
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,050
Have a one-on-one fight
with me if you dare.

574
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,520
Chief Peony is so hateful.

575
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,520
She set a barrier all of a sudden.

576
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,700
Jin Mi, where are you?

577
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,280
You have to get the Night Rattan.

578
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,460
Jin Min, have you
realized your mistakes?

579
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,980
Chief Peony, I know
that I am at fault.

580
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,890
I shouldn't break the rules
of the Floral Realm...

581
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,250
and run away from the Water Mirror.

582
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,890
But you are also at fault in this.

583
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,610
You shouldn't vent your
anger at others...

584
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,790
because of my mistakes.

585
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,500
Have you not been teaching us...

586
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,810
to be kind?

587
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,000
I know.

588
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,790
The Flora and Heaven Realm
have conflicts.

589
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,240
But as the saying goes,

590
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,800
"Saving a life is better than building
a 7-storey pagoda."

591
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,250
Can you just watch
Phoenix lose his power?

592
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,060
Won't you feel shame?

593
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,060
Seems like you still don't know
what you've done wrong.

594
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,830
I...

595
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,080
It is my fault.

596
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,990
- I...
- Don't say this.

597
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,600
Since you've realized your mistake,

598
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,120
just correct what you've done wrong.

599
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,600
Give me the Night Rattan.

600
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,270
Saving Phoenix is more important.

601
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,660
Looks like I've spoiled you too much.

602
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,700
That's why you've become
so ill-mannered and willful.

603
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,340
From today onward,

604
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,320
you're grounded here
to repent for 1 month.

605
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,580
Chief Peony, please don't...

606
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,660
Chief Peony.

607
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,660
Save Phoenix,
ground me later.

608
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,580
It is fine if you
ground me for 2 months.

609
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,630
Who can save Phoenix?

610
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,840
Little One, meal time.

611
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,290
Jin Mi,

612
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,260
you didn't even touch your lunch.

613
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,760
Little One,

614
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,920
you want to go on a hunger strike?

615
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,260
I thought Chief Peony...

616
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,860
has a sharp tongue and soft heart.

617
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,230
Never have I expected...

618
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,700
that her heart is made of iron.

619
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,370
She just won't give it to me.

620
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,660
At worse...

621
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,370
at worse, I grow it myself.

622
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,170
Mr. Hu,

623
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,990
you're the oldest here.

624
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,970
Have you seen the Night Rattan before?

625
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,920
How does it look like?
Can you tell me?

626
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:16,010
Why do you care so much
about the Fire Immortal?

627
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,120
Do you have an ulterior
motive for him?

628
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,280
Right. I do.

629
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,770
What's wrong?

630
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,970
He has saved me for three times.

631
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,460
Without him,

632
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,340
I would have died long time ago.

633
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,730
You also know...

634
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,980
Rou Rou was killed by Qiong Qi...

635
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,740
because of me.

636
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,160
I don't want another friend of mine
die like this.

637
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,820
And also...

638
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,540
And also what?

639
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,240
Phoenix has promised...

640
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,480
to give me 1000 years
of magical prowess.

641
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,430
If he loses all his magical prowess,

642
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,280
I'll get nothing.

643
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,290
A thousand years.

644
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,940
Forget about it.

645
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,900
Since this lad has saved you three times,

646
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,020
I'll help you this time.

647
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,580
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

648
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,470
It is roughly like this.

649
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,870
The leaves are in green colour.

650
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,540
The flower is blue in colour.

651
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,930
It is on the northern
side of a mountain.

652
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:24,160
It only blooms once a millennium.

653
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,270
Jin Mi,

654
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,450
I've brought the water
of Pure Pond for you.

655
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,120
This..

656
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,540
Mr. Hu,
did you paint it wrongly?

657
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,750
I...

658
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,640
It is unlikely for me
to paint it wrongly.

659
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:10,990
Impossible.

660
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,310
I... I only saw it once.

661
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,300
- Once?
- Right.

662
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,450
Isn't there any record on books?

663
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,140
Right.

664
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,010
Jin Mi only said...

665
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:36,969
she will definitely
get the Night Rattan.

666
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,699
But she didn't say...

667
00:33:40,989 --> 00:33:42,370
how to take it out.

668
00:33:42,949 --> 00:33:44,409
Do you think she can make it?

669
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,230
Jin Mi is from the Floral Realm.

670
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,870
She is so smart.

671
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,780
She must have her way.

672
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,460
I think Jin Mi alone can't fight
Chief Peony's bad temper.

673
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,520
Why is his body temperature
decreasing so quickly?

674
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,870
His magical prowess is vanishing.

675
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,000
Please shield me.

676
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,130
Ice and fire are of different nature.

677
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,190
I can't transfer my
magical prowess to him.

678
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,240
Therefore,

679
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,720
I use part of my magical prowess...

680
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,530
to heat up the aquatic
magical prowess.

681
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,610
And transfer the evaporated energy
to Xu Feng's body.

682
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,750
Going against the nature
will do you massive harm.

683
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,820
If your mind wanders,
it will take you over...

684
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,950
and backfire on you.

685
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,290
It is so urgent.

686
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,950
Xu Feng's life is more critical.

687
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,290
I can't care so much.

688
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,920
The Fire Immortal will be fine.

689
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,440
He will be fine.

690
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,660
Don't worry, Phoenix.

691
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,890
I'll save you.

692
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,120
Wait for me.

693
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,070
I will grow the Night Rattan for you.

694
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,750
It is dawn already.

695
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,500
Today is the last day.

696
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,940
If I can't grow the plant...

697
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,870
No.

698
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,580
If I can't grow it, Phoenix...

699
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,300
Who can help Phoenix?

700
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,620
This is the Night Rattan.

701
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,280
I've made it.

702
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,130
Mr. Hu, Lian Qiao, I've made it!

703
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,920
Mr. Hu, come and take a look.
Is this the Night Rattan?

704
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,850
Right, it is.

705
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,590
Great!
I need to take it out at once.

706
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,790
I want to save Phoenix.

707
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
Hold on.

708
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,120
But Chief Peony has set
a barrier outside.

709
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,500
You're unable to go out.

710
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,870
- What should I do?
- Then...

711
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,410
Fine, I will just help you.

712
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,590
Alright...

713
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,580
You show up in your
true form later.

714
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,400
I'll take you out.

715
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,740
Mr. Hu, I knew it.

716
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,480
You're the one who treats me the best.

717
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,250
I'm back.

718
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,040
Jin Mi, you're finally back.

719
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,360
It's great.
We can save the Fire Immortal now.

720
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,570
Last night, the Night Immortal said...

721
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,190
that you'd definitely
get the Night Rattan.

722
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
I didn't believe him.

723
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,160
Thank you, Fairy Jin Mi.

724
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,290
Let him eat the Night Rattan now.

725
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,420
Phoenix.

726
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,960
It is great.
His magical prowess is coming back.

727
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,100
Really?

728
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,790
Come.

729
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,380
Phoenix.

730
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,080
Phoenix.

731
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,610
Phoenix.

732
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,290
Didn't I tell you?

733
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:22,250
My Page Boy
can't look unkempt.

734
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,080
You are awake.
It is so great, Phoenix!

735
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,700
You are finally awake.

736
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,160
What are you doing?

737
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:46,950
Chief Peony.

738
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,450
Nice to meet you, Chief Peony.

739
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,710
Thank you for saving my life.

740
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,010
You're wrong.

741
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,440
I didn't save you,
you don't have to thank me.

742
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,970
Jin Mi, come over here.

743
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,410
It is my fault, Chief Peony.

744
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,900
I shouldn't leave the Water Mirror
without permission.

745
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,300
It has nothing to do
with Lian Qiao and Mr. Hu.

746
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,190
You can just punish me.

747
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,700
Don't punish them.

748
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,760
Chief Peony, please don't
blame Fairy Jin Mi.

749
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,660
Don't blame her for this.

750
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,540
When I attained nirvana,

751
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,270
There was an accident and I entered
the Floral Realm by accident.

752
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,190
We ran into each other
so we got together.

753
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,120
I took her out of the Water Mirror.

754
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,740
And it led to all the
misunderstandings later.

755
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,510
If you want to blame someone,

756
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,310
please just blame me.

757
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,950
This is our business.

758
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,790
Outsiders are not
allowed to interfere.

759
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,830
Please behave yourself
and mind your speech.

760
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,990
I don't have any say
for other fairies,

761
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,160
only the fairies of the Floral Realm.

762
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,640
Even though you are very powerful,

763
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,630
don't you wish to
meddle in our affairs.

764
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,410
I have a clear conscience...

765
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,600
that I've never misconducted.

766
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,750
Please don't listen to the gossips.

767
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,180
I've really fallen...

768
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:15,540
for Fairy Jin Mi.
