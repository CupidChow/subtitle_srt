1
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,540
"Episode 34"

3
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,880
What to do?

4
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,420
It has been all day long.

5
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,500
Jin Mi,

6
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,100
you know what,

7
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,240
I ordered to tailor

8
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,160
this phoenix robe for you

9
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,540
when you just came.

10
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,040
Every once in a while,

11
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,860
I would have it altered according to
the measurement of your figure with my eyes.

12
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,760
It has been altered for ten times now,

13
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,940
because,

14
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,220
because I was afraid that it wouldn’t fit you.

15
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,100
I didn’t expect that

16
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,000
it fitted you well.

17
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,100
My measurement is accurate, isn’t?

18
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:09,060
I have never helped any girl make up.

19
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,280
If I make you look ugly,

20
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,200
don’t blame me.

21
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,360
Originally,

22
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,300
you’re the most beautiful without makeup

23
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,480
in my mind,

24
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,280
but today

25
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,380
it’s our wedding day.

26
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,360
Bear it,

27
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,740
okay?

28
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,340
After we get married…

29
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,080
Your Majesty,

30
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,300
well…

31
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,520
There is a letter on the desk.

32
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,420
Give it to Minister Fu.

33
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,340
Your Majesty.

34
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,870
"Imperial Mausoleum"

35
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,360
Originally,

36
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,980
the wine was for you.

37
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Now,

38
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,100
we have changed our positions.

39
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,560
You didn’t keep your promise,

40
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,500
but I can’t break mine.

41
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,180
I’ll do

42
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,740
what I promised you

43
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,220
one by one.

44
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,040
<i>Unwilling to get involved in troubles,</i>

45
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,500
<i>but things go contrary to the wish.</i>

46
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,840
<i>The flower in my heart has withered.</i>

47
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,680
<i>Time can’t go back.</i>

48
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,360
<i>The memory haunts me,</i>

49
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,460
<i>making me grieved.</i>

50
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,420
<i>I only wish I would never regret in the rest of my life.</i>

51
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,500
<i>Fly away along with the flower aroma.</i>

52
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,860
<i>A pot of clear wine…</i>

53
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,500
You can’t

54
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,080
drink it.

55
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,000
Let me drink it for you,

56
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,080
okay?

57
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:02,659
Anyway, you have
tortured me for such a long time.

58
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,440
This life is of no exception.

59
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:09,980
This life…

60
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,040
You look like a crow.

61
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,860
I’ll call you Crow afterwards, okay?

62
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,560
Crow, what are you doing here?

63
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,560
Your Majesty, the one who
loves morality just like loving a beauty.

64
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,660
Your Majesty, please be self-possessed.

65
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,960
And I look…

66
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,360
You look ugly and are disliked by all people?

67
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,600
I don’t care.

68
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,920
After I come back,

69
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,780
be my queen, OK?

70
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,780
Thank you

71
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,360
for letting me know

72
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,600
the meaning of being alive

73
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,340
in my humble and insignificant
life for the first time.

74
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,080
I know you must think

75
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:55,600
I give up Huaiwu willfully as its king.

76
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
Don’t worry.

77
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,300
I have arranged everything properly.

78
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,940
Yuan Xi, my cousin’s son,

79
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,500
is smart and brave.

80
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,420
Minister Fu will assist him in succession.

81
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,720
Huaiwu will be strong in the future.

82
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,740
I didn’t expect that

83
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,740
I would be buried with you

84
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,760
at last.

85
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,720
I feel satisfied.

86
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:51,360
<i>I will get drunk again when flowers bloom.</i>

87
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,680
<i>I hope that time of all lives won’t wither again.</i>

88
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:05,360
<i>I look back and taste
the aftertaste of the wine in my heart.</i>

89
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,140
Now,

90
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,400
you finally become my ugly wife,

91
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,520
but

92
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,480
I have never seen such a beautiful wife.

93
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:34,000
<i>I look back and taste
the aftertaste of the wine in my heart.</i>

94
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,540
<i>A pot of clear wine and the dust on me.</i>

95
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:47,140
<i>As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.</i>

96
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:55,180
<i>I know clearly all these
births and deaths in my memory.</i>

97
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:01,680
<i>I look back and taste
the aftertaste of the wine in my heart.</i>

98
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,920
You can lean on my shoulder.

99
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,580
How can

100
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,080
you do that?

101
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,060
Take good care of me afterwards.

102
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,480
Your Highness.

103
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,980
Fairy Jin Mi is indeed outstanding.

104
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,920
What you experienced in the Human Realm

105
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,380
has beyond my ability.

106
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,740
Don’t bother to explain.

107
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,320
I’m sure you can’t make such an amazing plan.

108
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,600
Your Highness,

109
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,740
you’re broad-minded and smart.

110
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,940
It impresses me.

111
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,300
His Majesty has been waiting for you

112
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,620
in the palace for long.

113
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,240
Please.

114
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,780
What’s wrong?

115
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,680
Nothing.

116
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,620
I didn’t expect that

117
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,700
Qiang Huo was Rou Rou.

118
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,710
What on earth

119
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,280
has perished his primordial spirit?

120
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,280
Don’t worry.

121
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,400
I’ll find out the truth.

122
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,960
Xu Feng,

123
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,000
Jin Mi,

124
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,480
you’re finally back.

125
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:11,960
Fox Fairy.

126
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,640
I saw what happened to you in the Human Realm

127
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,580
through the Mortal Observation Mirror.

128
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,960
It was really pathetic with ups and downs.

129
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,780
Xu Feng’s infatuation

130
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,000
was impressive.

131
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,500
Even I was touched.

132
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,820
Xu Feng,

133
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,000
you don’t

134
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,540
let me down.

135
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,060
I feel gratified.

136
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,560
Well,

137
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,560
if I write an opera

138
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,040
based on your story,

139
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,560
it must be popular in the six realms.

140
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,560
Yuan Ji, what do you think?

141
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,880
We’d better go in.

142
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,260
Don’t keep His Majesty waiting.

143
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,300
Well, Xu Feng,

144
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,620
His Majesty is angry as you left privately.

145
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,940
I have to warn you that

146
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,600
you must conduct yourself well

147
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,000
in the palace later.

148
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,380
I see.

149
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,240
Your Majesty, don’t underestimate
what happened at Dongting Lake.

150
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,040
Su Li intended to rebel

151
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,520
and let her son Night Immortal

152
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,100
be the emperor.

153
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,360
Water Immortal sheltered
her for thousands of years.

154
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,840
He must have vicious intentions.

155
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,780
Night Immortal must be involved.

156
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,620
Water Immortal
shouldn’t have sheltered Su Li,

157
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,440
but Su Li was lonely and helpless,

158
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,100
so he just kept her
at the bottom of Dongting Lake.

159
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,380
It’s known to all in the Heavenly Realm that

160
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,860
he lives in the seclusion of his own home over the years,

161
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,220
so he wouldn’t conspire with Su Li.

162
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,420
Moreover,

163
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,800
Night Immortal didn’t know that his mother

164
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,480
was kept at the bottom of Dongting Lake until recently.

165
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,720
Don’t haste to make the final conclusion.

166
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,220
Rat Fairy is the conclusive evidence of their collusion.

167
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,100
Enough.

168
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,220
Now Su Li has been dead,

169
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,780
I don’t want to dredge it up.

170
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,760
Water Immortal is the cornerstone of the Heavenly Realm.

171
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,820
Night Immortal is my son.

172
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,140
I trust him.

173
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,720
Don’t guess wildly,

174
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,200
or others will laugh at us.

175
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,100
Well,

176
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,510
Water Immortal has high prestige

177
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,840
in the Heavenly Realm.

178
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,180
Don’t ruin the whole situation

179
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,060
because of some trifles.

180
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,700
Do you think

181
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,700
I’m not worried about their disloyalty?

182
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,880
I want to find out the truth,

183
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,880
so I make this plan.

184
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,080
You didn’t see

185
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,160
Run Yu wanted to kill me

186
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,680
when I killed Su Li.

187
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,120
He actually forgot that I brought him up.

188
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,280
How ungrateful he is.

189
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,800
Look what you have done.

190
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,460
So many troubles are left.

191
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:50,940
Enough.

192
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,820
Don’t mention it.

193
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,540
Fire Immortal comes.

194
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,320
Your Majesty.

195
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,580
Father. Mother.

196
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,800
You’re back.

197
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,220
You suffered in the Human Realm.

198
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,560
As the saying goes,

199
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,660
April showers bring May flowers.

200
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,119
Though you suffered bitterly,

201
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,740
you’ll succeed at last.

202
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:38,220
Yes.

203
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,880
Jin Mi is back.

204
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,550
Where is Water Immortal?

205
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,960
Water Immortal and Wind Immortal come.

206
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,000
Daddy.

207
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,540
-Mi.
-Daddy.

208
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,360
-Auntie Lin Xiu.
-Mi.

209
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,880
Your Majesty.

210
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,660
Jin Mi suffered

211
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,640
in the Human Realm.

212
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,520
It’s time to succeed to
the post of Floral Immortal.

213
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,340
Your Majesty, although Jin Mi is back,

214
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,340
the fate changed this time.

215
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,540
She didn’t experience the aging sorrow
among the seven sorrows in the Human Realm,

216
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,280
so she didn’t succeed.

217
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,460
She isn’t qualified to
come back to the Heaven Realm

218
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,900
and succeed to the post of Floral Immortal.

219
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,360
According to the law,

220
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,540
she should be a human again.

221
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,760
After experiencing the seven sorrows,

222
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,760
she can enter the immortal class

223
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,400
The fate of experiencing hardships
changed caused by an immortal

224
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,000
who went to the Human Realm
without authorization

225
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,000
to change Jin Mi’s fate.

226
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,140
Water Immortal, what do you mean?

227
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,140
For fairness,

228
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,380
you should ask Fire Immortal.

229
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,180
I jumped to the Cause and Effect Plate
without permission

230
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,060
changing Fairy Jin Mi’s fate.

231
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,580
It’s my fault.

232
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,080
It has nothing to do with Fairy Jin Mi.

233
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,060
Father, hope you can

234
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,940
promote Jin Mi as you promised.

235
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,620
Please punish me

236
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,800
for my mistake.

237
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,880
Xu Feng, you’re Fire Immortal,

238
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,480
but you ignore the general interest.

239
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,820
You have to to
reflect on your misdeeds in private

240
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,480
according to the heavenly rules.

241
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,400
You can’t step out of the Qiwu Palace

242
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,720
in half a month.

243
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes.

244
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,000
And Jin Mi…

245
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,480
It’s true that Jin Mi has
failed in experiencing hardships.

246
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,240
If you still promote her,

247
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,580
it’s against the law in the Heaven Realm.

248
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,180
Fairy Yuan Ji.

249
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,140
Yes.

250
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
Although Jin Mi just experienced

251
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,160
six sorrows in the Human Realm,

252
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,960
she suffered bitterly.

253
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,420
If she is promoted,

254
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,480
will there be abnormal celestial phenomena?

255
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,480
According to the law in the Heaven Realm,

256
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,200
Fairy Jin Mi

257
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,400
did fail this time.

258
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,820
Yuan Ji, out of the mouth comes evil.

259
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,940
But I calculated carefully just now.

260
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,960
Although Fairy Jin Mi

261
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,860
didn’t succeed completely this time,

262
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,400
every sorrow she experienced

263
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,400
is the bitterest hardship.

264
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,940
Her soul has become pure.

265
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,740
If she is promoted,

266
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,840
I don’t think it’ll do harm
to the immortality doctrine

267
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,600
or cause abnormal astrology phenomena.

268
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,220
Good.

269
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,200
Your Majesty, it’s related to
the immortality doctrine of the six realms.

270
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,900
Jin Mi,

271
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,680
now I announce that

272
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,810
you have entered the immortal class

273
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,310
and been promoted to be an immortal.

274
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,700
Then,

275
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,380
you should succeed to
the post of Floral Immortal.

276
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

277
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,700
But over the years,

278
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,820
Chief Peony manages
the Floral Realm methodically.

279
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,120
Moreover, I’m fond of play and inexperienced.

280
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,760
If I become Floral Immortal,

281
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,780
I’m afraid that I have to
stay in the Floral Realm every day.

282
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,340
I want to accompany my father

283
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,100
and enjoy the happiness of family union.

284
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,940
Your Majesty, please let me do what I want.

285
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,880
Jin Mi, you don’t want to

286
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,520
be Floral Immortal?

287
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,060
Fine.

288
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,760
Anyway, you’re still young.

289
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,100
After you get married and want to settle down,

290
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,780
you can succeed to the post of Floral Immortal.

291
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,220
Well,

292
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,140
we should set a wedding day

293
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,500
for Run Yu and Jin Mi.

294
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,160
-Your Majesty.
-Father.

295
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,980
Your Majesty,

296
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,360
the hardships in the Human Realm

297
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,500
have consumed much energy of Jin Mi.

298
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,820
Moreover, she was just
promoted to be an immoral.

299
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,300
She should have a good rest.

300
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,020
Moreover, when I
experienced hardships this time,

301
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,360
my good friend in the Floral Realm

302
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,740
died for my sake.

303
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,680
So I don’t want to get married now.

304
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,480
I just want to find out
the murderer as soon as possible

305
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,060
to avenge her.

306
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,960
Really?

307
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,520
Don’t worry.

308
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,280
I’ll make a thorough investigation.

309
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,800
But it doesn’t conflict with the wedding day.

310
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,760
Your wedding is the first priority.

311
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,420
Well,

312
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,340
choose a good day for Jin Mi and Run Yu

313
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,660
three months later.

314
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,840
What to do?

315
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,840
How about Xu Feng?

316
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,460
Well,

317
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,400
you can leave.

318
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,440
Your Majesty, I also leave.

319
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,180
Water Immortal,

320
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,180
stay.

321
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,440
I want to talk to you.

322
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,560
Your Majesty, what’s the matter?

323
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,560
Nothing serious.

324
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,340
I just want to tell you that

325
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,960
I trust you.

326
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,300
We have been friends for long

327
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
and as intimate as brothers.

328
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,520
Moreover, our children will get married.

329
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,140
We have to help each other afterwards.

330
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,620
Sure.

331
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,180
"Zifangyun Palace"

332
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,920
You actually failed in such a good chance.

333
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,260
What a good-for-nothing.

334
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,240
Sorry to let you down. Please punish me.

335
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,400
Punish you? It’s useless.

336
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,720
Forget it.

337
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,560
Bring Sui He here.

338
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,720
Yes.

339
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,120
Your Highness.

340
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,700
Your Highness, you’re back.

341
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,200
"Qiwu Palace"

342
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,160
Your Highness, you’re finally back.

343
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,640
Your Highness, Fairy Jin Mi,

344
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,480
no,

345
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,880
Immortal Jin Mi buried some
osmanthus wine beside Liuzi Pond

346
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,880
before experiencing hardships
in the Human Realm.

347
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,180
Do I need to go to take it out?

348
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,980
No need.

349
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,360
Prepare something to eat and tea.

350
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,360
OK, Your Highness.

351
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,600
Moon Immortal.

352
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,440
They’re so bold.

353
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,480
Xu Feng, you can’t indulge them.

354
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,700
At least, you should teach them

355
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,100
to be as steady as Lord Liaoyuan.

356
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,420
Uncle.

357
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,420
Now that you mention Lord Liaoyuan,

358
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,260
I wonder

359
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,700
why he went to the Human Realm.

360
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,320
Xu Feng.

361
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:37,860
Your Highness.

362
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,020
Lord Liaoyuan.

363
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,440
Maybe Lord Liaoyuan worried about you,

364
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,480
so he went to the Human Realm with you.

365
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,960
I really admire Lord Liaoyuan

366
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,820
for his loyalty.

367
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,600
Now I’m not allowed to go out of Qiwu Palace,

368
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,960
so I want you

369
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,580
to go to the Human Realm

370
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,580
to pick up Lord Liaoyuan for me.

371
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,400
OK, I’ll do it.

372
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,860
Oh,

373
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,520
I almost forget it.

374
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,760
Xu Feng,

375
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,520
Jin Mi’s wedding day has been set.

376
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,040
What’s your plan?

377
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,220
I’ll make a prefect plan

378
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,660
to let Jin Mi

379
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,740
get rid of her unwanted marriage.

380
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,620
Uncle, don’t worry.

381
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,620
Good.

382
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,840
I’m relieved.

383
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,840
I’m going to pick up Lord Liaoyuan.

384
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,160
Thank you, Uncle.

385
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,160
Mi, look around.

386
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,040
Mi,

387
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,920
you just return from the Human Realm.

388
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,520
Just stay here tonight.

389
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,140
I’ll tell you as soon as
I get any news about Rou Rou.

390
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,260
You should have your own room
in the Heaven Realm

391
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,260
after becoming an immortal.

392
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,860
so your daddy prepares this room for you.

393
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,520
I didn’t know you would come back in advance,

394
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,160
so I decorated it in a hurry.

395
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,480
Auntie Lin Xiu, I like it very much.

396
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,680
Thank you.

397
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,400
Thank you, Daddy.

398
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,640
Now Jin Mi has become an immortal.

399
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,760
and her wedding day
with the first Prince has been set.

400
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,460
With these two happy things,

401
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,220
why are you worried

402
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,200
and unhappy?

403
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,120
You’re worried about

404
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,680
what happened between the second Prince and her

405
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,840
in the Human Realm?

406
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,600
Yes.

407
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,800
The second Prince indeed behaved impulsively.

408
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,660
Others must gossip,

409
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,660
but I believe

410
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,660
Jin Mi is sensible.

411
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,220
What’s more,

412
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,480
the first Prince and her loved each other.

413
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,920
After some time,

414
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,180
she’ll know

415
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,020
what happened between the second Prince and her in the Human Realm

416
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,120
is just a dream.

417
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,900
After deep consideration,

418
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,260
she’ll make a right decision.

419
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,260
I hope so.

420
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,500
Now Jin Mi hasn’t known

421
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,920
Heavenly Empress killed her mother.

422
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,180
If she’s with the second Prince,

423
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,740
given her characters,

424
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,280
she won’t definitely face this truth.

425
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,860
We’d better not tell her about it.

426
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,980
Just see her decision.

427
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,320
No,

428
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,980
it’s inhuman.

429
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,180
Your Majesty,

430
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,120
you still love her?

431
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,900
Impossible.

432
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,660
Your Majesty, don’t mention the past things.

433
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,320
But she wanted

434
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,140
to overturn our governance.

435
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,940
She asked Rat Fairy

436
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,120
to kill Xu Feng during his nirvana.

437
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,560
In this battle of Dongting Lake,

438
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,960
I verify she privately maintained
tens of thousands of picked soldiers,

439
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,820
attempting to overturn our Heaven Realm.

440
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,820
It’s horrible.

441
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,460
Although Su Li committed heinous crimes,

442
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,880
exterminating her whole family

443
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,780
is a heavy punishment.

444
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,120
In this way,

445
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,380
our Heaven Realm will be discredited.

446
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,120
Your Majesty, you should know

447
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,140
the whole Arowana Family was eliminated

448
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,780
except Su Li thousands of years ago,

449
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,140
but then,

450
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,500
she created so many disturbances again.

451
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,200
If you’re still so tolerant

452
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,600
and let the remnants of Dongting Lake go,

453
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,440
they’ll become powerful enemies,

454
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,440
and,

455
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,960
now Su Li’s son

456
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,960
lives with us.

457
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,420
If they collaborate…

458
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,240
Run Yu has been living
with us since his childhood.

459
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,940
You know his characters well.

460
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,840
Current innocence can’t
ensure the eternal innocence.

461
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,100
You should know

462
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,980
the wild ambition can be developed,

463
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,480
as long as the time comes.

464
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,960
If you want to protect two sons,

465
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,540
you must make up your mind

466
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,280
to eliminate her whole family.

467
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,240
I should accept

468
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,240
your kindness,

469
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,560
but the Heaven Realm always advocates peace.

470
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,380
Such a heavy punishment is objectionable.

471
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,160
You don’t need to do it personally.

472
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,280
Leave it to me.

473
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,280
I worry

474
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,100
it’ll

475
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,640
discredit you.

476
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,760
For the sake of two sons

477
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,200
and our Heaven Realm,

478
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,860
I’m willing to be a demon.

479
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,920
I see.

480
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,940
Xu Feng,

481
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,700
I’ll eliminate all your enemies.

482
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:49,860
"Memorial Tablet of Immortal Su Li"

483
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,380
Your Highness.

484
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,780
You come just in time.

485
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,640
Invite Li and Yan You here

486
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,080
to kowtow to mom.

487
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,380
They’re caught by soldiers.

488
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,680
What?

489
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,580
Heavenly Empress wants to
kill those 30,000 living beings of Dongting.

490
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,980
When will she do it?

491
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,120
Maybe Thunder God and
Lightning Goddess have been on their way.

492
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,740
Father.

493
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,380
Father.

494
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,160
30,000 living beings in Dongting Lake

495
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,420
are innocent.

496
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,400
Now that my mom...

497
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,220
Su Li is dead,

498
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,160
Heavenly Empress doesn’t
need to do such a merciless thing.

499
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,080
Please

500
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,220
save them.

501
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,740
I guarantee

502
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,460
they won’t create any disturbance again.

503
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,140
Heavenly Empress is right.

504
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,600
Su Li rebelled and committed heinous crimes.

505
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,560
She should be punished according to the law,

506
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,800
though I’m also loath

507
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,800
to kill so many living beings.

508
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,100
Now that Heavenly Empress
actively issues an order to kill them for me,

509
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,840
I can’t refuse her.

510
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,840
As my eldest son,

511
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,380
you can’t take the lead to break the law.

512
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,440
But, Father…

513
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:36,980
Stop that.

514
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,880
Just leave.

515
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,960
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess
aren’t in the execution ground

516
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,960
but the Empyrean Cloud Palace.

517
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,980
I seem to be the real criminal

518
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,840
Mother wants to punish.

519
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,200
Those 30,000 remnants of Dongting

520
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,260
should be killed,

521
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,840
but they did that for you,

522
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,360
so you should also be punished.

523
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,400
They’re all weak and innocent living beings.

524
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,760
Please let them off, Mother.

525
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,200
Mother?

526
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,630
That day,

527
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:46,600
when you wanted to kill me to revenge your mom,

528
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,680
how imposing and insolent you were.

529
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,100
What’s wrong with you today?

530
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,540
You’re not insolent

531
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,280
I’m wrong.

532
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,900
Just punish me,

533
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,520
but 30,000 living beings of Dongting

534
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,340
are innocent.

535
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,580
Those 30,000 remnants and your mom

536
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,500
hatched a sinister plot

537
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,200
and wanted to overturn the Heaven Realm.

538
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,380
They deserve more than death.

539
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,460
Punishment should

540
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,360
fit the crime.

541
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,920
Even if my mom hated you,

542
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,920
she never really rebelled,

543
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,580
but you first…

544
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,580
Shut up.

545
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,219
You plotted to kill Xu Feng
and privately maintained picked soldiers

546
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,420
to rebel.

547
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,980
You deserve death.

548
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,639
I should directly kill you!

549
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,900
Yes.

550
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:43,699
I’m wrong.

551
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:45,920
Please let us off.

552
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:47,460
Night Immortal,

553
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,400
you’re not wrong.

554
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,840
Brother.

555
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:12,880
Li.

556
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,199
Yan You.

557
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:16,960
Mother.

558
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,219
Thunder God, Lightning Goddess,

559
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,620
how to deal with these remnants?

560
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,160
According to the law,

561
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,120
they should be killed
by Heavenly Thunder and Lightning Fire.

562
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,080
OK.

563
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,680
Execute.

564
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,380
Wait a minute.

565
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,100
I’m wrong.

566
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,100
I’m ungrateful.

567
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,780
I shouldn’t offend you,

568
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,420
but,

569
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,020
but my mom is dead.

570
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,580
They can no longer pose a threat to you.

571
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,960
Please

572
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,840
let them off.

573
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,560
I wonder

574
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,820
whether you’re virtuous and kind-hearted

575
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,440
or hypocritical.

576
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,200
Su Li plotted to kill Xu Feng.
She committed a heinous crime,

577
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,000
so she should be punished,

578
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,760
right?

579
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,000
Right?

580
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,900
Yes.

581
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,640
Run Yu,

582
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,960
Damn you!

583
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,120
Foster mother always
cared for you in the past thousands of years.

584
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,760
You’re not qualified to be her son.

585
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,640
So, you beg me as Night Immortal,

586
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,180
a remnant of Dongting

587
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:51,860
or the left orphan of Arowana Family?

588
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,740
I,

589
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,320
I,

590
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,100
Foster mother never accepted you.

591
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,340
Leave here right now.

592
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,800
Yan You.

593
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,660
I’m responsible for my mom’s crimes.

594
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,840
I’m willing to be punished for my mom.

595
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,060
Please don’t transfer your anger on others.

596
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,940
Forget it.

597
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,480
I’m reasonable.

598
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,760
Two choices.

599
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,880
Make a clean break
with these remnants of Dongting,

600
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,940
and execute the punishment personally,

601
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,880
or, take the blame for the remnants

602
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,700
and to atone for your mom.
