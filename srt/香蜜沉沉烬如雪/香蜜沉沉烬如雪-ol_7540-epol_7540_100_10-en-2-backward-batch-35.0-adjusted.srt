1
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,800
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,560
"Episode 10"

3
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,980
The saying goes, parents know
their children best.

4
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,060
But my son is not on the same boat with me.

5
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,520
I don't know what for
I'm doing all these.

6
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,440
His Highness will understand...
your thoughts one day.

7
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,060
But now

8
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,960
the people around him are all sceptical

9
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,120
The Princess of Bian City, Liu Ying
has only met with His Highness for a few days.

10
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,170
Yet she's already calling
him Brother Feng.

11
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,000
She doesn't care if he will

12
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,790
be criticised by
others in Heaven Realm.

13
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,960
It's just a demon's trick.
Don't mind that.

14
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,640
What's your opinion on
Xu Feng getting injured...

15
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,020
in Demon Realm?

16
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,140
I think something is fishy.

17
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,340
With the prince's cultivation,

18
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,520
he won't be injured so easily.

19
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,190
I believe Liu Ying is
not someone ordinary.

20
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,320
She wouldn't let someone from Heaven
Realm who provides help to get hurt.

21
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,450
In my opinion,

22
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,640
there's another story behind this.

23
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,560
Go check it out at Demon Realm.

24
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,079
Watch out for Qiong Qi
and the 3 Demon Kings.

25
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:47,510
See if Run Yu is colluding
with them secretly.

26
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:48,960
And report it to me.

27
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,700
Yes, aunt.

28
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,100
Princess, I've brought him here.

29
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,770
Greetings, Princess Sui He.

30
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,110
So you're the soldier that...

31
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,180
came late for conscription
and was taken by Xuanji Palace?

32
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,100
Yes, I am.
Is there anything you need me for?

33
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,850
Well, is Night Immortal
treating you right?

34
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,590
Yes.

35
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,960
How?

36
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,840
He only appears at night and
always keeps to himself.

37
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,570
Although I seldom see him,

38
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,140
he's quite good to fairies like us.

39
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,160
He always greets us.

40
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,000
Is this even good treatment?

41
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,520
Do you want to work for Fire Immortal?

42
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,900
Help me with this,

43
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,440
and I'll get you there.

44
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,769
Choose anywhere you like
at Divine Army Mansion.

45
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,120
As for your position,

46
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,260
as long as it's not a
high-ranking position,

47
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,540
you may choose whichever
position you like.

48
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,650
What do you want me to do, princess?

49
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,520
Keep an eye on the Night Immortal.

50
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,400
Every move he makes,

51
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,230
the people he meets
and things he says,

52
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,730
tell me everything regardless
of its importance.

53
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,480
Is it hard?

54
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,020
You'd have a promising future if
you work under Fire Immortal.

55
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,870
This big fortune
is wanted badly by other immortals.

56
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,140
What good have I done...

57
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,140
to deserve such a big fortune.

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,920
I heard that Fire Immortal is
very strict with the army.

59
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,490
He personally picks
his own soldiers.

60
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,770
So, why is it that you
have the power...

61
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,190
to pick the soldiers, Princess Sui He?

62
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,920
Don't you worry about that.

63
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,500
I'm a person of my word.

64
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,280
Actually, on conscription day,

65
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,710
it wasn't because I came late
that I had to go to Xuanji Palace.

66
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,980
I went there on my own will.

67
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,070
You're so lacking ambition.

68
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,350
So, you're not doing it, huh?

69
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,640
Everybody has his own aspiration.
Please forgive me, princess.

70
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,310
If you don't obey me today,

71
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,010
you'll be offending me.

72
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,610
Which means,
offending the Heavenly Empress.

73
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,210
Princess, you mean...

74
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,490
it's the Heavenly Empress's will
to keep an eye on Night Immortal?

75
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,990
Certainly.

76
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,640
It's only until today that I know...

77
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,750
why Xuanji Palace is so cheerless...

78
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,950
with only a few people.

79
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,460
So, it's because...

80
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,400
the Heavenly Empress is
treating you like this.

81
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,590
During these thousands of years,

82
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,330
none of them had
gone through the test.

83
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,250
They were all kicked out by me.

84
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,210
Aren't you afraid of
the Heavenly Empress?

85
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,630
I am.

86
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,430
But everyone has his own ambition.
They can't force me.

87
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,030
Moreover, I don't know how to lie.

88
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,370
I'd certainly expose myself.

89
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,670
But I've never wanted to betray you.

90
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,480
You have to believe me, Your Highness.

91
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,040
Kuang Lu, thank you.

92
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,070
I hope that you will...

93
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,760
trust me like the way
you trust the beast of dream.

94
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,720
The Heavenly Empress is
still very suspicious of you.

95
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,630
It's hard to protect yourself.

96
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,680
You must be careful, Your Highness.

97
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,710
I've got used to it. It's okay.

98
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,140
As long as she can't find my mistake,

99
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,020
she can't do anything to me.

100
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,660
If only there's meteor.

101
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,680
If there is meteor,

102
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,120
maybe the phoenix will be here.

103
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,790
Meteor.

104
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,350
Phoenix!

105
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,980
- Phoe...
- You're indeed bored, huh?

106
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,250
Fish Fairy, why are you here?

107
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,890
I came here without
informing beforehand,

108
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,670
please don't be angry.

109
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,320
What are you talking about?
I'm idle these few days.

110
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,060
You're most welcome to come here
to relieve my boredom.

111
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,220
You must be worrying about Xu Feng.

112
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,010
He's fine now.

113
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,630
He is recuperating at Qiwu Palace.

114
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,760
This time,
it's all thanks to you, Jin Mi.

115
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,280
Luckily he's fine.

116
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,900
I was so worried about him.

117
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,670
I was just thinking that...

118
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,860
if there's a meteor,
maybe the phoenix will be here.

119
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,310
That's why I thought that
the meteor was Phoenix.

120
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,450
So, do you like it?

121
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,650
Yes, I do.

122
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,169
It's so beautiful.

123
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,940
Fish Fairy,

124
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,960
can you take me out of the Water Mirror?

125
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,380
I want to see the outside world.

126
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,060
Okay.

127
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,240
Yay!

128
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,710
That's great!

129
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,020
We're out.

130
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,090
You're so amazing, Fish Fairy!

131
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,910
The barrier can't be broken
by needles or water.

132
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,650
Fruits like us...

133
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,110
can only come out after
cultivating for 10,000 years.

134
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,390
Even Lao Hu has to...

135
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,590
chant the water-breaking spell
for a very long time.

136
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,530
But you,
you managed to bring me out so easily.

137
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,110
You'll indeed have a great future.

138
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,360
There's nothing special.
You've overpraised me.

139
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,240
Let's go, then.

140
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,000
This way.

141
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,750
King, the Heavenly Emperor
promised to...

142
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,020
attack the Demon Lord
after Qiong Qi's incident.

143
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,410
But nothing has happened until now.

144
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,710
The Heavenly Emperor...

145
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,300
is still unreliable.

146
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,460
In the war between Heaven
and Demon ages ago,

147
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,710
he did not keep his promises
but abandoned us.

148
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,900
If it weren't for you,

149
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,030
how did he become
the Emperor so easily?

150
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,680
If I'd known earlier,
I wouldn't trouble myself...

151
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,300
to let Qiong Qi go.

152
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,200
Now that Heaven Realm
had taken Qiong Qi back,

153
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,240
the Demon Realm has suffered
a great loss.

154
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,580
If that's the case,

155
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,570
your plan to eliminate Demon Lord
has come to nothing.

156
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,360
We can't rush in seizing
the title of Demon Lord.

157
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,140
About that throne,

158
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,480
I have my own way to get it.

159
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,900
Heavenly Emperor is very ambitious.
Heaven and Demon Realms...

160
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,420
can't satisfy his greed.

161
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,270
So now,

162
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,280
we can't fuss over our losses.

163
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,700
Since the Heavenly Emperor
has taken Qiong Qi,

164
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,320
I'll let him fight at the front.

165
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,720
When the time comes,

166
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,850
I will definitely rule
over the six realms.

167
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,590
You're almighty.

168
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,560
According to the scout we
sent to Demon Realm,

169
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,750
His Highness was indeed hurt by
Qiong Qi.

170
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,740
The 3 kings in Demon Realm have
no contact with Night Immortal.

171
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,070
I have thought too highly of him.

172
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,410
But of the people who went
to Demon Realm,

173
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,440
there was also the grape fairy,
Jin Mi,

174
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,560
other than Night Immortal.

175
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,590
You mean...

176
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,670
she has something to do
with Xu Feng's injury?

177
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,120
Was Jin Mi...

178
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,180
Xu Feng's reading assistant
at Qiwu Palace?

179
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,430
You even praised her before.

180
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,350
I was careless.

181
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,890
Back then, Chief Peony
stopped providing food...

182
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,960
to the bird tribe
because of a lost flower fairy.

183
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,030
I found out later that
the fairy was Jin Mi.

184
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,430
I see, it was her.

185
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,180
Go on.

186
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,150
The strange thing is...

187
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,930
Qiong Qi was sealed inside
Soul Cauldron by His Highness...

188
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,260
with Nine Luminaries Fire Seal,

189
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,580
but who knows he was still
able to escape the cauldron.

190
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,340
When Qiong Qi attacked him
with plague needle,

191
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,780
Jin Mi was in the room too.

192
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,180
But no one knows
what actually happened in there.

193
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,970
I think...

194
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,290
Jin Mi definitely has something
to do with this.

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,280
What's even stranger is that....

196
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,450
when His Highness was
injured by plague needle,

197
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,830
only Night Rattan could save him.

198
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,880
But Night Rattan...

199
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,330
Night Rattan is Flora
Realm's sacred object.

200
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,440
But the Heaven and Floral Realms...

201
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,700
have had grudges
for thousands of years,

202
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,840
they would never save Xu Feng.

203
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,400
However,

204
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,760
they actually saved him with it.

205
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,100
This matter doesn't seem to be simple.

206
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,130
What is the Floral Realm's motive?

207
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,160
You've worked hard. Go get some rest.

208
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,090
Keep this a secret before it's clear.

209
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,780
Yes.

210
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,130
Go and check on a grape fairy
named Jin Mi at Floral Realm.

211
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,820
Yes.

212
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,700
Heavenly Empress,
everything is normal in Floral Realm,

213
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,350
except for one place.

214
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,950
I found that within
the Water Mirror Barrier,

215
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,060
there's a courtyard...

216
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,900
that was sealed by a powerful
Peony spell.

217
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,140
I was afraid I'd alarm the chiefs,
so I did not go in.

218
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,780
I'll have to go to Floral Realm
myself to find out then.

219
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,510
Chief Peony,

220
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,940
Xu Feng was seriously poisoned
while subduing Qiong Qi days ago.

221
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,250
Luckily you were generous enough
to heal Xu Feng with Night Rattan.

222
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,550
I'm here to thank you today.

223
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:38,030
I brought you a gift,
please accept it.

224
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,130
You're welcome, Heavenly Empress.

225
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,740
It was all fate.

226
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,810
It seems that his time
hasn't come yet.

227
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,170
As for your appreciation,

228
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,440
that is too much.
I can't bear it.

229
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,970
Everyone in Floral Realm
does not dare to accept it.

230
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,970
I heard that there's...

231
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,140
a grape fairy called Jin Mi
here in Floral Realm.

232
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,950
She was also there when
Xu Feng was wounded by Qiong Qi.

233
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,030
Can I see her?

234
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,740
I'm afraid I have to say no.

235
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,180
Jin Mi has made a big mistake.

236
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,310
She's repenting,
won't be seeing anyone.

237
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,630
Fire Immortal was attacked,

238
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,540
I think it's more appropriate
if you ask him yourself.

239
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,350
What wrong did
Jin Mi do exactly...

240
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,430
to receive such a heavy punishment?

241
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,980
The Heaven Realm has no right to
intervene in Floral Realm's business.

242
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,300
Especially someone like you,
Heavenly Empress.

243
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,670
What do you think?

244
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,600
We're busy here.
There are a lot of jobs to do.

245
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,150
Please leave.

246
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,220
I won't disturb you anymore then.
See you again.

247
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,920
Heavenly Empress,
do we go back to Heaven Realm now?

248
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,510
Chief Peony kept on stopping me,

249
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,060
and even ordered me to leave.

250
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,450
It's obvious that she's
covering something up.

251
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,460
From the way she's acting,

252
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,080
I feel more like seeing Jin Mi
and see who exactly she is.

253
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,200
Heavenly Empress,
you actually lowered yourself...

254
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,330
trying to break into a fairy's room?

255
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,940
Where would Heaven Realm put
its face if others know about this?

256
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,640
Who exactly is Jin Mi?

257
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,220
You even set a double-layer barrier
to trap her here.

258
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,310
It's none of your business.

259
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,880
Jin Mi.

260
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,530
Your Highness.

261
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,330
Your Highness.

262
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,700
It's you.

263
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,720
How are you?

264
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,880
Why don't you stay inside the palace?

265
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,700
I'm fine now. I need some air.

266
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,310
Are you troubled?

267
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,700
You seem to immerse
in thought just now.

268
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,540
Just tell me if there's
anything troubling you.

269
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,600
I can share it with you.

270
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,800
This is all fate.

271
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,060
The so-called trouble
sounds more like a joke.

272
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,670
Your Highness.

273
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,330
Are you worried about Jin Mi?

274
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:09,220
I'm afraid I'm not even
worthy enough to worry about her.

275
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,510
What a pity grape.

276
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Jin Mi.

277
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,150
Fish Fairy, you're here?

278
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,780
Jin Mi,

279
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,730
am I disturbing you?

280
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,270
No, no. Why would that be?

281
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,800
You seem sullen,

282
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,350
is it because of Xuanji Palace's
poor hospitality?

283
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,100
No, this place is great.

284
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,780
Everybody has taken great care of me.

285
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,540
Is there anything troubling you?

286
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,120
It's not quite so.

287
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,360
But after I parted with
Xu Feng the other day,

288
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,270
I've never seen him anymore.

289
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,010
I wonder how his condition is.

290
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,480
I want to visit him.

291
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,930
I see. You're sullen because of this.

292
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,100
Don't worry, Jin Mi.

293
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,010
I just visited him at Qiwu Palace.

294
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,400
So how? How is he?

295
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,210
Did he mention me?

296
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,090
After taking the Night Rattan,

297
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,560
he's basically fine.

298
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,240
It's just that at this moment,
everybody is queuing up...

299
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,980
in front of Qiwu Palace to visit him.

300
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,230
It's very crowded there.

301
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,420
If you go there now,

302
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,890
you'll be attracting attention.

303
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,210
Then the fact that you're
hiding in Heaven Realm...

304
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,750
can no longer be kept hidden.

305
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,520
You're right, Fish Fairy.

306
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,850
It's better if I don't visit him now.

307
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,510
I'll go some other time.

308
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,530
Fish Fairy, the meteor you
showed me the other day...

309
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,160
was too beautiful.

310
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,360
I want to see it again.

311
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,450
Just a simple trick,
it wasn't worth mentioning.

312
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,980
If you want,

313
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,070
I can show you something
even more special.

314
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,570
Something even more special?
Where?

315
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,780
After you get out of
Xuanji Palace, go south.

316
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,790
There's a milky way near the rainbow.

317
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,340
Milky way?

318
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,800
Let's go now.

319
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,950
Come on.

320
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,090
So this is the milky way?

321
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,390
Phenomenal!

322
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,180
I've never seen
such a beautiful place.

323
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,010
Fish Fairy, the position you hold...

324
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,940
is good in term of ranking.

325
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,160
But when it comes to joy,

326
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,110
I think it's not as good as
Maori Star Guardian.

327
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,630
What do you mean?

328
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,040
Well,

329
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,800
Maori Star Guardian is
on duty during the day.

330
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,370
There are sounds of cocks and dogs.
So it's kind of lively.

331
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,490
But you,

332
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,270
you only have that beast of dream
who can't speak as companion.

333
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,690
And everybody has
gone to bed at night.

334
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,070
How cheerless.

335
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,400
You're such a lonely immortal.

336
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,960
Only those who've
experienced liveliness...

337
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,490
understand loneliness.

338
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,270
I'm fated to be alone.

339
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,600
I eat alone, practice alone,

340
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,100
read alone and sleep alone.

341
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,580
Without knowing liveliness,

342
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,260
how'd I know loneliness?

343
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,720
Give me your hand.

344
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,290
For you.

345
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,240
This is the seed of
night-blooming cereus.

346
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,470
It is a flower that
only blooms at night.

347
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,660
In the morning,

348
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,040
it mostly sleeps while
closing its flower.

349
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,320
I think its habit
is more or less like yours.

350
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,630
That's why I gave it to you.

351
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,440
You can accompany
each other from now on.

352
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,920
All these years,

353
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,600
the Heaven Realm is full of
flowers transformed by clouds.

354
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,910
They will never wilt,

355
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,030
but it's still just a trick.
It's not real.

356
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,470
Thanks to you today...

357
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,000
that Xuanji Palace is able
to have a real flower.

358
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,350
But you still need to...

359
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,200
water and take good care of it.

360
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,770
I will give it my best.

361
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,570
Hopefully when the night-blooming
cereus blooms,

362
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,330
I can watch its beauty with you.

363
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,540
Sure. No problem.

364
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,390
Fish Fairy, please do me a favour.

365
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,760
Just say it.

366
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,030
Can you...

367
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,950
don't take me back to
the Water Mirror today?

368
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,360
I don't want to be
found by Chief Peony.

369
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,310
Is it okay if I stay and
disturb you...

370
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,870
for a few days at Xuanji Palace?

371
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,360
Since I've brought you
out of the Water Mirror,

372
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,620
I won't take you back.

373
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,420
As long as you don't mind
staying in Xuanji Palace,

374
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,080
that will not be a trouble.

375
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,430
I don't mind. I don't.

376
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,780
But even Phoenix
is afraid of Chief Peony.

377
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,610
Aren't you afraid?

378
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,770
I was disliked by many
people since little.

379
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,770
One more person means nothing.

380
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,020
Your Highness.

381
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,980
Your Highness,
I heard that Chief Peony...

382
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,780
is here to look for Jin Mi.

383
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,580
What? So fast?

384
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,320
No way.
I can't let her find me.

385
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,050
Otherwise I'm doomed.

386
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,030
Fish Fairy, I need to
quickly hide in your palace now.

387
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,140
I'm glad that
you think of Xuanji Palace first...

388
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,040
when you're in trouble.

389
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,560
But I think that
if you wish for a longer freedom,

390
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,300
hiding in Heaven Realm
is not the best option.

391
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,920
You're so thoughtful.

392
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,810
But... but I don't know much
about the six realms.

393
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,230
Please tell me what to do.

394
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,040
The mortal world is very complicated.

395
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,850
It wouldn't be an easy task
to track your scent...

396
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,950
among the mortals.

397
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,130
I was right about you.

398
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,740
You're indeed an exceptional
genius in Heaven Realm.

399
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,410
I have a lot of faith in you.

400
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,840
You actually look
good dressed like this.

401
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,000
Really?

402
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
Have a sip.

403
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,190
Although this place is simple and
crude, it's very quiet.

404
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,160
If you're okay with it,

405
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,730
you may settle down here.

406
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,430
Thanks, Fish Fairy.

407
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,170
I like this house.
I like it very much.

408
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,220
Now you have a house and clothes,

409
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,480
but a pseudonym name in mortal world.

410
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,910
Pseudonym name?

411
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,970
Call me Mi then.

412
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,720
No. The name
sounds too much like a girl's name.

413
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,120
You're now a gentleman.

414
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,530
How about the name Ling Guang?

415
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,440
Ling Guang?

416
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,470
Sounds like brightness.

417
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,140
I like it. This is it then.

418
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,160
The Earth Immortal is so speedy.

419
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,720
We've just arrived,
and he's already here.

420
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,900
Just like a cat that got a fish.

421
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,180
He must have come by tracing
the immortal scent.

422
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,330
I'm using your place...

423
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,920
without informing you first.
Please forgive me.

424
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,030
Your Highness,
your visit to my territory...

425
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,480
has showered glory and...

426
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,250
bring colours around here.

427
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:27,260
Now that I have lived
to see your charming appearance,

428
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,060
I feel so lucky...

429
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,900
- and blessed.
- Enough.

430
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,600
This is Mister Ling Guang,
a friend I made recently.

431
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,440
He has encountered some troubles,

432
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,530
and will be staying here
for a few days.

433
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,830
Please take care of him,
Earth Immortal.

434
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,090
Greetings, Mister Ling Guang.

435
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,850
Don't worry, Your Highness.

436
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,890
This is my territory.

437
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,350
I'm in charge of this place.

438
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,750
If someone wishes to harm
Mister Ling Guang,

439
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,320
he'd have to go over my dead body.

440
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,880
Before he became an immortal,
he was a mountain thief.

441
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,740
Thanks then, Earth Immortal.

442
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,600
My pleasure. I'll take my leave then.

443
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,820
- I want this.
- Give me this.

444
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,710
Sirs, there's only 1 left.

445
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,730
Lord Puchi.

446
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,880
Jin Mi.

447
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,630
Lord Puchi, why are you here?

448
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,390
One gets silly easily when
stays too long in Heaven Realm.

449
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,300
Don't you think so?

450
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,890
That's why
I'm here to see the mortal's faces.

451
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,630
Now,

452
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,210
- I'm no longer Jin Mi.
- What are you then?

453
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,650
After I came to mortal world,

454
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,350
I have a mortal name.

455
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,990
Call me Ling Guang.

456
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,660
Ling Guang?

457
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,230
Why?

458
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,700
I made a
a small mistake.

459
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,450
I was locked up and asked to
repent by Chief Peony.

460
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,110
But I escaped.

461
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,160
After a careful thought,
I think this is the safest place.

462
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,180
Chief Peony will never find me here.

463
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,190
I see.

464
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,540
Then, do you have a place to stay?

465
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,360
Do you need me to find one for you?

466
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,330
Never mind. I've had one.

467
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,050
Fish Fairy had everything done for me.

468
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,290
Fish Fairy?

469
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,850
When did Heaven Realm
have this position?

470
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,440
It's the Night Immortal.
He's a very nice guy.

471
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,100
It's he who helped me escaped.

472
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,870
He even found a house for me.

473
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,760
But he's gone back to Heaven Realm.

474
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,090
Oh right. You're free anyway.

475
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,140
Why not I bring you to visit my house?

476
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,130
It's not as colourful as Floral Realm,

477
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,610
or as elegant as Heaven Realm,

478
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,800
but it is special.

479
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,760
- Great. Let's go.
- Come on.

480
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,460
"Luoxiang Mansion"

481
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:29,020
Are you paying respect to Zi Fen?

482
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,790
Can you pour me a cup of wine too?

483
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,070
Thank you.

484
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,270
Zi Fen loved Osmanthus wine the most.

485
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,440
All these years,

486
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,340
I've been dreaming about her.

487
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,290
In my dream,
she was still the old her.

488
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,410
Smiling,

489
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,180
but with tears in her eyes.

490
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,220
The past has passed.
There's no use to bring it up.

491
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,970
May I know why are you here,
Your Majesty?

492
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,880
The Heavenly Empress' birthday
is in a few days' time.

493
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,250
I know that...

494
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,660
you and Lin Xiu are
indifferent to fame,

495
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,390
nor do you like crowded place.

496
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,660
But the Heavenly Empress
is over sensitive.

497
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,830
She might think you are upset of her.

498
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,969
All the immortals have been
talking behind us as well.

499
00:33:36,489 --> 00:33:37,530
So I hope that...

500
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,830
in her birthday banquet
a few days later,

501
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,560
you and Lin Xiu
will be there no matter what.

502
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,199
Since you have personally
come to invite me,

503
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:51,560
Lin Xiu and I will definitely go.

504
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,159
Okay.

505
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
You guys...

506
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,310
have kept my son waited for long.

507
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,710
The marriage was
arranged since 4000 years ago.

508
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,060
But where's your daughter?

509
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,500
What? Mother went to Floral Realm
to look for Jin Mi?

510
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,520
But what was unexpected was that...

511
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,150
Jin Mi wasn't in Floral Realm.

512
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,060
Even Chief Peony couldn't find her.

513
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:21,000
What did you say?
Jin Mi has gone missing?

514
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,800
Your Highness, you've just recovered.

515
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,370
Don't get too agitated.

516
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,770
Jin Mi...

517
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,860
Is Jin Mi that important to you?

518
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,040
Flower Immortals, you can't come in.
You can't...

519
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,640
Your Highness,
they insisted to barge in.

520
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,690
Your Highness.
I was incapable to stop them.

521
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,170
You're done here. You may leave.

522
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

523
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,360
Greetings, Chief Peony.

524
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,360
You came here in such a rush.

525
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,070
May I know what is it
that's so important?

526
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,680
Fire Immortal,
please hand over Jin Mi.

527
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,600
I think you've misunderstood.

528
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,810
Jin Mi is not in Qiwu Palace.

529
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,340
Jin Mi suddenly disappeared
from the Water Mirror.

530
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,740
Besides you,

531
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,480
I can't think of anyone
who is able to take her away.

532
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,060
Jin Mi is from Floral Realm.

533
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,460
If you've taken her,

534
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,960
please return her to us.

535
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,810
Since I've promised you...

536
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,080
I won't see her in
Floral Realm anymore,

537
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,720
I will never break my promise.

538
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:25,000
I was just about to look for her
since I've also just learnt that...

539
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,140
she's missing.

540
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,710
We've all agreed that...

541
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,700
it was Fire Immortal
who took Jin Mi away.

542
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,220
Nonsense!

543
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,560
You lost a person from Floral Realm,

544
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,670
yet you come here to Heaven Realm...

545
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,730
and blame Xu Feng?

546
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,910
The person you're
looking for is not here.

547
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,360
Even if you bring this to
the Heavenly Emperor,

548
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,860
the answer's still the same.

549
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,960
Please leave, Chief Peony.

550
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,770
As for Jin Mi, I'll find her.

551
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,800
"Fuxiang Restaurant"

552
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,550
Mister Ling Guang,
you've no idea that...

553
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,940
the best dish to go with wine is duck.

554
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,350
One sip of yellow wine...

555
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,310
with 2 bites of osmanthus duck.

556
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,310
This makes one's life perfect.
Perfect.

557
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:34,850
Here.

558
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,080
That's too strong.
Why is mortal's wine so strong?

559
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,090
But speaking of this wine,

560
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,410
the wine in mortal world...

561
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,720
when compared to the wine
brewed by an immortal like Yan You,

562
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,490
it's...

563
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,630
What do we call that?

564
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,520
It's just like diluted cat pee,

565
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,790
not presentable at all.

566
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:10,130
Three, two, one.

567
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,270
Done.

568
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,000
Even when the rich
are born into the mortal world,

569
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,020
they'd end up with a befuddled life
but not a desired life.

570
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,670
The 4 greatest pleasures
in one's life...

571
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,920
are none other than...

572
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,690
eating, drinking,
playing and enjoying.

573
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:30,180
Mi, can you get used to
the life in mortal world?

574
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,110
During these few days
I'm in mortal world,

575
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,860
Fish Fairy had been
keeping me company.

576
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,290
He is on duty at night.

577
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,380
Besides taking a nap during the day,

578
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,350
he'd play chess, zither or
discuss about books and poems with me.

579
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,990
I wasn't so boring.

580
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,810
Night Immortal...

581
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,350
is indeed careful and thoughtful.

582
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,130
He had been taking good care of you.

583
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,240
That's for sure.

584
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,780
But, Lord Puchi,

585
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,770
you were talking about eating,
drinking, playing and enjoying.

586
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,350
Let's put aside eating and drinking.

587
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,520
What's so special about
playing and enjoying?

588
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,530
I'm new here,

589
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,240
I need you to teach me, Lord Puchi.

590
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,610
Let me tell you.

591
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,700
Everything about the heaven is good,

592
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,320
except that it's too boring.
No fun at all.

593
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,320
Such a rare place is of course good.

594
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,590
But,

595
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:20,610
it's not as enjoyable
as the fun in mortal world.

596
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,970
I'll bring you to have fun now.

597
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,390
Thanks then.

598
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,600
Do you know what does having fun mean?

599
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,860
I...

600
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,180
I'll take you to experience
the real fun today.

601
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,520
Okay. We're here.

602
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,440
Isn't... isn't this just
a cloth store?

603
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,410
You'll know when you get in there.

604
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,950
Come on.

605
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,820
Boss,

606
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,290
any fresh fish to sell?

607
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,670
Sirs, please follow me.

608
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,910
Come on.

609
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,640
Watch out the steps.

610
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,630
Please hold on,
I'll get someone for you.

611
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,840
Okay.

612
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,520
To gamble in big amount with
many skillful people,

613
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,880
you have to find the right place.

614
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,070
An underground gambling house
is the best.

615
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,430
Bingo.

616
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,390
"Gamble"

617
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,510
I won.

618
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,520
I won!

619
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,750
Just leave.

620
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,960
Go away.

621
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,700
Go.

622
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,490
Mister, we're doing small business.

623
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,830
We can't withstand torture from
a skillful person like you.

624
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,860
Please don't ruin my business.

625
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,720
Thank you very much.

626
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,740
This is weird.

627
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,340
Playing mahjong is so boring.

628
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,010
In a game, winning and
losing makes it fun.

629
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,130
Like when I was playing
chess with Fish Fairy,

630
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,410
he'd take 2 of my piece...

631
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,740
while I capture 5 of his piece.

632
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
It's more interesting if
we take turn in winning.

633
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,080
But in mahjong,

634
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,730
I got whichever tile I wished for...

635
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,120
and won every time.

636
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,300
Besides getting these heavy objects...

637
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,480
in yellow and white,

638
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,860
it's not interesting at all.

639
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,980
This is not fun. Let's go.

640
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,140
Hey, brothers.

641
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,310
Greetings, Fire Immortal.

642
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,690
Your Highness, your
visit to this place...

643
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,590
has showered glory and
added colours around here.

644
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,710
Save your pleasantries.

645
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,680
Qiwu Palace has lost a servant.

646
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,760
I'm here to look for her.

647
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,750
Did you see
a very beautiful young lady...

648
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,810
or a fairchild with grape vine?

649
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,290
Did you see her?

650
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,370
- No.
- No.

651
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,670
Your Highness,

652
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,470
we've never seen the
person you're looking for.

653
