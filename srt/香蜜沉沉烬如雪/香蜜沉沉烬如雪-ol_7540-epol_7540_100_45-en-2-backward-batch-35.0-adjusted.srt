00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 45"

3
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,340
Anyway

4
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,760
I won’t let you marry him.

5
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,200
Black hair

6
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,400
represents lingering affection.

7
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,260
I’m afraid that

8
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,120
it’s impossible for us to be together again now.

9
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,079
Here you are.

10
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,120
This black hair can present my affection.

11
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,860
I wish your heart is just like mine.

12
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,580
Don’t worry. I have a plan.

13
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:37,920
But you must wait

14
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,420
before the end of the wedding ceremony

15
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,579
in three days.

16
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,079
Exercising government by means
of virtue is like the Polaris.

17
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,079
It’s in its place with all the stars twinkling around it.

18
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,640
The proud loong repents but goes its own way.

19
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,600
Being close to courtiers and alienating virtuous
ministers are the faults of Heavenly Emperor.

20
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,480
Heavenly Emperor is brutal

21
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,240
and the Polaris lacks virtue and losses its brilliance.

22
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,880
What should we do?

23
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,060
Decide the right path and correct the wrong path.

24
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,120
Bring order out of chaos

25
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,950
and choose anther wise ruler

26
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,080
to replace him.

27
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,580
The son manages the army of the father,
but doesn’t know where to stop.

28
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,060
Run Yu is wrong.

29
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,660
Your Highness, what should we do?

30
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,680
Clean up the world

31
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,230
and help the six realms in distress.

32
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,600
Fight to win or die and storm the enemy's den.

33
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,500
Conquer qian with kun and seize qian yuan first.

34
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,420
Li is above and kan is below.
Control the north gate in the middle.

35
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,660
Replace gen with dui.
Stabilize the west route in the rear.

36
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,400
Ziwei guards the Polaris.

37
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,400
Tanlang breaks Yaoguang.

38
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,020
Wuqu solves Tianquan.

39
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,760
The Heaven Realm is falling into decadence.

40
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,860
We should take a drastic measure to deal
with it instead of cutting off flesh to cure a boil.

41
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,660
Enduring the pain for the time being
and destroying the old and establishing the new

42
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,080
comply with the mandate of heaven.

43
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,200
Every change in power

44
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,480
will be bloody

45
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,670
and people will be plunged into an abyss of misery.

46
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,050
I cannot bear to see that.

47
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,720
Even if I must act against the trend,

48
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,090
I’ll stay the course.

49
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,040
Your Highness, we don’t stand a great chance.

50
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,820
Why does he go his own way

51
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,340
even if he has no hope of winning?

52
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,960
We have a slim chance.

53
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,820
Why do you make a risky move

54
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,560
in this case?

55
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,000
Yanyue.

56
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,340
Yanyue.

57
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:05,159
The star behind the bright moon

58
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,480
can’t be controlled but can perish the world.

59
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,840
In this unrestrained gambling of the universe,

60
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,800
I must make a last desperate effort.

61
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,940
Is there any other chip in his hands?

62
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,710
"Xuanji Palace"

63
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,260
Mi loves drinking osmanthus wine.

64
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,039
I made some recently.

65
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,299
You came at the right time.

66
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:06,320
I’m just going to drink this pot of wine tonight.

67
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,820
Thank you.

68
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,980
Do you remember

69
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,960
I drank the first drop of wine

70
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,800
with you?

71
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,060
Come.

72
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,220
Hurry up.

73
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,280
Hurry up.

74
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,860
What is this?

75
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,900
This is wine.

76
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,960
I want to drink it.

77
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,620
You’re too young to drink it.

78
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,640
I want it.

79
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,640
Drink a little bit.

80
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,020
Look up.

81
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,140
Is it good?

82
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,320
Is it good?

83
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,380
Give it to me.

84
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:13,940
No.

85
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,860
No.

86
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,980
-Give it to me.
-No.

87
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,960
I was your shadow

88
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,660
in our childhood.

89
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,540
We fought together after we grew up.

90
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,940
We were really care-free in those days.

91
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,240
Those good memories for you

92
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,140
may just be

93
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,780
nightmares for me.

94
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,760
Xu. Xu.

95
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,560
Your Highness, what happened?

96
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,400
Get up. Don’t cry.

97
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,600
Don’t cry, Your Highness.

98
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,920
Don’t cry.

99
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,920
What did you do?

100
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,020
I,

101
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,500
I just didn’t want the fire to hurt him.

102
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:31,960
Mother.

103
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,660
Mother.

104
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,860
Come here.

105
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,580
Mother.

106
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,520
Mother.

107
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,240
I will protect him in the future.

108
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,700
I won't hurt him.

109
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,180
Mother, I beg you.

110
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,000
Let go.

111
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,640
Let me out, Mother.

112
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,200
Let me out, Mother.

113
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,280
Mother.

114
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,520
Let me out, Mother.

115
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,480
Let me out, Mother.

116
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,920
From that day on,

117
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,520
I knew I must be cautious in the Heaven Realm.

118
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,220
I’m sorry.

119
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,220
Tomorrow is the wedding day of Jin Mi and me.

120
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,220
You’re not here

121
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,020
to recall the past late in my Xuanji Palace, right?

122
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,140
Promise me

123
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,300
not to do anything

124
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,000
you may regret tomorrow.

125
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,640
I’ll give you whatever you want.

126
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,480
Jin Mi.

127
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,220
You know I didn’t mean Jin Mi.

128
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,240
Xu Feng,

129
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,060
I have nothing

130
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,780
and want only Jin Mi.

131
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,520
I gave you anything

132
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,800
since I was young.

133
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,060
But I won’t give up

134
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,620
this time.

135
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,180
Do you have to do that?

136
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,900
Don’t you care about parental upbringing

137
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,420
and brotherhood?

138
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,660
If not,

139
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,260
how can I keep the one I care about?

140
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,840
So you’ll do that

141
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,980
at the cost of everything?

142
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,600
Get everything

143
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,980
or lose everything.

144
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,900
I’ve had it too long.

145
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,540
You know

146
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,780
I won’t turn a blind eye to it.

147
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,660
I’d like to

148
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,060
invite you to the wedding of Jin Mi and me

149
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,360
tomorrow.

150
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,060
You and I are good brothers.

151
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,340
I really don’t want to

152
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,400
see us get there.

153
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,440
Let me repeat it last time.

154
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,180
You can take everything

155
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,660
except Jin Mi.

156
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you,

157
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,300
but

158
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,020
I don’t need charity.

159
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,180
Good wine.

160
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,340
What can I do for you

161
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,780
before your wedding day?

162
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,900
Yan You,

163
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,500
are you willing to

164
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,140
follow me to that path

165
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,520
and complete our mother’s wishes together tomorrow?

166
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,380
It seems that you insist on

167
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,140
taking a road of no return.

168
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,580
I’m sorry but I cannot keep you company.

169
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,920
You refuse me

170
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,920
because you fear failures, right?

171
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,980
I fear nothing

172
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,600
in the world.

173
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,340
Both of us actually

174
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,500
fear the same thing.

175
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,280
We’re afraid of being abandoned.

176
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,340
In order not to be abandoned,

177
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,080
I chose to be obedient

178
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,940
and you chose to be cynical formerly.

179
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,720
But I know you’re not such a man.

180
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,860
You face the world jokingly

181
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,400
because you don’t dare to have wild wishes

182
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,080
and you’re afraid that

183
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,840
even if you spare no pains

184
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,340
to strive for it,

185
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,000
you’ll still fail.

186
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,020
Don’t act like you know me well.

187
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,460
I’m here to tell you

188
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,080
I won’t attend the wedding tomorrow.

189
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,920
The reason why I won’t keep you company anymore

190
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,920
is that we have our own rules

191
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,920
and I don’t agree with you.

192
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,760
You always think you know me well

193
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,760
and know everything well.

194
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,380
In fact, you know yourself least.

195
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,200
If anything happens tomorrow,

196
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,280
I’ll take care of Li.

197
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,200
Daddy.

198
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,680
Jin Mi.

199
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,220
When in the mortal world, you promised to marry me.

200
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,660
Will you keep your promise?

201
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,660
I’ll keep my promise.

202
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:22,840
Get up.

203
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,660
Go. Go.

204
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,460
Xu Feng.

205
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,200
There isn’t such a happy event in Floral Realm

206
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,320
in tens of thousands of years.

207
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,660
I’m kind of not used to it.

208
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,660
I’ve finally lived up to the great trust of the late lord.

209
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,400
It isn’t a good match.

210
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,550
What a pity.

211
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,380
What a pity.

212
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,440
It is not a pity!

213
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,280
Now you’re Water Immortal.

214
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,020
How can you kneel before us?

215
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,760
She is expressing her gratitude.

216
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,380
Jin Mi, get up.

217
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,710
It’s inconvenient for us to send you there

218
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,480
due to the former resentment
between Floral Realm and Heaven Realm.

219
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,580
As the brother of the Heavenly Empress,

220
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,580
Moon Immortal will escort you and
preside over the wedding ceremony in person.

221
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,480
It shows that Heaven Realm
doesn’t look down upon you.

222
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,320
Chief Peony and other Chiefs.

223
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,640
Thank you for protecting

224
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,640
and taking care of me

225
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,740
for so many years.

226
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,400
I was ignorant before.

227
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,960
As long as you’re safe and happy,

228
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,260
we will be relieved.

229
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,580
If Night Immortal doesn’t treat you well

230
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,500
or you’re bullied in Heaven Realm,

231
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,960
you can come back and live here.

232
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,900
Yes.

233
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,200
Even if you’re happy, you can also come back often.

234
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,820
I’ll roast the rabbit for you.

235
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,340
Take good care of yourself.

236
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,040
It’s time to get changed.

237
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,320
You must be very beautiful in the wedding dress.

238
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,880
I’ll come in first.

239
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,530
Jin Mi.

240
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,320
Jin Mi.

241
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,220
Xu Feng has given you Phoenix Hairpin.

242
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,800
Do you really have no regrets?

243
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,580
Fox Fairy,

244
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,060
please help me give it back to Phoenix.

245
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,560
Jin Mi, how can you be so fickle and unfaithful,

246
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,140
shift your love to another person

247
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,740
and kick down the ladder?

248
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,940
What can poor Xu Feng do?

249
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,960
You love the new and loathe the old.

250
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,700
It’s time for the couple to come to the hall.

251
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,580
<i>The left hand controls the earth, </i>

252
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,460
<i>and the right hand controls the heaven.</i>

253
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,960
<i>The palm print cracks lighting from all directions.</i>

254
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:33,500
<i>After the flying time is converted into year,</i>

255
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,620
<i>3,000 years disappear.</i>

256
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,810
<i>The left hand pinches a flower, </i>

257
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,520
<i>and the right hand wields a sword.</i>

258
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,780
<i>Thousands of years of snow
drops between the eyebrows.</i>

259
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,260
<i>A tear...</i>

260
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,200
Where is Xu Feng?

261
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,500
How come I didn’t see him?

262
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,820
The wedding of Night Immortal and Water Immortal

263
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,180
is a great event of Heaven Realm.

264
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,800
I think the Empyrean Cloud Palace must be crowded.

265
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,060
My nephew Xu Feng must have been

266
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,620
blocked on the way to the wedding.

267
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,200
How about waiting for him?

268
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,820
The auspicious time can’t be delayed.

269
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,180
Never mind.

270
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,100
Let’s begin.

271
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:27,940
Father.

272
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,840
You brought me up

273
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,500
and taught me.

274
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,060
What’s more,

275
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,000
you granted this marriage to me.

276
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,220
I’d like to express my gratitude to you

277
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,960
with Sparkling Aqua-essence.

278
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,700
What a filial son!

279
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,320
The wedding begins.

280
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,140
Worship the heaven.

281
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,380
Wait a moment.

282
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
The classical opera is so true.

283
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,980
Mr. Right will surely grab a bride.

284
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,360
Father.

285
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,700
Xu Feng, what are you going to do?

286
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,580
You still didn’t listen to me.

287
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,720
You will certainly fail.

288
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,480
If you insist,

289
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,580
the Empyrean Cloud Palace will

290
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,580
be daubed with blood of
innocent officers and soldiers.

291
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,580
Give it up.

292
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,400
I’ll try my best to help you get Father’s pardon.

293
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,820
Your Highness,

294
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,000
our men are ambushed by Fire Immortal.

295
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,900
Lord Liaoyuan,

296
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,720
tell me what happened outside.

297
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,400
Your Majesty,

298
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,720
the 100,000 heaven troops
of Night Immortal wait in ambush

299
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,320
outside the Empyrean Cloud Palace.

300
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,760
As long as the proper time arrives,

301
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,380
Night Immortal will beat a drum ordering them
to capture the Empyrean Cloud Palace.

302
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,220
Is what he said true?

303
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,240
Your Three-Direction Heaven Troops

304
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,520
have been disarmed by me.

305
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,200
Your Majesty, I’m here to save you.

306
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,820
Run Yu, I’ll give you a chance to defend yourself.

307
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,180
What else can you say?

308
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,540
Nothing.

309
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,790
When a mantis is trying to catch a cicada,

310
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,080
a canary is behind it.

311
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,520
Winner takes all and loser makes only one mistake.

312
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,520
You’re always smarter than me

313
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,460
and your merit and tactics are greater than mine.

314
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,300
I don’t understand why
you take this road of no return.

315
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,280
I have a clear conscience.

316
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,020
Run Yu,

317
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,280
I placed great hopes on you

318
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,160
and never expected that

319
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,620
you’re such an unfaithful and unjust rebel.

320
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,350
Today numerous immortals are present.

321
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,310
With ironclad evidence,

322
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,400
If I don’t punish you,

323
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,740
how can I explain to the six realms?

324
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,480
Father,

325
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,700
although Run Yu made a great mistake,

326
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,460
luckily he didn’t lead to a disaster.

327
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,080
Please be generous and forgive him.

328
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,800
Enough.

329
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,400
All the heaven troops, listen to my orders.

330
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,400
Escort this unfaithful and unjust rebel

331
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,080
to Pisuo Jail right now.

332
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,220
You’re an unfaithful, unjust and unfilial man.

333
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,000
How can you ask others to be so?

334
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,640
To ascend the throne,

335
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,460
you killed your brother,

336
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,220
dumped Floral Immortal,

337
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,940
married an evil woman, insulted my mother
and abandoned your own son,

338
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,600
while my brother

339
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,480
always wanted to take my wife.

340
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,260
The mortals think the heaven is the best place,

341
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,920
but they don’t know

342
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,820
this is the dirtiest, cruelest place of hypocrisy

343
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,320
in the six realms.

344
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,820
Shut up.

345
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,560
Father.

346
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,300
Tell me

347
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,080
what I drank just now.

348
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,300
Just some Evil Incense Ashes.

349
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,960
You’ll be lacking in strength for only four hours.

350
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,060
You…

351
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,480
Run Yu, I know you’re deep,

352
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,060
but I didn’t expect

353
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,860
you can be so heartless and cruel.

354
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,860
Heartless and cruel?

355
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,540
When His Majesty killed his brother,

356
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,640
allowed the dethroned Heavenly
Empress to kill Floral Immortal,

357
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,140
insulted and killed my mother
and wiped out the Arowana Family,

358
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,140
wasn’t he heartless and cruel?

359
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,380
What happened today

360
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,420
is just the natural retribution.

361
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,600
What I did

362
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,560
doesn’t seek to live up to the heaven and the earth,

363
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,680
but I have a clear conscience

364
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,920
and live up to the upbringing of my late mother.

365
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,900
Upbringing.

366
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,780
Even if you hate Father,

367
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,800
he also brought you up.

368
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,360
Winner takes all.

369
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,800
I fear no death.

370
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,860
Escort Night Immortal.

371
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,600
You such rebellious ministers and villains.

372
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,880
Don’t you fear the wrath of heaven?

373
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,880
Heavenly Emperor and the
dethroned Heavenly Empress lack virtue.

374
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,600
Now

375
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,120
His Highness Night Immortal has disclosed the crime of Heavenly Emperor

376
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,600
at the risk of the criticism of the six realms.

377
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,440
This is the good fortune of Heaven Realm.

378
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,280
Now it’s time for Heaven Realm
to destroy the old and establish the new.

379
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,670
We are willing to enthrone Night Immortal

380
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,360
to solve the chaos and build
prestige of Heaven Realm again.

381
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,200
We’re willing to pledge loyalty to Night Immortal.

382
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,200
We’re willing to pledge loyalty to Night Immortal.

383
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,260
How,

384
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,400
how dare you betray me!

385
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,040
Heavenly Emperor and the
dethroned Heavenly Empress are brutal

386
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,040
and all immortals and Buddha
have a grudge against them.

387
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,400
Fire Immortal, don’t you understand?

388
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,100
Yin Que, how dare you
act in collusion with Night Immortal!

389
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,780
I’ll get rid of you today.

390
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,220
Someone,

391
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,060
capture Fire Immortal and his men.

392
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,360
OK.

393
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,960
Take care of His Majesty.

394
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:58,900
Lord Liaoyuan.

395
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,900
Lord Liaoyuan.

396
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,460
I can’t

397
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,020
protect you anymore.

398
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,380
Xu Feng, If there is an afterlife,

399
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,620
I wish I could exist without you.

400
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,240
Jin Mi.

401
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,700
Jin Mi, save me.

402
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,880
Save me.

403
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,100
Jin Mi, save me.

404
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,760
Jin Mi.

405
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,300
Jin Mi.

406
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,560
Xu Feng!

407
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,040
Why?

408
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,780
Why?

409
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,860
You know it!

410
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,600
You killed my dad

411
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,100
and Auntie Lin Xiu!

412
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,700
Xu Feng!

413
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,580
Have you

414
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,440
loved me?

415
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,260
Never.

416
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,440
Xu Feng!

417
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,060
As expected, you attached my hair

418
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,740
to the essence of Internal Dan.

419
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,020
Jin Mi,

420
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,620
I’ll kill you.
