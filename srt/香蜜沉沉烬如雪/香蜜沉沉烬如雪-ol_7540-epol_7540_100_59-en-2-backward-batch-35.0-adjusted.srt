00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
"Episode 59"

3
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:44,800
Let go of me.

4
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,970
Let go of me.

5
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,070
What are you doing?

6
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:48,620
Don’t move.

7
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,050
What?

8
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:52,900
What do you want?

9
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,150
Let go of me.

10
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,400
Mi, listen.

11
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,600
I will never let go of you.

12
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,470
The wedding ceremony will be held

13
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,720
as scheduled.

14
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,920
Are you crazy? You...

15
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,350
Mi,

16
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,420
I will never ever let you leave me.

17
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,720
Xu Feng, you are in low spirit.

18
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,700
Haven’t you made the decision?

19
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,620
So many years have passed.

20
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,970
Xu Feng, don’t you want to

21
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,670
find out the truth?

22
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,220
Don’t you want to know

23
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,620
who is the culprit

24
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,270
who killed Water Immortal
and cast the blame on you,

25
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,770
making you suffer a lot?

26
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,300
Sometimes the closer you are to the truth,

27
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,050
the more dreadful you will feel.

28
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,550
Xu Feng, so you are clear in your mind.

29
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,570
In Heaven Realm,

30
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,900
I used to hate injustice like poison

31
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,300
and distinguish things as either black or white.

32
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,020
In order to find out the
assassin who intended to kill me

33
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,800
and cast the blame on Run Yu,

34
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,500
I also took some means.

35
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,170
But I didn’t expect that

36
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,070
behind that case,

37
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,650
there were so many people involved.

38
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,320
Yan You,

39
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,870
Rat Fairy,

40
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,020
Su Li, Water Immortal

41
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,820
and even the entire Water
Family in the Dongting Lake,

42
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,650
they all were involved.

43
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,020
Even my father and my mother were also involved.

44
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,570
Even if I find out the truth,

45
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,450
what benefit will it bring about?

46
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,070
Thee husband and the wife quarreled.

47
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,250
Brothers fought against each other.

48
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,780
The father and the son became enemies.

49
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,860
Endless revenges...

50
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,070
In that shocking gamble in Heaven Realm,

51
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,720
nobody is the winner.

52
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,300
But the misdeed is the misdeed.

53
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,720
Someone must pay for his or her misdeeds.

54
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,500
Water Immortal and Wind Immortal were killed.

55
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,200
And you are wronged.

56
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,820
If you let the real murderer get away,

57
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,950
I am afraid that she will take chances

58
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,200
and kill more innocent people.

59
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,770
You are right.

60
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,550
I’m too soft-hearted.

61
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,670
No.

62
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,550
you can’t see it clearly because
you are involved in this matter.

63
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,720
She has always been affectionate to you.

64
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,650
I know it’s really hard

65
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,950
to make the decision.

66
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,020
But I’m really very sorry to ask you for this favor,

67
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,100
which may bring you troubles and inconvenience.

68
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,000
I really feel guilty in front of
Mu Ci and King of Bian City.

69
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,500
You regarded me as an outsider again.

70
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,570
Mu Ci and my father
have always been open-minded.

71
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,370
They don’t see things at superficial level.

72
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,720
Xu Feng, don’t worry.

73
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:01,540
What's more,

74
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,740
the fake one can't turn into the true one.

75
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,920
This is a golden rule especially in Demon Realm.

76
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,770
Not everyone can pass the test

77
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,170
of the heart-testing stone.

78
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,320
Xu Feng,

79
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,620
after our wedding,

80
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,620
I will manage to cure your
autophagy pain caused by the Golden Elixir

81
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,720
even if I have to fight against
all the people of Heaven Realm.

82
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,970
Your Highness, you are so beautiful.

83
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,620
Nobody can compare with you.

84
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,400
Tomorrow you must pass the heart-testing stone,

85
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,320
proving that you and my Lord are a perfect match.

86
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
What heart-testing stone?

87
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,020
Xu Feng,

88
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,300
don’t blame me.

89
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,250
I believe that we love each other.

90
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,300
But love

91
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,900
can't stand any test.

92
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,320
Lord Puchi.

93
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,900
How come even the summon spell
doesn’t work now?

94
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,770
Congratulations, your Majesty.

95
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,020
You got the wrong person.

96
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,650
There is no Heavenly Empress here.

97
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,670
Today is the wedding day of His Majesty and you.

98
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,500
You deserve this title.

99
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,900
Congratulations, your Majesty.

100
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,870
In all over the six realms,

101
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,970
people like His Majesty who is
so loving and faithful are really rare.

102
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,250
I agree.

103
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,070
How can there be such a man in this world

104
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,700
who is so good to a girl?

105
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,120
If any,

106
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,420
it’s just an illusion.

107
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,000
The so-called infatuation

108
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,500
is just fake.

109
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,870
If you don’t have that experience in person,

110
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,700
how can you know the bloodiness

111
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,070
behind the gentleness?

112
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,070
The auspicious moment is coming.

113
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,500
Please dress up, Your Majesty.

114
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,200
If you want to be the Heavenly Empress

115
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,870
then go ahead.

116
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,520
In short,

117
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,650
I won't be the Heavenly Empress.

118
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,720
Your Majesty.

119
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,600
What's going on here?

120
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,800
Your Majesty.

121
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,020
It’s OK.

122
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,300
You may leave.

123
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,800
I want to talk to Water Immortal alone.

124
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,900
Yes, Your Majesty

125
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,000
Everything is OK. You may go.

126
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Go. Go. Go.

127
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,370
I’m here now.

128
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,770
Why don’t you welcome me yourself?

129
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,500
My beauty,

130
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,020
you shouldn’t be so indifferent to me

131
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,020
by taking advantage of my love for you.

132
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,550
My beauty,

133
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,770
you should know that

134
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,070
Heavenly Emperor can take many concubines

135
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,750
except the Heavenly Empress

136
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,320
My beauty,

137
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,570
look at me carefully.

138
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,370
Is there any differences?

139
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,120
You are so stubborn.

140
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,320
Then let me train you,

141
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,220
My beauty.

142
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,050
Okay.

143
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,720
Your Majesty,

144
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,070
let me serve you well.

145
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,200
Have you played enough, Your Majesty?

146
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,420
So you have already found it’s me.

147
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,370
Of course.

148
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,850
Do you think your acting performance is good?

149
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,820
Jin Mi,

150
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,370
I was summoned

151
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,950
by your grievance last night.

152
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,070
I have been wakeful all night because of you .

153
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,450
You have no idea how sly Run Yu is.

154
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,070
Alright.

155
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,200
Even Dan Zhu’s instrument doesn’t work anymore.

156
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,600
I have risked my life to save you.

157
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,000
Are you going to keep treating me like this?

158
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,300
Alright. Alright.

159
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,620
You really have no conscience.

160
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,920
Lord Puchi,

161
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,770
I will never ever forget

162
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,750
the big favor you did me.

163
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,600
Are you satisfied now?

164
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,370
I’m sad now.

165
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,570
Enough.

166
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,220
I haven't asked you yet.

167
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,500
How did you manage to slip in?

168
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,170
He’s smart,

169
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,270
but I’m smarter than him.

170
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,320
Did you steal this under his nose?

171
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,350
It took me so much effort.

172
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,720
Run Yu is still a night owl

173
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,520
even though he has become Heavenly Emperor.

174
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,750
I had no solution

175
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,970
but to wait until he fell asleep.

176
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,070
I almost fell asleep when I was waiting.

177
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,570
When the dawn broke,

178
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:52,770
he finally fell asleep,

179
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,850
which providing a chance for me to take it.

180
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Can you change back and then talk to me?

181
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,400
You are wearing this face talking to me.

182
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,000
It’s very awkward.

183
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,950
Really?

184
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,050
I also think so.

185
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,650
I’m the most handsome
man in all over the six realms.

186
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,020
Enough?

187
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,100
I have you remind you.

188
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,350
Kuang Lu is very clever.

189
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,300
No more delay.

190
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,720
Let's hurry back to Floral Realm.

191
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,320
Jin Mi, wait a moment.

192
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,150
Where are you going?

193
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,120
What are you doing?

194
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,470
Hurry up.

195
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,700
No.

196
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,450
What a nuisance!

197
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,700
Let’s go.

198
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,400
Your Majesty,

199
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,850
Why are you here?

200
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,320
Has everything at the Empyrean Cloud Palace

201
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,200
been arranged in order?

202
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,150
You,

203
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,000
you have gone back to the Xuanji Palace

204
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,450
to see Water Immortal, haven’t you?

205
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,970
Why are you here now, Your Majesty?

206
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,470
Today’s big His Majesty’s wedding day.

207
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,920
Keep your spirit high, brothers.

208
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,470
Yes.

209
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:28,950
Yes.

210
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,950
Hello, bros.

211
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,520
Hi. Hi. Hi.

212
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,670
Happy wedding day, Your Majesty and Miss Immortal.

213
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,700
May you guys share my happiness.

214
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,250
Today's my wedding day.

215
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,550
May you guys share my happiness.

216
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,900
Here are the red packets for you.

217
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,570
One for each.

218
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,770
One for each. Take it.

219
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,250
There is much power inside.

220
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:47,800
Keep it safe.

221
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:48,650
Take it. Take it.

222
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,220
Thank you, Your Majesty.

223
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,150
Take it.

224
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:50,620
Thank you, Your Majesty.

225
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,970
Help me give out these red packets.

226
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,050
What trick are you playing?

227
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,120
What?

228
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,270
Today is our wedding day.

229
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,570
I’m happy.

230
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,650
Well,

231
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,950
Today is my wedding day.

232
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,120
Why do you guys look so upset?

233
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,700
I’m happy.

234
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,250
And you have to be happy, too.

235
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,570
If I’m in good mood,

236
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,770
I’ll give rewards to you all.

237
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,570
It’s the wedding convention of our Floral Realm.

238
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,070
Just take it.

239
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,970
Thank you, Your Majesty. Thank you, Miss Immortal.

240
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,570
Thank you, Your Majesty. Thank you, Miss Immortal.

241
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,750
The wedding ceremony of me and
Water Immortal is going to be held tonight.

242
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,400
Please work your shifts carefully.

243
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,750
I definitely won’t treat you badly.

244
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Please be assured, Your Majesty.

245
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,550
We will do our best

246
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,900
to guarantee the peace and safety in Heaven Realm.

247
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,670
lord Po Jun,

248
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,599
those bad guys of Demon Realm

249
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:46,150
can take all means available
in order to get what they want.

250
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,650
Someone may change their shape into mine

251
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,750
and come here

252
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,250
to deceive you guys.

253
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,900
Yes, Your Majesty. I got it.

254
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:55,900
Your Majesty,

255
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,600
are you okay?

256
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,250
You hit me so hard.

257
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,700
It’s a flirting trick.

258
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,920
The fool is coming.

259
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,100
He’s coming.

260
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,170
I borrowed Water Immortal

261
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,350
to explore the essence of spiritual practice.

262
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,120
Yan You!

263
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,550
I’m dead!

264
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,650
Where is Water Immortal?

265
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,200
How dare you!

266
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,700
How dare you pretend to be His Majesty.

267
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,920
Take him down.

268
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:46,620
How dare you!

269
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,220
Can’t you even recognize me?

270
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,320
His Majesty has the natural treasure, mermen tears.

271
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,570
How do you prove that
you are the real Heavenly Emperor?

272
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,500
Can you only recognize the merman tears?

273
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,550
Can’t you recognize my Red Clouds Sword?

274
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,570
I’m guilty, Your Majesty.

275
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,020
A villain pretended to be you

276
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,300
and took away Water Immortal.

277
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,650
I didn’t notice it. I’m guilty.

278
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,520
How long has it been since they left?

279
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,850
About one hour.

280
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,400
Come with me.

281
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

282
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,370
I won’t marry him.

283
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,100
That's the whole story.

284
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,900
What?

285
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,670
It’s really hard to judge a person’s
true nature from his or her appearance.

286
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,820
A bad bamboo can’t produce good bamboo shoots.

287
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,770
The new Heavenly Emperor

288
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,170
is even better at scheming than
the past Heavenly Emperor Tai Wei.

289
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:44,900
Jin Mi,

290
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,600
we will definitely try our best to protect you.

291
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,550
But I’m afraid that the news about
your running away won’t be kept for long.

292
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,450
We must make plans early.

293
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,570
Run Yu won't hurt me.

294
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,970
Now the most urgent matter

295
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:56,970
is to find Hairy Feather

296
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,470
to cure Xu Feng’s autophagy pain
caused by the Golden Elixir.

297
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,450
Hairy Feather grows near the lake.

298
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,700
Let Mr. Hu take you there.

299
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,100
Bad news!

300
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,300
The Heavenly Emperor and the soldiers

301
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,370
are coming.

302
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,770
So early.

303
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,550
We should never let Jin Mi
be at his control again.

304
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,400
Take Jin Mi,

305
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,650
and run away through the back hall.

306
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,850
I will deal with things outside.

307
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,900
OK.

308
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,550
Let’s go.

309
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,250
Go.

310
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,500
Go. Go.

311
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,670
Go.

312
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,100
I didn’t know you were coming here, Your Majesty.

313
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,400
Sorry for not having welcome you in time.

314
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,370
Chief Peony, you have been safe and sound.

315
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,400
How come you are here now, Your Majesty?

316
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,450
Today I’m here for two things.

317
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,370
One is

318
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,470
to take Mi back to finish our wedding ceremony.

319
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,550
The other

320
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,550
is to invite the floral chiefs

321
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,070
to go to the Empyrean Heaven and
attend our wedding ceremony as the witnesses.

322
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,470
What?

323
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,300
Jin Mi is not in Heaven Realm?

324
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,570
Mi is tempted by someone.

325
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,570
She came here to get the herb Hairy Feather

326
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,820
for that demon, Xu Feng.

327
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,950
What?

328
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,570
Haven’t you seen her, Chief Peony?

329
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,520
Our young master is missing
because of your poor supervision.

330
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,720
We haven’t accused you yet.

331
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,150
How come you are here
to ask us to give you Jin Mi.

332
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,600
You don’t know the twists and turns
and misunderstandings

333
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,600
in this matter.

334
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,470
But I don't want this trivial matter

335
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,670
to affect our relationship.

336
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,670
Misunderstanding?

337
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,400
Your Majesty, you led this well-armed soldiers

338
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,220
and came here directly

339
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,070
to disturb the peace of our Floral Realm.

340
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,900
I’m terrified.

341
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,000
I don't know what is the
misunderstanding in this matter.

342
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,400
It’s a matter of expediency.

343
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,220
Sorry for having been rude.

344
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,870
The wedding today

345
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,270
has been proclaimed in all over the six realms.

346
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,320
Jin Mi

347
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,100
is the Heavenly Empress
recognized by people all over the world.

348
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,200
I hope that you will take
the overall interests into account

349
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,020
and look for Jin Mi with us.

350
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,820
This is just the story from your side,

351
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,420
Your Majesty.

352
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,670
Jin Mi is not an ignorant child.

353
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,250
If she leaves,

354
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,100
there must be some reason for it.

355
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,550
If you

356
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:20,800
insist on siding with Jin Mi regardless of her mistake,

357
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,920
then don’t blame me for being rude.

358
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,420
You!

359
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:31,670
How dare you!

360
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:33,920
Your Majesty,

361
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,670
this is Floral Realm.

362
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,400
Floral Realm has always been

363
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,220
an indispensable part of Heaven Realm

364
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,700
since the very beginning of this world.

365
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,150
The past Heavenly Emperor was lenient,
and the past Floral Immortal died early

366
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,420
so that the power has been
transferred into others’ hands.

367
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,270
You have intervened in the affairs
beyond your duties for several thousand years.

368
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,500
Have you forgot the rule
of superiority and inferiority?

369
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,020
We are just doing what is required
by the past Floral Immortal.

370
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,720
We didn’t...

371
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:55,870
Your Majesty,

372
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,020
then what do you want us to do?

373
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,070
You should learn how to be a subordinate.

374
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,820
You’d better pray that Jin Mi

375
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,200
will become the Heavenly Empress smoothly.

376
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,450
Only in this way

377
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,070
can you guarantee the peace in Floral Realm.

378
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,120
-Don’t get inside.
-Don’t get inside.

379
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:50,950
Show up.

380
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,650
You have crossed me in everything.

381
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,500
Don’t you feel guilty in front of
our mother who has passed away?

382
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,170
Run Yu,

383
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,900
I really don't want you

384
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,100
to keep doing wrong anymore.

385
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,620
Where is Jin Mi?

386
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,270
She has left Flower Realm.

387
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,070
She’s gone.

388
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,620
Don’t you believe me?

389
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,250
If she had left,

390
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,000
she wouldn’t have left you here to stop me.

391
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:30,720
Give it to me.

392
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,320
What?

393
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,970
What did you steal from me?

394
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,470
Whether you can get it or not

395
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,670
depends on your ability, Your Majesty.

396
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,000
Fairy Shangyuan,

397
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,720
I heard that Water Immortal
had run away this morning.

398
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,820
Is the wedding ceremony
going to be held as scheduled?

399
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,470
As scheduled.

400
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,670
Yes.

401
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,500
Jin Mi.

402
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:31,650
Lian Qiao.

403
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,650
How come you are here?

404
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,750
I am looking for Hairy Feather.

405
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,820
I can’t find it anywhere. Why?

406
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,700
Hairy Feather?

407
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,450
Is it that?

408
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:41,600
What?

409
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,950
Are you looking for the thing

410
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,620
that looks like a small umbrella

411
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,020
and also kind of look like feathers?

412
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,900
Yes. Yes. That’s it.

413
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,750
Have you seen it? Where is it?

414
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,220
Jin Mi,

415
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,260
a few days ago,

416
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,570
my mother picked all the herbs

417
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,170
to make mutton dumplings for me.

418
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,300
What?

419
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,970
Do you know that it can save people’s life?

420
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,820
If you wants to eat mutton dumplings,

421
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,620
you can put spring onions

422
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,570
or carrots in the dumplings.

423
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,620
Why did you put Hairy Feather?

424
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,770
I don’t like spring onions.

425
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,950
And Mr. Hu wouldn’t let me eat carrots.

426
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,670
It’s a reckless waste.

427
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,600
I’m anxious to...

428
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,100
What should we do now, Jin Mi?

429
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:16,850
Don't touch me.

430
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,920
Don't blame her.

431
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,320
It’s not late to plant it now.

432
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:21,900
Mr. Hu.

433
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:22,650
How?

434
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,350
Mi. Mi.

435
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,670
Mr. Hu, where is the Hairy Feather?

436
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,000
It hasn’t been planted yet.

437
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,450
You...

438
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,370
Well, you guys protect me.

439
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,320
I’ll plant it now.

440
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,200
OK.

441
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:46,720
Come.

442
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,170
Honghong,

443
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,020
I heard that the Heavenly Emperor

444
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,600
had cast an escape proof net in Floral Realm

445
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,620
to look for Little one.

446
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,670
Don't panic. Yan You is stopping him.

447
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,100
I couldn’t stop him.

448
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,050
You!

449
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,850
Mi,

450
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,300
it seems that he is determined

451
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,170
to take you back this time.

452
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,050
Can you buy one hour for me?

453
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,970
Yes, we can.

454
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,120
We’ll try our best to stop him.

455
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,050
Honghong,

456
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,870
we all count on you this time.

457
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,570
I haven’t shown my real power for long time.

458
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,870
Let me have a try.

459
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,570
OK. Try it.

460
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,450
It’s Attached Love.

461
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,100
Honghong,

462
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,020
I haven’t seen this amazing magic
of yours for six thousand years.

463
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,350
The best steel should be
used to make the knife’s edge.

464
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,800
You are still very powerful.

465
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,600
Run Yu can’t break this ward

466
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,050
within three hours with his present power.

467
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,800
Mi, don’t worry. Just focus on planting the herb.

468
00:27:59,150 --> 00:27:59,570
OK.

469
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,120
Lord Puchi,

470
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,470
you stay here protecting Jin Mi.

471
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,050
We three are to distract
the attention of those soldiers.

472
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:08,980
No more delay.

473
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,540
Let’s go.

474
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,320
Go.

475
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,620
Hurry.

476
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,620
General, I didn’t find her.

477
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:45,620
Go get him.

478
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:47,670
Stop.

479
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,850
Your Majesty,

480
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,900
Water Immortal is not here.

481
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,870
You may go.

482
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:56,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

483
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,150
Set up the battle formations.

484
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,900
It’s just a small trick.

485
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,470
Uncle.

486
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:07,700
Your Majesty,

487
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,920
if you still regard me as your uncle,

488
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,300
then listen to me.

489
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,650
Let go of her.

490
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,850
Uncle,

491
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,250
if you still regard me as the Heavenly Emperor,

492
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,700
then don't intervene in this matter.

493
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,300
Mi,

494
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,370
actually, I owe you an apology.

495
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,620
Why?

496
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,400
To be honest,

497
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,400
I am the adopted son of

498
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,350
Run Yu’s biological mother, Lord Dongting.

499
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,100
No wonder,

500
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,900
no wonder I always feel that

501
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,300
there is some connection that is hard to explain

502
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,670
between you and Run Yu.

503
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,670
Now I see.

504
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,550
I was raised up by my foster mother.

505
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,800
The time when I stayed with her

506
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,900
is much longer than the
time when Run Yu stayed with her.

507
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,820
At the beginning,

508
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,100
in order to take revenge on the Heavenly Empress,

509
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,000
she attempted to hurt Xu Feng many times.

510
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,820
In order to repay her,

511
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,520
I had to do many misdeeds against my conscience.

512
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,220
I did make use of you at the beginning.

513
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,450
I induced you to attend the
birthday banquet of Heavenly Empress.

514
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,170
But I really didn't expect that

515
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,120
it would get you involved in
such a dangerous situation.

516
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,150
The terrible things that happened later,

517
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,700
no mater those are artificial or destined,

518
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,370
are not what I want.

519
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,050
Sorry, Mi.

520
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,470
I guess it’s too late for my apology.

521
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,220
If it were in the past,

522
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,400
I definitely wouldn’t forgive you.

523
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,820
But after going through all these things,

524
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,020
I gradually find that

525
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,670
things are not simply black or white.

526
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,770
And nothing is constant.

527
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,180
I'll never forget

528
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,420
how you protect me and Rou Rou from Qiong Qi.

529
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,350
You are always my benefactor.

530
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,670
You are my friend.

531
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,500
You were my friend.

532
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,420
You are my friend.

533
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,719
And in the future you will still be my friend.

534
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,350
Mi,

535
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,370
now that we have confessed to each other,

536
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,320
can our relationship be closer now?

537
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
I have made matches

538
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,320
for people for several thousand years.

539
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,170
I come to realize

540
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,050
that nothing forcibly done
is going to be agreeable.

541
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,270
Why are you so stubborn?

542
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,949
The most unreliable thing in the world

543
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:02,000
is people’s mind.

544
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:03,719
It changes.

545
00:34:04,449 --> 00:34:05,600
Why should I give up?

546
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,020
People can’t stand being made use of.

547
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,300
Jin Mi doesn’t love you,

548
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,670
not because you can’t compare with Xu Feng,

549
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,860
but because all the
deliberate actions and scheming

550
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,699
can't compare with a pure heart.

551
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,699
Ask yourself.

552
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,250
Throughout your life,

553
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,350
who have you treated with sincerity?

554
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,620
Others may not know my situation at that time.

555
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,170
Don’t you even know that, uncle?

556
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,920
If I had treated others with sincerity,

557
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,750
I would have been doomed
once I made any mistake.

558
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,820
There are not many people like Tu Yao.

559
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,400
If you don’t treat others with sincerity,

560
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,450
how can you expect

561
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,520
others would treat you with sincerity?

562
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,770
Put yourself in my shoes.

563
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,300
Over all these years,

564
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,220
who has really put himself in my shoes?

565
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,520
When I was perplexed and helpless,

566
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,270
who stood out and spoke for me?

567
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,070
Now

568
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,770
none of you has the right

569
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,000
to tell me what to do

570
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,470
and judge me.

571
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:14,850
Jin Mi,

572
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,000
bad news.

573
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,550
What happened, Lian Qiao?

574
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,620
Heavenly Emperor and Moon immortal

575
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,270
are fighting.

576
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,800
It seems Moon Immortal

577
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,900
can’t hold on for long.

578
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,820
Jin Mi.

579
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,070
Lord Puchi,

580
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,700
give this to phoenix.

581
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,900
It’s planted by you.

582
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,300
You should give it to him yourself.

583
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,120
I can't leave.

584
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,850
If I leave,

585
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,050
Floral Realm will be in trouble.

586
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,120
Please.

587
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,200
You!

588
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,470
You are block-headed.

589
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,070
Why do you give up all the snakes for a bird

590
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,800
and then throw yourself into a loong’s arms?

591
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,170
Let me tell you something.

592
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,350
He looks very innocent.

593
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,600
But actually his heart

594
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:16,870
is darker and more turbid than

595
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,000
the mire in the Taihu Lake.

596
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,250
He is wicked, narrow-minded and skeptical.

597
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,200
He always bears grudge against others. He is shrew.

598
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,070
Let me tell you something.

599
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,870
If you go on like this,

600
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,920
you will be at his full control sooner or later.

601
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,350
He will make full use of you.

602
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,220
Go on.

603
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,000
Why don’t you go on?

604
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:48,620
I’m wondering how vicious I am.

605
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:51,700
By the way,

606
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,000
mom’s death day is around the corner.

607
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,350
I’m going to prepare some sacrificial offerings for her.

608
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,750
See you.

609
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,550
If you have cooled down
and horsed around long enough,

610
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,470
then go back with me.

611
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,750
As long as we get married tonight,

612
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,170
everything will be OK.

613
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,920
And I will let bygones be bygones.

614
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,620
Where is she?

615
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,650
My mother called me home for dinner.

616
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,150
You!

617
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:15,900
I’m exhausted.

618
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,550
Are you older than me?

619
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,950
Why do you dally so much every time?

620
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,450
You wasted much time.

621
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,950
Run Yu is hard to deal with.

622
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,020
I had a hard time getting rid of him.

623
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,400
Before I got here,

624
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,420
I had to use cover-up magic along the way

625
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,150
and got rid of several troops of soldiers.

626
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:30,970
It’s really a hard time.

627
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,000
You said you had a hard time.

628
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,120
You are empty-handed.

629
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,420
I had a harder time than you.

630
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,570
I carried her here from Floral Realm.

631
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,920
I’m so tired. My waist almost gave in.

632
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,050
My legs are trembling.

633
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,220
I have never seen a frost flower
that is so heavy before.

634
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,650
What did she eat growing up?

635
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,200
Is she heavy? Let me have a try.

636
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,300
Behave yourself.

637
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,750
Do you want her to marry that devil man or not?

638
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,070
If you delay any longer,

639
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,920
it will be too late.

640
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,350
You are right.

641
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,800
-Boatman, we need to cross the river.
-Okay.

642
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,570
Your Majesty,

643
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,500
we have searched all over the Floral Realm

644
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,400
but we couldn’t find Water Immortal.

645
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,550
Make it proclaimed all over the six realms that

646
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,870
Floral Realm will be blocked from now on.

647
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,820
I will destroy one kind of plant every day

648
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,920
until Jin Mi comes back.

649
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,750
Don’t put any hope into it.

650
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,470
Chief Peony! Chief Peony!

651
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,320
-Chief Peony!
-Peony!

652
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,170
Even if you are gonna to destroy the entire Floral Realm,

653
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,450
we will not let Jin Mi

654
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,570
be at your control.

655
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,900
You attacked me, the Heavenly Emperor.

656
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,500
It’s a capital offense.

657
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,570
Let's start from you tomorrow.
