1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,800
 Eun Dong told me to wait, 

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:15,320
 but Eun Dong never returned. 

3
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,140
 My Love Eun Dong
 Episode 2 

4
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,340
 How was Eun Dong's life for past ten years? 

5
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,620
 The space in my heart for her was alway empty, but 

6
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:00,940
 Eun Dong's face was slowly fading from my memory. 

7
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,760
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

8
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,980
Oh... That...

9
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,600
 Kiddo? Kiddo? 

10
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,940
 Are you okay? Are you coming to your senses? 

11
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,820
 This is Eun Dong. 

12
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,140
♫    How can I meet you again like this?   ♫

13
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,500
Have... You... Been well?

14
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,040
 ♫ The warm memories are coming back out now ♫  

15
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,640
That...
♫   Back in the days we loved  ♫

16
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,020
Have you eaten?

17
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,800
♫   Back to the days we shared  ♫

18
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,520
 Like a dream and like a movie, we met like that again. 

19
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,740
 Like when I met Eun Dong ten years ago. 

20
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:26,060
 Just like that, we met again. 

21
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:42,160


22
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,020
Oppa... I've grown taller, right?

23
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,320
Yeah.

24
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,940
I got prettier, right?

25
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,640
Yeah. Totally.

26
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,240
You are embarrassed aren't you?

27
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,760
- Why would I be embarrassed? 
 -Yeah, you are.

28
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,840
 I always wondered how Eun Dong had changed. 

29
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:35,460
 I never thought I'd feel embarrassed looking at her face. 

30
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,380
 But, the whole time looking at her face, 

31
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,520
 my heart raced like crazy. 

32
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,220
 That little kiddo became a woman and reappeared in my life. 

33
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,460
Then...

34
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,360
Then, you become an actor?

35
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,680
Right, it just happened. That was your dream.

36
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,100
No, I don't watch dramas or movies that much.

37
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,140
Tell me the dramas or movies you are in, so I can search.

38
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,460
Oppa.

39
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:27,740
You know what star in the sky shines the longest?

40
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,300
The latest star.

41
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,540
Are you comforting me?

42
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,780
What about me?

43
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:40,660
- Hey you little kiddo, you acted mature back then and you are still acting mature?
- Yeah.

44
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,060
I don't know about in front of others, but you don't have to act mature with me,

45
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,680
because I am not mature yet.

46
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,340
Oh, the smell! Take it easy on your aftershave!

47
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,520
This little punk...

48
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,440
You've finally gone off the deep end?

49
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,500
Mother, I am so very happy!

50
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,540
- Found her! 
 - Found what?

51
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,960
- Eun Dong!
- What?

52
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,460
- Really? 
 - Stop over there.

53
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,400
Eun Dong!

54
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,200
Hey! Hey!

55
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,340
 Eun Dong! 

56
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,500
How did he find her? So fine...

57
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,720
 Wow! She is killing me. 

58
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,340
Oppa! You're here!

59
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,760
Wow, that kiddo. How did she grow up so fine?

60
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:52,240
- Oppa, faster! 
- Faster!

61
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,120
Hold on tight. 
 ♫   Would I ever get a dazzling girlfriend like that?   ♫

62
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,640
 - Hold on tight! 
 - Yup! 

63
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,180
 Don't let me go again, okay? 

64
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,020
 Okay... 

65
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,980
 After meeting Eun Dong again, I stopped calling the TV program. 

66
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:27,120
 In fact, that program was too old. 

67
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,860
 I even thought like that. 

68
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,660
Hello, my name is Ji Eun Dong.

69
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,360
I am in my fourth year at the City University, studying literature.

70
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,780
From today, to you grandmas and grandpas,

71
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,340
I will teach Korean.

72
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,820
During the class, if you don't fall asleep and study hard,

73
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,920
I'll buy pizza.

74
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,300
Wow!

75
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,780
 The Korean class for the seniors 

76
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,480
was cancelled due to the reconstruction.

77
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,660
But..

78
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,860
That young teacher came to see the city counselor,

79
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,820
so the class was revived.

80
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,100
That young lady is pretty impressive and smart.

81
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,980
Right...

82
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,360
The young lady has solid principle,

83
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,660
volunteering and all...

84
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,200
You, Hyun Soo too, should get some acting work.

85
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,260
I feel bad for you being compared to Lee Seok Tae.

86
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,520
Supervisor Oh, do you know which star shines the most in the sky?

87
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,140
The newest star.

88
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,450
Yes, I am all done.

89
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,900
Oppa, I will submit the report to school and come back. We'll have dinner together, okay?

90
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,680
Ohh... Okay, okay.

91
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,020
Are you okay?

92
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,710
What are you? Were you nearby?

93
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,580
Why are you riding a bike? It's dangerous!

94
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,860
Oppa, where were you?

95
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,820
I am always near you. Heed that!

96
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,890
You are bleeding! Aish!

97
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,380
You stay put!

98
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,600
You still have a scar from that motorcycle accident.

99
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,670
No Oppa. That was gone long ago.

100
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,390
Then what is this?

101
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,300
I frequently fall and get hurt,

102
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,700
so my nick name is QuaDang. (falling sound)

103
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,240
- What? 
 - Funny, isn't it?

104
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,160
Is it funny to you?

105
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,800
You need to be careful.

106
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,910
If you know you fall and get hurt frequently, then you shouldn't be riding a bike! You should use public transportation.

107
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,690
From now on, use the subway or the bus.

108
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,920
You are sweating a lot.

109
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,250
You must have run fast because of me.

110
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,510
Don't ride your bike from tomorrow. It's an order.

111
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,190
I fell in a bus because of the quick stop.

112
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,490
I'll be careful Orabeoni.

113
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,560
I'll take you.

114
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,220
You are currently serving the public, not unemployed.

115
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,470
You are making me nervous.

116
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,490
Were you nervous during the ten years without me?

117
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,560
Of course.

118
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,760
Those ten years felt like a hundred years.

119
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,850
I too, missed you a lot.

120
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,650
I'll take you home.

121
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,390
You are still on duty.

122
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,190
I just finished.

123
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,270
Hello?

124
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,020
Yeah.

125
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,550
No I can't come, I have to go to Mi Sun.

126
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,650
Hello? Hyun Soo?

127
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,050
Did you just hang up? Hello?

128
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,210
Can't you tell me before I ask

129
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,460
how you've been?

130
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,600
After Grandmother passed, I was adopted.

131
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,650
I am sorry, I should have found you already.

132
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:30,030
No, my parents are nice folks.

133
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,600
I am thankful to them.

134
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,990
Yes.

135
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,220
I didn't think you'd leave that way.

136
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,930
I was in the hospital on the day of your grandmother's passing.

137
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,190
The day you disappeared.

138
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,480
So it was...

139
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,390
But why were you in the hospital?

140
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:06,500
I fought thirteen against one and got hurt a little.

141
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,110
Of course you were in the thirteen?

142
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,910
I should have been discharged sooner.

143
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,410
I waited, Oppa.

144
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,080
We met like this again, so all is well.

145
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:04,290


146
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,940
Wow the City University is impressive.

147
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,780
Why are you limping?

148
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,080
Did you sprain your ankle?

149
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,690
No, I am fine.

150
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,710
This won't do, I'll give you a piggyback.

151
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,470
No, I'll return shortly.

152
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,930
No, I'll take you to the door.

153
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,540
No, I am fine.

154
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,950
I can go alone.

155
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,670
You, with an injured ankle,

156
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,950
and this many steps?

157
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,200
No way! Get on.

158
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:11,040
 If I needed to find you, what would I find you with? 

159
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,090
 I'll recognize you just from your back. 

160
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:18,640
 How could you find me just looking at my back? 

161
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,570
 I'll recognize you easily because you have the warmest back in this world. 

162
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,910
It is a bit embarrassing, but it is warm, too.

163
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:46,230
You are a bit heavy,

164
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,350
but it's not hard at all.

165
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,080
I like it, but I'm a bit sorry.

166
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,690
I am curious, but can't ask.

167
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:04,270
If asked, I can answer everything.

168
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,900
You don't have a boyfriend, right?

169
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,100
 Humanity Building 

170
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,150
I'll wait in the car.

171
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,940
Okay.

172
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:03,030
 Eun Dong did not answer, but I knew what it meant. 

173
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,860
 The fact that Eun Dong cannot lie 

174
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,340
 was a resentful moment for me. 

175
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,130
Aish... What bum—

176
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,800
Ah, seriously!

177
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,540
  Imposition of Fine and Objective car being towed   
- Ahh.. What bum— Seriously!

178
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,950
I am going to your house, so come see me.

179
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,530
Ah, this isn't it.

180
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,040
It's me...

181
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,840
What are you doing? Have you eaten?

182
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,110
Aish... We are not elementary kids.

183
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,760
Is it you Eun Dong?

184
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,690
It's me, Oppa.

185
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,240
It is Hyun Soo...

186
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,860
No...

187
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,460
This is Oppa. Oppa.

188
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,540
 Must read Korean modern poetry 222 lines. 

189
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,960
What are you to me? And what am I to you?

190
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,360
Was I just Oppa to you?

191
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,330
Hyun Soo, make some copies please.

192
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,060
Hyun Soo, mine is more urgent.

193
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,960
Wait, this is urgent. Do it fast.

194
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,180
This too.

195
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,000
Hyun Soo...

196
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,650
- Give it to me. 
  - Thank you. 

197
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,910
-  Hyun Soo! 
 - Yes? 

198
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,510
 Please eat! Please eat! 

199
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,600
You have to eat that and don't bother our oppa again, okay?

200
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,430
You must! We'll be watching you.

201
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,640
Oppa!

202
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,710
Oppa!

203
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,510
Wow, you're so cool! Hyun Soo, Oppa!

204
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,720
You're so cool! So handsome!

205
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,230
Hyun Soo Oppa! Hyun Soo Oppa!

206
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,930
 You're so handsome. I love you! 

207
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,620
 Oppa, please come here! 

208
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:32,360
 I love you! You're so handsome! 

209
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,090
- Do both of your adoptive parents know about  me? 
- Yeah.

210
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,470
What did you tell them about me?

211
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,330
Eun Dong.

212
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:02,970
- Oppa. 
- What kind of entity I was, and am to you now,

213
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:08,480
is up to you. So I won't care, but...

214
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,080
You aren't just like a sister to me.

215
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,850
Let's continue this brother-sister relationship.

216
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,100
Am I just a brother to you?

217
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,950
You aren't a sister to me.

218
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,960
I'm just a brother to you?

219
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,990
I never had a sister like you.

220
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,830
I'm already tired of having my own sister.

221
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,430
- Then, do you not have a girlfriend? 
- I don't!

222
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:49,680
Brother-sister... Yeah, right.

223
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,910
Eat slowly, you'll get indigestion.

224
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,700
- Hurry up and eat. 
- I am.

225
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,870
It's delicious.

226
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,780
Of course it is. You bought that from a chicken restaurant.

227
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,000
A girl, like you, eating messily like this...

228
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,090
Stay still.

229
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:50,050
- Oppa, I'll be going now. 
- Be careful. 
- Okay.

230
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,000
Eun Dong.

231
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,080
- I'm telling you to be careful. 
- Okay.

232
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,180
- I'll be going. 
 - I acted like it didn't bother me, 

233
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,550
 - but the awkwardness that was flowing between me and Eun Dong  
- Go.

234
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,460
 was so heavy that it couldn't be erased.  

235
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,380
 I needed some kind of breakthrough. 

236
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,120
 But not knowing what kind of breakthrough was needed,  

237
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,140
 was the problem.  

238
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,190
Aigoo, hello.

239
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,960
- I work with Hyun Soo Hyung. 
- I see.

240
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,920
Excuse me. I'm Lee Seok Tae.

241
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,490
How unlucky.

242
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,560
Hyun Soo, who was that lady, earlier?

243
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,150
- Why? 
- She's not your biological sister, right?

244
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,650
- She called you oppa. 
- No, she isn't.

245
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,450
She's not your girlfriend either, right?

246
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,950
Please introduce me to her.

247
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,610
- What? 
- She's totally my type.

248
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,850
But... Why did you think that she wasn't my girlfriend?

249
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,530
You guys didn't have that special atmosphere given out

250
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,460
when two people are dating.

251
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,440
 I don't want to date entertainers any more. 

252
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,900
They said you need to date a lot when you're still a public servant.

253
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,310
 You can't date when you start your career. 

254
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:36,110
Seok Tae, can we talk?

255
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,920
- Hey you bastard! 
- What? Oh gosh, that scared me.

256
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,410
Hey, she's my girlfriend.

257
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,440
It's been ten years.

258
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,110
She's not someone you can look at so easily, so don't even think about it!

259
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,010
And I'm an early 79, you punk! (born in early 1979)

260
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,970
If you ever speak informally to me again, I'll kill you!

261
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:22,950


262
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,540
Oh, who is this?

263
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,500
Isn't this Korea's best actor, Park Hyun Soo?

264
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,200
I'm outside the hospital. Let's have a drink.

265
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:38,010
Indeed, because you are in administrative and not in the defense,

266
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:42,210
- you are more smooth with the civilians. 
 - Hurry up.

267
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,750
What's wrong? Why are you slumping down like that?

268
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,080
You look like someone who just experienced a broken heart.

269
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,660
I will be your consulting partner today.

270
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,800
- Just tell me the category. Dating, work, or—
- Hey!

271
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,310
How do you steal a woman who already has a boyfriend?

272
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,310
A  new  category!

273
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,960
Why are you getting troubled over something like that?

274
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,100
What's so hard about that?

275
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,320
Create a similar point between you two.

276
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,710
- What are you saying? 
- What I mean is,

277
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,640
you make it so that the girl feels sorry to her boyfriend,

278
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,800
so that both of you have the same feelings, a similar point.

279
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,390
What on earth are you talking about?

280
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,980
You really don't understand anything!

281
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,590
What I'm saying is that

282
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,350
you feel sorry towards that man because you have feelings for his girl, right?

283
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,650
Why would I feel sorry towards that punk?

284
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,830
I was the first one to hug Eun Dong. I was the first one to like her. I was the first for everything!

285
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,860
- The person who should be sorry is that punk! 
- Eun Dong?

286
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,000
You like Eun Dong, Oppa?

287
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,070
- How did you come to like her? 
- Forget it, just drink your beer.

288
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,910
Oppa!

289
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,380
This girl. Your manners are so...

290
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,020
I have someone I'm going to marry.

291
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,530
Park Hyun Ah.

292
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:36,390
If you marry before me, I'll kill you!

293
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,190
I'm going to marry first!

294
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,070
I may lose my opportunity waiting for you to get married.

295
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:46,170
- Don't know. 
 - What you mean, don't know?

296
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:50,930
But, that girl, Eun Dong's, boyfriend...

297
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:55,260
What if he's someone who is more successful than you are?

298
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:00,790
 As my curiosity grew over who Eun Dong's boyfriend was,  

299
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,200
 so did my feelings of wanting to rip them apart.  

300
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,100
 Just thinking about how Eun Dong was with another man was very painful for me.  

301
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,770
 You need to date me.  

302
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,590
 Why?  

303
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,060
 Because we're fated.  

304
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,100
Fate.

305
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,540
He really opened the lid. That's what you're saying, right?

306
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,720
Yeah.

307
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,660
He definitely sees you as a woman! He's jealous!

308
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,420
The answer is so clear. Start your scheme!

309
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,440
Can I do that?

310
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,620
But you... What is it exactly that you want from him?

311
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,660
Marriage.

312
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,680
Hey, how can you fearlessly say you want to marry a public servant who is so much older than you?

313
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,500
I can raise money and feed him myself.

314
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,660
What's it to him?

315
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,580
 Oh my, oh my. 

316
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,940
 You worked really hard! 

317
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,840
Teacher, you worked hard!

318
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,220
Go home safely!

319
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,140
Are you Teacher Eun Dong's boyfriend?

320
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,560
 What? 

321
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,160
 You look really good with Teacher Eun Dong. 

322
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,900
Watch a movie with me today.

323
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,380
I have plans already.

324
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,220
Cancel them. Right now.

325
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,180
Oppa.

326
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,400
I'm going to do things my way, so you do things your own way.

327
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,600
I won't disturb anything.

328
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,540
Hey, no matter how much I think about it,

329
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,140
you having a boyfriend is such a given. I'll play fairly.

330
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,160
I just have to win in the championships. Am I right?

331
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,080
What exactly your feelings for me are...

332
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,020
You don't even know.

333
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:15,240
That's the thing I can confidently say I know for sure.

334
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,160
I'll take care of my feelings, so you just take care of yourself.

335
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,960
Whether I'm like an older brother or a man to you.

336
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,220
I'll see you in front of the movie theater at seven. You 'd better come looking pretty,

337
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,300
since it's our first date.

338
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,660
Good job, good job. Park Hyun Soo, you're a man.

339
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:03,120


340
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,020
 Hey little kid! 
♫  I must be regretting it, I must be waiting for you  ♫ 

341
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,900
Oh... This?

342
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:36,080
I wanted to wear them when I turned twenty, but my feet grew too much.

343
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,180
Shall we go?

344
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,680
Okay.

345
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:59,080
Your hairpin is pretty. Your hairpin is pretty.

346
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:06,100


347
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,900
♫   As if we'd met yesterday  ♫

348
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:38,360
♫   Not really needing to ask you how you've been  ♫

349
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,920
♫   Maybe I was needlessly concerned  ♫

350
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:51,480
♫   Being nervous, maybe I made it awkward between us  ♫

351
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,180
♫   Telling me that you look awful  ♫

352
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,220
Since I heard you had a boyfriend,
♫  Because you couldn't sleep last night after my phone call   ♫

353
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,720
holding your hand like this is so difficult.
♫   Because you couldn't sleep last night after my phone call  ♫

354
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,780
But...
♫  You are shyly smiling   ♫

355
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,200
I don't want to think about things like that.
♫  How could you still be the same?   ♫

356
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,500
I can't give you up.
♫   How could you still be the same?  ♫

357
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,780
I wouldn't have expected anything else if your heart felt the same way mine did.
♫  You say you didn't even know it was love back then   ♫

358
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:32,700
I bet it doesn't yet.
♫   And that you always felt bad when you heard news about me  ♫

359
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,180
I'll wait.
♫   Hearing that, tears start to flow  ♫

360
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,720
I'll match you,
♫   Hearing that, tears start to flow  ♫

361
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:49,040
and I'll control my heart.
♫  Hearing that, tears start to flow   ♫

362
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,160
♫  Should I say I love you, again?  ♫

363
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:32,340


364
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,880
You can... Increase it.

365
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,660
You can increase the amount (of love) more.

366
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,980
♫  If you didn't know it was love before  ♫

367
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:33,760
♫  Whenever you hear about me  ♫

368
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:43,220
♫  When I hear the words stating how you always felt sorry towards me  ♫

369
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:50,120
♫  My tears start to fall down without me knowing ♫ 

370
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:55,880
♫  Should I tell her I love her again?  ♫

371
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:04,080
♫  Will you accept me comfortably like you are now?  ♫ 

372
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:10,880
♫  Even if I'm born again, loving you again  ♫

373
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:17,600
♫  Is my life's purpose  ♫

374
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,680
♫  Should I tell her I love her again?  ♫

375
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,860
 Oppa! Oppa over here! 

376
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,400
Oppa, come out for a second please!

377
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,940
-  Oppa, please come out! 
- I can't come out because of this punk!

378
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,060
 Wow... 

379
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,580
 Oppa, come out anyway! Hurry! 

380
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,000
Hey.

381
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,680
Go out there. They're waiting for you.

382
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,300
Yes sir. Thank you.

383
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,080
 Oppa! 

384
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,680
Oppa! Is that guy bothering you?

385
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,000
He's so annoying!

386
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,930
Spring.

387
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,840
Summer.

388
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,800
Fall.

389
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,190
He's so handsome.

390
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,370
- Handsome? 
- Have we learned it?

391
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,400
I don't know.

392
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,420
 Oh, he is handsome. Very handsome. 

393
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,330
This is a story about a guy who can't forget his first love.

394
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:13,270
Lee Seok Tae was supposed to be the main character, but as he entered military, we're down-playing him now.

395
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:18,660
So Jo Yoon Jung is the main character, and you're the female lead's boyfriend.

396
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:24,830
It is a small part, but these days the supporting act can outshine the lead act.

397
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:31,520
The female lead is Mi Sun, so we put you in the package. You must do well this time.

398
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,290
You have to audition for this part.

399
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,640
Practice like crazy!

400
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,140
If you don't get this part, you'll have no chance.

401
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,830
The filming will start in two months, so the timing is perfect with your discharge.

402
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:44,550
Right? Timing is everything.

403
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:48,150
You learn that while you live. Timing!

404
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,590
Read.

405
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:57,290
 What kind of smile  

406
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,630
 Hyun Soo, let's eat! 

407
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,650
Hurry up kids.

408
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:28,020
Thanks for the meal!

409
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:32,060
Mom, Hyun Ah said that she had someone to marry.

410
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,500
Wow, look at how loose lipped you are!

411
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,380
Really?

412
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,730
Oh, it might be true.

413
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,810
Do you marry by yourself?

414
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:51,080
 You have to look into that family's current standing. You marry just because you're dating? 

415
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,300
 What kind of person is he? 

416
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,350
I met him at the hospital.

417
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,720
Oh, he's a doctor?

418
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,190
That's a relief then.

419
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,880
What do his parents do?

420
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,390
I don't really know. I haven't asked.

421
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,870
Oh look at this girl. Why wouldn't you ask that? That's the most important part.

422
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:12,770
If you want to know how that person really is, you need to know about his parents.

423
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:16,810
I mean, you need to just look at that person. Why the need to look at the parents?

424
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:21,500
What really annoyed me about our history was the fact that they put a death sentence for three generations.

425
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:26,100
What do the parents have to do with this? There are kids without parents who grew up splendidly.

426
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,200
Why are you going so overboard?

427
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,910
It may be for men, but for women, you have to look at the household.

428
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:38,460
The kids raised without parents are melancholy and tend to hold grudges, so they are not suitable for family.

429
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:43,750
What department does he work in?

430
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,170
Is he a fellow or—

431
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:48,010
He's not a doctor.

432
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,110
He's a patient.

433
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,150
Huh?

434
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,570
What?

435
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:15,560
You should have let me tell them later on. Why did you go and tell them now? Huh?

436
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,970
Who knows what you'll do if we leave you alone?

437
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:23,180
Someone needs to know to prevent you from doing anything.

438
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,240
You said he was a patient. What kind of patient is he?

439
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,440
Hemorrhoid?

440
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,660
Cancer.

441
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,540
What?

442
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:45,410
He's a patient under my care. He has stage three brain cancer.

443
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,540
- Hyun Ah. 
- Oppa.

444
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,420
I'm serious.

445
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:00,560
I'm sorry. I didn't know that and...

446
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,270
I just...

447
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,320
You did well.

448
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,850
It's better to have them know sooner than later.

449
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:10,400
That person doesn't have time.

450
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,500
I was thoughtless.

451
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:16,000
I shouldn't have let our parents know.

452
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,420
But, that girl Eun Dong, does she not have parents?

453
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,360
No.

454
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,220
What do we do? Even you are in a difficult situation.

455
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,910
We really back-stabbed our parents.

456
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:45,940


457
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,650
 Why don't you listen to your father and do whatever you want? 

458
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,460
 This ungrateful child! 

459
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:24,100
Oppa. Do you remember this song?

460
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,570
What is this?

461
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,430
You don't remember?

462
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,590
I don't know.

463
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:40,690
Hey, what is it? Tell me.

464
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:45,770
You really are too much. This song was a big part of our lives and you don't know it?

465
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:48,480
- Big part? 
- Forget it.

466
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:54,320
Tell me. What is it?

467
00:43:56,430 --> 00:44:01,980
We. That day. First.

468
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,870
First?

469
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,750
How could you forget this song?

470
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,090
I've heard it over a hundred times.

471
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:22,000
Hey, I really was out of my mind that day.

472
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I was seduced by a fox with ninety tails and my soul was buried in the ground.

473
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,530
Do you think I would remember this song?

474
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,080
That's right. It was this song.

475
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,620
It's great.

476
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:50,010
♫ When you said you are still alone ♫

477
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:56,810
♫ My heart ached without realizing ♫

478
00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:03,500
 ♫ Will you tell me that you love me again? ♫  

479
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:10,590
 ♫ It's been a long time but I have been waiting ♫  

480
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:19,230
 ♫ Waiting for you is the easiest thing for me to do ♫ 

481
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:29,790
 ♫ I didn't even know time was passing by
 Will you tell me that you love me again? ♫  

482
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:38,250
 ♫ I lack many things as always but will you accept me? ♫  

483
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:45,020
  ♫ Loving you is my everything ♫  

484
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:51,600
♫ It couldn't be helped ♫

485
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:57,030
I heard you are going for an audition.

486
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:59,980
Yeah, the script looked great!

487
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,950
Indeed, the script is great.

488
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,580
I am disappointed. I really wanted to do it myself.

489
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:11,070
But it is a bit unrealistic.

490
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:18,570
The male lead is meeting the female lead in fifteen years, but how could he not recognize her?

491
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,140
It could happen, if it is fifteen years.

492
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:24,570
I recognized her at first glance.

493
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,470
If meeting a fateful person, you'd recognize in the first glance after twenty years as well, not only fifteen years.

494
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:36,150
But, is it something that you should be concerned with?

495
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,490
If anybody should be concerned, then it should be the male lead.

496
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:41,270
Yeah, this punk...

497
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:45,360
That is why your anti-fans are increasing rapidly.

498
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,830
Is your pride bruised?

499
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:49,590
I am sorry.

500
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:52,880
Hey, it's your pride that should be bruised.

501
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,990
That is why you can't escape modeling.

502
00:46:55,990 --> 00:47:00,330
Either supporting act or extras, you must understand the exact emotion

503
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,620
to execute. This punk...

504
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,020
How could you  not  know something so basic!

505
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:11,190
Is he really an actor?

506
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,030
I have an audition next week.

507
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:39,770
I heard.

508
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,270
From who?

509
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,570
From your manager.

510
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:46,270
Hey, why do you keep meeting a guy without me knowing?

511
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,410
Should I go follow you to the audition?

512
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,210
You have class, though.

513
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,970
Anyhow, you will go after your work.

514
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:56,670
Okay, fine. Come.

515
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,890
If you're there, I'll do a lot better.

516
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:03,430
- Let's go. 
- Okay.

517
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:27,370
You... Are you still meeting that punk?

518
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,590
- Oppa... 
- I already told you

519
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:33,310
that I'd play fairly, that I'd win in the end.

520
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:37,010
I'm canceling those words. From today on— No—

521
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:41,090
From yesterday—  No, from the day before—you can't do this.

522
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:45,950
You... This is the ring that bastard gave you, right?

523
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,790
- Now that bastard— 
- That ring!

524
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:59,170
My mom gave it to me!

525
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,290
Ah! Oppa!

526
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,350
Oppa, it's dangerous!

527
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:11,510
♫ ♫

528
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:14,370
Oppa! Come back!

529
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:25,910
Why would you jump in to find it, you dummy? You didn't even know how deep it was!

530
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:32,310
Wait here. I'll go buy a towel, okay?

531
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,190
You have to come back, okay?

532
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,350
Of course, I'll come back.

533
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,450
I'll be back, so don't move and stay here, okay?

534
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:05,350
♫  Because I love too much  ♫

♫   Putting you in my heart, you've remained in my heart  ♫
 Eun Dong, 

539
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:41,370
 she told me to wait. 

540
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:51,370
 ♫ Me, who smiles when I see her
 me, who can breathe thanks to her ♫  

541
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:56,990
 ♫ My heart is like that, just yearning for her ♫  

542
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:00,910
 Eun Dong, she told me to wait. 

543
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:03,590
 However, Eun Dong... 

544
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:12,850
 She never came back. 

545
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:14,910
 Hey you in the front! Move... 

546
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:21,270
 I heard your reason for making an autobiography is to find someone. 

547
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,990
 What is her name, exactly? 

548
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:42,530
♫ ♫

549
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:44,610
Hyun Soo Oppa.

550
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:47,070
Oppa...

551
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,190
 Hurry! 

552
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:55,870
 We're departing now. Both are in a critical condition.  

553
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:59,370
 The man's name is Choi Choi Ho. The girl's name is yet unknown.  

554
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:02,550
- I found her name!
 - The girl's name!

555
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:05,750
 Ji Eun Dong. 

556
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:10,410
Ji Eun Dong.

557
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:14,930
 Is she, by any chance, your first love? 

558
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:19,090
She's my fiancee.

559
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:20,810
 What? 

560
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:25,250
 We heard you were dating Young Sun Group's oldest daughter Jo Seo Ryeong. 

561
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:28,470
 How do you think Jo Seo Ryeong will feel when she finds  out about this? 

562
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:34,410
Jo Seo Ryeong and I are just very good friends.

563
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:38,570
A relationship between us seems to be something reporters want,

564
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:41,170
but we're not in any kind of relationship.

565
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:58,310
 Mister Eun Ho! 

566
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:05,770
You must be tired.

567
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:07,850
Let's go.

568
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,090
Where?

569
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,610
There.

570
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:13,070
Oh. Okay.

571
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:15,670
- You brought my clothes right? 
- Yes! In the bag in the back.

572
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:17,570
Let's go to IlSan.

573
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:42,330


574
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:58,850
 You have to come back. 

575
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:00,890
 Of course, I'd come back. 

576
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:03,870
 I'll be right back, so just wait here, okay? 

577
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:27,130
 Eun Dong disappeared, just like that. 

578
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:31,590
 Eun Dong told me to wait. 

579
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:33,610
 Let's go now. 

580
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:37,550
You go by yourself.

581
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,370
How are you going to get home?

582
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:43,810
I'll take a taxi.

583
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:47,390
The director keeps texting to bring you.

584
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:51,210
I'll talk to him. You go first.

585
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:53,170
Okay... Ah.

586
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:56,510
I agreed to meet with the ghostwriter you told me about.

587
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:59,910
You told me to get the writer without anyone knowing.

588
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:03,130
So why would you reveal it all at the press conference?

589
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,830
 Honestly... 

590
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:08,990
Come back safely then.
