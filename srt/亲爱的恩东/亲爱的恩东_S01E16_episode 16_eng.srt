 My Love Eun Dong
Last Episode 

2
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,350
 Jae Ho! Ra Il! 

3
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,070
Ra Il.

4
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,590
Ra Il! Ra Il!

5
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,410
Ra Il! Ra Il!

6
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,090
Ra Il!

7
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,510
Someone please!

8
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,710
Ra Il!

9
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,550
It's exhaustion. Your child experienced a considerable amount of mental shock.

10
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,470
Let's make sure he gets a lot of rest.

11
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,770
What happened?

12
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,310
Don't worry too much. They said it's exhaustion.

13
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,570
Can I be a good dad to Ra Il?

14
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:55,570
The feelings he has for that man... Do you think Ra Il can redirect them to me instead?

15
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,130
But if I keep trying to achieve that goal,

16
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,190
is there a chance that Ra Il could get hurt?

17
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,410
He's your son, Oppa.

18
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,270
For raising Ra Il like that,

19
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,810
thank you.

20
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,850
Now you do all of it, okay?

21
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,890
Let's go get something to eat.

22
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,210
No, Oppa. I'll stay here.

23
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,230
I know you haven't eaten yet. Let's go.

24
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:01,130


25
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,570
Ra Il.

26
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,410
Ra Il!

27
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,310
Ra Il!

28
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,130
Yes, welcome!

29
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,470
 - We will go in the private room. 
- No, no, no!

30
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,290
Someone else has reserved that room so sit over here.

31
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,710
 Sit over here. 

32
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,570
Please give us two beef short rib soups.

33
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,410
 Two gal-bo ! (Two whores!)
 (similar to gal-bi = short rib)

34
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,610
  I guess you all walk around without reading the newspaper? 

35
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,030
 When They Reunited She Was Already Married 

36
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,630
 Has Actor Ji Eun Ho Become the Nation's Adulterer? 

37
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,650
  How can you even face your child? 

38
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,310
 Have them hurry up and eat so they can leave soon! 

39
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,970
Dad, are you awake?

40
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,730
Are you not sick any more?

41
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,550
You, why are you here?

42
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,690
Why did you come here?

43
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,930
It's hard for you isn't it, Oppa?

44
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,090
Yeah.

45
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,750
The problem is Ra Il and Jung Eun.

46
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,770
Right now, everyone is talking about the rumors coming out of those misleading articles written about you and Jung Eun.

47
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,950
Ra Il and Jung Eun are the ones being harmed the most.

48
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,090
People don't believe that Ra Il is your son.

49
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,910
That's why

50
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,970
I will make a public statement confirming that Ra Il is your son.

51
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:02,530
No, don't do that. We're  not prepared for that yet.

52
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,970
Do you know what kinds of names people are calling Jung Eun?

53
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,790
You're a celebrity so you're used to these things, but

54
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,370
it's going to be really hard for Ra Il and Jung Eun to cope with all of this.

55
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,990
I will meet the reporters and show them the DNA results.

56
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,410
Let's reveal that Ra Il is your son, Oppa.

57
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,770
 You never know. It might get better. 

58
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,310
Doing that won't resolve this situation.

59
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,270
It might even make things harder for Ra Il.

60
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:33,990
I suppose.

61
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,850
Ra Il's  face, hands, hair and body...

62
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,450
All of these may come from me, but

63
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,330
his heart doesn't belong to me.

64
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,530
I don't have the right to cause him any pain.

65
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,670
Especially considering I'm only his father in name.

66
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,130
Oppa.

67
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,530
Was it wrong for me to show up in Eun Dong's life again?

68
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,930
All I wanted was to be good to her.

69
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,450
My intention was to give her more happiness.

70
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,130
But instead, for both of these people,

71
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,430
I'm having thoughts about whether I'm giving them more pain.

72
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,130
No, Oppa. It's not like that.

73
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,510
But I really don't see a solution to this problem.

74
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,810
Also, Ra Il knows

75
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,790
that you are his dad, Oppa.

76
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,490
It seems like he found out somehow.

77
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,070
What?

78
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,350
Are you okay?

79
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,140
Yes.

80
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,970
Ahjussi...

81
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,280
Are you really my dad?

82
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,080
How did you find out?

83
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,330
But why didn't you come until now?

84
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,710
I'm sorry.

85
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,640
For me, that is

86
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,120
my biggest regret and apology to you.

87
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:21,430
Ahjussi, please don't take my dad away from me.

88
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,480
 I heard what the nurses were saying. 

89
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,850
 They said my dad tried to kill himself because of you. 

90
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,750
I hate you, Ahjussi.

91
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,030
Because of you

92
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,350
my mom gets hated by people,

93
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:50,360
 and I also get hated by my grandmother. 

94
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,620
I'm sorry, Ra Il.

95
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,430
I was the happiest when you weren't here.

96
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,340
Same for my dad. Same for my dad.

97
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,600
Please

98
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,260
take good care of Ra Il.

99
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,400
I will let go of Eun Dong.

100
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,600
I will let Seo Jung Eun return to her rightful place.

101
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,110
I ask that you also

102
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,260
let the two of them go.

103
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,340
I will leave as well,

104
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,090
so that Eun Dong and Ra Il don't experience any more pain.

105
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,860
I don't see any other way we can resolve this entire situation.

106
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,090
Now we just need to leave it all up to fate.

107
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:15,530
Thank you for raising Ra Il well.

108
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,200
I will never forget that.

109
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:29,210


110
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,410
Here. Hyung asked me to give this to you, President.

111
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,720
He left it up to you, however you want to take care of it.

112
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,290
How did everything turn out like this?

113
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:48,090
Eun Ho Hyung said he was going to meet with Chief Jo today. He said he plans to make President Hwang testify as a witness.

114
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:53,230
-  Then there's a chance you may not have to go to prison. 
- But instead, what would we have to do in return?

115
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,720
Knowing what type of person Jo Se Ryeong is, there's no way she would bestow such kindness without any conditions.

116
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,470
He said he's willing to turn this company over to her.

117
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,120
Well, I suppose with Eun Ho leaving, this company would no longer have any meaning for me.

118
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,580
But you know, I don't hate Eun Ho Hyung even one bit.

119
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,820
Why would you hate him? He's such a pitiful guy.

120
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,630
You've been through a lot.

121
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,190
Speaking of, it's you who's been going above and beyond.

122
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,380
It's okay if I spend a little time inside. Don't overdo yourself.

123
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,680
It's been a while. Should the three of us have a drink together?

124
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,520
Should we?

125
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,680
Here.

126
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,190
You guys have worked really hard.

127
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,040
What are you going to do?

128
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,800
Me?

129
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,210
Just...

130
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,390
Wondering whether I should go find a quiet spot to crawl into and live.

131
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,700
I can't be out and about too much since people know my face.

132
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,590
What are your plans, President?

133
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,200
I'll go back down to Chun Cheon.

134
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,640
What do you think about me running a motorcycle wholesale business?

135
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,090
Motorcycle.

136
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,790
Times were good back then, when I was racing around town fearlessly. Those were the days.

137
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,310
That little kid who finally put an end to my speed demon days,

138
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,610
who would have known she would become the center of my life?

139
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,860
Park Hyun Soo was really the coolest back in those days.

140
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,750
Hyun Bal.

141
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,020
You...

142
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,840
- Go into Chief Jo's company.
- I don't want to.

143
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,140
Even if I fall into the water and start drowning, I don't dog paddle.

144
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,750
- Go there, you bastard.
- I said I don't want to.

145
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,100
Ay, this punk.

146
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,350
Your  pretentiousness is still a big problem.

147
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,410
You have to admit that I have some loyalty, right?

148
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,810
Loyalty, my ass.

149
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,210
Hurry up and pour it.

150
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,580
Fill it up.

151
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,500
 - Dong Gyu. 
- Yes, Hyung.

152
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,180
You—

153
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,890
Make sure to call me when you get married, okay?

154
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,570
Yes.

155
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,880
All this time,

156
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,550
you've really gone through a lot.

157
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,790
 And hey, after you get married, quit acting like such a smart ass. 

158
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,910
 I put up with your crap because I'm cool like that. 

159
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,670
Dad, I'll see you later.

160
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,280
Okay.

161
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,070
Ra Il, go outside for a little bit while Dad and I talk.

162
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,780
Okay.

163
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,070
Since you're awake now, I'm going to go.

164
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,010
Mother-in-law

165
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,740
told me to stay only until you woke up.

166
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,650
Mother-in-law will take care of your discharge from the hospital.

167
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,550
Let's talk when you get discharged.

168
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,040
Don't ever

169
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,730
do something like this again.

170
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,590
Don't ever

171
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,040
act like a coward again.

172
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,150
I'm leaving.

173
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,360
I hope business goes well.

174
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,430
Are you going alone?

175
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,240
Yeah. I have to.

176
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,030
Take care. And I ask that you please take care of my employees.

177
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,420
I just want to ask you one thing.

178
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,290
If, let's say...

179
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,600
If Ji Eun Dong had never existed in this world,

180
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,180
would you have given your heart to me?

181
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,900
Why would Ji Eun Dong not exist in this world?

182
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,990
If I was born into this world,

183
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,390
it's only fate that Eun Dong would automatically follow.

184
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,130
If she never existed, then I probably wouldn't be here either.

185
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,880
- Aren't you nervous about leaving that woman behind?
- No.

186
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,910
I'm not worried

187
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,570
because we will definitely meet again.

188
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,140
That's how it is for us.

189
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,350
Take care of yourself.

190
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,670
 He's arrived! He's here! 

191
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,620
 Ji Eun Ho! Ji Eun Ho! 

192
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,920
  Just a moment. Just a word! Just one statement! Can you open your window? 

193
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,520
  Please give us some statements. 

194
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,350
All of you are working so hard. Let's go inside my house and talk.

195
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,910
Pardon?

196
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,480
This situation is entirely my fault.

197
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,930
That woman and that child are victims.

198
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,740
And the claim that she is your first love...

199
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,250
Then what about that book?

200
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,870
All of that, I guess that was just me wasting time being foolish and kidding myself.

201
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,320
It's true, this was all of my own doing.

202
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,030
Is the child your son or Choi Jae Ho's son?

203
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,580
He is that man's son.

204
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:37,140
Please treat it as if I was just acting crazy on my own, and  let's just put an end to this incident.

205
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,910
The child and the woman didn't do anything wrong.

206
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,520
Hello, Ms. Writer.

207
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,580
You came.

208
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,900
We had all of your pictures taken down, but there will probably be some people who will still recognize you.

209
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,040
Please hang in there just a little longer. Soon everything will be forgotten.

210
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,710
Alright.

211
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,940
Eun Ho liquidated all of his assets,

212
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,290
but he insisted on buying a house for you to live in.

213
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:28,380
There are a lot of empty houses that have been put up for sale close to where you live right now.

214
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,850
What is Oppa doing right now?

215
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,730
The company is causing him an extraordinary amount of problems.

216
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:41,620
Remember last time I told you about President Hwang, that guy who left behind his entire mess for Eun Ho to deal with.

217
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,980
 I swear, if we ever catch him... 

218
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,730
 Hello? 

219
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,200
Oppa.

220
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,900
 Yeah. 

221
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,110
It's really nice here.

222
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:18,740
Really? That's such a relief.

223
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,980
You must be crazy busy because of everything going on with the company. Make sure to eat properly.

224
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,250
Of course.

225
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,940
 I will contact you as soon as I move in. I'll be able to see you then, right? 

226
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,270
Of course.

227
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:39,300
I feel so awful that you're having such a hard time. Is there anything I can do for you?

228
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:44,950
No, there isn't. Don't worry, I took care of everything.

229
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,040
 That's a relief. 

230
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,240
Eun Dong.

231
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,790
 Yeah? 

232
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,960
You can't get sick, alright?

233
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,220
Why are you saying that? You sound like someone who's planning to leave all of a sudden.

234
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,470
  Oppa. 

235
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,470
Hmm?

236
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,560
  I will call you as soon as I'm done packing everything up. 

237
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,770
Oppa, call me as soon as you're done dealing with all of the company  business. Got it?

238
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,630
Y-Yeah.

239
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:37,940


240
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:55,270
Do you think I'll ever be able to buy this house back?

241
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:03,330
I bought this house for me and Eun Dong to live in together.

242
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,010
Who bought the vacation house?

243
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,710
Someone who runs a clothing business in Nam Dae Moon.

244
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,270
I gave him your message not to alter the house too much.

245
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,830
Told him there was a chance you might return and buy back the house.

246
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,460
Okay. You did well.

247
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,640
Did the article come out?

248
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,080
Yes.

249
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:43,510
Do you think that it will be enough for people to leave Eun Dong and Ra Il alone?

250
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,330
Yes. I think so.

251
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,490
Oh Hyung. Here.

252
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:58,130
This is for a language practice course. While you're over there, please take the opportunity to study English.

253
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,690
If you don't, you might encounter problems with your visa status.

254
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:10,690
You didn't tell Eun Dong that I was leaving, did you?

255
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:14,070
No. You told me not to.

256
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:22,270
If she finds out, I'm afraid she might insist on leaving with me.

257
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,430
Then, you can leave together.

258
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,690
What about Ra Il?

259
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:37,470
My father said that... He said I am not a father yet.

260
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:43,990
That's why I am doing this. So I can become a real father.

261
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:49,110
Do you have any idea, man? This was a huge decision for me. It wasn't easy.

262
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,350
I know, Hyung.

263
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,390
The last thing on my list, there's a place I want to visit.

264
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,170
Hyung. It really has been a long time, hasn't it?

265
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,540
That's right.

266
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,860
 - Eun Dong! Have a good time.  

267
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,340
 Yes, I will! 

268
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,240
Hey kid.

269
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,580
If you meet that Oppa,

270
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,280
tell him not to worry too much.

271
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,960
Tell him everything will work out fine.

272
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,200
 Yes. 

273
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:52,830
 My Love Eun Dong 

274
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:05,090
 Eun Dong, by the time you read this letter, 

275
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,770
 I will probably no longer be in Korea. 

276
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:14,410
 When I look at you and when I look at Ra Il, 

277
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,210
 it will be hard for me to leave Korea, 

278
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:21,090
 and even harder for me to leave alone, 

279
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,390
so I'm just moving forward with this decision.

280
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,650
 My love Eun Dong, 

281
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:36,170
 for giving birth to my son, raising him for ten years, 

282
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:40,630
 and for coming back into my life, I'm so extremely grateful. 

283
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,390
 But right now, 

284
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,210
 we have no choice but to be separated like this. 

285
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,910
  For me, who waited for ten years, 

286
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,230
 this short time will probably be nothing. 

287
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,870
 We will surely meet again, 

288
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:05,410
 because that is our fate. 

289
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:12,430
 Even if you and I were on Mars and Venus, separated on different planets, 

290
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,010
 we would be fated to meet again. 

291
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:21,190
 That's why I am not scared of any such things. 

292
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,790
 I will become a good dad for Ra Il. 

293
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,990
 I really want to do that. 

294
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,990
 You don't even ask if I want any? 

295
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,970
 Do you want to try some? 

296
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,570
 Oppa, did you sleep well? 

297
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,510
 Hurry and wash up. 

298
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:59,410
 For giving me the blessing of loving just one woman my entire life. 

299
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:04,510
 I'm deeply moved by you. 

300
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,750
 That one thing alone makes me feel like I've had a successful life. 

301
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,550
 Eun Dong, this time, 

302
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:21,550
 you must come and find me, okay? 

303
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:40,030
 But you know what, Eun Dong? 

304
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:45,110
 Even now, I miss you so much. 

305
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,350
 I love you. 

306
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:21,590


307
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,330
 Oppa, I was grateful. 

308
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,610
 I won't ever forget. 

309
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:12,510
 I still have the sneakers Eun Dong gave me. 

310
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,070
 In the topmost space of the shoe rack, 

311
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,410
 all beat up and tattered, 

312
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,270
 still dirty from wear. 

313
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,210
♫  Your  ♫

314
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,450
 The reason is because I truly love you. 

315
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,430
♫  Eyes glittering like stars  ♫

316
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:33,670
  It's because you're you. 
♫  Your voice softly blowing in like a breeze  ♫

317
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:39,250
 Just because you're you. 
♫  Your voice softly blowing in like a breeze  ♫

318
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:43,370
 Who are you? Eun Dong? 

319
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:46,670
 -Eun Dong!
-If Eun Dong sees that drama, 
♫  It remains  ♫

320
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,650
 I'd be handsome as always. 
♫  with me   ♫

321
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,390
 More than that time 10 years ago, 
♫  like it was yesterday  ♫

322
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,830
 though I've gotten older, I'd be the same as ever. 
♫  Like it was yesterday  ♫

323
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,710
 I'm sure 
♫  It seems like I won't be able to  ♫

324
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,450
 that it will be the same feeling from 10 years ago. 
♫  see you again  ♫

325
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,270
 Eun Dong. 
♫  It seems like I won't be able to see you again  ♫

326
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:08,470
 There's a chance she may love you even more.   
♫  You passing me by, pretending not to notice, 
causes me such pain  ♫

327
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:12,770
 Just a little more. A bit more. 
♫  Always  ♫

328
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,170
 Try to wait. 
♫  and everywhere  ♫

329
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,030
 Eun Dong... 
♫  the image of you I loved
is a shining ray of sunlight  to me  ♫

330
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:24,510
♫  The image of you I loved is a shining ray of sunlight  to me  ♫

331
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,510
♫  Now it seems like you won't come back again  ♫

332
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,570
 Why did she live like that? 
♫  you won't come back again  ♫

333
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:33,510
 And  so far away... 
♫  You who's forgotten me  ♫

334
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:39,850
 I felt happy while I was writing your book.  
♫  it seems I can't catch you  ♫

335
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,950
 It feels just as if...  
♫  Just as if it was the first time we met, 
without a word, the moment passes  ♫

336
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:49,630
♫  Just as if it was the first time we met, without a word, the moment passes  ♫

337
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,650
 What do you think of me? 
♫  Just as if it was the first time we met, without a word, the moment passes  ♫

338
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,770
 Are you scared right now? 

339
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:06,950
 Are you scared again? You must be thinking a lot of thoughts that you don't want anyone to discover. 

340
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:10,710
 Is that so? 

341
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,990
 Yes, that's right. 

342
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:17,950
  I like that person so much, I feel like I'm going  crazy. 

343
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,610
  I really feel like I'm going crazy. 

344
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:25,350
 Just thinking about that person makes me feel like my heart is going to burst. 

345
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:31,330
 - It keeps getting harder for me to get through the day.
- Your husband... 

346
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:34,630
 Do you love him? 

347
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:40,170
 - Yes.
- When that person is next to me, 

348
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,990
 he comes directly into my heart. 

349
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:48,370
 Without so much as a knock, he walks right in. 

350
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:54,570
 That feeling... I really like it. 

351
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:59,090
♫  This unbelievable moment right now, my heart is aching  ♫

352
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:01,950
 I like that man. 

353
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:08,030
 My heart jumps whenever I see you. 

354
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,630
 The fact that you have a husband, 

355
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,250
 okay. Fine, I'll accept it. 

356
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:19,530
  What am I supposed to do when I can't forget about you? 

357
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:25,090
  You were originally my woman from the start. 

358
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,750
 Let's just keep trying until the very end, 

359
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:35,510
 until one of us dies. 

360
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,170
 You have to come back. 

361
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,290
 Didn't I tell you she would come back if you waited? 

362
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,730
 And then what?  When she lives with another man? 

363
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,630
 When she has another man's son? 

364
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:49,310
 When she doesn't even remember me... 

365
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,850
 Please find Eun Dong for me. 

366
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:55,510
 I'm asking this of you. 
 ♫  have passed  ♫

367
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:01,590
♫  When you shed painful tears in front of me  ♫

368
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,450
 I love you.  

369
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,510
  I was unable to say these words to you 

370
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:12,350
  before we became separated.  

371
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,890
 Holding onto these words for ten years  

372
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,250
  in my heart,  

373
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:22,230
  has been incredibly hard on me. 

374
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,930
   I almost died, you know! 

375
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,410
 Eun Dong 

376
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,770
 I love you. 

377
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:46,310
 Even now, I miss you so much. 
 I love you.
Your goof-off slacker, Park Hyun Soo. 

378
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,430
Take care of yourself.

379
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,350
Please let me  see Ra Il every once in a while.

380
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:09,430
I'll explain things to him slowly, over time.

381
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,950
Alright.

382
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,930
I'll do that. Let's do that.

383
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,790
Jung Eun.

384
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:28,690
I'm sorry.  I loved you. 

385
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:34,710
I thought that if I loved you then you would have to love me as well,

386
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:41,030
but I became resentful because that didn't happen.

387
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:48,670
All of my wrongdoings where I had acted out of anger, I thought  I was done paying the price for all of that.

388
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:51,310
But I think there's still a lot left to make up for.

389
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,250
I was foolish and mistaken.

390
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,350
It's all in the past now.

391
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,470
It will all be forgotten.

392
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,070
Please forgive me.

393
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,250
Okay.

394
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:17,550
You

395
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,390
helped raise Ra Il so flawlessly and spotlessly.

396
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,910
No, actually, you created half of Ra Il.

397
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:33,570
I'll make sure there is a place left for you as Ra Il's father.

398
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:40,670
I'll contact you as soon as the papers start getting processed.

399
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,590
Okay.

400
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,710
 Choi Jae Ho!

 "Ji Eun Ho and Seo Jung Eun, Their Love is Genuine"
'Exclusive Interview With Choi Jae Ho, Former Baseball Player Who Attempted Suicide' 

402
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,580
 Ten years ago, I fell in love with a certain woman. 

403
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,840
That woman was carrying another man's child,

404
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,610
and she loved that man like crazy.

405
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:37,490
It was impossible for me to tolerate,

406
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:40,290
because that woman didn't love me.

407
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:46,770
So out of anger, I forced that woman into my car and started speeding down the street like a maniac.

408
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:50,720
That's how we got into the accident.

409
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,790
 That's how I became disabled and how that woman lost her memory. 

410
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:57,810
 - And she lived as my wife for ten years.
- Hyun Soo Oppa... 

411
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:59,940
 Oppa 

412
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:03,590
 That woman gave birth to that man's child. 

413
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,980
 And with that, we became a family. 

414
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:13,360
 But ten years later, that man appeared 

415
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:18,380
 to search for the woman he loved. 

416
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:25,110
 That woman is in fact Ji Eun Dong and that man is Ji Eun Ho. 

417
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,320
 The two of them had genuinely loved each other. 

418
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:34,240
 This is the truth. 

419
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,030
 1 year later 

420
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,110
Not bad!

421
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:01,170
 - Throw it, let's see what you've got! 

422
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:02,710
- Yah! 
- Oh!

423
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,770
- Very good!
-   Arigato! (thank you  in Japanese)

424
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:08,230
Okay great. This time then, I'm going to throw it up high.

425
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,240
- Yah! I got it!
 - You got it? 

426
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:15,840
- Yah! Uh yoo! 
- See, you can do it now that I've taught you.

427
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,730
- Open it! Open it all the way!
 - I opened it! 

428
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:22,440
So, you were just listening patiently and holding it all in?

429
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,970
Violence is bad, so I didn't hit him,

430
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:29,640
but just to make sure he doesn't say anything like that  again, I gave him a piece of my mind.

431
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,830
You did well!  I've got to say, my son is pretty cool.

432
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:37,070
Come on, whose son am I?

433
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:41,770
Ra Il, you know that you have another dad besides me, right?

434
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:43,670
Yup.

435
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:47,260
People don't all live the same way.

436
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:51,100
Each person has a different way that they love and different situations they face.

437
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,960
I know. I guess it would be nice having two dads.

438
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,350
I'm going to be cool from now on and just acknowledge it.

439
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:03,860
Ra Il, if you happen to meet with your other dad again, then call him Dad, okay?

440
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,710
You'll do that, right?

441
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:12,500
If I ever see him, I'll do that. Dad, if you tell me to do it, I will.

442
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,750
- Dad. 
- Yeah?

443
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,870
Starting today, I'm going to sleep at your house.

444
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:23,680
Mom is all over the place lately because she's trying to write.

445
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,750
Really?

446
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:29,700
I'm Park Jung Eun! What is wrong with you?

447
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,660
Where would I have another synopsis?

448
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,550
I don't know, whatever then! Just forget it!

449
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,290
Ms. Writer.

450
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:53,270
There's a synopsis I've been working on for a while.

451
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:56,260
- What? 
- Would you like to take a look?

452
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,730
- Mi Na!
- You've arrived!

453
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:02,180
- Grandpa!
- Aigoo ya.

454
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,130
- Hello.
- Aigoo, look at our baby.

455
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:09,460
- Father, please take a seat. You too Mom, sit down. 
- Let's go and sit.

456
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:14,560
Wow, you've prepared a lot of food!  Oh, it's seaweed soup.  Did you make it?

457
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,960
- Nope.
 - Oh, Ajumma made it.

458
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,590
Nope. Ra Il's mom did.

459
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:22,340
Oh yeah?

460
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:26,060
You know how it's Oppa's birthday on Saturday. Ra Il's mom,

461
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,150
she also left this note.

462
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:37,850
 Father and Mother, 
Thank you for giving birth to Hyun Soo Oppa. 

463
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:43,090
  I felt sorry and anxious about meeting with you, so I am just leaving behind this food I made for you. 

464
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:45,380
 Please be healthy. 

465
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:54,940
Hey, then you should have told her to stay.  Why would you let her just leave like that? Sometimes, you are just really...

466
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,170
Oh! How can it be this delicious?

467
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:03,990
This is the first time I've tasted such delicious seaweed soup!

468
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,490
Wow, she really knows how to cook.

469
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,450
The seaweed soup tastes good.

470
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:13,930
- Eat a lot.
- Yes.

471
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:16,590
Mom, you completely forgot it was Oppa's birthday, didn't you?

472
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,110
No way! Why would I forget?

473
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:21,980
- It looks like you forgot...
- No, I didn't!

474
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,960
Do you have any actors or role models you admire?

475
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,760
I consider Kim Yoon Suk to be my role model.

476
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:34,230
Ah you're a Kim Yoon Suk fan? I'm a Kim Yoon Suk fan too! I'm happy to meet you.

477
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,680
They're here?

478
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:44,500
Kim Han Chul, Hong Chi Hwan, Kim Emma. What a snore-fest.

479
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,710
Start off by changing your names.

480
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:51,310
What in the world is  ki-man chuh-lee ?  (=  dealing with deception ; wordplay of Kim Han Chul) One controversy with betrayal and your popularity as an actor will be over. Complete shutdown.

481
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:55,040
And what are you going to shut down? Are you  Madame Aema ? (= a.k.a. Mrs. Emma, an erotic movie from 80s)

482
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,520
You know those actor names that hook you as soon as you hear them, like Ji Eun Ho. Ji Eun Ho.

483
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,570
Eun Ho!

484
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:06,590
- Eun Ho, that knucklehead, when is he coming?
- Ta-da! I'm picking him up tomorrow.

485
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,620
Hello. Welcome.

486
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:20,680


487
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,000
- Did you see Ji Eun Ho?
- Yeah!

488
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,970
He's  daebak (amazingly)   good-looking, isn't he? Omo, what do I do?

489
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:37,200
Did you see him? Ji Eun Ho, Ji Eun Ho!

490
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,550
Mr. Ji Eun Ho...

491
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:01,070
Are you on your way back to Korea?

492
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,830
When you go back to Korea, you're going to continue acting, right?

493
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:13,080
What are you doing? It's okay, he likes it!

494
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:32,880
Ah, I'm tired, tired! I feel horrible! How could I have been sitting in economy...

495
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,450
So embarassing. Hey!

496
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:37,030
Who's the actor and who's the manager?

497
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:42,250
Isn't it true that you had retired? Ahjussi, don't forget you're not an actor any more.

498
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:45,890
Aigoo, a jerk like you... I could just...

499
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:49,090
It was my mistake, asking you to come meet me.

500
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:52,100
It's not like I got injured because I wanted to!

501
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,310
Who said anything?

502
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:57,610
You've been going on and on, complaining this entire time!

503
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:00,350
It's because I'm utterly exhausted.

504
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:04,240
Hey, for ten hours I was sitting, trapped like this, as if I was stuck in a beehive!

505
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,710
I didn't sleep one wink!

506
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:10,230
Hyung, grab that pen over there for me?

507
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:13,080
Just constantly ordering me around for everything...

508
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:19,420
Oh, that feels so good!

509
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,820
Ayoo, ayoo, ugh. How does...

510
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:26,640
Who in the world drops a frozen piece of meat on his foot and gets injured like that?

511
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,200
I have never seen anyone like you,  ever! 

512
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,940
A dummy who's never seen that happen is more ridiculous than the dummy who got injured.

513
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,080
- Ayoo, you can stop now already.
- What did you say, you punk?

514
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,840
Dummy?

515
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,010
Seriously?

516
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:44,750
This little asshole. I haven't seen you in a while and now what, you're coming up, are you?  Coming up, eh?

517
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,850
It must have been killing you, trying to hold in all that snarkiness while you were over there.

518
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:55,070
Yeah, now that I'm back, my mouth is starting to open up.

519
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:59,120
Hyung, admit it, you love being back in Korea, don't you?

520
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,880
Ayoo, ayoo, ayoo.

521
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,020
 What am I doing with a guy like you... 

522
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,420
Eun Ho. Eun Ho!!

523
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,910
Ayoo, this bastard! Ayoo!

524
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:21,160
Let me see... You didn't get beaten by kangaroos in Australia, did you?

525
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,470
- You look the same as before.
-  Your jokes are no fun, man.

526
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,610
Hey, bring a glass of iced coffee.

527
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:28,450
Ayoo.

528
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:34,140
Okay, okay. Now that you're sitting right here, it finally feels this office has found its groove.

529
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,320
Did you meet up?

530
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,040
No.

531
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:48,350
You have to get back to work.

532
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,260
I don't know. I just came in because of my visa.

533
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,040
I made  an appointment for us to go see Writer Park Jung Eun.

534
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:02,270
Hey, I retired! Going back to work, doesn't that seem a bit weird?

535
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:04,170
I really don't have much desire.

536
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:09,950
And also, of all the writers out there, why Park Jung Eun?

537
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:14,770
Why does that woman focus on me so much? Am I the only actor who exists in Korea?

538
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,920
Ay, this is tiring.

539
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,380
Who asked you to appear in anything?

540
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,610
The plan is to produce.

541
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:36,740
My Love Eun Dong. Let's make a drama.

542
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,340
- What? 
- Let's produce it.

543
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,390
Hyung, it smells good, doesn't it?

544
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:54,530
- Why is the entryway so narrow?
- Bathroom, bedroom...

545
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:57,100
Hyung. Window.

546
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:05,110
Ayoo, this is it?

547
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:07,540
What is this?

548
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,860
Hey, how do you expect me to live in a place the size of a booger?

549
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,820
It's nothing but bright, to me.

550
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,620
Hey, did I or did I not ask you to manage my money well?

551
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,360
What have you guys done with the account I gave you? How... What did you spend the money on?

552
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:25,590
Did I give you that money to spend it on a house this small?

553
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:27,420
Hyung, you left us a booger-sized amount behind.

554
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,300
 That  booger wasn't  this  booger!

555
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:35,170
Hyung, really! You know exactly where President spent that money.

556
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:39,530
- Oh is that so?
- Okay, I understand.

557
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,940
- I'll ask them to transfer you to a bigger space.
- Hey!

558
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:47,780
Just because you start talking to me in baby talk,  oooh jjoo jjo , you think I'll suddenly stop feeling bad?

559
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:49,790
This is a problem with your guys' level of sincerity. Sincerity!

560
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:52,450
Hyung. Really, this was the best I could do!

561
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:56,040
The size is not what's important. It's your guys' basic  attitude !

562
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,930
The problem is the  attitude !

563
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:01,230
The start has got to be good for the ending to be good, you punk!

564
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:04,650
Oooh,  attitude... 

565
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:21,110
 Pretty Writer 

566
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,840
 Pretty Writer 

567
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:10,810
  Editing friend's name. 
 Eun Dong. 

568
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:15,190
 Eun Dong 

569
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:24,160
Since Dong Gyu's foot is injured, looks like I'll be the one giving you rides  for a while.

570
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:30,580
- Where are we going right now?
- What do you mean, where? We're going to meet a writer.

571
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:35,110
Writer? Who? Park Jung Eun?

572
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:39,320
Park Jung Eun once told me about this superstition of hers.  If she's at a production site where the project isn't doing well,

573
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:44,950
she just needs to rent out a pension and go there to write for about a week.  And then  bam,   it blows up as a hit!

574
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:48,190
She's in Chuncheon. Let's go meet her.

575
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:52,330
 I think there are a lot of things she wants to hear from you since you're the original author. 

576
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:58,710
Wow, the first person I go to visit after I return to Korea is Writer Park Jung Eun.

577
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,360
Hey, it's been a long time since I've gone to Chuncheon,

578
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,820
and it's funny that I'm going with you, of all people.

579
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,440
You don't think it's the same for me?

580
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:11,940
Anyway, wow, it really has been a long time since the last time I went to Chuncheon.

581
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,990
The weather is great.

582
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:58,870


583
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,190
I had no idea you were coming.

584
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:48,140
This time, I found you Oppa, okay?

585
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,220
You found me well.

586
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:58,240
How'd you do it?

587
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,620
I planned it with President, to meet you like this, Oppa.

588
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:07,580
Not bad. It was dramatic.

589
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:22,600
Your company agreed to produce this drama.

590
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:26,760
- I heard.
- Also...

591
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:32,120
Writer Park Jung Eun agreed to give me credit as co-writer.

592
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:36,150
Really?  That's great.

593
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:40,200
Our Eun Dong has finally accomplished her dreams.

594
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,190
But

595
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:47,370
the main character is a woman.

596
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:53,740
It's a story about how this female character loved one man for twenty years.

597
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:01,540
The man doesn't know. He only knows about how he loved her.

598
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:10,010
That woman

599
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:14,520
loved that man much more, and before he did.

600
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:21,410
You see, at a young age of thirteen, she knew he was her first love.

601
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,640
Now I know.

602
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,840
So we can't cast you, Oppa.

603
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:46,050
- Why? 
- I heard that you refuse if the main character is a woman.

604
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:49,730
- Who said that? 
- The writer.

605
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,340
Since the topic's come up, let's talk about it.

606
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:57,760
Despite what you say, there's no doubt the male main character loved the female main character more. How could the woman love him more?

607
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,670
Absolutely not true! The woman loved him so much more.

608
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:04,280
You want to debate it, who loved who more?

609
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:08,160
- Okay, sounds good. I'm confident.
- Then from now on,

610
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,290
let's talk about who likes and loves who more.

611
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:16,180
Any time. I'm going to win that debate.

612
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,700
Okay, promise?

613
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,750
Stamp!

614
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:32,810
 - Promise.
 - Okay, promise. 

615
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:39,100
 - I'll make a promise too. 
- What's that? 

616
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:45,090
 What is it? Hey what is it? 

617
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,720
 Oppa, have you eaten? 

618
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,870
 Make me home-cooked rice. I want to eat home cooking. 

619
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:59,540
 Okay, let's go.
