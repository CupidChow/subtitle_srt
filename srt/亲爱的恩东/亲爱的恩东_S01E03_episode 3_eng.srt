1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,220
 Please look over here! 

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,140
 Ji Eun Ho, what's a positive aspect of being famous? 

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,080
I can make a lot of money.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,380
 How do you manage the money?  

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,060
 A hard question. 

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,640
It's been quite a while since I had to manage my money.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,540
 There's a rumor that's saying, out of all the male celebrities, your face is the smallest. 

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,260
At that part, it looks like I was pushed out far.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,180
Did you get an event schedule from the promotion team?

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,140
Yes. They said they would start the VIP promotions beginning on the twenty-fourth.

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,060
Don't affiliate with using the company cards.

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,880
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,080
Please drive the SNS Friend+ program.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,980
Our hotel needs to attract the younger set, and I will do FM recruiting.

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,540
Yes. I understand.

16
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,580
Did Ji Eun Ho's press conference start?

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,860
 Yes. 

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,180
 I heard you're releasing an autobiography to search for someone. 

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,800
 What exactly is that person's name? 

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,140
Ji Eun Dong.

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,320
 Is she your first love by any chance? 

22
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,140
She's my fiancÃ©e.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,200
  Ji Eun Ho! 

24
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,520
That guy's freaking autobiography...

25
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,780
I found out for the first time today. I'm serious.

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,980
The reporter at Joongang Daily seemed to already know.

27
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,700
Since Ji Eun Ho and Reporter Park were always close,

28
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,000
it was probably talked about in an unofficial conversation a while back. Ji Eun Dong...

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,840
What does that woman do?

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,060
She's just a girl Hyun Soo... No, Eun Ho, was indebted to.

31
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,480
His first love?

32
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,300
Yeah right, first love. Nothing like that. She's just like a little sister to him.

33
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,900
Ahh... Ji Eun Ho, Ji Eun Dong. Can't you tell by just hearing the names?

34
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,240
He changed his name so he could find someone that was like a little sister to him.

35
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,720
He's cool, Ji Eun Ho,

36
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,680
that he would have an innocent side to him...

37
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,920
Innocence, yeah right...

38
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,640
He said she's his fiancÃ©e.

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,740
Don't worry about it.

40
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,020
Please find her.

41
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,880
- What? 
- We have to find her.

42
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,920
I'm curious as to who she is.

43
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,680
The girl Ji Eun Ho is waiting for and couldn't forget for ten years.

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,640
I mean... Is there really a need to be curious?

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,080
I want to see what kind of girl she is.

46
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,140
 Eun Dong! Be careful! 

47
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,320
 Eun Dong! Be careful! 

48
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,180
Eun Dong...

49
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,160
Where are you?

50
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,820
Are you, by any chance, Writer Seo Jung Eun?

51
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,940
- Yes. 
 - Nice to meet you.

52
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,240
I'm Ji Eun Ho's manager, Go Dong Gyu.

53
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh, why hello!

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,040
Just as I heard, you're quite handsome! Is it because you work in the entertainment field?

55
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,320
What? Is that so?

56
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,860
You too, Mi Soon Noona kept praising you with compliments, saying

57
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,300
you're a genius writer.

58
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:48,020
Oh, not at all!

59
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,160
But... Is Ji Eun Ho not coming?

60
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,360
Oh, Eun Ho Hyung? He's going into filming.

61
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,160
He's filming for the movie  Sudden Island  in America. He leaves tomorrow.

62
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,600
I see... I thought he was coming,

63
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,080
so I was really tense while waiting.

64
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,240
You can write after listening to Eun Ho's recordings.

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,560
He's been working really hard on them for the past two days, so you'll be really busy.

66
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,900
Okay.

67
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,800
Oh and can you keep it a secret that you are Eun Ho's ghost writer?

68
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,320
Oh, of course! Don't worry!

69
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,000
But, it's not even like I'm editing the content, I'm just ghost writing.

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,360
Honestly, that shouldn't really cause a problem.

71
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,860
No, that's not it. To be honest, his entertainment company didn't know about all this.

72
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,200
After Eun Ho revealed everything at the press conference, things escalated.

73
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,160
Why would he act without his company knowing?

74
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,040
Because of the reason he's releasing this autobiography.

75
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,240
He said he's releasing his autobiography to find his first love, Unni!

76
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,660
Isn't that man so cool?

77
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,840
You know I really like Ji Eun Ho!

78
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,280
Even his appearance is so refreshing!

79
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,840
I know, right?

80
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,540
Are you not going to meet Ji Eun Ho?

81
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,600
After he sends his recordings, he said to just listen and write.

82
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,660
I would  really  get a good sense if I personally heard it from him.

83
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,600
Dong Gyu managed a lot of actors, but he said there's no one quite like Ji Eun Ho.

84
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,960
He said he never goes to round two when they all go out drinking.

85
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,160
Oh...

86
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,380
Unni, the fact that I'm his ghost writer is a secret, you know that, right?

87
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,220
Of course! I'm the one who introduced you to Dong Gyu. Zip!

88
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,100
Zip!

89
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,160
Oh! Come in.

90
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,200
Why are you here at such a late hour?

91
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,920
I can only see you if I come at a late hour.

92
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,240
You know I'm going to America tomorrow, right?

93
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,540
That's why I came.

94
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,400
Do you want tea?

95
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,980
No.

96
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,840
Ever since you took over the hotel,

97
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,180
the event promotions have become completely different. Quite amazing.

98
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,000
How is it?

99
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,060
Is what?

100
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,580
Isn't your heart racing?

101
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,720
Hey. A young, beautiful girl is hugging me from the back, at this late hour.

102
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,800
What man is there whose heart wouldn't race?

103
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,380
That's it?

104
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,780
That's it.

105
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,360
There's no way. Just wait a bit.

106
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,400
So Young.

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,780
I'm not sleeping with you.

108
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,080
If I sleep with you and I like it, it's failure.

109
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,020
Why is it a failure?

110
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,120
I'm going to keep my distance from you. I have to.

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,120
Is it because of that girl?

112
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,160
Eun Dong?

113
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,960
This is no fun. I'm leaving.

114
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,440
Okay. Take care.

115
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,480
Shouldn't it be goodbye, right now?

116
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,860
Okay, fine. Goodbye.

117
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,840
It's always like this whenever I see you.

118
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,960
My heart flutters when  I come. My heart hurts when I leave.

119
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,700
Throw me away!

120
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,100
Just wait. You'll eventually want me.

121
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,880


122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,060
Hello?

123
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,720
 Writer! If you give me your account number, I can send in your payment tomorrow.  

124
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,300
Really? Thank you so much! I'll work hard!

125
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,180
 Honey!  

126
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,980
Should we eat kalbi (barbecued short ribs) tomorrow?

127
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,260
I have money!

128
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,360
Really? That sounds good to me.

129
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,300
I sent the ghost writer's number to you through a text message.

130
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,200
Are you sure about her skills?

131
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,500
Of course.

132
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,660
My noona introduced her to me,

133
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,320
and she said she was an editor of Korean newspaper in America for a bit.

134
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,780
Then, she came to Korea a few months ago.

135
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,100
She said she writes really well.

136
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,360
That's what I'm saying. Is she a trustworthy person who will keep her mouth shut?

137
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,620
Yes. I met her and she seemed really kind.

138
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,300
She looked kind?

139
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,300
How do you know, you punk?

140
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,340
Her eyes.

141
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,860
Her eyes were really kind, especially when she smiled.

142
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,780
Hey, you were really funny this time around.

143
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,320
- Young lady? 
 - No, she's an ahjumma.

144
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,960
And yet she looked kind?

145
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,240
I mean, what does it matter if she's young or an ahjumma?

146
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm asking because your answer was funny.

147
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
You said her eyes looked kind.

148
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,980
I read people really well. From my perspective, that writer is a really nice person.

149
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,260
Okay, okay.

150
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,240
Hyung, get ready quickly.

151
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,760
I'm already set. I just have to put clothes on.

152
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,800
Hyung, wear your airport fashion.

153
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,120
Take care of Korea.

154
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,640
Truthfully, I don't feel too good about sending you alone to such a far-away place.

155
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,730
I feel like you're a kid in the water.

156
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,620
You're being overly dramatic.

157
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,060
When you get there, don't cut other people off when they are talking.

158
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,290
Hey, I need to at least know when the sentence ends in English, so I can cut it off or not.

159
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,540
 So how much of a relief is that? 

160
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,770
Oh right, we deposited the contract fee for the writer,

161
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,040
and I asked that she text or email us with any questions.

162
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,480
Did you do that writer's background check,

163
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,830
to see if she's taking any drugs?

164
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,970
What?

165
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,400
Tell her not to call me. I hate that.

166
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,350
Did Eun Ho leave?

167
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,970
At least, Kang Sin Ho accompanied him, so...

168
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,080
Yes. I confirmed his being with the manger over there.

169
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,720
Eun Ho...

170
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,620
Report everything he does, to me.

171
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,580
Stop him from writing that autobiography.

172
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,650
But, why do we have to stop it?

173
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,510
Are you just innocent, or stupid?

174
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,590
Chief Jo is breathing down our necks right now.

175
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,470
Why, at this important time, is he talking about the story like a pure love of 1988?

176
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,010
Eun Ho has to marry Chief Jo if we both want to live.

177
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,700
But since Eun Ho became this famous,

178
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,680
shouldn't that girl, Eun Dong, have already come to find him if she was alive?

179
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,350
That's what I mean. What's the point in releasing a book?

180
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,490
Is that girl pretty?

181
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,750
Chief Jo is so much prettier.

182
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,520
 Seo Jung Eun  

183
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:27,180
The size is...

184
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,570
If it doesn't fit you, come any time to exchange it.

185
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,430
- Good work. 
- Thank you.

186
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,640
Have a good day!

187
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,880
Good work.

188
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,720
Please come again!

189
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,740
Oh my legs.

190
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:52,040


191
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,580
Welcome!

192
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,690
What are you looking for?

193
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,690
Something comfortable

194
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,000
for a seven-year-old girl to wear.

195
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,550
Is 140cm (US/UK child's size 10/11) big enough?

196
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,700
Not sure. I haven't seen her in a while.

197
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,870
There's a reason for that.

198
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,830
Is she your grandchild?

199
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,380
Yes, my grandchild.

200
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,090
This looks pretty the more I look at it.

201
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,690
Here you are.

202
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,580
Yes, thank you.

203
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,150
Have a good day.

204
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,150
- Have a good day! 
- Yes.

205
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,990
 Message  

206
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,670
 Hello, this is Ji Eun Ho. 

207
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,710
 I got the message from Dong Gyu and am sending you the files. 

208
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,250
 Hello, this is Ji Eun Ho.  

209
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,810
 This is a bit awkward.  

210
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,710
 Please take care of me.  

211
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:16,050
 When I first met Eun Dong, it was on a spring day when I was in my first year of high school. 

212
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:22,650
 That day, I rode my motorcycle like crazy.  

213
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,730
 â« How did I meet you again like this? â«  

214
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,120
 That oppa didn't hit me!  

215
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,590
 I just slipped and fell.  

216
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,330
 Please don't punish him.  

217
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,340
 That's how Eun Dong came into my life.  

218
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,700
 Whether that child was eating properly. 

219
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,330
 Whether someone was bullying her.  

220
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:49,550
 A fated feeling that I should know came upon me.  

221
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,250
 Hey kiddo!  

222
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,420
 This little kid. 

223
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,850
 Your hairpin looks pretty.  

224
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,030
 I think Oppa is such a good person.  

225
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:07,200
 When I think about you,  
Oh, this girl!

226
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,330
 it's like I am getting a cramp in my heart.  

227
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,520
 Eun Dong and I were both young.  

228
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:22,960
 But when I think about Eun Dong, it's like I am getting a cramp in my heart.  

229
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:29,680
It's like I am getting a cramp in my heart? 
 Eun Dong! Eun Dong! 

230
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,260
 - Oppa, thank you. 
- I'm sorry! 

231
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,210
 I'm sorry! 

232
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,510
 I won't forget you.  

233
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,300
 Eun Dong.  

234
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,670
 I miss you.  

235
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:46,490
 I didn't know why Eun Dong had to suddenly disappear like that.  

236
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,210
 Eun Dong! Eun Dong!  

237
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:56,070
 I realized then that I didn't even know her last name.  

238
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:01,140
 â« Those days I was too young to know what love was  â«  

239
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,010
 Like a dream, like a movie, we met again.  

240
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,820
Oh my gosh, they met. They met. Wow.

241
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,900
 Just like the day I first met her ten years before, 

242
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,900
 we met like that, again.  

243
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,020
 You don't have a boyfriend, right?  

244
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,060
Eun Dong had a boyfriend?

245
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,520
 Oh, what about poor Hyun Soo? 

246
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,830
 You can let it out.  

247
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,740
 You can let it all out, Oppa.  

248
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,470
 Those are the good times. 

249
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:44,220
  â« We can just leave, back in the days, we loved  â«  

250
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:50,390
Oh, wow his personality. How could you just jump in like that?

251
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,690
Aigoo.

252
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,370
 You have to come back.  

253
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,050
 Of course, I will. 

254
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,700
 I'll be back soon, so just wait a little while.  

255
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,540
 Eun Dong told me to wait,  

256
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:17,010
 but she never came back.  

257
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,680
  â« Let's not be separated again  â«  

258
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,460
Where did she go?

259
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,300
 I, every day and all dayâ No.  

260
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,120
 For weeks, I went to look for Eun Dong.  

261
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,610
Is Teacher Eun Dong sick? Why hasn't she been here these days?

262
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,730
Teacher,

263
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,930
the thing is, I can't get a hold of Ji Eun Dong,

264
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,510
and I wanted to ask if you knew her home number.

265
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,050
I only know her cell phone number, as well.

266
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:56,760
I wonder where she went. Without any notice, either.

267
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,260
There isn't a person named Ji Eun Dong in our department.

268
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,660
There's no way. She's a student at this school.

269
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,520
I looked at all the student records.

270
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,880
There isn't a name like Ji Eun Dong.

271
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,780
No way.

272
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,080
There's no way.

273
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,490
 I looked throughout the whole school and even looked for people with similar names.  
Miss Jang Eun Dong!

274
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,150
Jang Eun Dong!

275
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,730
 Eun Dong was nowhere to be found.  

276
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,000
 And the day of lifting my summons came by.  

277
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,910
Grandma.

278
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,720
Aigoo, my goodness.

279
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,120
Your face has gotten so bad. You still haven't been able to meet Teacher Eun Dong?

280
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,700
No.

281
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,350
Grandma, I'm leaving tomorrow.

282
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,300
I am discharged from duty.

283
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,220
Is that so?

284
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,010
Umm... If you see Eun Dong,

285
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,330
can you give this letter to her?

286
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:15,040
She doesn't pick up when I call her and she doesn't reply to my texts, either.

287
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,990
She disappeared like the air.

288
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,460
She might appear again after I leave.

289
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,280
Teacher Eun Dong isn't someone like that.

290
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,430
No.

291
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,820
I did many wrong things.

292
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,320
Grandma, please make sure to give this to Eun Dong if you see her.

293
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,100
And this is my phone number.

294
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,260
If you really happen to see Eun Dong,

295
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,710
please contact me. Please.

296
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,150
Of course. I'll do that.

297
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:02,660
But, Teacher Eun Dong and you look good together.

298
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,430
Me, too.

299
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,080
I think so, too.

300
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,770
But Eun Dong isn't here right now.

301
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,130
Don't cry. Don't cry, okay?

302
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,790
 You'll meet again if it's fate. 

303
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:23,110
 If only one holds onto the red string of fate, you won't be able to meet.  

304
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:27,880
 But if you guys hold it together, you'll be able to meet.  

305
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,840
 Please believe me.  

306
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,660
 Yes, that's right.  

307
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,790
 Okay. After I check it, I'll contact you through this phone number. - Seo Jung Eun  

308
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,080
 What happened to that letter?  

309
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,450
 I went there again after many months had passed.  

310
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,700
Grandma.

311
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,160
Oh, long time no see, boy.

312
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,290
Teacher Eun Dong hasn't come yet, though.

313
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,380
But I lost that letter.

314
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,990
What do I do? I feel so sorry.

315
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:43,870
I have your phone number, but I lost the letter.

316
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:49,910
I'll call you as soon as I find that letter.

317
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,290
 And then I did an audition for "What Kind of Smile."  

318
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,830
Mr. Ji Eun Ho? Try acting a bit for me.

319
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,650
Yes, sir.

320
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,110
I'm not worth anything to you, right?

321
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:09,940
But... You're everything to me.

322
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,260
Why can't you love me too?

323
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,110
Is that so hard?

324
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,350
I waited ten years for you!

325
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,210
When I saw you again,

326
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,900
the whole universe changed for me.

327
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,160
Where on earth are you?

328
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,440
Mr. Eun Ho, hold on a second.

329
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,120
Do you want to try doing the lines from the script?

330
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,290
Page 48, second line. Give it to him.

331
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,440
I

332
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:00,110
love you for a thousand reasons.

333
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:07,080
 But, the reason why I truly love you is, 

334
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,310
because you are you.

335
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,720
Just because you are you.

336
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,490
 That day, that drama's lead changed from Jo Yoon Joo, to me. 

337
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:28,520
 And my life changed due to that drama, as well.  

338
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,720
 During the decisive moments in my life, Eun Dong was always with me.  

339
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,670
Where did you go?

340
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:55,860


341
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,880
It's so nice.

342
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,390
Unni, the story between those two is more heart wrenching than a movie.

343
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:10,630
- My heart hurts a lot, too.
- Yeah.

344
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:15,350
But no matter how much I think about it, I think he made it up.

345
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,280
Doesn't it seem like a lie? Is this even possible?

346
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
Really?

347
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,160
Yeah. They met twenty years ago and met again after ten years.

348
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,410
This is very dramatic.

349
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:30,140
And isn't the fact that a high school student felt something for a grade school student, just funny?

350
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,810
I understood that.

351
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,660
How did you understand that?

352
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,140
It must have been a fated meeting.

353
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,390
Fate...

354
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,550
Oh, it reminds me of an American TV show called  The Thornbirds. 

355
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:47,770
In that story, a young pastor had himself pulled by fate to a pea-sized kid.

356
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,500
Oh! Leonardo was in it!

357
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,020
Fated love like that exists,

358
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,450
the kind that most people don't understand.

359
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,090
Yeah, I guess it does exist.

360
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,290
It's just that the probability of such love is lower than getting struck by lightning.

361
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,610
I wish Ji Eun Ho would quickly be able to find Ji Eun Dong.

362
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,770
I want to help them.

363
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,730
But if that really  is  the truth,

364
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,000
I think that girl might have died.

365
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,980
What?

366
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,080
Hey, who is Ji Eun Ho? He is the most famous person in Korea.

367
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,020
If that girl was alive, would she have just stayed down like this,

368
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,130
when Ji Eun Ho is looking for her so passionately?

369
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,610
She must not know that he's looking for her.

370
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,710
Or she could have a specific reason as to why she can't go look for him?

371
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,620
Ji Eun Ho has stated that he was looking for that woman, in interviews, several times.

372
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,660
That girl left. She died.

373
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,640
No, she's out there somewhere.

374
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,380
I'm sure of it. Those two will meet.

375
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,840
Let's just say that they will.

376
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,560
But I am envious of that girl.

377
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:52,510
To be innocently loved by that kind of man.

378
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,450
But, Unni...

379
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:02,060
For some reason, his story wasn't unfamiliar to me.

380
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,720
I keep crying, too.

381
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,090
Isn't it funny?

382
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:11,850
You were totally into it, weren't you? You have a real professionalism.

383
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,310
The flowers are so nice.

384
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,660
I'll come back another time.

385
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,500
Yes, please do.

386
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,420
Have a good day!

387
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,210
Oh, welcome!

388
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:34,960
Oh, I came yesterday and you weren't here. I guess you aren't the boss.

389
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,200
No, the manager comes later in the afternoon. I'm just a part-timer.

390
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,900
Oh.

391
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,450
Did the clothes you bought the other day, fit well?

392
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,250
They probably did.

393
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,780
This is pretty. The colors too. Please give me this.

394
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,480
Yes.

395
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,740
You give off such a nice impression, Miss.

396
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,910
I'm not a Miss but an ahjumma.

397
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,460
Honestly. I wasn't being rude, right?

398
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,560
I don't think so.

399
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:17,100
Well that's true. Telling someone that they look younger than they are isn't really rude.

400
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,470
This is a gift.

401
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,350
I don't even know if that girl has long or short hair.

402
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,500
Take care.

403
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,700
Yes, please have a good day.

404
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:48,070
I still have the sneakers Eun Dong gave me.

405
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,900
They are on the top shelf of my shoe closet. Worn out,

406
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,650
and covered with dirt.

407
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,230
 Eun Dong left me with one promise.  

408
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:15,650
 But that promise, I still don't know what it is.  

409
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,900
- So? You love it when you read books to your grandma? 
- Yeah.

410
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,860
Grandma said that her pain goes away when I read books to her.

411
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,290
So, I love reading to my grandma, the most.

412
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,270
Well, now I've come to love other things as well.

413
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,940
I see.

414
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,860
What do you like the most, Oppa?

415
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,720
I love it when I'm riding my motorcycle.

416
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,190
All my thoughts go away.

417
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,890
Well, now I've come to love some things more.

418
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:11,140
Oppa, be careful riding your motorcycle.

419
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,060
It's very dangerous.

420
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,950
Okay.

421
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,730
Promise?

422
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,100
Sure. I promise.

423
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,200
I'll promise you something as well.

424
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,950
What?

425
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,000
What is it? Hey!

426
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:51,450
Idiot. You didn't even know that?

427
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:58,060
 I pray that Eun Dong's promise was that we'd meet again. 

428
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,220
 Eun Dong. 

429
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,930
We...

430
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,930
We met for such a short amount of time

431
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:27,300
and were separated for such a long period of time.

432
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,530
 Eun Dong. 

433
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,080
 Eun Dong. 

434
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,960
 We have to meet again. 

435
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,750
 No. We will meet, 

436
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,380
 because I'm going to look for you until we meet. 

437
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:57,060
How is this guy being so real?

438
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:07,560
â«   Your scent comes to me   â«

439
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:12,870
â«   It remains in my heart so that I can't forget   â«

440
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:17,390
â«   The feelings I hid from you   â«

441
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:22,910
 Just like Eun Dong's words, "A star that forms the latest, lasts the longest,"  

442
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:29,530
  if it means that the longer it takes to meet again, the more we'll shine the brightest and longest... I will wait. 

443
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:34,220
â«   She comes to me   â«

444
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:42,440
â«   She makes my hardened heart flutter   â«

445
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,890
â«   I keep thinking of your face  â«

446
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,580
â«  Your whole being comes to mind   â«

447
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:55,300
â«   What should I do about this feeling in my heart?   â«

448
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,950
 The poem about fate you memorized when you were in the hospital back in high school, 

449
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,370
 do you still have the book? 

450
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:08,340
â«   My heart fluttering love   â«

451
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,180
 No. I don't have it.  

452
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:18,850
â«   I, who breathe because of you   â«

453
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:24,630
 The flowers bloomed. 

454
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,520
 The beautiful moment was short. 

455
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,000
 When we were in our excited prime, the wide wind and the heavens... 

456
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,300
 You were the one who left my side first. 

457
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,910
 You really memorized this entire poem? 

458
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,800
 Oppa, I really like this poem. 

459
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,650
 It's me! 

460
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:58,410
 - Wow, this came out so well! 
- Of course!  

461
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,950
 This one too! 

462
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:03,130
 - This came out well too, right? 
 - Yeah!

463
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:08,560
 I seem like a pig here. 

464
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,350
 You can have the poetry book. Give me the photos. 

465
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,230
 No! This is the only weird photo. 

466
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:17,540
 No, give them to me! I will decide what's pretty and what's not. 

467
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,800
 Hey! Really... 

468
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,830
  - Stop right there! 
- I'm not giving them back! 

469
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:29,040
 Just wait 'til you get caught... 

470
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,980
 I got you! 

471
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,440
Wow. You'll get a Nobel Prize at this rate.

472
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,460
The Nobel Prize for ghostwriting.

473
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,050
If Nobel doesn't give you a prize, I'll give you one, so just  sleep.

474
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:10,070
Okay. After I do this.

475
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,650
Wow. You're working really hard.

476
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:16,610
- Then I'll put Ra Il to sleep when he comes. 
- Okay.

477
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,220
Aren't you overworking yourself?

478
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,390
I told my part-time job I'd only work on Wednesdays and weekends.

479
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:42,490
Good job. Is work fun?

480
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:48,020
It's so fun. I wrote my best work for this ghost writing business.

481
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:54,030
I want to write it for him as soon as possible, because this man is looking for his first love.

482
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,590
His first love?

483
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:02,120
No. It's beyond thatâhis fated beloved.

484
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,610
That's how he put it.

485
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,520
His fated woman?

486
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,330
Just like you and me. That's how we met.

487
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,490
Just like fate. Love at first sight.

488
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:18,340
There's no way he loved her like we love each other.

489
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,840
If we're first, then he's definitely second.

490
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,080
That's quite amazing, being second.

491
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,320
How can I help you?

492
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,890
There's a grandma who took a Korean class for the elderly in 2005.

493
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,500
Could I find her?

494
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,260
2005?

495
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,990
Actor Ji Eun Ho served here, right?

496
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,140
Yes.

497
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:06,000
Drink this. When Ji Eun Ho worked here, Lee Seok Tae served alongside him as a civil servant,

498
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,330
although Lee Seok Tae lost his fame.

499
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,290
I see...

500
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,250
But why are you looking for that grandma?

501
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:20,760
Actor Ji Eun Ho is currently looking for his first love. That grandma has the letter he wrote to her.

502
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,270
Would documents from that time still exist?

503
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:28,650
Could I upload that onto our discussion board?

504
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,340
That's a really good idea!

505
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,940
I have one condition.

506
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,090
His autograph?

507
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:41,510
It's not something I need. It's...

508
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:48,320
As I'm writing his autobiography, he said he gave the letter he wrote to Eun Dong, to a grandmother.

509
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,830
But I want to find that grandma and include it in the autobiography, but the ward

510
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,980
wants his autograph.

511
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,330
Oh... I'll get you his autograph.

512
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,270
I can just get you ten, right?

513
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,620
No, I don't need that many... Yes.

514
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,670
Work has been going well, right?

515
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,400
Yes. I'm almost done.

516
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,690
Hyung always records during his free time so that, on set, they say he became an otaku. 
(Japanese term for someone who has obsessive interests)

517
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,470
I mean, he must have mumbled to himself in a corner many times.

518
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,600
Hyung came back today. He should be coming sometime soon.

519
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,480
Stay and meet him.

520
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:34,900
Can I do that? Oh goodness... This is so nerve-wracking.

521
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,910
Here.

522
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,580
Because I'm so thankful to you for giving me payment of writing, in advance, and for

523
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,770
being so considerate in other ways.

524
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,060
Why would you do this? Thank you.

525
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,490
It's nothing. I'm more thankful.

526
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,510
Yes, Director.

527
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:00,700
I finished speaking with the writer.

528
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,630
Excuse me, Writer. You may have to leave today.

529
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,460
- Why? 
-  We're more thankful. 

530
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,520
I will explain later.

531
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,450
Please leave.

532
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,520
Okay.

533
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,270
I will get you ten autographs.

534
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,660
Yes. Thank you! Goodbye.

535
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,810
Get home safely.

536
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,540
Hey. Who is that?

537
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,750
No one.

538
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,860
Who is she?

539
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,350
Hyung will be here soon.

540
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,130
 I'm such a big fan of yours! 

541
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,630
What did you say your name was?

542
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,180
Thank you!

543
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,050
Hyung, you're already here?

544
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,850
I have my luggage in the car. I'm going to go home right away.

545
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,480
Okay. Nothing happened, right?

546
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,260
You're asking me that? Shouldn't you be finding out for yourself?

547
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,310
You're here?

548
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,310
- You come to my office. 
- Okay.

549
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,790
Bring cool drinks, okay?

550
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,780
How was filming?

551
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,460
I was monitoring Twitter, and you were practically at Brad Pitt status.

552
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,300
President Hwang, did you cause an incident again?

553
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,400
Aigoo... I don't know either.

554
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,760
This is the last time I'm covering for you out of loyalty. Take your hands off this.

555
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,060
Do you have a plan?

556
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,540
You take over the president position.

557
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,380
Really?

558
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,920
Then do you want me to do it? And

559
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,200
stop meeting Chief Jo. I'm not letting you off.

560
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,960
Why do you not like her? I really don't understand.

561
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,780
Why would I not like her?

562
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,220
She's rich, pretty, and smart.

563
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,340
Yeah. Then, why?

564
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,120
So what?

565
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Forget it. Let's not.

566
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,060
Anyway, don't start something with her.

567
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,360
I warned you.

568
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,700
Yes, Sir.

569
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,940
I feel like I'm dying.

570
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,360
Hyung, don't sleep right now.

571
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,340
Shut up.

572
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,980
You need to adapt to the time difference.

573
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,000
You have an interview tomorrow. You have a packed schedule tomorrow.

574
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,440
Hey. Don't schedule anything for me for three days.

575
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,500
What are you planning to do?

576
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,220
To spend those days idly.

577
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,140
Was it that hard?

578
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,640
I'm sleeping.

579
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,000
Ah, the ghostwriter came by today.

580
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,940
That woman with kind eyes?

581
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,080
She wanted your autograph.

582
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,700
Just say I'll get her a meal.

583
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,320
A meal?

584
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,320
Hey, how old is that writer?

585
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,200
Huh, let's see. Around thirty?

586
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,840
She's pretty.

587
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,260
She has kind eyes and she's pretty.

588
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,180
It's true. She's really pretty.

589
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,440
Really? Hey body is nice too, right?

590
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,320
Oh, yeah.

591
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,640
Aish, I knew it! You chose her because she was pretty, right?

592
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,760
No. Such nonsense.

593
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,200
Just wait. If that book comes out childish,

594
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
I won't leave you alone.

595
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,460
I'm fully awake now because of you!

596
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,640
Did you put the beer in the refrigerator?

597
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,060
Yes. I bought almonds and cheese, too. Do you want me to get you some?

598
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,220
No, thanks.

599
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,620
Ah, the ahjumma who was supposed to work is coming next week.

600
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:10,940
She can make a variety of food such as Korean food, Chinese food and Western food.

601
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,720
Aigoo...

602
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,200
Ah... What a wasted opportunity.

603
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,440
Should I have introduced myself?

604
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,500
 Eun Dong. 

605
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,980
 Sure. I promise.  

606
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:01,640
 Eun Dong, we have to meet again.  

607
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,040
 No. We will meet.  

608
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,460
 I will look for you until I find you.  

609
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:17,560
 Eun Dong. Eun Dong.  

610
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,980
 We have to meet again.  

611
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,300
 No. We will meet.  

612
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,220
 I will look for you until I find you.  

613
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,860
Uncle!

614
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:41,220
Oh, Mi Na!

615
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,580
Aigoo, my Mi Na. Give me a kiss.

616
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,480
Have you been well?

617
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,760
Uncle. Why did you come now? I waited for you.

618
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,620
Oh, sorry. I went to America.

619
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,660
I bought you presents from America.

620
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,040
Wow, I'm so excited!

621
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,280
Open them in your room, okay?

622
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,440
- Oppa, you came? 
- Yeah.

623
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,240
Hey, what kind of smell is this? Are you cooking something?

624
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,180
You didn't eat yet, right?

625
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:09,200
Hey, when I come to your house, I eat some kimbap from the convenience store.

626
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,080
Is she sleeping?

627
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,920
Yeah.

628
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,380
She's exactly like her father.

629
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,640
She sleeps as soon as she puts her head down.

630
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,940
Mom bought Mi Na some clothes and left them in the security office.

631
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,060
She's done that quite a few times.

632
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,920
How did you know it was Mom?

633
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,860
The security office man said that

634
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,980
a grandma looking exactly like me, left them.

635
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,320
I'm such a bad daughter.

636
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,240
When I went to school, you were so rebellious.

637
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,680
Mom and Dad didn't give any attention to me,

638
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,220
so I studied constantly, just

639
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,640
to try and get their attention.

640
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,000
Rather than me being first in my class, you reading the poems made

641
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,520
Mother happier.

642
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,280
So you should've kept your rebellion to a minimum!

643
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,700
Hey, I wasn't rebelling that much.

644
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:38,240
Mom, I wonder how much her heart ached

645
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,400
when I said I wanted to marry a man dying from cancer,

646
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,600
left home,

647
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,580
and cut off our ties?

648
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,360
Let's go home.

649
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,640
See Mom and Father as well.

650
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,260
You need to marry first for her to feel better.

651
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:09,660
And is it true that you're looking for Eun Dong?

652
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,740
Are you really releasing a book?

653
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,340
Yeah.

654
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:18,200
What if Eun Dong married already?

655
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,540
I can't imagine

656
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,800
her being married.

657
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,700
But still, it must be nice for you.

658
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,260
You have the hope of meeting her again.

659
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,500
Why do I act pitifully?

660
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,100
Jung Eun.

661
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,420
Jung Eun!

662
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,360
Jung Eun, go inside and sleep.

663
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,040
Jung Eun.

664
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,900
Oh my!

665
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,700
Did you finish sleeping?

666
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,220
Oh my. Look at me. What should I do?

667
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,780
You should have woken me up.

668
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,780
How could I wake you when you were sleeping so soundly?

669
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:19,000
So you were waiting for me like this? You should have told me.

670
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,980
Let's go inside and sleep. You said you have work early in the morning tomorrow.

671
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,080
Yeah. I'm sorry.

672
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,340
Ah, let's go in. I'll lay you down.

673
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,400
Clean up first.

674
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,980
I wasn't able to put on the finishing touches.

675
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,100
You're going to pull an all-nighter?

676
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:37,900
Since I got the money in advance, I felt the need to send them a draft, first.

677
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,640
I only have to write a little more.

678
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:43,600
You spend the whole day working while standing. You should at least be able to sleep comfortably.

679
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,300
I understand.

680
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,780
Let's hurry up and go inside.

681
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,180
I'm going crazy!

682
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:35,820


683
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,140
Hello?

684
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,900
You made me unable to sleep.

685
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,300
You need to feel the same way as I do, you punk.

686
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,660
 Are you a pervert?  

687
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:02,040
Stop doing things like this and sleep.

688
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,880
This punk...

689
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,480
I need to be able to sleep in order to sleep.

690
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,390
Alright, Go Dong Gyu,

691
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:11,390
I've forgiven you.

692
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:14,990
I'll believe in your sense.

693
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,750
Take care of your father's as well, okay? Bye honey!

694
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:32,570
- Are you going to do mine as well? 
- Yeah.

695
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,300
Mom, milk!

696
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,180
Oh, just wait a moment.

697
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:44,750
Hey, you didn't get your bag ready? You should have gotten it ready beforehand, since you know Mom is busy.

698
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:49,360
Didn't I tell you to prepare it before you sleep? Huh?

699
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:52,370
- Sorry, Mom. 
- Here.

700
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:54,860
You should eat too, Honey.

701
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,890
Oh, hold on.

702
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:01,030
Wait. Take your time. We still have time.

703
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:05,170
My sneakers. Sneakers.

704
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,010
The weather is so nice.

705
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:20,870
Isn't it?

706
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:25,980
What can I do about you just looking at this nice world?

707
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:32,910
I've run a lot already. I can just see as much as I want now.

708
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:37,160
You will be able to walk. Don't talk like that.

709
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:45,150
I want to carry Ra Il on my shoulders once. That is my wish.

710
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:48,930
I want to be able to do it for him before he gets bigger.

711
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:37,000
 The grandchild of the grandmother who was in that Korean class, is one of our employees.  

712
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:45,410
 Someone told us after seeing the bulletin. He found out the phone number of the grandma that had the letter.  

713
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:50,610
I'm so thankful. I will make sure to get you Ji Eun Ho's autograph!

714
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:53,970
Yes, yes. Thank you!

715
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,980
I mean all this luggage is so heavy. I really wish it wasn't all this.

716
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,720
I think it would be okay to do this much, then.

717
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,890
Then, I'll ask him first. Please wait a moment.

718
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:24,290
Hyung! You can't sleep  right now! 

719
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:27,310
Paparazzi are following and strange rumors are going around.

720
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:30,170
Honestly, I can't even sleep?

721
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:33,060
Wake up and don't sleep.

722
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,400
Look behind you. The reporters' eyes are red.

723
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:53,560
 I found that grandma, the one who lost your letter.  

724
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:03,240
 Ji Eun Ho  

725
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:07,750
The part-timers these days...

726
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:12,070
- Hello?
 - This is Ji Eun Ho. 

727
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:17,430
 This is Writer Seo Jung Eun, right? 

728
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:21,440
- Yes.
 - Did you really find that grandma? 

729
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,780
Yes.

730
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,630
Ah, I see. Then...

731
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:33,170
Shall the three of us have a meal together?

732
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:34,340
What?

733
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,980
 Hyung. Get ready. They're starting. 

734
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,790
Ah, I'm sorry.

735
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:44,370
 I will contact you again through text or a call. 

736
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,570
 You can't.  

737
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:55,820
 Oh, kiddo. Eun Dong, be careful!  

738
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:59,010
 Sure.  

739
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:00,560
 I promise you.  

740
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,060
 I will look for you until I find you.  

741
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,240
Unni, I'm sorry. I'm really late, right?

742
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,240
- It's okay. 
- Yes.

743
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,840
 Hello, Boss! 

744
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,750
 -  I have a matching card.
-  No, not matched. 

745
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:39,320
Okay, okay, okay.

746
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,040
Aigoo, I got a call.

747
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:43,880
Hello?

748
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,440
 Is this Grandma Yi Ga Eul?  

749
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,670
Ah yes, that's right.

750
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:52,420
Hello, you heard about someone looking for your phone number on the discussion board, right?

751
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:56,500
Aigoo, of course I did.

752
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,630
The letter that Ji Eun Ho wrote to Ji Eun Dong,

753
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:02,740
did you find that?

754
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:06,440
Aigoo, I wasn't able to find that letter yet.

755
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:13,360
 This old timer lost that letter, and it was such an important letter, too! 

756
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:20,090
 That boy cried and begged me to give that letter to her, too.  

757
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:25,840
On that envelope of that letter, it said this,

758
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,520
 The person I love, Eun Dong.  

759
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,140
 Eun Dong. 

760
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:36,340
 Aigoo, my heart aches. Those two really loved each other!  

761
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,660
No...

762
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:42,670
 Hello?  

763
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,160
Ah, Grandma, I'm sorry.

764
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,490
I will call you back later.

765
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:12,190
 Ji Eun Ho.  

766
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:23,130
 - Writer Seo, I'm sorry about earlier. 
- Eun Dong. Eun Dong! 

767
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,550
Hello?

768
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:28,790
Miss Writer.

769
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:33,040
 - Miss Writer? 
Eun Dong, you are doing well, right?  

770
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:39,300
 - Eun Dong.
- I will find you! 

771
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:43,810
 Eun Dong, we have to meet again.  

772
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:45,960
 I will look for you until I find you.  

773
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,310
 Eun Dong! 

774
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:54,420


775
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:00,430
 Was there someone else with my husband Choi? 

776
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:04,870
 You have to take responsibility for your actions. You must not abandon him.  

777
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:08,360
 You're unconsciously wanting to become Eun Dong.  

778
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,310
 Hurry up and drink.  

779
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:13,370
 I really don't like you or that writer.  

780
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:17,590
 I really think you're different from others. Your memories, recover them.  

781
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:20,490
 - Who is this? It's Teacher Eun Dong! 
- What? 

782
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:21,940
 Do you not know me?  

783
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,720
  Her name is Seo Jung Eun. 

784
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,950
 That girl Eun Dong. How old is she?  

785
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:30,170
 That writer. You said you saw her right?  

786
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,400
 Who are you?
