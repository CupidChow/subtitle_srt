00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:06,890
 My Love Eun Dong  
 Episode 10 

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,170
 Hyung, we are here! We only have one hour. 

3
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:44,090


4
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,700
You lost some weight!

5
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,810
It's been awhile since I filmed dramas, so it is a bit tiring.

6
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,130
I am proud of the fact that you are my brother.

7
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,360
Of course, where can you find a brother like me?

8
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,270
Let's go eat!

9
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,920
I asked you here because I have something to say to you.

10
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,790
About what?

11
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,370
There's a patient who got into a car accident ten years ago.

12
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,980
Due to compression fractures of the C7 cervical vertebrae,

13
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,950
the spinal nerves located behind the C7 vertebrae became damaged.

14
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,400
His lower body became paralyzed and he became disabled.

15
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,560
But right now that man is having a difficult time, not physically but emotionally.

16
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,610
Another man showed up in front of the man's wife.

17
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,390
Her twenty year, fated, first love.

18
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,240
Oppa!

19
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,750
Are you his doctor?

20
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,180
Are you her husband's doctor?

21
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,960
Is it right?

22
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,220
You must be an authoritative doctor in your field.

23
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,290
Of all the neurologists, how could he be linked to you?

24
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,890
I feel crappy.

25
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,430
Don't shake up that man's family.

26
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,390
Honestly, I didn't want to interfere.

27
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:01,220
And more than anyone, I wanted you to meet Eun Dong,

28
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,730
but those two must not be separated.

29
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,830
You called to tell me that?

30
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,690
- To the hospital? 
 - Yes!

31
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,210
I wanted to see you, wearing my doctor's gown.

32
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:14,730
I want to protect my patient. What I mean is that I want to remove all the obstacles that get in the way of his rehabilitation.

33
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,660
It's the same without my gown. I can't take your side this time.

34
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,910
You'll get hurt!

35
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,840
Who would be on my side in this world? I don't even expect it.

36
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,160
Let me ask you one thing.

37
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,820
That man... Can he sleep with a woman?

38
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,880
- Oppa! 
 -  Answer me! 

39
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,490
I must know. Can that man sleep with his wife?

40
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,950
No, it is impossible.

41
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,460
Why are you curious about that?

42
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,650
Fine.

43
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,920
I need to get going. I left in the middle of filming.

44
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,640
- Let's go 
 -  Yes.  

45
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,010
Driver, I am sorry but let's go to Shinsa-dong.

46
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,330
  DM President Lee Hyun Bal 

47
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,570
 Myung Sung Group, C&amp;K Entertainment  Launches New Company 
Plans for Industry Advancement are in "Full Swing"  

48
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,320
 Myung Sung Group, C&amp;K Entertainment  Launches New Company 
Plans for Industry Advancement are in "Full Swing"  

49
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,930
President!

50
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,220
We finished rehearsal practice and the acting coach just left.

51
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,340
Okay, you may go home.

52
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,180
You are getting gray lately.

53
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,040
I thought maybe it's because you worry about us.

54
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,380
I heard it's good for preventing gray.

55
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,690
Okay, I'll enjoy drinking it.

56
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,520
Are you going home?

57
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,710
No.

58
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,850
Then where?

59
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,270
To my part time work.

60
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,400
What are doing there?

61
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,150
I teach piano to children at a music academy.

62
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,570
- Are you good at playing piano? 
- Yes

63
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,590
Why didn't you list it as one of your specialties?

64
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,520
I didn't realize it was a specialty.

65
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,280
Where is the piano school?

66
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,380
You have a guest, President!

67
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,050
Ah, really?

68
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,830
I understand. You may leave.

69
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,730
I heard you came because of Ji Eun Ho. Is that right?

70
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:04,360
Yes. I came because I have no contact information.

71
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,320
Regarding what?

72
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,540
I think he is meeting my wife more than is needed for work.

73
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,640
 Seo Jung Eun.  

74
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,960
She is my wife.

75
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,730
As you can see, I am disabled from the waist down, so

76
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,490
it's a little difficult for me to take care of this problem through physical force.

77
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,310
So, you are Eun Dong...

78
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,010
Seo Jung Eun's husband, right?

79
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,350
I won't take it any more!

80
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,830
If he lingers around my wife one more time,

81
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,010
I'll do everything I can, as her husband.

82
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:52,040
This is all I have to say for today. Please make sure to relay this message to him.

83
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,350
Ohh! This is the

84
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,480
place you talked about?

85
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,780
It's nice!

86
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,730
 Welcome! 

87
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,000
Hello!

88
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,300
You've gotten prettier since I saw you last!

89
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,020
Hello!

90
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,620
Yes.

91
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,800
Ahjumma, hello!

92
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,980
Oh, Mi Na!

93
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,790
Oh my? Do you know our Mi Na?

94
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,600
Yes. Then are you Doctor Park Hyun Ah's mother?

95
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,810
Yes, I am!

96
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,000
What a small world!  Meeting you like this..

97
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,840
- Hahaha.
 - Do you know my daughter?

98
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,650
Yes!

99
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,040
How can this happen?

100
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,060
Grandmother, how about this dress?

101
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,040
This one?

102
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,080
Just a moment!

103
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,060
Mi Na, let's go over there and try this on, okay?

104
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,180
 - Yes   
 - Shall we?

105
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:32,980
If you stare at a young woman for that long, it's considered a crime these days.

106
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,400
That lady gives off a very good impression.

107
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,590
I know, right? I really like her too.

108
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,750
Here we go!

109
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,260
We have new merchandise coming in next week, so come back again.

110
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,690
You can exchange it to better one.

111
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,450
Have you eaten?

112
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,520
Pardon?

113
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,410
You are being silly!  You want to eat with her if she hasn't eaten yet?

114
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,240
Make sure you eat while working.

115
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,930
Yes, I'll make sure to do that.

116
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,300
Hello! I am Jo Se Ryeong of Myungsung Hotel.

117
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,970
Hi, I am Choi Jae Ho.

118
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,610
I am honored to shake a golden hand.

119
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:38,870
No, the honor is all mine. I thank you for your support and I'll do my best to cultivate the Eclipse to the fullest.

120
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:44,220
Of course, you have to. To tell you the truth, I don't know much about baseball, nor am I interested.

121
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,560
Then why are providing sponsorship?

122
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,250
Ji Eun Ho.

123
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,470
Do you know the relationship between Ji Eun Ho and your wife?

124
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,270
How would you know about that?

125
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,720
I am interested in Ji Eun Ho, as a man.

126
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,890
Then, that is the reason for your support?

127
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:11,520
We may seem different, but we both have the same goal,

128
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,260
breaking that awful relationship between Ji Eun Ho and Seo Jung Eun.

129
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,680
To do that, you need power. I'll make that power for you.

130
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,380
You seem smarter than me.

131
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,190
I can trust you, right?

132
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,730
Yes, you can trust me, because I have never lost to anyone other than to Ji Eun Ho.

133
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,640
 - Hyung, come and have some!   
 - Thank you! We'll enjoy it!  

134
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,810
  Not hungry! 

135
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,020
  Thank you! We'll enjoy! 

136
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,710
Lalalala...

137
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,240
  Don't shake up that man's family   Those two must not be separated.  

138
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:16,390
 Whether I have memory of my past or not, I am my husband's wife and my son's mother. 

139
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,370
 This is the end for us.  

140
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,140
  Ji Eun Ho. 

141
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,150
Come on in.

142
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,950
Where is Ra Il?

143
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,700
He's sleeping. Did everything go well today?

144
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,350
Yes.

145
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,600
You must be tired. Let's wash up.

146
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:12,690


147
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,960
Honey!

148
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,840
Right, I am getting better like this.

149
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:33,230
When did you get better like this?

150
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:39,660
I believed this was the only way I could make you feel responsible for me and have you stay by my side.

151
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,410
That was the only reason why I didn't tell you.

152
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:51,350
If you keep meeting that person, it will taint you.

153
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,190
Jae Ho!

154
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,720
He did it back then and he's doing it now. He is a negative influence and makes you a bad person.

155
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,480
Don't let me see you becoming bad.

156
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,460
It's too difficult for me.

157
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,650
Nothing has changed.

158
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:16,900
Just give me a little time. I am just a bit confused.

159
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,240
That man,

160
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,650
do you like him  that much? 

161
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,810
Do you really like seeing him  that much? 

162
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,600
No.

163
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,230
He has no meaning to me.

164
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,410
Let's not talk about it any more.

165
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,920
Don't take his money either. Don't do it any more.

166
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,830
This is an order as your husband.

167
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,520
Yes.

168
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,980
I won't accept it any more, and I won't see him any more, either.

169
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,120
What brought you here so late at night?

170
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,990
What is it?

171
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,270
Someone came by at the company today.

172
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,890
Who?

173
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:32,690
- Eun Dong's husband. That man came by.  
 - What?

174
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:38,320
He said he won't take it any more if you linger around his wife again.

175
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,670
This dog bastard! How dare he barge in there!

176
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,370
Hey you bastard! Why are you telling me that now, you asshole!

177
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,870
  That man, do you really like him that much?
 Do you really like seeing him that much? 

178
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:50,110
 No, he has no meaning to me. 

179
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,160
  Hello? 

180
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,390
It's me.

181
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,090
Yes.

182
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,910
  What are you doing? 

183
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
Don't you miss me?

184
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,060
- Ji Eun Ho! 
-  Ji Eun Dong!  

185
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,910
I'll play fair.

186
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:57,300
Okay fine, I acknowledge you have a husband.

187
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,290
But what about the fact that I can't give up on you?

188
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,530
- Ji Eun Ho! 
- You were  my  woman in the first place.

189
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,610
So,

190
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,660
let's take this to the end until one of us dies.

191
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,530
Ji Eun Ho!

192
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:26,240
 Park Hyun Soo!   
I am not Ji Eun Ho, I'm Park Hyun Soo!

193
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,370
And you are not Seo Jung Eun, you're Ji Eun Dong!

194
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,700
 Don't know if you like the scenario? 

195
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,040
 - The relationships between these characters...
- Professor Kang!   

196
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,570
 Look who's here?  You've been well? 

197
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,960
 - We were having a meeting    
- Ahh!

198
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,300
 You know this actor Ji Eun Ho, right?  

199
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,550
  Ah, hello! 

200
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,630
 Chairman Cho's eldest daughter. 

201
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,610
  - We'll resume our meeting.  
 - Oh, yes.

202
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,780
  Let's continue. 

203
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,290
  To select a piece of work, 

204
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,210
  you need to take your time. 

205
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,600
  Oh, yes.  

206
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:43,860
  Yeah?  Ah, yeah. 

207
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,400
  Ah! 

208
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,220
 What did you say? I am sorry.  

209
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,390
 - Shall we wrap it up for today?   
 -  Let's talk about it some other time. 

210
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,670
  Director, can I borrow your pen? 

211
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:06,500
  The scenario is good. 

212
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,660
  You can do it.  

213
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,490
  Let's do well. 

214
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,270
  I'll be leaving now. 

215
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,830
 - We need to come back one more time.   
 - Ah, yeah.

216
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,420
 I am your fan. You look even more handsome in person.  

217
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,530
  Pleased to meet you. 

218
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:53,070
 This hotel's coffee is horrible. You should change the barista.   

219
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,400
I like it.

220
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,960
Have you arrived?  Yes, I'll be right down. Okay.

221
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,260
Can you guess where I am?

222
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,720
Where are you?

223
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,020
 Hello!  

224
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:11,330
You are coming with me to the event tomorrow, right?

225
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:17,120
Everybody wants to see you. I heard your father is coming, too.

226
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,750
- My father, too? 
 - Yeah.

227
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,370
So, let's get you all dolled up and go together.

228
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,560
Okay, I will go.

229
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,080
- Your phone just rang. 
 - Who?

230
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,100
 Ji Eun Ho!  

231
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:45,130
Why is this guy calling someone else's wife, and then he's got nothing to say?

232
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,810
If he's got business to talk about, then he should talk.

233
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,540
I won't take it any more.

234
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:02,580


235
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,120
Hyung!  Mrs. Ttak said she brewed this all day.

236
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,030
So, let's have some.

237
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,070
Dog bastard!

238
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,450
I didn't say it to you.

239
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,360
The planning for the Eclipse sponsorship celebration event is going well, right?

240
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,950
Yes, without any hitch.

241
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,690
Pay special attention to it manager. We are doing a good deed.

242
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,550
I understand.

243
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,460
You may leave.

244
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,850
- Yes, Choi Jae Ho! 
 - Yeah.

245
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,710
- I have a favor to ask. 
 - Anything, you are the main event!

246
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,530
I would like to see Ji Eun Ho tomorrow night.

247
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:14,890
- I don't think that's a good idea. 
 - No.

248
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,460
Right now, with Ji Eun Ho acting very self-centered and aggressive, I have absolutely no intention of avoiding him.

249
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,880
I'll face him head on.

250
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:28,620
- I guess you could do that. It won't be difficult. 
 - Thank you.

251
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,860
Or it could go the other way and add more fuel to his fire.

252
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,880
Hello, President Lee!

253
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:00,080
Of course, Ji Eun Ho's attendance will help make you shine

254
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,540
and bring attention to the event as well.

255
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,130
Of course, he will be there!

256
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,600
Because our operations depend on an annual support fund,

257
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,870
there isn't enough money for training.

258
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:16,340
What hurts the most is that they don't have decent team uniforms.

259
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:21,660
 - Thank you   
  - Pleased to meet you. 

260
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,380
Nice!

261
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,380
Do Ah! Can you come here for a moment?

262
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,910
It's good, but

263
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,740
- you should throw it with more force.
- Yes, I got it.

264
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,570
Uhm, this is good.

265
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,510
Is something going on?

266
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,420
Looks tasty.

267
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,700
I heard that if, while you're in the middle of eating really good food,

268
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,300
you start wishing you could share it with a certain person, then it means that you've truly fallen for them.

269
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,960
Generally, on an instinctual level, human beings are selfish and only think about themselves when it comes to food.

270
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,480
The brain function suppressing that instinct

271
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,890
is only possible if you really like that person.

272
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,310
Who are you thinking about, looking at this food?

273
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,640
Is it Ji Eun Ho?  Or Choi Jae Ho?

274
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:47,170
- I am thinking about Ra Il. 
 - Hmm, right!

275
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,490
Of course you should be thinking about your child!

276
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,920
Jung Eun! You want to take a trip to Jeboo Island with me tomorrow?

277
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,030
- Jeboo Island? 
 - Yes, my uncle built a pension after he retired.

278
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,380
Oh, that Ji Eun Ho's manager, my cousin—they are his parents.

279
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,780
I was going to go with my husband,

280
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,440
but the troublemaker said he's going on a business trip tomorrow.

281
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,890
I thought about canceling it, but I changed my mind, seeing you.

282
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,490
- Let's go for two nights and three days.
- I love it Unni.

283
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,230
- I wanted go somewhere. I really like it. 
 - Shall we leave tomorrow?

284
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,420
Tomorrow, I even took the day off from the store because Jae Ho has a big event.

285
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:29,530
If it's alright with you, then let's leave the day after. Let's leave together.

286
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,120
Okay, let's leave the day after.

287
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,110
Eat up! It's getting cold.

288
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,380
Hi Grandmother!

289
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,470
 Teacher Eun Dong!  

290
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,680
Teacher Eun Dong.

291
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,540
Yes, Grandmother.

292
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,380
Aigoo! Sit, sit.

293
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,460
Teacher Eun Dong, have you realized now that you are Teacher Eun Dong?

294
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,760
Aigoo, right!

295
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,880
You did well!  Good! Yes, that's right, no matter what!

296
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,740
Aigoo.

297
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,440
I lost my memory.

298
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,880
Ah, I thought as much.

299
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,680
But, have you met that bachelor?

300
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,300
At any rate, when you see that bachelor, tell him I said hello.

301
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,760
Finally,

302
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,540
this letter is going to its rightful owner.

303
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,700
Do you know where I found this letter?

304
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,800
 I was just lying on the floor in my room and looked under the furniture  

305
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,340
 and saw something like an envelope.   
 My Love Eun Dong  

306
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:05,000
 I was curious to see what it is, so I dragged it out, then realized it was this letter.  
 My Love Eun Dong 

307
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,040
 This letter was asking to be sent to the rightful owner.   
 My Love Eun Dong  

308
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:13,160
 It revealed itself to me where I could see it!  

309
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,980
Thank you.

310
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,420
  My Love Eun Dong 

311
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,800
  Then at least you should be living well, 

312
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,160
 so that I can give you up right away. You should be living well! 

313
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,600
  Hope Baseball Team
"Eclipse" Sponsorship Day of Celebration 

314
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:53,590


315
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,340
 Hyung! It seems your outfit is ready at the hotel. 

316
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,920
Since you made a special effort to attend, 
despite being busy with filming,

317
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,940
they are requesting that you make a short speech.

318
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:22,380
No big deal. It's not like I'd have to make up a story that isn't true.

319
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,020
The fact is, I  am  going there in the midst of filming.

320
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,620
What kind of event is it anyway? We should know what it is beforehand.

321
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,800
I asked President, earlier.

322
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,200
He said it's nothing major.

323
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,440
I think the president is coming, too.

324
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,080
Sunbae, did you come?

325
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,880
Hello.

326
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,600
Congratulations!

327
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,360
Thank you for not only sponsoring me but also making such a valuable event.

328
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,560
I sincerely thank you.

329
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,200
Hello.

330
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,740
Are you the wife of athlete Choi Jae Ho?

331
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,180
 You are really beautiful.  

332
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:31,860
  You know, Mr. Choi Jae Ho boasted a lot about his wife last time.  

333
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,500
He said you are the reason why he is living.

334
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,960
I understand it, seeing you in person.

335
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,940
Have a great time.

336
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:07,600


337
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,880
Jae Ho!

338
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,340
- Uhh! 
- Hello

339
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,220
- You came. 
 - Yes, congratulations.

340
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,200
Thank you.

341
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,540
Oh, hi Jung Eun!

342
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,080
Dong Gyu.

343
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,740
Oh, you came, President?

344
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,780
Where is Eun Ho?

345
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,080
He is in the dressing room, changing.

346
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,380
Come see me for a minute.

347
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,060
Yeah!

348
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,980
Eun Ho will kill me now.

349
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,520
Why?

350
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,260
This event is for supporting Choi Jae Ho.

351
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,580
The husband of Writer Seo!

352
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,680
Yeah!? Are you really crazy?

353
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,380
What can I do?

354
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,780
- I am about to go crazy, too!
- Why would you schedule Eun Ho for this event?

355
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,560
Do you really want to see Eun Ho going mad?

356
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,880
Could you talk him into

357
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,180
just going back down to the South Sea?

358
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:20,100
What do I tell him? You need to find things out beforehand!

359
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,660
You're being an asshole, seriously!

360
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:27,340
It's happened.  Something big has finally happened.

361
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,040
Hurry up and go talk to him.

362
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,880
Ahh!

363
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,540
You look great!

364
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,740
What kind of event is this?

365
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,360
The bad luck baseball player, Choi Jae Ho's sponsorship celebration.

366
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,460
What?

367
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:07,180
He's coaching handicapped baseball players.

368
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,540
 Isn't he great! He has his own disabilities. 

369
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,500
He has a strong will to protect something.

370
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,920
We must help people like that.

371
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,880
I thought you should be here to witness this situation.

372
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,800
I told you that I am not giving up on you.

373
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:37,940
If that is your intention, you are making a mistake.

374
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,180
  Ji Eun Ho! 

375
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,700
- This is the President.
-  Nice to meet you. 

376
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,800
You know him, right?

377
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,220
Let's sit down.

378
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:34,580


379
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:49,900
Now, we will begin the

380
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,930
sponsorship celebration event for Hope Baseball Team, Eclipse!

381
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:00,310
First, we will introduce the Hope Baseball Team, Eclipse!

382
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,160
 Now we will introduce to you, the head coach of Eclipse. 

383
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,010
 Former baseball player Choi Jae Ho, has taken the position of head coach. 

384
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:17,210
 Now we invite Coach Choi Jae Ho to present us with his inaugural speech. Let's give him a loud round of applause. 

385
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,870
Hello. I'm Choi Jae Ho.

386
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:59,230
Ten years ago, I had to quit baseball because of a car accident.

387
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:05,390
One day, my former opponent from the Korean-Japanese rivalry, Yoichi, looked me up and paid a visit.

388
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:11,970
He gave me this bit of soil and told me this.

389
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:16,930
 Something that caused him more heartache than the time he suddenly lost a game and dug out this soil, 

390
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:20,470
 was when he heard the news that I got into an accident. 

391
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,010
 In order to beat me, 

392
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,850
 Yoichi told me he would mix some of this soil in his food. 

393
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:32,950
But after I became disabled like this, he had a slump.

394
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:37,040
In the end, Yoichi eventually quit baseball as well.

395
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,790
To the athlete Yoichi, who lost a competitor because of me,

396
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:44,210
first of all, I'd like to apologize.

397
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:50,690
Everyone, I introduce to you Mr. Yoichi.

398
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:03,020
For the past ten years, while in addition to having a dear friend like him,

399
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:07,810
more than anything else, the driving force behind why I was able to continue living, without losing hope,

400
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:10,250
is none other than my wife.

401
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:15,770
If you give me permission, I want to bring my wife to the stage.

402
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:44,030
My wife and I met like fate and loved each other,

403
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:47,730
and with the power of love, we were able to get through all of these obstacles.

404
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:55,010
Because of that, I can and will do anything in order to protect my wife.

405
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,150
No matter what that is.

406
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:07,590
I understand Actor Ji Eun Ho came here in order to shine a light on this event.

407
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:11,430
If it's not an inconvenience, can you say a word?

408
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:30,080


409
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,530
Hello. I'm Ji Eun Ho.

410
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:09,830
 I'm honored to be invited to such a meaningful event. 

411
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:14,040
For Player Choi Jae Ho, who became disabled due to an unfortunate accident,

412
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,150
I sincerely wish him a successful comeback.

413
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:21,710
The true place for Player Choi Jae Ho to be

414
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:27,980
is not here, but out on the baseball field.

415
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,690
I will find my place as well.

416
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:48,470
I will not throw a foul, nor will I throw a beanball.

417
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:52,300
 I will play fairly. 

418
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:58,020
You cannot be sure of anything in this world.

419
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:04,600
I also had no idea that I would be waiting ten years like this.

420
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:12,350
Now, I'm not going to wait any more.

421
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:16,540
I'm going to find and take back

422
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,220
those ten years that I lost.

423
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,090
My congratulatory message was a bit random and all over the place, wasn't it?

424
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:38,840
While looking at Player Choi Jae Ho's life,

425
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,570
I learned many things.

426
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:46,570
I should not covet other people's things.

427
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,560
And in the world of competition,

428
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:55,670
sometimes we need to be merciless.

429
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:02,970
I wish Player Choi Jae Ho the best of luck!

430
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:21,230
 As I understand, he was in the midst of filming down in the South Sea,  

431
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,510
  but he came all the way here to give a celebratory message, and we would like to offer our gratitude for him doing so. 

432
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:29,370
  Now, I will introduce the person who worked the hardest to make this event happen. 

433
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:34,500
  We will greet Director Jo Se Ryeong from Myeong Seong Group. Everyone, please show a loud applause. 

434
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,010
  Hello, I am Jo Se Ryeong. 

435
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:53,370
  I would like to sincerely thank everyone here for attending this event. 

436
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:58,890
  Director Choi Jae Ho,  

437
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,040
 who allowed me to cheer on Eclipse, even from far away, 

438
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,610
  to Ji Eun Ho, who managed to find some time with his busy schedule and make a speech, 

439
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:06,850
  I sincerely thank you. 

440
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:08,780
 Writer will have a harder time if you are like this. 

441
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,180
  And 25 players of Eclipse, who gathered under the name of hope, 

442
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,810
  I sincerely welcome you. 

443
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:18,510
 - Our Myeong Seong Group... 
- Eun Dong!

444
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:25,940
He will sponsor 100 pairs of baseball shoes (sounds like Eun Dong)!

445
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:33,230
He's going to buy them right now!

446
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:40,930
  He's so cool. 

447
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:44,010
  He's amazing. 

448
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:50,410
  Why did Director Jo  

449
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:53,540
  sponsor him? 

450
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:58,010
  My Love  Eun Dong 

451
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:10,320
  My Love,  Eun Dong. 

452
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,720
  My Love, Eun Dong. 

453
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,120
  I was the most fearless boy in the world. 

454
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:37,960
  Ten years ago, when I first met you, 

455
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,050
  I was like that. 

456
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,610
  But after losing you, 

457
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:46,120
  I became a coward. 

458
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,200
  The only thing I'm scared of in this world 

459
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,670
  is losing you. 

460
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:12,040
  You said that you want to speed things up. I... 

461
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,710
  am supposed to be going on a graduation MT (trip) with friends. 

462
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:18,360
  Eat quickly. 

463
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:23,020
 -  I will play fairly. 
- Your hair pin is pretty. 

464
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,160
  I can't give you up. 

465
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,920
  I was planning on wearing them until I turn twenty, 

466
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,220
  - but my feet grew.
- Marriage. 

467
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:33,110
  It's my dream to get married to him. 

468
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,480
  Eat this. 

469
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,040
  Eun Dong! Are you okay? 

470
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,290
  What is this? You were nearby? 

471
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:43,470
  I'm always beside you. Remember that. 

472
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:46,390
  Hold on tight. 

473
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:48,590
  You can't lose me again. 

474
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,650
  So you became an actor? 

475
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:54,070
  I know, it was your dream to be an actress. 

476
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:57,950
  Eun Dong. Just like that time ten years ago,  

477
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:00,880
  I became a coward again. 

478
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,570
  I'm scared that I will lose you again. 

479
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:08,640
  Eun Dong. No matter what happened to you, 

480
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,250
  no matter what you were thinking, 

481
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:15,160
  I will understand everything and wait for you. 

482
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:19,050
  So please, come back now. 

483
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:23,890
  Eun Dong! You are well, right? 

484
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:28,350
  Eun Dong... 

485
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,430
  Eun Dong, I'm sorry. 

486
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:34,750
  I'm sorry. 

487
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,710
  Eun Dong. 

488
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:39,570
  I miss you. 

489
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:43,070
  Eun Dong... 

490
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:48,410
  Eun Dong! Eun Dong... 

491
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:05,740
  Kid, wait a moment. 

492
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,910
  Kid, goodbye. 

493
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:10,430
  Kid, come to your senses! 

494
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:14,010
  Kid, are you okay? Wake up! Kid! 

495
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,890
  Are you okay? Are you conscious? 

496
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,160
  Kid! Kid! 

497
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,530
  Excuse me! Please  call the ambulance! 

498
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:36,730
  Grandma, when we were going up the hill with the cart,
 did you see the high school student that helped us? 

499
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:44,760
  If a man is an angel, he would look like that. 

500
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,480
 That Oppa... 

501
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:03,030
  After school, I was on my way home, but it rained. 

502
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:07,970
  I didn't have an umbrella, and while I was running home, I slipped and fell. 

503
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:09,870
  I was in a rush and fell. 

504
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:12,600
  So the high school student was riding a motorcycle, and... 

505
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,820
  No, that's not it. I fell on my own. 

506
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,860
  So he was coming from that direction riding a motorcycle, and then— 

507
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,760
  I didn't get hit by the motorcycle. 

508
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,790
  Kid. You can't lie. There are scary ahjussis here. 

509
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:29,210
  It was slippery, so I fell on my own. 

510
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:34,890
  Oppa piggybacked me and took me to the hospital. He didn't do anything wrong. 

511
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:45,320
  Our Eun Dong, did something good happen? 

512
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,360
  Unni, am I pretty? 

513
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,010
 Look at this girl! 

514
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:57,990
  Now, this is sticky rice cake, which our Jung Eun likes. 

515
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:59,110
  It looks delicious. 

516
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,220
  Chew thoroughly.

  Park Hyun Soo? Park Hyun Soo? 

526
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:56,080
  There isn't a person like that here.

  - No.
- There isn't.

  I'm sorry, Jung Eun. I'm sorry for loving you. 

550
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,880
  Jung Eun, I got scouted by the LA Dodgers. 

551
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:21,230
  Is it that man? Is that why? 

552
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:28,220
  - Jung Eun!
- Are you with that man, the one who you were with during that time when I had lost you? 

553
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,380
  Then you don't have a girlfriend? 

554
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,160
  I don't have one. 

555
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:37,930
  Oppa and dongsaeng? Bull— 

556
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:43,510
  So that oppa got really mad, right? 

557
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:44,670
  Yeah.  

558
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:48,090
  He sees you as a woman! Jealous! 

559
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:52,430
  I can already tell. Start your plan. 

560
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:53,570
  Should I? 

561
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:57,960
  But what do you want with that oppa? 

562
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,240
  Marriage. My dream is to get married to him. 

563
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,690
  How about that pitcher? 

564
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:11,350
  What do you mean? He's going to America anyway. He's going to the Major Leagues. 

565
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:16,670
  Hey. So you can say without any hesitation that you want to get married to that older oppa? 

566
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:19,450
  You want to get married to that jobless guy, instead of the successful one? 

567
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:23,120
  When I become a writer, I'm going to earn money and support him. 

568
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,180
  His dream is to become an actor. I have to help him. 

569
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:29,820
  You are such a faithful woman. There isn't any  job that is more visionless than being an actor-to-be. 

570
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:35,250
  Don't speak like that. You don't know what kind of person he is. 

571
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:39,490
  I'm not going to change my mind now. 

572
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:43,710
  Even if somebody offered me the whole universe, I wouldn't trade it for you. 

573

  I'm going to wait until you come back.

  Even if that takes a year, two years, or three years. 

575
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:59,280
  I waited for ten years. It isn't hard to wait longer. 

576
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:06,130
  The problem is that even if I waited, waited, and waited, 

577
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:13,200
  if you don't come back as Ji Eun Dong, 

578

♫  I hear your voice and breathing  ♫

627
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:04,550
♫   I'm keeping you in my heart so you remain with me  ♫

628
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:12,190
♫   It will never change, my overpowering love  ♫

  I want to go back to ten years ago. I have to start again. 

630
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:20,280
  I want a child. I need something that can tie me and Jung Eun together. I don't have something like that.

  Oppa. Hyun Soo Oppa... 

632
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,290
  You waited a long time. 

633
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:30,370
  You were the one who waited a long time.
