1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,500


2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,680
 My Love, Eun Dong  

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,340
 Eun Dong. Eun Dong.  

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,360
  Aigoo, my heart aches.  

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,060
 Those two really loved each other.  

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,760
No...

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,280
Hello?

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,520
Ah.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,380
Grandma, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll call you back later.

11
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,660
 Ji Eun Ho.  

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,000
 Writer Seo.  

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,380
 Eun Dong. Eun Dong!  

14
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,420
 I'm sorry about earlier.  

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,780
Hello?

16
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,020
Miss Writer.

17
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,920
 Eun Dong! You're doing well, right?! 
Miss Writer? 

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,860
 Where on earth are you? 

19
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,520
 Eun Dong. I will 

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,500
 find you!  

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,040
 Eun Dong, we have to meet again.  

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,180
 I will look for you until I find you.  

23
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,520
 Eun Dong! 

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,940
Hello?

25
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,920
 Miss Writer?  

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,500
 Miss Writer.  

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,440
 Miss Writer.  

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,320
 My Love Eun Dong 
Episode 4  

29
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,080
- Mom, I'm here. 
- Welcome.

30
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,100
What's wrong with your face? Are you sick?

31
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,180
No, not sick. I'm just a little tired.

32
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,380
Did you eat?

33
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,700
Yeah, I ate.

34
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,760
Here, drink.

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,720
Why do you keep giving me milk?

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,820
When we first saw you, when you were yo—

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,300
You fell down easily when you were young because you had weak bones.

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,080
- Mom. 
- Yes?

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,060
You said that pictures of me when I was young caught on fire and are gone, right?

40
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,720
Yeah.

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,860
Then are pictures of me from my college days gone, too?

42
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,560
When you went to America with husband Choi, I sent them through airmail to your house,

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,080
but they lost the package.

44
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,800
How come there isn't anything I can use to remember about what happened before the accident?

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,440
 I'm really curious as to what happened that day. 

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,000
Ra Il's father is my first love, right?

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,500
What are you saying now?

48
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,340
Did we really fall in love at first sight and love each other?

49
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,340
Are you kidding?

50
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,660
When husband Choi was in his third year of high school,

51
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,660
and when you were in your second year of high school, you both fell in love at first sight

52
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,960
and asked to marry right after graduation. It was no joke.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,280
- Really? 
- Of course.

54
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,700
I see.

55
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,500
Jung Eun.

56
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,740
It was frustrating me because I couldn't remember any of that.

57
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,480
Can't someone do something about this head of mine?

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,820
It's done.

59
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,660
Jung Eun, coffee.

60
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:07,800
Thank you, Unni.

61
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,270
I might be crazy.

62
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,960
I was talking to Ji Eun Ho over the phone earlier,

63
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,720
and I was inside that person's past.

64
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,780
It was like I was the Eun Dong he's looking for.

65
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,040
It was because you were too committed.

66
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,360
I was hallucinating that he was calling my name.

67
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,480
My heart was beating so much that I couldn't handle it.

68
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,220
Aren't I really funny?

69
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,380
Continue like this and you'll be like that lady from  Misery .  

70
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,280
You have a wide imagination, you know everything about that person now.

71
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,200
If you decide to have Ji Eun Ho, then you'll become just like that woman in  Misery. 

72
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,460
Delusional people did not become that way overnight, you know.

73
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,500
That's probably it, huh?

74
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,680
If not, then what? You're unconsciously wanting to become Eun Dong.

75
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,680
You want to connect your lost memories to Eun Dong.

76
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,600
You want to be the woman that Ji Eun Ho can't forget.

77
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,180
Hurry up and come back to reality!

78
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,400
But when Ji Eun Ho calls for Eun Dong.

79
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,300
It does makes my heart flutter.

80
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,080
It would make my heart flutter, too.

81
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,600
Who?

82
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,200
Ah, please come in.

83
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,940
I heard everything that I need to do from Manager Go.

84
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,640
And therefore, I don't think we need to discuss it.

85
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,660
Now then, may I

86
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,760
look over the topography where I will be working?

87
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,420
Ah yes. As you like.

88
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,060
Oh.

89
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,540
I think it will make my job a lot easier if you move.

90
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,880
Ah yes. You could've worn something more comfortable.

91
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,700
Why are you wearing something uncomfortable?

92
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,700
I am a former military officer!

93
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,560
This is my uniform.

94
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,160
I mean...

95
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,560
Don't you wear a uniform in the organization life?

96
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,800
Wearing a uniform is the basic duty while working!

97
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,680
- Ahjumma. 
- Mrs. Ta!

98
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,820
Please call me that. My stance toward my duties

99
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,200
changes according to what I am called.

100
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,380
Wear some comfortable clothes a—

101
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:26,140
You may not understand it because you joined the National Guard and not the regular army.

102
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,600
I ask that you understand the importance of a uniform.

103
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,500
Dong Gyu!

104
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,860
Her clothes look like they're going to rip.

105
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,740
She's mentally weird.

106
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,740
She said I have no perspective about the uniform because I joined the national guard.

107
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,840
National guard? Ah, you were in public service.

108
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,980
To her perception, it may not be different than national guard.

109
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,860
National guard or public service, they both wear uniforms.

110
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,200
- Change to a different person. 
- I can't.

111
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,380
It's hard to find someone as heavy (tight) lipped as she is.

112
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,780
Are you sure she's heavy lipped?

113
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,100
You didn't choose her because of her heavy body?

114
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,660
Actually your mom in Chuncheon found her.

115
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,960
What? My mom?

116
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,420
Ah, about that kind eyed and pretty

117
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,600
author with a good body,

118
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,760
I called her and she didn't respond, all of a sudden.

119
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,020
Did you say something to piss her off again?

120
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,280
What? Pis— What do you take me for?

121
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,120
Then why didn't she respond, all of a sudden?

122
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,460
- How should I know that? 
- You probably angered her.

123
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,480
Do you think I'm you?

124
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,420
Seventy percent of my body is moisture and the remaining thirty percent is a lump of manners.

125
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,240
Come on, that's not right.

126
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,520
Doesn't even make sense.

127
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,880
Whether it be the ahjumma in my house

128
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,180
or the ghostwriter, I don't like either of them.

129
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,160
Do you know how weird and picky you are?

130
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,880
Shut up.

131
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,460
You really don't know how to look at people.

132
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,000
You always look at the outer appearance of a person to judge them.

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,860
Look at the inside, their true self, inside.

134
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,100
Has kind eyes, pretty, and has a good body? Yeah right.

135
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,300
What do you mean by inside? How would I be able to look at that?

136
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,840
Hey, shouldn't you be able to determine an ill-mannered woman at first sight?

137
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,760
This writer isn't ill-mannered!

138
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,920
She doesn't have manners, but she's also very rude.

139
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,460
Hey, I called her and she didn't even res— Forget it.

140
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,520
She really makes me into such a petty guy. I really don't like her.

141
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,530
 I promised Eun Dong that I will never disappear again,   

142
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:20,440
 and in order to keep that promise, I am standing here today. 

143
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,770
 Nothing changed.   

144
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,440
 Eun Dong, we will meet again.   

145
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,070
 I am going to look for you until I find you.   

146
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:01,790


147
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,540
 Kim Dong Ryul - "Shall I Say I Love Her Again?"  

148
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,520
♫  It's like I met you yesterday   ♫

149
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,700
 How can you not remember this song? I listened to it more than a hundred times. 

150
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,900
 Hey, there was a lot of stuff going on that day.   

151
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:32,290
 I was entranced by a fox with 90 tails and my soul was buried deep in the ground.  

152
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,000
 After all that, you think I'll remember the song?   

153
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,640
 Yeah, it was this song.   

154
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,840
 It's nice.   

155
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,610
 ♫ You said you couldn't sleep at all last night ♫  

156
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,120
 I waited for you, Oppa.   

157
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,390
 We met like this.   

158
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:01,100
 I missed you a lot too.   

159
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,380
 Hold on tight! 

160
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,640
 Okay!   

161
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,990
 You can't lose me again! Alright?   

162
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,470
 Alright!   

163
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,810
 ♫ While we were laughing at past stories ♫  

164
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,510
  You have to come back... 

165
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:26,820
 I'm coming back. Don't go anywhere until I come back! 

166
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:34,840
 ♫ My heart suddenly started to ache without me knowing ♫  

167
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,820
 ♫ Shall I say I love her again? ♫  

168
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:48,790
 ♫ That it's been a long time but I have been waiting ♫  

169
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:57,280
 ♫ That waiting for you was the easiest thing for me to do ♫  

170
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,260
 ♫ That I didn't even know time was passing by ♫  

171
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,410
 I sent you the song I listen to in memory of Eun Dong.   

172
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,210
 ♫ Shall I say I love her again? ♫  

173
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,600
 ♫ I still lack many things ♫  

174
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,110
 ♫ But will you accept me? ♫  

175
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:23,140
 ♫ Loving you is my reason for living! ♫  

176
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,010
 ♫ I can't do anything about it ♫  

177
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,500
 - I wanted to wear them until I was twenty...
 -Thinking about you having a boyfriend...  

178
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,540
 You can kiss me if you want. 

179
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,630
 I want to wait until you feel the same way I do. I know you're not there yet.  

180
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,690
 I can't give you up! 

181
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,620
 ♫ You said that you didn't know it was love back then ♫  

182
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,640
 ♫ And at the words that you felt sorry ♫  

183
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:03,570
 ♫ When you heard news about me ♫  

184
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,670
  Actor Ji Eun Ho's agency, DM Entertainment appointed Lee Hyun Bal as the new president.  

185
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,740
Ah, this is so embarrassing.

186
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,120
I would go anywhere with you if the old saying "following a friend to the south" would bring success.

187
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,800
You came?

188
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,500
The door was open.

189
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,660
Hyun Soo came earlier.

190
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,350
You still call him Hyun Soo?

191
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,210
Well, that's usually what I've called him since he was young.

192
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,970
Congratulations.

193
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,190
It's all thanks to you.

194
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,180
Don't tell Eun Ho.

195
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,560
Of course I won't tell him. He'd kill me if he found out.

196
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,240
I don't want to see Ji Eun Ho in a difficult situation. It's hard for me to see.

197
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,500
That's why I'm helping you.

198
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,890
But I don't want him to change how he feels, because I've helped him.

199
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,620
I know he's not like that though.

200
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,050
But everyone knows you are being altruistic—

201
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,650
Altruistic?

202
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,740
Do you think the feelings I have for Ji Eun Ho are pure?

203
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:13,290
Make me a cool woman so I don't fall behind.

204
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,760
President Lee.

205
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,940
How should I...

206
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,900
That woman, Ji Eun Ho's first love.

207
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,740
I wish the two of them wouldn't meet.

208
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,990
Forever.

209
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,500
Not even for a moment.

210
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,700
I wish they would not see each other.

211
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:45,190
Yes, Mother. I'm just visiting for a moment, so I shouldn't take long.

212
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,480
I'll be back before dinner. Yes.

213
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,070
So I'll be leaving first!

214
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,490
Jung Eun!

215
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,030
Yes?

216
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,400
What is it boss?

217
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,610
I deposited  your payment this morning.

218
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,290
Really? Thank you!

219
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,850
I'm giving you what you earned so there is no need to thank me.

220
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,820
I've been watching you.

221
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,360
Yes.

222
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,930
You don't put your cellphone down during work hours.

223
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:22,060
I picked you because you looked like a hard worker.

224
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,740
We have to stay together for a long time.

225
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,290
Yes. I'm sorry.

226
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,940
Are you Grandma Yi Ga Eul?

227
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,060
Aigoo, yes that's me. You've worked hard to come a long way.

228
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,970
Thank you for your time.

229
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,930
Aigoo, it's not mu—

230
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,030
Wait. Who is this?

231
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,740
Excuse me?

232
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,600
Who is this? It's Teacher Eun Dong!

233
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,370
Grandma...

234
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,850
Aigoo, I'm sure! You're Teacher Eun Dong!

235
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,170
You are so pretty. You haven't changed at all.

236
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,270
That's not me. I am Seo Jung Eun.

237
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,250
What are you talking about?

238
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,930
You think I won't recognize you just because I'm old?

239
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,210
You're definitely Teacher Eun Dong.

240
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:25,880
That's not me Grandmother. I was in America at the time.

241
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,510
Grandmother?

242
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,690
Oh...

243
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,310
- Grandmother
- Huh?

244
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:43,210
The letter. You don't remember what was in the letter?

245
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,220
 The truth is, at the time I couldn't read Korean that well. 

246
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,520
I only recognized a few letters that I learned before.

247
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,300
I think it was about something like this:

248
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:06,840
"I really, really, love you. I really love you, Eun Dong." That's what I think it said.

249
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,580
Even though I couldn't read Korean,

250
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:15,440
I could feel the exact emotions expressed in the letter.

251
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,470
I see.

252
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:22,210
But, did you get married?

253
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,570
I'm married.

254
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,080
What a shame.

255
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,900
But still, make sure you meet that man.

256
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,660
You need to meet that man.

257
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,450
- What?
- I'm not going to talk for long.

258
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,850
You need to meet that man.

259
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,110
I think that's how you could find out everything.

260
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,730
 ♫ As if we had met yesterday, not needing to ask whether you've been fine ♫  

261
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,090
 I really, really, love you. I love you, Eun Dong.   

262
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,790
 Even though I couldn't read Korean, 

263
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:06,760
 I could feel the exact emotions that were expressed.   

264
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,540
 ♫ That I made it more awkward between us ♫  

265
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,770
 ♫ When you received my phone call yesterday ♫  

266
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:26,100
  ♫ You said you couldn't sleep at all and that you look terrible ♫  

267
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,240
 ♫ Your face smiling shyly ♫  

268
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,880
Dad.

269
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,380
Sit.

270
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,450
Did you wait long?

271
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,350
It's nothing.

272
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,260
Nothing's been going on?

273
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,950
Of course.

274
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,550
There's nothing going on with Ra Il, either?

275
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,210
No.

276
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,320
You have to do your best for husband Choi.

277
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,840
No matter what, you can't betray him.

278
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,230
I know.

279
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,270
This happened because of your mistakes,

280
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,070
so I can't defend you.

281
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:16,620
Tell me what I did wrong.

282
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,060
You always say that I did something wrong.

283
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,060
I'm having a hard time right now.

284
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:27,040
It would be better for you to not know. Just go on with life.

285
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,040
You just have to remember that you're a sinner to husband Choi.

286
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,960
Was there someone else besides husband Choi?

287
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,770
By any chance, is there?

288
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,530
It's not like that. There's no one else.

289
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,980
I want to know about myself.

290
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,200
What more do you want to know?

291
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,370
I told you everything that happened from the moment you were born.

292
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,740
If she received the music file, she should respond.

293
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,650
This woman really has a weird personality.

294
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:41,170
She canceled the call without any warning and now she's not even talking to me. So rude.

295
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,640
- Hey, it's me 
- Should we go out to  do something tomorrow?

296
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,780
I have an extra filming scheduled,

297
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,150
so I can't get a tan.

298
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,670
Then, let's have dinner together today.

299
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,960
- Want to come to my house? 
- If I am one of them, then I decline.

300
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,590
You are not one of them.  Come now. 

301
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,190
I'm already on my way.

302
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,130
Oh, Mother, leave it.  I'll do it.

303
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,710
Why are you coming home now when you should have finished work a while ago?

304
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,530
I had some business to attend to. I'm sorry.

305
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:43,610
- Are you coming home now? 
- Oh honey, did you do well at the hospital?

306
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,890
What did your attending physician say? Today's weather was killer, right?

307
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,540
Honey, let's talk about things one at a time. The attending physician was good and the weather was very good, okay?

308
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,700
Mother, you should eat before you go.

309
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,520
I'm going now, so just feed him.

310
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,160
- But you should still eat before you go. 
- I said it's fine!

311
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,640
- You come see me for a moment. 
- Mom.

312
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,200
Do you want to interfere in the matters between mother and daughter-in-law, as well?

313
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,800
How was your father able to become a pro coach?

314
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,990
He, who was just a mere high school coach,

315
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,730
who was it that made him a pro coach?

316
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,120
I know, Mother.

317
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,070
How long has it been since he became like that?

318
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,550
Truthfully, I'm going to say everything since we've already started.

319
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,480
Whose fault was it that he became like that?

320
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,490
You guys were in the accident together! He was trying to save you in that moment!

321
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,540
That's why you're perfectly fine right now.

322
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:57,920
- I'm sorry, mother.
- Then...

323
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,220
If my child miraculously survived,

324
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,680
I wouldn't be able to stay shamelessly like that.

325
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,190
How could they, as your parents, just pretend nothing happened?

326
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,310
 His hospital fees and living fees, we're the ones who paid for all of it. 

327
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,080
- We've reached rock bottom too! 
- I'm sorry, Mother.

328
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,590
I will work hard so you don't have a hard time.

329
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,030
How much could you possibly make while working hard?

330
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:23,870
I'm thinking that now I would like your parents to contribute every month, as well.

331
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,780
 You need to send Ra Il to an international school. 

332
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,860
Nothing will improve if we keep sending him to a Korean school.

333
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,480
Did you see his facial expression after coming back from school?

334
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,130
He's completely dead.  I won't stand for my child looking like that! 

335
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,120
 My child wasn't enough, and now even that young child. 

336
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,170
 - I'm sorry, Mother.
- I really don't understand. 

337
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,140
 - Are they really your blood related parents?  
- What?

338
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,870
 You don't know because you lost your memory, no? 

339
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:52,200
- How could your blood related parents act like this? 
- Mother.

340
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,690
Even so, you spoke out of the line.

341
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,520
 I'm sorry for that. 

342
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,820
 I really don't understand. 

343
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,680
 How could they act like this, when their daughter is having such a hard time? 

344
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,980
Seo Young.

345
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,180
- I just— 
- I'm embarrassed now. Please don't embarrass me further.

346
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,050
Let's just eat this.

347
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,210
You are very special to me.

348
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,560
You know that much at least, right?

349
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,130
Don't give your heart to me.

350
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,020
What is it when a guy calls a girl over saying that he'll cook?

351
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,620
If you interpreted it that way, I'm sorry.

352
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,180
I can eat comfortably with you

353
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,230
any time. That's how I feel.

354
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,750
- You are so cruel.
- I'm sorry.

355
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,290
I just thought we were comfortable friends.

356
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,090
How many times have you said sorry?

357
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,850
What did you do wrong?

358
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,410
You didn't do anything but come into my heart.

359
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,970
 And did you come in willingly? 

360
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,160
 I was the one who brought you in by tying you down. 

361
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,470
Let's leave it at this.

362
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:49,110
It's good. You're pretty good.

363
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,760
It's good, right? I called you to show off.

364
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,370
 How do I have such talents even in cooking? 

365
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,300
Yeah.

366
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,950
Cheers.

367
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:15,300


368
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,750
I'm sorry.

369
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,890
For what?

370
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,070
My mother made a mistake because she was upset.

371
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,290
I know.

372
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,150
Jung Eun.

373
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,950
The truth is, today was a bit much.

374
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,680
Wasn't it? We three family members are working

375
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,550
hard to make a place to belong.

376
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:55,140
- Jung Eun.
- I'm just saying that's how it was.

377
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,040
Today was quite a long day.

378
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,850
- Hello. 
- Oh, you've come.

379
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:20,310
- Looks like you came with Jung Eun today. 
- Ah yes, hello doctor.

380
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,830
How do you feel? Any improvements?

381
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,260
Not yet...

382
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,720
Now, please try making a fist.

383
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,080
Okay. Now please put some strength into your arm.

384
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,370
Please pull. Pull a little bit.

385
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,180
Please pull. Pull.

386
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,470
Okay.

387
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,040
If the patient's will is strong enough, it will work out.

388
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,920
Doctors refuse to believe in miracles of mental, affecting physical.

389
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,270
But I'm different. There are medications in medicine,

390
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,600
and beyond that is the human's mental state.

391
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,470
Try imagining yourself walking again.

392
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,200
Take him to the hospitalization center.

393
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,290
 Thank you. 

394
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,720
Please follow me. Follow me.

395
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:30,270
Follow me. Follow me. And push again.

396
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,100
Push more.

397
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,700
Slowly follow me.

398
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,570
I think you're different from others.

399
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,270
It's like I'm looking at myself.

400
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,990
My husband died seven years ago.

401
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,960
From a  brain tumor. He suffered for three years,

402
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,130
then he gave up his life.

403
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,200
They said that he wouldn't last one year, medically.

404
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,200
But I made him live for two more years.

405
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,060
 That was when I was a first-year resident. 

406
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,680
I was in charge of him.

407
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,240
He suddenly grabbed my hand

408
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,930
when I was grabbing his forearm for a vein

409
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,910
to collect blood for a blood sample. Do you know what he said?

410
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,130
"Please don't be so nervous. There's another forearm

411
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,400
right here."

412
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,870
Up until the moment he died,

413
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,220
he was someone who made other people laugh.

414
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,560
I guess there is a thing called fate.

415
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,180
Yes. His appearance while wearing a hospital gown

416
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,890
was so cool. And the smell of his cigarettes

417
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,550
was like the smell of burning leaves.

418
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,980
You should start, too.

419
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,160
Your memories. Recover them.

420
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,980
Find out when you met your husband

421
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,960
and how you fell in love. You can withstand

422
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,240
reality with those precious memories.

423
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,890
I'm afraid though.

424
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,480
I feel like inside the time I can't remember,

425
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,250
there might be a huge changing wind.

426
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,240
It's like  there's something I don't want myself to know.

427
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,740
I'm really afraid.

428
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,620
 I got a text yesterday. 

429
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,280
From that writer.

430
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,020
She said she's almost done with the book and wanted to know what the title should be.

431
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,060
That woman is really funny.

432
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,720
She could tell me herself, but suddenly she tells you instead?

433
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,580
Even if you may not know, you definitely hurt her feelings.

434
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,840
I said I didn't.

435
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,820
To you, it might have been nothing but to the person listening, it could have hurt.

436
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,760
- I said I didn't.
 - Okay, I get it.

437
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,160
What's the title of the book going to be?

438
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,540
Tell her to talk to me about it.

439
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,920
Hyung, don't distinguish between right and wrong with her.

440
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,160
- I'm going to. 
- Hyung, please.

441
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,700
Your social manners. Be mindful of them and

442
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,420
act cool like an actor, please!

443
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,880
What is that to me? I mean...

444
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,080
It's like this— I'm talking to her on the phone, and

445
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,420
all of a sudden she hangs up.

446
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:42,920
And, I sent her a music file, one that would have something to do with the book content.

447
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,540
She receives the music file, but there's no reaction.

448
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,060
The rude one is that woman.

449
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,320
No. That writer is really nice.

450
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,100
 She's not that kind of person. 

451
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,440
Aish...

452
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,240
You... If the writer and I fall into the water, who are you going to save first?

453
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,000
Seriously! Stop with the childish questions!

454
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,300
You and that writer are making me immature!

455
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,100
That writer lives a hardworking life.

456
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,600
She is working as a part time salesperson at the outlet during daytime and sometimes monitoring the edit for the publisher.

457
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,820
On top of that, her husband is disabled so she has to take care of him.

458
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,640
Those people, with just a small word,

459
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,000
can seriously get hurt.

460
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,440
I'm going to go crazy.

461
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,780
I seriously didn't say anything!

462
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:33,040
- Then why is the writer being like that? 
- I'm curious too!

463
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:40,360
Oh my... Why do I have to seem so petty because of some ghost writer?

464
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,020
Let's stop it here.

465
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,140
 Let's stop. 

466
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,680
You little...

467
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,680
He's releasing a book? Even though our department has no knowledge about it?

468
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,400
Yes... There's no way to stop it.

469
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,480
I'm going to go crazy!

470
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,780
The fan club is going crazy right now, wondering when the book is going to be published.

471
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:09,000
Guess who I heard this from? A member of the fan club, Woon Young Ja.

472
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,440
Does that make sense to you?

473
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,000
What can you do? Eun Ho Hyung decided it.

474
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,760
Oh... I'm getting dizzy.

475
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,020
Did you read that book?

476
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,260
No.

477
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,220
Let me meet that writer.

478
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,400
- What are you going to say to her? 
- What power do I have?

479
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,500
I'm going to meet with her and ask for a favor,

480
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,870
to be cautious of her writing.

481
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:38,000
If something happens to that writer, I'm going to tell Eun Ho everything.

482
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,640
This punk!

483
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,780
Just... let me meet her!

484
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,700
Hello?

485
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,140
I feel as if I am stepping on thin ice.

486
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:08,620
I mean, does a book actually sell from releasing an article in newspaper these days?

487
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:14,200
What are you saying? We're not releasing this book to make money.

488
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,520
The amount for Ji Eun Ho's one shot commercial is one million dollars.

489
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,580
Also, whether we're going to release it or not, we still don't know.

490
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,260
 Reporter Park, don't release that article 

491
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,520
 until I call you. 

492
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,300
You got that, right? I'm hanging up.

493
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:44,180
 Ghost Writer 

494
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,360
Hello?

495
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:58,860
It's Seo Jung Eun. Where are—

496
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,620
Hello.

497
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,060
- Are you the writer?
- Yes.

498
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,560
You don't recognize me?

499
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,720
What?

500
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,960
It's nothing.

501
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,260
I heard you were working really hard on Ji Eun Ho's book.

502
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,660
I thought it would be polite to at least give my greetings. That's why I wanted to meet.

503
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,080
It's nothing at all.

504
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,840
You still didn't meet Ji Eun Ho, right?

505
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,240
No, I still haven't met him yet.

506
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:46,220
I see... That guy is usually really busy...

507
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,880
The book is in the finishing stage. It's almost done.

508
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,620
 That little kid... How could this be? 

509
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,660
 But why doesn't she know he's looking for her? 

510
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,200
Also, please don't worry too much.

511
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,040
I will never reveal that I'm Ji Eun Ho's ghost writer.

512
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,400
Are you single?

513
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,880
I'm married.

514
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,100
Do you know what Ji Eun Ho's real name is?

515
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,500
Yes. Park Hyun Soo.

516
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,020
Yes. Park Hyun Soo.

517
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,060
I was friends with Hyun Soo since high school,

518
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:31,360
so I know the his history with Eun Dong better than anyone.

519
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:37,660
- Ah... Then are you that Hyun Bal?
- Yeah...

520
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:43,860
That's why, if you're curious about anything, ask me.

521
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:50,460
Don't meet Eun Ho. I'm making this a request.

522
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:57,300
You must never meet him.

523
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,000
Okay. I understand.

524
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,420
Are those two people fated?

525
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,440
How can something like this happen?

526
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,940
Hey Dong Gyu.

527
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,240
Yes?

528
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,660
You. How did you find that ghost writer?

529
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,080
She's my cousin's close sister.

530
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,400
Why?

531
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,160
Does Eun Ho know that writer's phone number?

532
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,600
Yes. Of course.

533
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,460
Don't let the two of them meet.

534
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,160
If they do, you're dead to me.

535
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,820
They can't even meet.

536
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,760
Eun Ho made her feel bad so she won't even respond to him.

537
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,880
Don't let them meet.

538
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:08,180


539
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,460
 Let's talk, Writer. 

540
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,140
 Pretty Writer 

541
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,620
Hello?

542
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,440
It's Seo Jung Eun.

543
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:50,540
Yes. Why did you hang up like that last time?

544
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,080
I'm so sorry about that day.

545
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,200
Also, the music file I sent you. You received it, right?

546
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,080
 Yes, I got it. 

547
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,060
 It was the song that played when Eun Dong and Hyun Soo first kissed, right? 

548
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,420
Yes, that's correct.

549
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,300
The book title should be: "My Love Eun Dong."

550
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,520
 I would like it to be that. 

551
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,180
 Hello? 

552
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,600
Oh. Yes. I like the title. Definitely.

553
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,620
 Apparently it's the first line of the letter you wrote to Eun Dong. 

554
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,820
 I wish you became nice. 

555
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,600
 I have to get on the subway now. 

556
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,240
 I will talk to you about the rest through text. 

557
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,780
 - It's Seo Jung Eun.
 - I wish you became nice. 

558
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,240
Aigoo, Eun Ho!

559
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,980
You waited a long time, huh? I'm sorry.

560
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,880
Ah...

561
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,040
As you know, these days, it's practically a war.

562
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,960
Ah... Seriously. You look better.

563
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,880
Thank you.

564
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,100
 It's the tenth anniversary of "That Smile." 

565
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:14,140
 Honestly, what broadcast show are you leaning towards? 

566
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,640
 Do it with us. If you do it with us, 

567
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,920
 we'll do it the way you want us to. 

568
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,160
Director, I'm sorry.

569
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,820
I have something urgent that came up. I'll contact you tomorrow.

570
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,420
  Pretty Writer 

571
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,420
 Pretty Writer  

572
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,640
 The subway is stopping.  

573
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,680
 Please be careful when you get off.  

574
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,240
  Next stop will be... 

575
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,880
  Don't forget your belongings... 

576
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,090
 Hello? 

577
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,440
Oh, come here right now.

578
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,840
Aren't you having a meal with the Managing Director? Did you fight?

579
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,700
Hurry up and come!

580
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,100
Oh wait. I'll go there, instead.

581
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,460
Stay in the office.

582
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,560
 What's wrong?  

583
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,360
Hey.

584
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,020
That writer, you said you saw her face right?

585
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,720
 Yes. I told you she was pretty.  

586
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,620
How old is that girl? What school did she graduate from?

587
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,840
You received a resume from her, right?

588
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,140
 No, I didn't.  

589
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,080
Why didn't you get something like that from her?!

590
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,880
Why are you acting like this? Is there a problem?

591
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,740
Is that girl's name really Seo Jung Eun? Is that really her name?

592
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,560
 Yes it is. 

593
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,560
I even deposited the money to her bank account. The account holder's name was Seo Jung Eun.

594
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,680
 What's wrong?  

595
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,820
 The president met with the writer as well. 

596
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,280
 He was asking all sorts of things, too.  

597
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,220
Hello?

598
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,220
 She is 33-years old. She was just on the phone.   

599
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,520
You said that she's married, right?

600
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,280
 Yes. I heard she has a ten-year-old son, too.  

601
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,760
Son?

602
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,600
She has a son...

603
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,820
 What's wrong all of a sudden?  

604
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,960
It was Eun Dong's voice.

605
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,140
That's not possible. It's not her.

606
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,280
 If so, that writer would have told you ages ago, 

607
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,040
 or told me.  

608
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,100
It could be that she hates me.

609
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,120
 What do you mean she hates you? She even asked me to get her your autograph.  

610
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,080
 Hyung, there are many people in the world with similar voices.  

611
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,600
 Honestly.  

612
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,560
 How funny.  

613
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,120
I'm hanging up.

614
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,520
Yeah.

615
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,660
There's no way.

616
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,800
 Ji Eun Ho fanpage.  

617
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,840
 Seo Jung Eun  

618
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,300
It's really Seo Jung Eun.

619
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:21,420
That's right. She said she was adopted.

620
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,120
Hello.

621
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,200
You're saying you want to be the fan club's president?

622
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,560
Yes. Please make an official fanpage.

623
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,720
I'll run it.

624
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,280
Well, running isn't really... I mean there really isn't much to do.

625
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,280
You're the only fan.

626
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,540
The start may be small but the end will be very big.

627
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,240
Just wait and see.

628
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:52,300
And you know that the fan club president and the manager are close, right?

629
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,460
Please give me your phone number.

630
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:59,380
 Seo Jung Eun  

631
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,720
Customer, you dropped this.

632
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,900
Oh my, thank you.

633
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,740
What did you have to tell me?

634
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,460
It's okay.

635
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,420
The thing is...

636
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:40,260
I found her. Eun Dong.

637
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,040
Something that would only happen in movies...

638
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,360
Honestly...

639
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,460
The ghostwriter for Hyun Soo,

640
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,300
that writer, is Eun Dong.

641
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:05,440
I really couldn't believe it. How could this happen?

642
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,780
Wow, thankfully she's married.

643
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,580
She has a child, too.

644
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,080
Their fate is really frightening.

645
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,820
They won't ever be able to meet. I made it so

646
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,820
that they will never be able to meet.

647
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,660
I must really like Ji Eun Ho.

648
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,200
This is really annoying me!

649
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,320
Why isn't it me,

650
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,700
instead of her, that he has this kind of story with?

651
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,180
Ah. Jo Seo Yeong  is getting petty.

652
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,020
When did you come?

653
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,880
Did you meet Managing Director Nam?

654
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,320
I'm going to release the book.

655
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,480
Do I publicize that?

656
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,820
Tell the reporters. If you don't,

657
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,600
I'll do a press conference for the launching of the book.

658
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,880
Fine!

659
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,120
I heard you met the ghost writer.

660
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,340
Yeah. It won't serve anything for people to know it's ghostwritten.

661
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,280
I just met her to ask her that favor.

662
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,180
For me, that—

663
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,260
Her voice

664
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,520
is just like Eun Dong's.

665
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,420
You think only one or two people have the same sounding voice!

666
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,680
How does she look?

667
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,600
She's a pretty ahjumma. I don't remember her face.

668
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,840
Even if she's just a woman who sounds like Eun Dong,

669
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,600
my heart was racing like it would burst!

670
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,920
 All women's voices are the same over the phone. 

671
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:26,140


672
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,720
Investigate someone for me.

673
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,680
Yes.

674
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:40,740
Her name is Seo Jung Eun. Get the rest of the information from President Lee, from DM Entertainment.

675
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,240
Yes.

676
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,460
 There's nothing but the love story between you and Eun Dong, for it to be called an autobiography.  

677
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:00,160
 I think it would be better to write it as an essay by Ji Eun Ho.  

678
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,360
 It's not like I saved a country or its people.  

679
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,080
 I think the word, autobiography, is used too dramatically. 

680
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:13,420
 And essay makes me feel sick. Just writing nothing seems best...  

681
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,360
 I'll do that. 

682
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,220
 I'll do that. 

683
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,340
  I'll do that. 

684
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:41,160
"I'll do that." Her message is a little...

685
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,940
It changes depending on your mood.

686
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,200
  I'll do that. 

687
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:53,160
Why does this, "I'll do that," seem so rude to me?

688
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,480
Wow! You're really nit-picking!

689
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,260
Why are you like that to that poor writer?

690
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:06,340
When I think about it, it's like you're that writer's manager.

691
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,220
How can you not take  my  side once?

692
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,400
Is this something about taking someone's side?

693
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,980
Aish...

694
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,840
Both you and that writer are not in my favor.

695
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,560
Oh yeah! The ten autographs!

696
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,980
Tell her to ask me herself!

697
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,380
Oh really!

698
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:55,750
Honey. This weekend, should we take Ra Il and go to Deoksu Palace?

699
00:50:55,750 --> 00:51:01,340
It's fine for me. But it'll be hard for you, practically taking care of two children.

700
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:07,260
We can take your beloved mother-in-law and father-in-law, too.

701
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:11,960
But... When do you finish that book? You know I've been feeling strange lately?

702
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,150
You're always texting another man.

703
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:24,120
Ji Eun Ho is so weird. His original name was Park Hyun Soo but he changed it to something that was similar to Eun Dong.

704
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,020
Eun Dong?

705
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:29,490
Yeah, Eun Dong. Ji Eun Dong.

706
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,590
 That person's original name is Park Hyun Soo. 

707
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:39,550
 He made a promise with Eun Dong when they were young. When he grows up to be an actor, he'll rename himself as Ji Eun Ho. 

708
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:47,300
How old did you say Eun Dong was?

709
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,420
She's the same age as me.

710
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,770
Are you not feeling well?

711
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:07,340
Honey, what's wrong?

712
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:10,970
I'm really tired...

713
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:13,690
Oh. Okay.

714
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:49,050
♫   As if we met yesterday   ♫

715
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:57,570
♫   Not really needing to ask how you've been   ♫

716
00:52:57,570 --> 00:53:02,070
♫   Perhaps I was needlessly concerned  ♫

717
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:09,110
♫   Maybe my uneasiness made it awkward between us  ♫

718
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:16,420
♫   After picking up my phone call yesterday  ♫

719
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:24,900
♫   You said you looked terrible because you couldn't sleep  ♫

720
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:29,710
♫   Your face smiling shyly  ♫

721
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:37,060
♫   How could it be that you're exactly the same   ♫

722
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:43,870
♫   We were too young back then  ♫

723
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:49,710
♫   Laughing at old stories  ♫

724
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:56,200
 It's the song  when Eun Dong and Hyun Soo first kissed, right? 
♫   But hearing that you're still single   ♫

725
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:03,120
 Kim Dong Ryul - "Should I Say I Love You Again" 
♫   My heart starts to ache   ♫ 

726
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:45,750
- Hello? 
 -  It's Ji Eun Ho. 

727
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,270
Yes.

728
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:51,400
Uhh... The music file I sent.

729
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,700
Yes.

730
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:58,780
The song that played when Eun Dong and I first kissed.

731
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:01,510
I never said that before.

732
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,210
How did you know that?

733
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,980
Hold on for one moment.

734
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:31,310
Didn't you ever text that to me?

735
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:33,670
No, I never did.

736
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,660
There's no way.

737
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,750
How would I know that?

738
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,670
Who are you?

739
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,550
Eun Dong?

740
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:03,420
Eun Dong!

741
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,780
Ji Eun Ho.

742
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,800
Let's meet right now.

743
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,230
It's too late. Let's meet another time.

744
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:19,490
No. Let's meet now. I have to meet with you  right now. 

745
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:20,260
I have to.

746
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,550
 It's too late. 

747
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,710
I'm going to hang up now.

748
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,760
That's right.

749
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:59,380
He never told me.

750
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:05,170
How did I know that?

751
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,090
That person has no manners.

752
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,320
So late at night...

753
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:40,010
Don't pick up from now on.

754
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,380
Okay. I'm sorry.

755
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:48,180
I won't. Sleep.

756
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:55,280
 ♫ Could it be you? ♫  

757
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:02,440
 ♫ My heart beats this fast at your approaching heart ♫  

758
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,150
 ♫ It's just a simple walk ♫  

759
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:10,550
 ♫ But why do I feel such a weight on my shoulders? ♫  

760
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:17,190
 ♫ It must've flown here breathlessly ♫  

761
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:25,430
♫   No matter how much I try to hold it in, you fall into view   ♫

762
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:29,610
 ♫ I will release ♫  

763
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:33,690
 ♫ This heart of mine that wanted to cry to no end ♫  

764
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,540
 With a girl's knees like this, would you ever get married? 

765
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,540
 What are you going to do if that girl is married? 

766
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,990
 I don't think anything would change even if she had a husband or child. 

767
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:45,230
 You. Did you meet with Ji Eun Ho? 

768
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,820
 I wanted to see Writer Seo Jung Eun's face. 

769
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,810
 Who am I that she'd say she's too busy? 

770
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:53,750
 - We'll receive divine punishment for this! 
- It's okay as long as Jung Eun doesn't know! 

771
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:57,820
 That writer. Is there no way to even get a picture of her? 

772
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:02,480
 It's a photo of the Korean writing class during Ji Eun Ho's military service. 

773
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,060
 I have to meet that woman. 

774
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,450
 Jung Eun. Can't you be with me today? 

775
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:08,760
 I'm in front of your apartment. 

776
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:13,360
 Seo Jung Eun. You're my wife and Ra Il's mother. 

777
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,820
 Eun Dong.
