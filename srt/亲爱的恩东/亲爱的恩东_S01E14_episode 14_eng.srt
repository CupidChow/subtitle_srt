1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:10,020


2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,720
You know why I came, right?

3
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,900
My son, my woman... I'm taking them back now.

4
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,360
"My son"? Who is?

5
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,000
Don't tell me you're actually claiming Ra Il as your son?

6
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,100
He  is  my son.

7
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,740
Thank you for raising him for all these years. Thank you very, very much.

8
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,920
I raised him.

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,460
I fed him, put clothes on him, and laid him to sleep every night.   That's  how he became  my  son.

10
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,260
How can he become your son within a day's notice?

11
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,140
I don't want to have a long talk about this.

12
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,860
I did  not  come here to negotiate with you.

13
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,160
I came here to inform you.

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,300
What on earth have you done for that woman?

15
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,200
What did you do for Jung Eun?

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,620
You waited for ten years?

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,740
You waited, while gaining fame and money, and enjoying everything the world has to offer.

18
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,660
That's all you did, isn't it?

19
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,080
Do you know what my ten years have been like?

20
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,520
You...

21
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,780
With your scamming and lying,

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,840
you spent your life with  my  son and  my  woman.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,520
What do you think my life was like?

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,540
Fame and money?

25
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,280
What good was that, when I couldn't share it with the person I loved?

26
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,660
Don't talk about things you have no idea about.

27
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,720
You can't take them. Never.

28
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,900
My son, my wife. You won't be able to lay a hand on them.

29
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,940
Do whatever you want.

30
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,790
You...

31
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,020
Would you be willing to give everything up for that woman?

32
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,960
Can you leave it all behind like I did?

33
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,320
Answer me. Can you do that?

34
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,000
Just watch what I can do.

35
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,060
 My Love Eun Dong
Episode 14 

36
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,820
I'm sorry,

37
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,400
that I didn't fully realize he could be my son.

38
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,570
I wanted to have your child, Oppa.

39
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,700
That's why I wanted us to get married early.

40
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,540
So then, how did you realize that Ra Il was your son?

41
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,000
I was looking at Ra Il, and it just came to me all of a sudden.

42
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,800
Ra Il is at my sister's house right now.

43
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,520
Do you know who my sister is?

44
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,100
Your husband's primary doctor, Park Hyun Ah.

45
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,160
The thought didn't cross my mind to tell you.

46
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,890
Our fate...

47
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,100
Isn't it just amazing?

48
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,940
How could something like that...

49
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,120
She invited me over today and when I got there, Ra Il was there.

50
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,300
The moment I saw Ra Il, I started getting all sorts of weird thoughts.

51
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,080
Really strange thoughts.

52
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:39,120
I'll do this ten times, twenty times better than anyone else.

53
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,780
I will love you even more, and I will make you even more happy.

54
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,820
You and Ra Il.

55
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,220
Let's go see Ra Il.

56
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:07,640
We can't. Ra Il has to go to school tomorrow, so I have to go back up to pack his clothes and his bag.

57
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,680
Okay. Then go get his clothes and bag.

58
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,500
Let's pick Ra Il up and go to my house.

59
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,820
Oppa. Let's take care of things the right way.

60
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,100
Ra Il also needs time.

61
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't want to. This is the right way.

62
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,960
And you just do what I ask of you.

63
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,120
This is why I couldn't tell you, because I was afraid you'd be like this. I know your personality.

64
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,980
Think about Ra Il.

65
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,020
That's the only dad he's had for ten years.

66
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:40,160
If you suddenly take him away,  how much pain would that cause for the child?

67
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,020
Just go pack his clothes and his bag. I'll handle it.

68
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,120
No. When it comes to Ra Il, you have to listen to me first.

69
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,020
I don't want to.

70
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,220
Oppa.

71
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,240
Okay.

72
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,180
I needed to prepare Ra Il's book bag.

73
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,070
I also needed to pack Ra Il's clothes.

74
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,510
Let's do well so that the child doesn't get hurt.

75
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:05,690
Little by little, I hope you can try to understand everything and continue to make the effort.

76
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,910
Then it will work.

77
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,370
Oppa, are you scared?

78
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,790
What?

79
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:38,650
Ah. Who wouldn't be scared?

80
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,250
My childish Oppa.

81
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,030
Now that you've suddenly became a dad, you're out of your mind, aren't you?

82
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,400
What does Ra Il like?

83
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,220
Ah, before that, what does he not like?

84
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,660
Let's take it slow.

85
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:05,060
Ra Il is a child that needs some time. He's different from you.

86
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,140
I'm a dad.

87
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:17,220
So you're saying you gave birth to my son, right?

88
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,820
Is Ra Il in that room? Come on in.

89
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,490
You've come?

90
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,090
Come on in.

91
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,080
How did you know?

92
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,080
I had a DNA test done to compare Father and Ra Il.

93
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,970
I've been meaning to tell you,

94
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:05,150
but this situation required a lot of thinking.

95
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,910
Please understand me, Oppa.

96
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,140
I'd like to be alone with Ra Il.

97
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,420
Okay.

98
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,420
 I'll be going to my mother's place. 

99
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,950
Oh no, you can sleep here tonight.

100
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:26,100
No that's okay. Please look after Ra Il.

101
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,540
You don't have to ask. He is my nephew.

102
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:15,600


103
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,560
Hello?

104
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,190
It's me.

105
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,080
 Yes. 

106
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,910
Our Ra Il is sleeping well, isn't he?

107
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,800
Yes.

108
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,930
He doesn't have any fever, does he?

109
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,760
 No, he doesn't. 

110
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,760
Please look after him.

111
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,390
Yes.

112
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,150
Hello.

113
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,230
Did you sleep well?

114
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,430
Why did you sleep here, Ahjussi?

115
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,320
Not sure...

116
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,710
Mi Na and her mother are females, so the females slept together.

117
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,650
I'm a male, so that's why we slept together, right?

118
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,830
Why didn't you sleep at your house?

119
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:53,000
I was talking to Mi Na's mother until very late at night, and I got really sleepy. So I slept here.

120
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,690
I get that way, too.

121
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:00,130
I'll be totally busy playing, but when it passes 11pm, I get really sleepy so then I have to go to bed.

122
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,170
Is that right?

123
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,840
You need to eat breakfast and go to school. Let's wash up.

124
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:12,970
I want to call my dad first. Today's the day he needs to water the lavender pot.

125
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,760
Father, did you sleep well?

126
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,700
Did you water the lavender pot?

127
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,080
Do you like reading books?

128
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,680
Yes.

129
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,770
What kind of sports do you like?

130
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,100
Baseball.

131
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,460
- Baseball? 
  - Yes.

132
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,950
Thank you for the ride, Ahjussi.

133
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,200
Okay. Have a good day at school.

134
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,000
Yes.

135
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,360
Ahjussi.

136
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,610
  Would you be willing to give everything up for that woman? 

137
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,300
 Can you leave it all behind like I did? 

138
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,050
Everything is ready.  You just need to come on time, Hyung.  Okay.

139
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,820
What did he say?

140
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,380
He asked if everything was ready for the press conference.

141
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,760
He needs to speak well.

142
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,180
Isn't a search and seizure something that's inevitable, Hyung?

143
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:35,130
That's one thing. But he needs to do a good job addressing the entire autobiography situation.

144
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,300
We're already getting rained on. We can't get hit by hail, too.

145
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,460
We need to protect Ji Eun Ho.

146
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:52,930
  CT Radiology Room
Please go in. 

147
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,890
Jae Ho, are you feeling uncomfortable somewhere? The color in your face doesn't look so good.

148
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,320
I didn't get much sleep.

149
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,970
I have a lot of stressful problems weighing on me.

150
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,920
Do you want me to prescribe you some sleep medication?

151
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,830
No. I still have a lot left.

152
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,120
Jae Ho.

153
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,040
Ji Eun Ho...

154
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,550
Is my biological older brother.

155
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,660
There were several different times I wanted to tell you, but I kept losing my timing.

156
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,530
 You are shocked, aren't you? 

157
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,030
You know what part of that should shock you the most?

158
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:52,410
Despite Ji Eun Ho being my biological brother, I was on your side.

159
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,430
Up to now, I thought my brother was intruding between you and Jung Eun,

160
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:04,040
but now that I know Ra Il is my nephew,

161
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,680
you are the one intruding between Jung Eun and Oppa.

162
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,760
Please let go of Jung Eun.

163
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,720
And Ra Il, too.

164
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,350
Did Ra Il get to school alright?

165
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,270
Yes.

166
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,800
Last night,

167
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,350
he slept with Oppa.

168
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,370
Is that right?

169
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,780
Now I can't even talk to you any more about my pain, Doctor.

170
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,410
Don't be that way. I will help you.

171
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,570
I'm a doctor.

172
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:25,040


173
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,930
Did you sleep well?

174
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,460
I fell asleep so quickly last night.

175
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,910
Uhm. I slept well.

176
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,930
I took Ra Il to school,

177
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,850
even fed him breakfast.

178
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,640
Uh! I am so proud of you.

179
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,110
Did you eat breakfast?

180
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,350
Not yet. My mom and I are making bibimbap.

181
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,010
Oh, sounds good. You should've invited me over.

182
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,240
 You want to come over? 

183
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,030
I have some work to take care off first. Tell your mother I'll be there after I finish.

184
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,310
I will do that.

185
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,120
 What does your mother like? 

186
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,770
He's asking what you like?

187
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,760
I don't want anything.

188
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,800
Just cherish my daughter, that's all.

189
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,200
You heard, right?

190
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,340
Tell her I can do that better than anybody in this world.

191
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,900
Oppa, come over as soon as you're done working.

192
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:04,030
Okay, I got it. Bring Ra Il over later, too.

193
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,240
 Hello?  

194
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,290
I got a call from Jae Ho.

195
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:14,550
 He asked for time with Ra Il today and tomorrow.   

196
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,860
I don't want to.

197
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:25,200
Oppa. When it comes to Ra Il, Jae Ho is a good person.

198
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,650
Okay, I understand. This isn't something I can control.

199
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,820
 I'll see you later.  

200
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,850
Yeah.

201
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,990
Eun Dong. I love you.

202
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,210
I love you, too.

203
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,020
  He's coming in! He's coming! 

204
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,020
Hello, members of the press.

205
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,770
Three months ago, in this very seat,

206
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,250
I announced that I was searching for my fiancée.

207
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,810
As I previously revealed, My Love Eun Dong,

208
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:39,020
was a book created with the intent of finding my fiancée, and thanks to that book,

209
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,910
I did find my fiancée.

210
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:49,120
 However, due to an article that was released yesterday by a certain media company, regarding the book, 

211
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,190
 we have had to fight some truth battles. 

212
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:57,830
As a person directly involved in that incident, I feel the need to express my exact position.

213
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,590
That is why I have asked you all here today.

214
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,500
As the article states,

215
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,380
that woman was already married when I found her.

216
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,720
She even has a child.

217
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:21,140
However, that child

218
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,530
was conceived between my fiancée and I.

219
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,430
  No way. 

220
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:31,600
I will be taking back my fiancée and my child.

221
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,380
 For the rest of my life, I will be doing all I can for those two people, 

222
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:42,060
 to fulfill my family obligation and to make up for ten years of happiness that we've lost. 

223
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,910
  To the public and to all of my fans, 

224
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:51,960
I believe telling you this up front is the right thing to do. That is why I asked for this press conference.

225
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,370
I...

226
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,020
I

227
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,570
will retire from my career as an actor.

228
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,730
If any media person, anonymous or not,

229
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:24,660
violates the image rights and privacy of my woman and son, while trying to dig information about me,

230
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,980
I will have no qualms about confronting them head-on, by any means necessary.

231
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,700
Please do not make me angry.

232
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:39,600
I am clearly informing all of you. This is my fair warning.

233
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,950
The legal matters involving the company are being dealt with actively.

234
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,090
We will issue a separate announcement concerning those particular matters at a later date.

235
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,410
This is all for now.

236
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,150
 Mr. Ji Eun Ho! Just one question!
 Wait a minute! 

237
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:32,400
Does that mean I don't do any work for you starting tomorrow?

238
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:40,180
It must've been really hard for you. Working for an actor like me who has a good personality,

239
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,830
is very considerate of others,

240
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:48,790
and modestly tries hard not to show off all those great qualities. You've really worked hard and gone through a lot of trouble.

241
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,200
You're joking at a time like this?

242
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,770
I am not in the mood for serious talk either.

243
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:59,130
But, how could you do that without discussing a word of it with me?

244
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,260
What am I to you, Hyung?

245
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,360
Am I just a manager to you? Am I nothing else to you, Hyung?

246
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,550
Why are you being this way?

247
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,280
This is probably not the case for you,

248
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,470
but I really liked you, Hyung.

249
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:24,320
I was willing to do anything for you and my feelings toward you were totally sincere.

250
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,000
Dude, if someone heard you, they might think you and I had dated.

251
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,560
You are too much, Hyung!

252
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,620
Hey, you really liked me?

253
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,580
Punk...

254
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,420
Okay, I like you, too.

255
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,260
Then prove it.

256
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,390
- Prove what? 
 - See, you can't!

257
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,350
Ah, this punk.

258
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,370
Hey, you take the store.

259
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,990
What store?

260
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,280
That children's clothing store.

261
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,270
Are you always this way?

262
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:11,090
The only things I can do for you are those sorts of things. So take it. I'll give it to you.

263
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,670
Why? You don't like it?

264
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,230
Wow, seriously Hyung, you are...

265
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,750
Let's go to Yeonhui-dong.

266
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:26,660
You need to go to the office. Where are you running off to alone again after you make a mess like this?

267
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,980
I'm hungry!

268
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,990
  Ji Eun Ho "Retiring from Acting Career to Protect My Woman" 

269
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:53,760
Park Hyun Soo, you're a teenager all over again!

270
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,670
Yeah, Mom.

271
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,780
  Come over right away! 

272
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,940
You guys talk to each other, right?

273
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,320
You two are conspiring against your parents, aren't you?

274
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,010
Hurry up and talk.  You've seen him, haven't you?

275
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:29,790
Are you waiting to tell me after I pass out from all the stress?

276
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,150
Please calm down, Mom.

277
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,830
How do you expect me to be calm!

278
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:37,400
Retire? Fine, that can be reversed.

279
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,930
But I heard Eun Dong is a married woman with a child.

280
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:44,990
It's all over the Internet.

281
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,490
And her husband is handicapped...

282
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,730
Mom.

283
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,770
Hey. Perhaps...

284
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,650
Mom, don't get too worked up. Just listen to me.

285
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:10,750
That kid Ra Il, the one who didn't like scallions like Hyun Soo.

286
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:18,010
And the one I said looked exactly like Hyun Soo when he was young. Is that him by any chance?

287
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,520
Yeah, Mom.

288
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:27,720
I had a DNA test done with Father's hair, and the results showed that Ra Il is Father's grandson.

289
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,580
- Honey, honey. 
 - Honey. Uhh.

290
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,100
  Calm down, calm down. 

291
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:39,250
So that kid...

292
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:45,500
He's the one we saw at your house before? That kid?

293
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,930
So I didn't recognize my own baby sitting right in front of my eyes?

294
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:54,810
How could this be?  This makes no sense.

295
00:31:54,810 --> 00:32:00,090
 What to do? My poor Hyun Soo. 

296
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,810
President.

297
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,300
Where is Eun Ho?

298
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,400
He said he'll be here in the evening. He said to talk then.

299
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,860
Hello?

300
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,100
I'm calling because the deadline is approaching.

301
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,980
Have you mentally prepared yourself?

302
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,500
I've already made my decision.

303
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,520
I followed my friend to the south, even though I am not a migratory bird.

304
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,060
I followed only because it was my friend, Eun Ho.

305
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,900
  This is my answer. 

306
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:48,160


307
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,720
How am I going to make a living if Eun Ho retires?

308
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,340
I'll probably have to go live inside for a few months.

309
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,530
I pay attention to fashion so the prison color...

310
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,870
I really don't like it.

311
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,900
President.

312
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,100
You know how it is.

313
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,910
For me, it's just a clothing problem, but for Eun Ho, from his food to the bathroom, he is quite picky.

314
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,310
It'll be better for me to go live inside.

315
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,850
Should I ask Eun Ho Hyung to come in now?

316
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:26,870
Leave him be. Let's at least one of us have a good time.

317
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,250
Come on in Oppa, this is the house where I used live.

318
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,010
Hello Mother.

319
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,660
I am sorry. We've committed too big of a sin.

320
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:57,990
Mom, why are doing this? You'll make him feel uncomfortable.

321
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:02,960
Mother, I haven't had anything to eat today.  I am too hungry.

322
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,050
Would you give me some of the bibimbap you made this morning?

323
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,120
How could I? Wait just a bit.

324
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,990
I'll make some fresh warm rice.

325
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:15,990
No, you don't need to. You can just give me cold rice, with the weather being hot and all.

326
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,150
This looks tasty.

327
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:26,340
Eat it slowly, you might get indigestion.

328
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,960
This tastes really delicious. Wow, this is good.

329
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,580
Mother. Go on a trip.

330
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,330
What...

331
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:48,310
Greece. With your close friends, about seven nights and eight days? Please go and enjoy yourself.

332
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,590
I would like to go with Jung Eun.

333
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:55,050
Uh, that won't do. Jung Eun needs to stay with me.

334
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,220
Take your close friends. If you give me the dates, I will set everything up.

335
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,940
- Can I really do that?
 - Of course.

336
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:09,050
This year, you should go to Greece. And next year, Italy? Italy is great.

337
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:13,040
Live your life taking trips like that every year.

338
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,230
Even if it's just words, I am grateful.

339
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:20,280
Please hand over Eun Dong to me. I will raise her well.

340
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,040
  I know there are a lot of things that need to be sorted out. 

341
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,590
But I'll make sure to take care of everything.

342
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:32,560
That's why I am asking you to take a trip so you don't have to worry about any of it.

343
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:39,360
Come visit often. I will serve you tasty food any time.

344
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,550
Yes.

345
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,390
 What do you like? 

346
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,590
Things that Ra Il likes. He has same taste as Ra Il.

347
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,770
They both don't like the things they don't like and both like the things they like.

348
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,160
 Mother, next time I would like jjim-dak (steamed chicken). 

349
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,390
Jjim-dak with the dang-myun (glass noodles). I really like it.

350
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:02,470
Okay, and take out the scallions.

351
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,330
I eat scallions now.

352
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,410
I eat scallions!

353
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,430
Eat slowly.

354
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,550
It's totally delicious.

355
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:29,970
You haven't seen the news or anything yet, right?

356
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:35,110
News? No I didn't watch it.  Did something happen?

357
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,250
I caused some trouble.

358
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,130
What trouble?

359
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:49,250
I quit acting.

360
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,830
Oppa, are you crazy? Are you for real?

361
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:58,200
I'm for real. I quit.

362
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,630
Oppa!

363
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,880
What?

364
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,460
Why are you doing this? Are you seventeen years old?

365
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,350
Why are you so impulsive?

366
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:13,260
Ahee. It is what it is. I've done as much as I could.

367
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,310
I can't even believe it.

368
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:19,370
That's why I'm bringing this up. Let's get you working.

369
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,360
What?

370
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:25,870
Your hand is all healed, right? Since I'm unemployed now, you need to work.

371
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:32,170
We have somewhere to go. I want to introduce you to someone.

372
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,730
Noona. Come here and say hello to Writer Park Jung Eun.

373
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:46,660
Hey! How can you retire from acting without talking to me first?

374
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,440
I knew you were a  nut job  but you really killed it today!

375
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,830
Don't get excited. Let's go inside.  Come on in.

376
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:55,350
Come in, come in. Let's go talk inside. Let's go, come on.

377
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:59,190
 Don't get all worked up. Noona, don't you have high blood pressure? 

378
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,250
I have low blood pressure!

379
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,920
Low blood pressure or high blood pressure, don't get excited and sit down.

380
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,130
Come in, come in this way.  You come sit here.

381
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:12,480
  Noona, this is the person I was talking to you about before. 

382
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,460
Hello, I am Seo Jung Eun.

383
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,100
So, did you say you're quitting acting because of that woman Eun Dong?

384
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,650
To protect her and the kid?

385
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,270
Don't tell me you made a retirement announcement to shield yourself in advance from the public attacking you?

386
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,670
It's not like that, Noona. Don't get so worked up.

387
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:38,400
 How can I not get worked up right now? That Eun Dong girl is trying to trap you by saying she is pregnant, isn't she? 

388
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,300
Bring her to me. I will talk to her really clearly so she  understands.

389
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,310
  How dare she block a man's future? Tell her I want to see her! 

390
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:50,680
I need to work with you on another project.

391
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,660
Bring that wench over here!

392
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,090
I did bring her to you.

393
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:08,620
Hello, I am Ji Eun Dong.

394
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,330
 If you read her script, you can tell right away she's never been in love before. 

395
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,070
Really?

396
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,790
The man and the woman always split up.

397
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:29,200
Right when the relationship is truly about to begin, she always splits them up.

398
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,480
I think she doesn't know how to handle it.

399
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,780
You will write well.

400
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,700
Why?

401
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,480
You're a woman who has thoroughly experienced love.

402
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,810
Do some work.

403
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,980
Oppa, we've gone back to ten years ago.

404
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:48,660
I told myself that I'd become a writer to support you.

405
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:53,550
See?  Dreams do come true. Work hard!

406
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,040
Where are we going now?

407
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,570
Don't know.

408
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:03,700
The reporters are camping out in front of my house.

409
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,140
Let's go to the vacation house.

410
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,980
  Turn on the Internet. 

411
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,560
  - This is my personal stuff.
- We still have to take it. 

412
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,060
  Please move over. 

413
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,120
Yes.

414
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,040
I already told you we'd pay the penalties for breaking the CF contract, according to its stipulations.

415
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,880
How does retiring from acting have anything to do with the CF?

416
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,620
Please, I ask that—

417
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,690
Hello.

418
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:07,360
Yes. We already talked about all of it yesterday.

419
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,300
  - Ra Il! 
 - Dad!

420
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,480
- Did you have fun? 
 - Uhm. You came, Dad?

421
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:34,040
That is the kid who said his wish is for his father to walk.

422
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,350
Ah, what to do?  Honey what to do, our Hyun Soo?

423
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,980
 What do we do with that young child? 

424
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,930
  I don't know. 

425
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,300
  God. 

426
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,740
  Father in heaven. 

427
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,080
Strike! Oh, nice!

428
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,540
- Catch it, Dad! 
- Wow!

429
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,300
- Strike! 
 - Two strikes!

430
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,500
Hey Ra Il, you've improved a lot.

431
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,480
Yes!

432
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,720
Breaking ball.

433
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,840
- Ah, cold!
 - You'll catch a cold.

434
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:29,320
Dad, I slept with an ahjussi named Ji Eun Ho yesterday.

435
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:36,240
They show him on television, but seeing him for real was interesting.

436
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,480
Do you like that Ahjussi?

437
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,820
I don't like him nor dislike him. He was just interesting.

438
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,670
- Ra Il
 - Uhm?  

439
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,660
Get along well with that Ahjussi.

440
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,240
Why?

441
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,340
I just would like it if you did.

442
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,200
Okay.

443
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,620
Let's go in. You might catch a cold.

444
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,760
Wow.

445
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,760
Throw it.

446
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,620
Starting here, you can't cross this line.

447
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:24,840
♫  How can I meet you again like this?  ♫

448
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,780
♫    I see the yearning painted on my lip    ♫

449
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,790
Okay.

450
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,390
Come here!

451
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,500
- You are so dead. Come here! 
- Hey, that is a rock!

452
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,980
Hey! Hey!  Use your words if I did something wrong!

453
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:51,400
Ahhh!

454
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:58,460
♫  All the warm memories now are
 coming back with a smile   ♫

455
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:07,860
♫  Back in the days we loved the times 
when we loved each other  ♫

456
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:14,470
♫  Back to the days we shared   ♫

457

460
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,240
♫  Stay with my arms...   ♫

461
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,340
You know, I've been thinking.

462
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:44,520
You and I and Ra Il—should we go live abroad?

463
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,800
- Abroad? 
 - Yeah.

464
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,980
I don't think there's any way things can get resolved here.

465
00:44:53,980 --> 00:45:00,620
For Ra Il's education—plus, people will endlessly make up stories.

466
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:05,020
If that's what you were thinking, then why did you take me to Writer Park Jung Eun's workroom?

467
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,780
I'm not saying let's go live there right now.

468
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:13,800
I'm just saying let's think about a long-term plan.

469
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,940
Oppa, you? What in the world made you think about a long-term plan?

470
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,880
After you and Ra Il suddenly came into my life,

471
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,760
it just took an instant to come to my senses.

472
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,820
Not just a long-term plan,

473
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:33,280
but for the first time, a sense, or an awareness of responsibility.

474
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,640
I'm feeling things like that, too.

475
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,820
I am not going overseas.

476
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,380
Why?

477
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:47,100
You see for me, after you came back into my life, I suddenly came to my senses.

478
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:51,980
 What if Oppa is doing some idiotic stuff again? Thoughts about how to stop you. 

479
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,180
I start feeling this enormous responsibility for you.

480
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,400
You have this tendency to really underestimate me.

481
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,880
It's not underestimating you, but seeing you for exactly who you are.

482
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,180
Who else knows you as well as I do?

483
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,760
Ah, seriously.

484
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,400
Yeah, yeah, you're just so smart, aren't you?

485
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,480
Oppa. Do you want me to read your palm?

486
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:23,280
Looks like you're going to be nagged to death.

487
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,080
Hey! This shows that I will live well, and my life line is long, too.

488
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,160
I didn't wash my hands today.

489
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,380
At school, they gave us homework to write a filial duty diary.

490
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,080
- Filial duty diary? 
 - Yeah, filial duty diary.

491
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,500
Do you know what filial duty is?

492
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,460
Of course I do. Washing your feet, Dad.

493
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:51,710
Wow. So does that mean you're going to wash my feet today?

494
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:19,040
Ra Il. What filial duty means is, listening to your mother well.

495
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,700
That's a piece of cake.

496
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,500
You'll be a good son to her, right?

497
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,140
That's a given!

498
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,280
Dad, why didn't you listen to Mom?

499
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,480
- Me? 
 - Yeah.

500
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,900
Isn't that why you two fought, because you didn't listen to her?

501
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,060
Does it seem like your mom and I were fighting?

502
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,440
It wasn't a fight.

503
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,960
It really wasn't?

504
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,700
How could I fight with your mom?

505
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,090
It's really, really not, right?

506
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,980
Of course.

507
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,860
All done.

508
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,940
Dad, give me a minute.

509
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,680
I am going to draw your footprint and then take an evidence photo.

510
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,360
All done.

511
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,080
Wow.

512
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,340
Ra Il, why don't you put your foot against it.

513
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,700
I still have a long way to go to be as big as you, don't I?

514
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,260
All done.

515
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:12,660
- Wow. Our toes look alike, don't you think? 
 - Yeah.

516
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,460
Oppa, I'm hungry!

517
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,860
Just wait little longer. I'll make it tasty.

518
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,580
Here. All done.

519
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,400
 Shall we say cheers? 

520
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,920
Cheers!

521
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,180
Here.

522
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,580
Try this.

523
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,380
What do you think?

524
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,380
- It tastes good! 
 - Right? It's good, doesn't it?

525
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,160
Feed me, too.

526
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,930
It does taste good!

527
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,940
What do you think Ra Il is doing now?

528
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,600
Give him a call.

529
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:29,660
Leave him be.  We agreed to give him more time.

530
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:37,040
I want to bring him here and eat together.

531
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,680
Jae Ho's mother came over to prepare their dinner.

532
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:45,160
She must not know yet that Ra Il is my son.

533
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,800
It seems so.

534
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,640
I wish I could see him.

535
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,300
  "You are responsible for what you have tamed." 

536
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:11,700
  "You are responsible for your rose," said the fox. 

537
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:17,020
 "I am responsible for my rose," 

538
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:21,660
 the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember. 

539
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:30,000
 Dad. If you think about it carefully, the little prince and the rose are like you and me. 

540
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,420
  I feel responsibility towards you. 

541
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:38,640
Because, just like the little prince's precious fox and rose,

542
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:46,020
you are precious to me, and you and I have tamed each other, Dad.

543
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,740
You're right.

544
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,520
I am getting sleepy. Dad I'm going to sleep.

545
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,160
I'll see you tomorrow.

546
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,840
Ra Il.

547
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,720
Go to your mother.

548
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,360
  Ra Il's father. 

549
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,540
Hello.

550
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,220
 It's me. 

551
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,130
Come and get Ra Il.

552
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,500
Alright.

553
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:58,490
Okay.

554
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,820
What did he say?

555
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,580
He said to take Ra Il.

556
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,600
Really?

557
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,520
Let's go Jung Eun!

558
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,480
How can we bring him here?

559
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,820
Ra Il will be shocked to see us together.

560
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,140
Ah, that's right.

561
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:35,220
Then let's ask Hyun Ah to bring him to her house.

562
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,760
Ra Il.

563
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:52,480
Ask Ji Eun Ho Ahjussi to read the rest of this book for you, okay?

564
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,400
Is that Ahjussi coming to Mi Na's house tonight?

565
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,640
Probably.

566
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,960
Come here.

567
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,020
- Go get your clothes together. 
- Okay.

568
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,760
Yes, I am sending him down.

569
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,760
Yes, I'll call you again after I take him to school tomorrow.

570
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,960
 Give me a call. 

571
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,740
Ra Il, what did your dad say?

572
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:23,820
He just told me to get along well with Mi Na's uncle Ji Eun Ho.

573
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:31,240
  He told me to ask Ahjussi to read my Little Prince book for me, too. 

574
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:44,850
  Choi Jae Ho 

575
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,220
  The customer is not answering... 

576
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,740
  I hope this will bring you good luck, Dad. 

577
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,480
  Thanks Ra Il. 

578
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,300
Ra Il! Ra Il!

579
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,900
Get up for a minute, Ra Il!

580
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:47,640
What's the code to your house?

581
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,540
  Choi Jae Ho 

582
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,590
Why aren't you answering?

583
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:20,730
Jae Ho!

584
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:22,650
Jae Ho! Are you in there?

585
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,590
Jae Ho!

586
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,080
Jae Ho!

587
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,120
Jae Ho!

588
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,530
What are his vitals?

589
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:05,290
70/50 and dropping.

590
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,970
  Don't answer. 

591
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,500
Hello.

592
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:49,120
Jung Eun. You need to come to the hospital now.

593
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,240
Is Ra Il sick?

594
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,040
  Jae Ho... 

595
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,000
Attempted to commit suicide.

596
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,440
  I am sorry Jung Eun. 

597
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,680
  I am sorry for loving you. 

598
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:17,220
♫   I might not be able to look at you again   ♫

599
