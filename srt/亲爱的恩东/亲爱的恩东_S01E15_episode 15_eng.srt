1
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,340
 You need to come to the hospital now. 

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,210
  Jae Ho 

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,520
  attempted to commit suicide. 

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,450
  You can't take them! Absolutely not. 

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,960
  My son and my wife... 

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,700
  You won't even be able to touch them. 

7
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,470
  Hey! Choi Ra Il, be careful! 

8
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,630
  Don't run, Ra Il! 

9
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,020
  Dad, let's hurry! 

10
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,960
Oppa, stay here. I'll go in alone.

11
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,560
Eun Dong!

12
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,290
Don't worry too much. I am Eun Dong.

13
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,720
  Emergency Medical Service Center 

14
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,130
Jung Eun!

15
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,180
  He slit his wrist. 

16
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,450
  He also ingested two weeks worth of sleeping pills all at once. 

17
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,130
  He is still unconscious. 

18
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,850
Hello?

19
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,010
  Oh, Oppa. 

20
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,220
How is his condition?

21
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,830
We need to wait and see.

22
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,760
Is it serious?

23
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,750
I don't think it's going to be life-threatening.

24
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,380
He slit his wrist.

25
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,170
  He also took sleeping pills. 

26
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,470
  Oppa. 

27
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,960
What?

28
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,370
Jung Eun and Ra Il meant everything to him,

29
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,630
everything he loved.

30
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,380
  I will watch his progress and let you know. 

31
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:23,960


32
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,820
  What are you doing here at this time of the night? 

33
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,000
  Did something happen? 

34
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,300
What is it again? What happened?

35
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,040
I have no place to go.

36
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,740
What?

37
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,130
Reporters in front my house, reporters in front of the company...

38
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,380
Weren't you with the writer?

39
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,090
You're my manager.

40
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,740
Of course. So please tell me what in the world is going on?

41
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,200
That man...

42
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,960
Eun Dong's husband attempted to commit suicide.

43
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,740
Why did he attempt to commit suicide?

44
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,820
Hyung! It's not because of you,

45
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,770
so I hope you're not thinking any of this is your fault.

46
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,060
Hyung, she was originally your girlfriend and he is the one who took her from you.

47
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,300
And on top of that, at this point it's looking like you're the one who's going to have to pay for their marriage annulment.

48
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,960
Why are things so difficult for me and Eun Dong?

49
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,860
  Hyung, remember you told him that night of the Sponsorship Event? 

50
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,830
  That you were going to play fairly. 

51
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,360
First, let's hope for his recovery. We can talk about the rest later.

52
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,990
You know, thinking about the three of us...

53
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,470
Who is the perpetrator and who is the victim?

54
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,580
I waited for ten years.

55
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:06,570
Why am I treated like I'm the sinner, when I haven't done anything wrong?

56
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,660
And he is the one who took  my  woman.

57
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,870
Why is he making me feel like I stole  his  woman?

58
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,670
Hyung. You didn't do anything wrong.

59
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,950
Which is why you shouldn't even entertain thoughts like that.

60
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,100
I'll just sleep right here.

61
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,340
Go sleep in the bed.

62
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,360
This is fine.

63
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,580
Eun Dong is with that man.

64
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,980
Ra Il is calling me Ahjussi.

65
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,940
My life is such a mess.

66
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,390
Mom!

67
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,700
Oh you're home. Oh my...

68
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,990
Look at the blood on your cloth— Are you alright?

69
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,240
What about Ra Il?

70
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,720
Oh, your father took him to school

71
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,670
and I sent Mi Na off on the kindergarten bus.

72
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,070
Mom, I'll come back out after I change my clothes.

73
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,860
What?

74
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:38,780
Ay, th-then... People will be saying all of this is your brother's fault.

75
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,860
People will think that way, won't they?

76
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,420
As of now, if he regains consciousness today, I've made sure that no information goes out to reporters.

77
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,130
Ahh! Ahh, seriously! I mean...

78
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:53,780
Why are such horrible things happening to our Hyun Soo?

79
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,800
Mom, is your son the only one who's important?

80
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,310
That man is fighting for his life right now.

81
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,770
Aigoo yeah, well— That's for  his mother to worry about.

82
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,570
Hey, what is your brother doing right now?

83
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,080
I bet Oppa is feeling like death right about now.

84
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,960
Mom, I have to go back to the hospital.

85
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,770
Again?

86
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,670
I will see you tonight.

87
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,000
  Hyung! It's time to get up now. 

88
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,720
Do you want to go to the sauna?

89
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,490
There haven't been any articles released yet, thank goodness.

90
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,220
Hopefully nothing happened overnight, right?

91
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,130
I will find out for you.

92
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,850
Choi Jae Ho is in Sungin Hospital's emergency room now.

93
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,470
  His vitals are stable now so we'll be moving him into the general ward. 

94
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,610
We need a guardian's signature here.

95
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,400
  Guardian: 

96
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:47,590
  Seo Jung Eun. 

97
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,510
Okay then.

98
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,360
Hello.

99
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,150
From the director.

100
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,180
What brings you here?

101
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,590
Your love.

102
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,710
Look at the end result of your sublime and great love.

103
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,190
I'm sure this wasn't the picture you wanted, Seo Jung Eun.

104
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,180
To Ji Eun Ho and Seo Jung Eun, it was love,

105
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,110
but to this man it was misfortune.

106
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,850
And ultimately the world will see it that way as well.

107
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,930
You said you wanted to protect Ji Eun Ho, didn't you?

108
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,710
You said you would see to any person who tries to ruin Ji Eun Ho.

109
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,190
The person who destroys Ji Eun Ho the most,

110
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,020
will be you in the end, Seo Jung Eun.

111
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,920
The guardian should stay strong, right?

112
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,830
Jae Ho! Jae Ho!

113
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,960
Jae Ho! Jae Ho!

114
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,500
Jae Ho, Jae Ho, Jae...

115
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,920
Was this what you wanted?

116
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,630
What kind of enemy were you in his past life to come back and do this, as if it wasn't enough to have crippled him?

117
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,390
You have to save my baby!

118
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,780
You have to bring him back!

119
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,170
 You have to save my baby! My baby... 

120
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:57,500
 Save my baby, my baby... 

121
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,590
You have to save my baby!

122
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,780
Please calm down!

123
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,090
This is a hospital! You can't be doing this here!

124
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,100
Get out! Get out!

125
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,730
- You can't do this here! This is a hospital.  Please calm down.
- Get out!

126
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,720
  Get out! Jae Ho.  Jae Ho! 

127
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,620
 Jae Ho.  Please save my baby.

128
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,390
My baby...

129
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:34,000
 My baby, Jae Ho. 

130
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,940
 What am I going to do? 

131
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,540
  Call the reporters. 

132
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,240
Quickly find out whatever information the hospital has had sealed

133
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,790
because Park Hyun Ah is blocking it.

134
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,200
Yes.

135
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:42,380


136
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,650
  Oppa. 

137
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:48,790
  Jae Ho's mother lost it and kicked Jung Eun out. 

138
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,260
Don't do it.

139
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,830
I will call for some people to take care of it.

140
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,230
Eun Dong.

141
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,260
Oppa.

142
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,390
Listen carefully to what I'm saying.

143
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,480
This is just the beginning.

144
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,300
From now on, we will be misunderstood

145
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,620
and criticized by the world.

146
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,410
We must overcome it.  We can't fall apart, got it?

147
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,560
And...

148
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,230
I will save that man.

149
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,780
No matter what it takes, I will make sure to save that man, so don't worry.

150
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,130
Let's go.

151
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,220
  Seoul Central District Attorney's (Public Prosecutors') Office 
 Summons for Witness Testimony 

152
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,030
 President! 

153
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,730
   Hard-Luck Pitcher Choi Jae Ho's Suicide Attempt 

154
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,340
Hey!

155
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,120
What is this article?

156
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,420
  Did he really commit suicide? Please tell me he didn't die! 

157
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,980
Where is Hyun Soo now?

158
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,790
Yeah, it's me.

159
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,560
 The articles have surfaced, Hyung. 

160
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,470
  As expected, it's total chaos. 

161
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,900
Really?

162
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,680
- I understand. 
  - Hyung! Stay strong. 

163
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,860
It will be hard to take care of right away because right now we're dealing with that whole President issue as well.

164
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,200
We have no allies right now.

165
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,440
Okay, I understand.

166
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,340
Are you ready?

167
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,070
Let's go.

168
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,030
♫   Left in my heart so I can't forget you   ♫

169
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,060
  He's coming! He's coming!
♫   Left in my heart so I can't forget you   ♫ 

170
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:56,270
♫   My hidden feelings for you   ♫

171
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,370
  Just a second! Ji Eun Ho! 
 ♫  If you knew how empty I feel without you  ♫

172
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,940
♫   Your smile comes to me   ♫

173
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:20,180
♫   You make my numbed heart flutter  ♫

174
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,630
♫   I keep picturing your face  ♫

175
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,350
♫   You keep crossing my mind  ♫

176
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:32,590
♫   What should I do about this my swelling heart?  ♫

177
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:39,570
♫   I'm keeping you in my heart, 
so you remain with me  ♫

178
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:47,990
♫   It will never change, 
my overpowering love  ♫

179
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,450
♫   Only when I see you smile  ♫

180
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:58,020
♫   If I could see you then I could finally breathe  ♫

181
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:04,660
♫   I'm looking only for you,
that's what my heart is like   ♫

182
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,740
My friend over there, she's still sleeping.

183
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,670
Please give her something to eat when she wakes up.

184
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,410
Even if she says she doesn't want anything, please make sure that she eats.

185
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,590
  Yes, I will do that. 

186
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,660
I need to step out, but I'll be back soon.

187
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,290
    'Suicide Attempt' Choi Jae Ho? Take a Closer Look... It's the Long-Forgotten Hard-Luck Pitcher 

188
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,580
 Actor Ji Eun Ho's 'Eun Dong' Drove Handicapped Husband to Suicide 

189
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,590
DM's President Lee has only admitted to the charges of bribery,

190
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,020
but has completely denied everything else.

191
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,090
I think they're planning to subpoena

192
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:28,010
former President Hwang Gyu Shik to testify on the witness stand.

193
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,120
Monitor President Hwang carefully to make sure he doesn't run.

194
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,600
Yes.

195
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,150
President Lee is really loyal.

196
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:41,870
I heard he testified that Ji Eun Ho had nothing to do with this incident.

197
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,390
Well, it is true that he had nothing to do with it.

198
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,450
Even though I didn't plan out everything that's actually happening,

199
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,050
it's all working out really well on its own.

200
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,660
Hello?

201
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,160
Your life has become pretty uncomfortable lately, hasn't it?

202
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,810
Is it our company that you want?

203
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,640
No.

204
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,300
I already told you that it's you I want.

205
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,940
Help Hyun Bal out.

206
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,080
You started all of this.

207
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,690
He's already turned himself in to the prosecutors.

208
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,740
The only thing I started was an investigation by the prosecutors,

209
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,690
who just shook out the dust that already existed in your company.

210
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,980
I don't have the kind of power that can stop a case that's already in the prosecutors' hands.

211
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,790
And our nation's prosecutors are no joke, either.

212
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,580
About President Hwang,

213
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,620
you know where he is, don't you?

214
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,480
 Aren't you the one controlling his moves? 

215
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:12,060
I'm planning to move in with her.

216
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,500
 I have a son as well. 

217
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,180
Go ahead and take our company.

218
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,860
I will entrust it to you based on any conditions you want to set.

219
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,490
After Ji Eun Ho hits the bottom,

220
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,060
what value will the company have left? The only thing left for the future is your continuous downfall.

221
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,700
That's why I'm asking you to set a limit that will allow me to live a decent enough life,

222
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,260
and take the company while it still has reasonable value.

223
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,350
Are you afraid of falling?

224
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,880
Of course not.

225
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,500
Right now, I'm only thinking about how to protect my woman and my son.

226
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,020
You're a salesperson.

227
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:55,160
Think carefully about which choice is the fairest to you.

228
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,840
I'll be going.

229
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,910
Regarding President Hwang's case, I'll discuss it with our company lawyer first.

230
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:08,390
You may be summoned for an investigation,

231
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,940
or you might be investigated as a witness.

232
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:19,090
I have to go now to pick up my kid from school.

233
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,690
I'm leaving.

234
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:29,790


235
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,650
Where are we going now?

236
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,020
To your mom.

237
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,860
Where are you calling?

238
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,830
My dad.

239
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,440
It seems she's still sleeping.

240
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,420
Ra Il.

241
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,110
Since your mom is sleeping,

242
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,390
should we play here together?

243
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,810
I want to see my mom.

244
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,460
Mom.

245
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,710
Ra Il, you're here?

246
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,290
Mom, why are you sleeping here?

247
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,320
Why are you sleeping at Mi Na's uncle's house?

248
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,110
Mom, let's go to our house.

249
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,300
To Dad.

250
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,600
Ra Il. We have to sleep here today.

251
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,460
I don't want to. I like our house.

252
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,680
Let's go to Dad now.

253
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,690
Ra Il.

254
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:20,640
Mom, did you do something wrong?

255
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,590
The kids were saying that you were having an affair.

256
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,640
They said they heard it from their moms.

257
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,530
They said you and that ahjussi are committing adultery.

258
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,640
But what's adultery?

259
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,760
Oppa.

260
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,190
I will tell Ra Il.

261
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:06,640
I'll tell him

262
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,670
that you are his father.

263
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:16,260
Let's tell him after that man wakes up.

264
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,780
Right now is not the time.

265
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,900
It feels sneaky, don't you think?

266
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,460
I understand.

267
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,880
I'll go to the hospital.

268
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,190
I have to face reality.

269
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,110
Nothing can be solved from just sitting here.

270
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:47,020
I'm sorry for making things difficult for you.

271
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,500
Why are you sorry, Oppa?

272
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,020
If it's this hard for me, I can only imagine how it is for you!

273
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,690
Let's overcome this hardship.

274
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,450
Got it?

275
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,260
Let's do that.

276
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:40,500
 Your call cannot be connected.  After the beep— 

277
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:47,130
  Dad, I miss you. 

278
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,510
  Dad, where are you? 

279
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,530
 Although we'll have to do further tests, so far there aren't any issues in terms of hemorrhaging or infarction. 

280
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,940
 I actually think the reason he hasn't regained consciousness 

281
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,680
 could be attributed to a psychological cause. 

282
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,020
  That is, he may be rejecting his own will to wake up. 

283
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,230
Then what should we do, Sunbae?

284
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,730
Honestly, this isn't a proven medical procedure, but...

285
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:14,030
A while back, a male patient who poisoned himself was brought to the ER.

286
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,840
We successfully treated him without any complications,

287
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,950
but he remained unconscious for three days.

288
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,960
His daughter came and kept talking to him.

289
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,760
She kept telling him in his ear, "Dad, wake up,"

290
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,200
and he finally woke up.

291
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,200
 I definitely believe there's an element within one's subconscious that can control the conscious mind. 

292
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:44,760
Honey, we should go and meet with Eun Dong.

293
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,480
Actually, we should meet with her and hear what she has to say.

294
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,340
Under what pretext would we meet her,

295
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,040
when they're dealing with a life-or-death situation right now.

296
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,940
No, I mean,  let's just think about Hyun Soo.

297
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,750
Let's just consider how our son is feeling about his own son being raised by someone else for ten years.

298
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,220
You're being so nosy about other people's issues.

299
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:11,720
Why are completely dismissing the feelings of someone who embraced and raised someone else's child?

300
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,240
He genuinely cherishes Ra Il and raised him very  lovingly.

301
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:54,290
Jae Ho told me once.

302
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:58,560
There was a lady whom he loved,

303
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,490
but it seemed it was only he who loved her.

304
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,640
Was it you?

305
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,920
Did Jae Ho know

306
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,280
that Ra Il was not his real son?

307
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,100
Yes.

308
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,910
He said

309
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,810
you were pregnant with his child.

310
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:39,490
Was it after your memory returned,

311
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,500
when you realized who Ra Il's real father was?

312
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,550
Yes.

313
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,600
What are you going to do?

314
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,240
Go.

315
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,630
Just leave, without lingering.

316
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,390
I will also

317
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,520
let go of my feelings for Ra Il.

318
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,070
Please let me stay,

319
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,110
at least until Jae Ho wakes up.

320
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:29,120
Then I will do as you tell me, Mother.

321
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,500
 Attorney Hong just stopped by. 

322
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,890
 He's pretty sure President Lee will have to serve time in prison. 

323
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,840
 The writer's pictures were taken down but... 

324
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,420
Even though the articles have been removed, they're already all over the Internet.

325
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,010
I'll discuss it with the legal team tomorrow.

326
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,720
  Alright. 

327
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,230
Dong Gyu.

328
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:11,520
How do you suggest I spend time with a ten-year-old boy?

329
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:17,100
Hyung, you can just do your usual, at your present level.

330
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,170
This shouldn't be hard for you at all.

331
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,940
Aish, this is serious for me right now.

332
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,260
Oh, Ra Il.

333
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,230
Let's hang up.

334
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,490
What's up? Are you having a hard time falling asleep?

335
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,290
Where is Mom?

336
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,510
Mom?

337
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,870
Ah....Th... Come on in.

338
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,570
Sit here.

339
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:55,220
Ra Il, should I have Mi Na come over?

340
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,020
Then, do you want to play   Word Relay  game?

341
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,880
Do you want to play computer games?

342
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,070
Ra Il.

343
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,660
What do you want to do?

344
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:22,990
Dad used to read books to me.

345
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,650
Books?

346
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,950
 I teach you the superman. 

347
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:37,200
 Man is something that must be overcome. 

348
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,230
What have you done to overcome yourself?

349
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:52,410
All beings so far have created something

350
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,350
beyond themselves.

351
00:37:55,350 --> 00:38:00,280
Do you want to be the ebb of that great tide, and revert back to the beast rather than overcome mankind?

352
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:07,190
What is the ape to man?

353
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,040
I'm going to sleep now.

354
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,720
I know you tried really hard.

355
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,660
You're going to sleep?

356
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,600
You're not curious what the ape is?

357
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,040
No, I am not curious.

358
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:44,640


359
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,310
 Your call cannot be connected.  After the beep— 

360
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:06,610
Dad, why are you not answering?

361
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,530
Without me there at home for you...

362
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:13,760
It's not because you fainted like last time, right?

363
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,480
Dad. I'm really worried about you.

364
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,000
If you hear this message, make sure to call me back.

365
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,060
Okay?

366
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,570
 ...has been recorded. 

367
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,190
Where did he go?

368
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,920
Ra Il!

369
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,270
Ra Il!

370
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,600
Ra Il!

371
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,750
Where did he go?

372
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,840
Hello?

373
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,620
 Ra Il said he's going to the house right now to look for his dad. 

374
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:51,800
  Since neither his dad nor his mom are answering his calls, he called me. Oppa, go and look for him. 

375
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,460
Ra Il.

376
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,190
Let's go to Dad.

377
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,780
Ra Il.

378
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,400
Dad. Dad!

379
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,330
Dad, wake up!

380
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21,610
Dad! Dad!

381
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,220
Dad!

382
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,430
Dad, wake up.

383
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,500
Come on Dad, you're a superman!

384
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,360
Mom. Why is Dad like this, Mom?

385
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,680
He's not waking up.

386
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,940
It's okay. Right now...

387
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,840
- Dad is sleeping.
- No, he's not! He's not!

388
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,450
Dad!

389
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:28,340
 Abandoned your disabled husband and started an affair with Ji Eun Ho. 

390
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,740
 Some nerve you've got trying to take care of your husband in the hospital now. 

391
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,290
 You're not even ashamed in front of your child? 

392
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:39,300
The world is coming to an end, I tell you!

393
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:44,770
Aigoo. I am so sorry for getting water on you.

394
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,120
 We will take legal action against any news media who engage in defamation of character. I have clearly stated our position. 

395
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,510
Please leave now.

396
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:43,030
Please leave!

397
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:45,140
Please leave.

398
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:50,100
  Please leave. 

399
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,990
 It's Ji Eun Ho! Oh, Ji Eun Ho! 

400
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:57,260
 Ji Eun Ho! We just want to ask you some questions. 

401
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:01,240
  Please say some words. 

402
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,250
 Ji Eun Ho! Ji Eun Ho! 

403
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:06,330
 - Ji Eun Ho!
- Please don't come in! 

404
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,050
 Ah, that's too much. 

405
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:20,820


406
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,430
What's going on with Hyun Bal?

407
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:29,730
- Do they still have him in questioning?
- Yes.

408
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,620
Let's start the company liquidation process.

409
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,030
Yes.

410
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:47,400
I'm worried about the writer and Ra Il.

411
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,250
Hyung, there are a lot of things you can do as a celebrity,

412
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,300
but with this, there is no solution.

413
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,450
I...

414
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,800
seem to be making their lives harder.

415
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,180
Because of me...

416
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,090
It seems like the closer I get, the more they suffer.

417
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:19,940
I told you not to think that way.

418
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:07,630
Ra Il. Ra Il.

419
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,200
Why don't you go eat with Mom?

420
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,890
When Dad wakes up, I'll eat with him.

421
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:23,330
I don't want to eat when Dad can't eat. I'm not eating.

422
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:29,440
You can't do this. Come on, let's have you go with Mom.

423
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:36,360
What are you doing?

424
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,620
I want to you to stop coming here.

425
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,760
Take Ra Il with you.

426
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,580
Ra Il.

427
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,960
- Let's go.
- I don't want to.

428
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,560
Dad, let's go together. Hurry and wake up.

429
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,680
You promised to play baseball with me.

430
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,410
You also said you'd read  The Little Prince  to me.

431
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,310
 I need the potted plant. 

432
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:39,870
 Grandfather, remember you said that it brings good luck? 

433
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:43,760
 Dad will surely live. 

434
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,230
 Grandfather... 

435
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:04,920
If you stick to him like this, then it's hard for your father.

436
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,650
I don't want to. I'm going to stay by Dad's side.

437
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:15,300
 First, let's just get you down from the bed. If you press on a tube like this while lying down, it will be dangerous for your father. 

438
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:17,930
That's right.

439
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:37,900
Then, is Ra Il still in his dad's hospital room?

440
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,210
But, what's with your expression?

441
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:51,810
That person raised our Ra Il really well.

442
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,750
We can't separate the two of them.

443
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:04,380
Oh, God. Oh, God.

444
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,500
Immaculate Conception...

445
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,320
Yes, Father.

446
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:59,500
 Do you want to go fishing with me? It's been a while since we've gone. 

447
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,570
Fishing?

448
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,990
About Mi Na's dad, Son-in-law Yoo,

449
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:13,320
do you remember that time the three of us went fishing like this together, right?

450
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,930
Without your mom knowing.

451
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,690
Yes.

452
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:22,050
After that day, I couldn't go fishing any more.

453
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:25,200
The image of his pale, lifeless hands,

454
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,650
I kept remembering that.

455
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,900
I guess that's the reason why I couldn't bring myself to go fishing any more.

456
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,990
I felt like that too.

457
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,770
Hyun Soo.

458
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,550
Life is

459
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:42,690
just like fishing.

460
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,510
It's the endless, continuous waiting.

461
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:53,960
And just like the feeding time, the timing of a single moment is important.

462
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:58,280
If you make a mistake pulling your rod in too early, you feel disappointed and lose hope.

463
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,720
But the moment a fish bites, that feeling in your hands...

464
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:04,370
You feel excited again with that one experience.

465
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:08,030
And just like that, you're again convinced  that life is good.

466
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,900
It's difficult, isn't it?

467
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:22,720
Yes.

468
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,550
I missed it.

469
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,660
For ten years,

470
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,420
I didn't get to see him growing up.

471
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:42,700
That's why for the remaining time,

472
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:46,550
I want to do a good job raising him myself.

473
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,420
I apologize, Father, for not discussing it with you

474
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,770
and making that decision on my own.

475
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,280
The three of us...

476
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:06,390
I've been thinking about having us leave Korea and live overseas.

477
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:12,850
Do you truly think

478
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:18,770
that is something that would make those two people happy?

479
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:24,290
That person raised that child.

480
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:30,460
I have seen how he looks at Ra Il.

481
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,670
It was genuine.

482
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,270
He's  my  son, Father.

483
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,280
Shouldn't you be thinking about what's best for Ra Il?

484
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,560
Oh, I got a bite!

485
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,500
Here.

486
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:36,840
Let him go, Hyun Soo.

487
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:43,010
Ra Il...

488
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:47,300
Let him go to that person.

489
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,720
I can't.

490
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:58,980
I can't do that, Father.

491
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:03,620
Why are you saying this, Father?

492
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,510
Because I'm a father,

493
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,610
I can understand what you're feeling.

494
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:18,560
Ra Il is my son.

495
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,970
Because I am your father, I am saying this to you.

496
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:26,210
 That's what a father is. 

497
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,650
More than your own pain,

498
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:33,220
your child's pain is bigger.

499
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:36,440
 It's something you do until the very end. 

500
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,340
 You protect your child with everything you have. 

501
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:43,240
Taking Ra Il away from that father,

502
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:49,690
that's your greed and your self-interest.

503
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,320
 Give that person a chance. 

504
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,140
Let Ra Il go.

505
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:08,080
I'm saying this solely for the child's happiness.

506
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,740
I will raise him.

507
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:18,820
I

508
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,580
can do a better job raising him.

509
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:25,670
He's  my  child, but I lived without seeing him for ten years.

510
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:30,310
Then what am I, Father? Huh?

511
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:33,690
This is the reason why you're not a father yet.

512
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,600
When you become a father,

513
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:47,980
you will come to understand my words.

514
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:21,840


515
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:31,280
♫  Why is love   ♫

516
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:38,300
♫  Like this continuing even without you   ♫

517
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,810
♫   Even as the night passes  ♫

518
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:46,560
♫    And many years later  ♫

519
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:52,340
♫   My footsteps continue to follow you  ♫

520
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:56,790
♫  No matter how much I try to hold back,   ♫

521
00:57:56,790 --> 00:58:01,200
♫   I'm so in love with you   ♫

522
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,200
♫   Without leaving a single thing out  ♫

523
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:12,450
♫  I cry out everything to you   ♫

524
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:16,560
♫   I see you, I see you  ♫

525
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:21,690
♫  Like this in front of me   ♫

526
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:24,050
♫  Unchanged as ever  ♫

527
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:28,980
♫   You are there in front of me  ♫

528
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:33,060
 Please don't take my dad away from me. 

529
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:36,100
 Can I be a good dad to Ra Il? 

530
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,730
  People don't believe Ra Il is your son.
  

531
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:41,220
 Please treat it as if I was just acting crazy on my own. 

532
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,850
 And let's just put an end to this incident. 

533
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,070
 I loved Ji Eun Ho. 

534
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:45,150
 It's dangerous. 

535
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:46,400
 I will let go of Eun Dong. 

536
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,120
 I will let Seo Jung Eun return to her rightful place. 

537
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,060
 Why are you being like this? Acting like someone who's going to leave all of a sudden. 

538
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,930
 Please take care of Ra Il. 

539
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:57,340
 If there was no Ji Eun Dong in this world, 

540
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:59,270
 would you have had feelings for me? 

541
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:02,960
 If she never existed, then I probably wouldn't be here either. That's how we are. 

542
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,060
 My Love Eun Dong
