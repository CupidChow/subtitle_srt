00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,400

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,600
 My Love Eun Dong
Episode 5 

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,600
 Ji Eun Ho  

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,040
Hello?

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,120
 It's Ji Eun Ho. 

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,560
Yes.

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,720
The music file I sent you...

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,400
Yes.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,080
The song that played when Eun Dong and I first kissed,

10
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,560
I never said that before.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,910
How did you know that?

12
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,790
Please wait a moment.

13
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,030
You never texted that to me?

14
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,510
No, I never did.

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,700
There's no way.

16
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,880
 Then how would I know that? 

17
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,680
Who are you?

18
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,270
Eun Dong?

19
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,510
Eun Dong!

20
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,000
Ji Eun Ho...

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,980
Let's meet right now.

22
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,540
It's too late. Let's meet another time.

23
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,720
No. Let's meet right now. I must meet you right now!

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,420
- I have to—
 - It's too late. 

25
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,060
I'm going to hang up now.

26
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,630
♫   It must have followed me  ♫

27
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:17,790
♫   No matter what, you always come into view   ♫

28
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,420
 It's a music file from my memory with Eun Dong. 

29
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,140
 It was the song that played when Eun Dong and Hyun Soo first kissed, right? 

30
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,720
 I never said that. 

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,280
That's right... He never told me.

32
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,740
Then how did I know that?

33
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,390
♫   Your unchanging self   ♫

34
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:52,640
♫   I hear it, I hear it in my dreams and wherever  ♫

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:03,580
♫   I hear your voice and your breathing that I didn't hear before   ♫

36
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,620
He has no manners, that person. This late at night...

37
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,440
Don't pick up, from now on.

38
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,110
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,040
I won't.

40
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,740
Sleep.

41
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,300
Ra Il! Ra Il! Wake up!

42
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,680
Hurry!

43
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,400
We're busy! Hurry and wake up!

44
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,160
Wake up!

45
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,760
Hurry, wake up!

46
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,860
I don't want to...

47
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,800
Get up!

48
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,500
Mmm...

49
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,660
Ready? One, two...

50
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,780
Jung Eun.

51
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,160
Seo Jung Eun.

52
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,820
Your name is so nice.

53
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,640
What is this first thing in the morning?

54
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,680
Seo Jung Eun, you're my wife and Ra Il's mother.

55
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,900
Don't forget that.

56
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,500
So flustering...

57
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,270
 Let's meet today. I have to see you. 

58
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,070
 It doesn't matter what time. 

59
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,050
 I'll match your schedule. 

60
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,850
 If not, I'll go to your house. 

61
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,490
This man must be crazy.

62
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,900
 I will send you a message later. 

63
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,680
 Turn off power. 
Will turn device power off. 

64
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,960
 It's the song that played when Eun Dong and Hyun Soo first kissed, right? 

65
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,520
 I never said that. 

66
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,750
 Your memory. Please find it. 

67
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,130
 How you met your husband, and how much you two loved each other. Please find those memories. 

68
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,910
 Then with those memories, you can endure reality. 

69
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,450
 I'm scared. 

70
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:35,870
 I feel like there is a huge whirlwind in the memories that I can't remember. 

71
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,830
 Like there's something I shouldn't know. 

72
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,790
 I'm scared. 

73
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,400
Have a nice day!

74
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,730
Welcome!

75
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,810
I would like to buy some clothes for a ten-year-old boy.

76
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,720
Please follow me this way.

77
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,740
Please look at this collection. They're all boys' clothing.

78
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,940
It's my nephew's clothes.

79
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,300
I see...

80
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,500
Did you marry?

81
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,320
- Yes. 
- Do you have a kid?

82
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,560
Yes. My son is ten-years old.

83
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,740
Then please pick something that your son would wear. It's for a wedding.

84
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,700
Ahh. Yes.

85
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,780
How is this?

86
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,600
I like it.

87
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,580
- How about this? 
- I like it.

88
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,220
You want both?

89
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,320
- Sure. 
- Okay, please wait a moment.

90
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,520
Here you are.

91
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,920
You don't seem like a mother with a ten-year old son.

92
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,080
I married early.

93
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,380
You must have really loved him.

94
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,520
I guess I did.

95
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,920
If it doesn't fit him, please bring it back right away.

96
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,760
I don't think I will need to.

97
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,480
What?

98
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,420
Now that I think about it, my nephew (niece) is actually a girl.

99
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,380
Omo. Then, please look at some other clothes.

100
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,240
It's fine. Please give these to your son. It's a gift.

101
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,220
- What? 
- Just accept them. It's fine.

102
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,040
Uh... Ma'am...

103
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,720
I'll come visit often.

104
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,520
Next time, I'll buy my niece something.

105
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,120
Well then.

106
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,930
What is she, that woman?

107
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,670
Oh.

108
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,030
Where?

109
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,690
I heard you're doing another drama with Writer Park Jung Eun.

110
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,030
I fell in love with you because of her drama long ago.

111
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,720
You were really cool then.

112
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,730
How could you act like that?

113
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,540
That wasn't acting for me back then.

114
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,180
That was my reality.

115
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:28,940
What do you like so much about that girl?

116
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,840
What do you like about me?

117
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:39,180
I guess I got my answer.

118
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,940
You need to really find a good man and marry.

119
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:48,540
What if that girl got married?

120
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,160
Do I have a chance then?

121
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,700
Does life work according to your plans?

122
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,710
When it's the heart doing it, of what meaning is a plan?

123
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,800
What if she has a child as well?

124
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,030
Even if she has a husband and child,

125
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,320
I don't think anything would change.

126
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,690
Nothing will change for me.

127
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,010
Is that high pride of yours gone only when you're in front of that girl? It wouldn't change?

128
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:44,020
Nothing would change for me, but there would be nothing I would be able to do.

129
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:11,260


130
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,950
 Ji Eun Ho Essay  

131
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,930
Honey, looks like you're already here. Let's hurry up and go out.

132
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,580
 That writer got into an accident a long time ago. 

133
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,000
She got into a really big accident when she was in the car with her husband.

134
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,710
So, because of damage to the spinal cord,  her husband's lower body is paralyzed.

135
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,830
And did the writer get hurt in her frontal lobe?

136
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,890
In any case, she said she can't remember anything from before the accident.

137
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:26,540
I just found that out too. Noona said if we found out she was a patient with traumatic brain injury, we wouldn't have given her the job. Sorry.

138
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:33,780
Hey, that writer, is there any way to see a picture of her?

139
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,460
What?

140
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,570
I'm really going crazy!

141
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,810
But Hyung, why are you so obsessed with that writer?

142
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,820
Dong Gyu, I really need to meet that writer.

143
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,670
You can just meet her then.

144
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,310
- She won't meet me! 
- So why did you make her upset?

145
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,080
What did I do to her?  Never mind.

146
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,670
Then do you want to secretly see her after I ask her to see me?

147
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,410
Yeah! Let's do that!

148
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,670
- Hey, contact her. 
- Okay.

149
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,000
She would immediately come see me if I ask.

150
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,450
 Today? 

151
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:19,740
 Today is not a good day. I have time tomorrow though. 

152
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,300
I'll see you tomorrow. I'm sorry.

153
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,980
Yes.

154
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,920
Who was that?

155
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,350
It wasn't anyone.

156
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,110
I asked who it was.

157
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,310
Ji Eun Ho's manager.

158
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,900
Then you could have told me it was his manager. Why did you say it wasn't anyone?

159
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,100
Did she agree to meet up with you?

160
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,780
You heard everything, didn't you?

161
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,340
So when are you meeting her?

162
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,510
You heard everything! She said let's see each other tomorrow.

163
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,990
Why is she so busy?

164
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,080
I told you she's busy and that she has a hard life.

165
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,070
Hey, then ask her if she can send you a picture of herself.

166
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,000
- What? 
- I don't need anything else. I just need to see her face in a picture.

167
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,710
What's wrong with you? Would you like it if she said she wouldn't want to meet up with me either?

168
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,890
- What picture all of a sudden... 
- No, I mean,

169
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,180
just tell her that we're putting her picture on the book!

170
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,500
Are you crazy? Why would we put a picture of a ghostwriter on the book?

171
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,790
- Ah...
 - Honestly... 

172
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,710
Hurry up and go home.

173
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:41,450
These days, if I work with you for three hours, then I feel as tired as working for three  years. 

174
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,890
What did you say? Aish!

175
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,450
It's because you keep saying such weird things.

176
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,390
Are you laughing? Look only in front of you, punk.

177
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,530
- I'm sorry, Hyungnim. 
- What hyungnim?

178
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,400
Follow me. Follow me.

179
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,410
Follow me. Follow me.

180
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,630
 Now go back to your original position. 

181
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,530
 Go back to your original position. 

182
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,080
Honey, order everything you want to eat.

183
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,910
I want to bring Ra Il here. He loves this restaurant.

184
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:45,350
We can just come with him later on. Let me have a date with you today.

185
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,360
You can order everything for me.

186
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,280
Okay. I will order everything.

187
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,000
Is the autobiography going well?

188
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,700
I'm almost done with it.

189
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,620
So you're already done?

190
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,270
No, I meant the two people. If you're almost done, then that means they're done.

191
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,660
I might have finished writing, but that doesn't mean they have. They haven't even started.

192
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,970
No it's all over for them.

193
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:17,760
Did you meet with Ji Eun Ho?

194
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,110
No.

195
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,100
Don't meet him.

196
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,490
 Would you like to order? 

197
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,660
Please give me number one, number three, and a shrimp salad.

198
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,820
Yes.

199
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,830
Why shouldn't I meet him?

200
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,420
It makes me upset.

201
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,390
- What? 
- Just don't meet him. You said you already wrote everything.

202
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,900
I have no intention of meeting him, either.

203
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,640
The person representing Ji Eun Ho told me not to meet him, either.

204
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,490
He must be worried that it would be revealed that it was ghostwritten.

205
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,970
But you're telling me not to meet him as well. I feel like I did something wrong.

206
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,250
- It makes me upset. 
- It makes me upset too.

207
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,530
Why are you acting like this as well?

208
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,800
Don't meet him. You can't.

209
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,080
No, what I'm saying is, Korea is like that...

210
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,740
There's always some trouble after contracts end.

211
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,220
It's right for me to tell you not to do it.

212
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:42,390


213
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:26,070
 I want to tell her to come back to me if she reads this book,  

214
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,520
 that my heart hasn't changed,  

215
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,770
 and that it's become stronger after ten years.  

216
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:41,000
 I end this book with the words I couldn't bring myself  

217
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,920
 to say to Eun Dong.  

218
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,050
 My Love, Eun Dong.  

219
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,430
 You were my reason for living.  

220
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:59,580
 During the ten years without you, that reason became my reason for living.  

221
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,080
 I'll wait for you.  

222
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,090
 I'll wait for you.  

223
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,170
 I'll wait for you... My Love, Eun Dong.  

224
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:33,080
 -End-  

225
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,940
Should I wear this?

226
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,760
Ra Il's Father, fighting today as well!

227
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,040
Jung Eun.

228
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,740
Can't you be with me today?

229
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,560
What's wrong?

230
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,360
I don't want to be in the treatment room alone.

231
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,800
I have an appointment so how could I?

232
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,860
- Go. 
- Okay.

233
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,980
I'll be back.

234
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,500
Now, I pressed it.

235
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,560
Please press the floor with your heels.

236
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,920
 Straighten yourself. 

237
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,600
Hello?

238
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,540
Oh Jung Eun, you need to quickly come to the hospital.

239
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,060
Jae Ho fainted while doing his rehabilitation exercise.

240
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,560
What?

241
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,740
Yes, I'll be there as soon as possible!

242
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,380
Yes, yes!

243
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,820
Yes, Miss Writer?

244
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,980
What?

245
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,800
You can't come?

246
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,860
Looks like we can't do anything about it.

247
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,280
Yes.

248
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,520
Aish, come on!

249
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,440
Oppa! Oh my god!

250
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,260
Let's go to the hair salon.

251
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,700
Are you planning to do your hair?

252
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,000
- Your cousin's place. 
- What?

253
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,960
Oh, okay.

254
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,040
Ji Eun Ho!!

255
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,220
Miss Customer, I'll just pick up a call.

256
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,760
What?

257
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,900
Ji Eun Ho is coming?

258
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,640
Hurry! Hurry! Make it more puffy.

259
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,320
- You need to put on some hairspray, after! 
- Noona!

260
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,820
P-Please come this way...

261
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:01,360
I really don't know what to do after you've

262
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,600
come to this humble place of mine.

263
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:10,240
Do you have any pictures that you've taken together with Writer Seo Jung Eun?

264
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,700
I don't have any pictures.

265
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,080
 I'm not really photogenic you see. 

266
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,460
I've been living life looking at people in person.

267
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,880
But, what did you need it for?

268
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,820
I wanted to see her face.

269
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,440
I called her, but she doesn't pick up my calls.

270
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,620
I wonder why she didn't pick up your calls.

271
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,540
Then please ask me.

272
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,760
I know everything about Jung Eun except for her hair strands.

273
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,620
Please ask anything.

274
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,680
Is her real name really Seo Jung Eun?

275
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,540
Yes, of course!

276
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,900
You said she's married, right?

277
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,500
Yes, she has a son, too.

278
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,660
She fell in love with her husband at first sight and passionately got married to him.

279
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,300
But why are you asking?

280
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:58,760
Didn't she grow up in Chuncheon when she was young?  And go to a city university?

281
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,640
No, I heard that she lived in Seoul and immigrated to the states when she was in high school.

282
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,680
 And it's only been four years since she's graduated from college. 

283
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,360
 It was some kind of community college. 

284
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,210
 But since life was so hard for her, she had to earn her own money to go to college. 

285
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:18,260
 And then her husband came to the away-game, and when their eyes met... 

286
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,380
But...

287
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,860
 Why are you asking? 

288
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:30,140
But, her husband got into an accident and is disabled.

289
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,520
Ah, yes. I heard.

290
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,760
 I heard  her husband's lower body is paralyzed because of damage to his spinal cord. 

291
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,540
 It's been so long, 

292
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,740
but it's so heart wrenching to see.

293
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,660
At that young  age, she lives in solitude—

294
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,540
Aigoo, again...

295
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,140
Thank you.

296
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,080
I'm sorry for taking your time when you're most likely busy.

297
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,180
- Please continue what you were doing. 
- Oh! I'm not busy!

298
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,840
I'm fine with having my time taken away.

299
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,800
- Please at least allow me to get an acknowledgment picture. 
- Forget it.

300
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,320
Honey!

301
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:11,380
It's not serious but he stretched out his neck and slightly hurt his pelvis.

302
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,760
He went overboard. He was greedy.

303
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,040
Did you change your lotion?

304
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,540
It's the one I always used to use.

305
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,400
The writer bought it for me.

306
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,980
Who?

307
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,460
Writer Park?

308
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,820
No,

309
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,840
the pretty writer with kind eyes.

310
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,860
That  woman is really weird.

311
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,560
She makes people confused.

312
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,020
What about mine?

313
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,440
Go home.

314
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,560
Do your homework and help Mom.

315
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,200
Dad, I want to sleep here.

316
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,000
Go home and sleep. It's uncomfortable here.

317
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,060
No, I want to sleep beside you.

318
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,540
I will quickly become an adult and help you.

319
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:50,080
I can do anything if Mom and Dad can get cured.

320
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,540
 Great!  

321
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,340
 Please look back.  

322
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,860
 Side a little bit. 

323
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,960
 Very good! One more time! 

324
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,820
 Yes, we'll be taking a break. 

325
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,340
Please give me some cold water.

326
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,300
The book came out today.

327
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,020
I know.

328
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,320
Did you study?

329
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,560
Don't worry. It came out as the number one article on the internet.

330
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,260
Everyone will know, other than people living under rocks.

331
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,020
 My Love, Eun Dong  

332
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,760
Let's tell Jung Eun.

333
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,500
Absolutely not.

334
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,500
We'll receive divine punishment!

335
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,320
It's fine if only Jung Eun doesn't know!

336
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,020
This all happened because you pushed it.

337
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:06,560
Eun Dong— No. Jung Eun ghostwrote this book.

338
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,900
 How could this happen? 

339
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,340
Let's tell Jung Eun.

340
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,880
What are you going to do by telling her?

341
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,540
Reveal everything.

342
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,620
No.

343
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,660
You, Jung Eun—

344
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,660
No.

345
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,820
Would you do this if Eun Dong were your real daughter?

346
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,080
What did you say?

347
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,200
We erased Jung Eun's memories from before the accident! We're going to receive divine punishment!

348
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,240
It was the best thing we could do. There was no other way!

349
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,640
It's funny, right?

350
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,400
It's not even my story, and it's technically not even a book I wrote.

351
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,120
But I'm so embarrassed I can't even read it.

352
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,120
Do other ghost writers feel like this, too?

353
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,700
What's wrong?

354
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,120
It's nothing.

355
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:11,380
It's just... When I look at this book, I was just wondering what it'd be like if you wrote your own book.

356
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,620
That thought came into my mind.

357
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,060
That's my dream.

358
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,000
Try it. Your dream. I'll cheer you on.

359
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,640
My mind is empty.

360
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:33,420
Times tables, capital of America, how to make rice, how to fold paper, curry rice recipe...

361
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,600
I intrinsically know all of these things.

362
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,380
But since my history all flew away from my mind, I  have no confidence.

363
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,160
 Writers need to use their experiences as a base for their writing. 

364
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,440
My memory coming back...

365
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,920
Would it be really difficult?

366
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm sorry, Jung Eun.

367
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,540
Why are you sorry to me?

368
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,460
You're making me feel sorry.

369
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,140
I'm sorry for loving you.

370
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,200
You should be a writer.

371
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,840
Your mother is coming, so I'm going to head out.

372
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,340
I have to go to the store today.

373
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,780
Okay. Have a nice time.

374
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,140
 Hurry! 

375
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,800
 Move a little faster! 

376
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,720
 That's good! 

377
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,060
 Main Producer - Kim Shi Hyun 
Screenwriter - Park Jung Eun
 Production - Kang Seo Joon 

378
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,500
That writer's name is Jung Eun.

379
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,880
Seo Jung Eun.

380
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,440
 Do you have separate feelings for Ji Eun Ho? 

381
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,260
- No... 
- Then why won't you meet him?

382
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,100
What's the point of meeting him?

383
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,580
Hey! Do you meet a man like him to do something?

384
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:09,460
Though, when you see him, you would probably do something. You're so stiff-necked.

385
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,400
Maybe it's because it's my first time ghostwriting.

386
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,640
Losing strength and having my heart break over someone else's story,

387
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,080
I think I invested too much of my emotion into their story.

388
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,540
No, it's because it's Ji Eun Ho.

389
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,400
If you wrote for an irritating, ugly grandpa,

390
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,200
you wouldn't feel heartbroken or dazed.

391
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,820
You would be unburdened.

392
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:37,920
Eun Dong once told Hyun Soo,

393
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,680
"My heart feels like it's getting cramps."

394
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:49,120
While I wrote this book, I completely understood those words,

395
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,300
because I was like that.

396
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,260
Just look at his face! It's so tiny!

397
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,840
As expected, stars are so different.

398
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,360
He's stealing the spotlight for himself. Look at this.

399
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,220
Stars are truly different, aren't they?

400
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,480
Yesterday, he was shining, himself. Oh!

401
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,440
Unni, you love Ji Eun Ho that much?

402
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,580
I love him so much! I want to have him in my possession!

403
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,180
Hey, but... Why is Ji Eun Ho so curious about you?

404
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,200
He was so serious.

405
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,400
 I should've done something properly. 

406
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,260
You worked hard!

407
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,960
Let's go home.

408
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,040
Right now?

409
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,800
 Okay. 

410
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:52,760
Hey, Miss Tak has great cooking skills. People like her are very uncommon.

411
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,840
Not uncommon. It was my first time seeing someone like her.

412
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,340
You like her that much?

413
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,400
- Where's Father? 
- He went out to the ranch.

414
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,120
It must be fun for him.

415
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,880
It's a relief.

416
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,200
After retiring and coming home, it was hard on your father.

417
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,940
He should take it easy.

418
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,580
I read your book.

419
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,740
Really?

420
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,420
I'm sorry, Mom.

421
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,240
Why?

422
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:41,620
While I was releasing the book and thought about my past life  again,

423
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,420
I must have made you suffer a lot.

424
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,830
Hey, why do you think I two-timed two religions?

425
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,740
So settle one of them.

426
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,720
 You settle on one of them. 

427
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,680
What are you going to do about Director Cho at Myung Sung Hotel, now that you've made this so big?

428
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,580
When I find Eun Dong, I'm sure it will all work out.

429
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,520
What?

430
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,120
I...

431
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,600
...am going to marry Eun Dong when I find her.

432
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,180
I'm going to have kids and live with her.

433
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:24,040
I'm going to eat the food she makes and nag her and live like that.

434
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,720
Hey, what are you going to do if she got married and had kids and is living a good life?

435
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,140
 You never thought about that? 

436
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:34,540
- There's no way that would happen. 
- What do you mean that would never happen?

437
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,380
Other people always tell me that having children where one's a doctor and one's a top star,

438
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,360
that I must have the world's luck.

439
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,520
That I'm a child loved by God.

440
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:53,120
How are you both like people that have their bodies made up with only their heart?

441
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,600
I heard you bought Minah clothes.

442
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,680
You think she knows it was me?

443
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,020
Didn't you do it because you wanted her to know it was you?

444
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,140
Her kid was really pretty.

445
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,940
Yeah, she's really pretty.

446
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,260
You saw her?

447
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,140
I saw her playing at the playground.

448
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,880
It must have been two years ago...

449
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,700
Mom.

450
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,260
I'll bring Hyuna home.

451
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,120
Do what you want. Who says I'm waiting?

452
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,430
That little brat...

453
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,940
 Hello? 

454
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,740
Yes. It's me.

455
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,600
I'm going to your house. Come out for a bit.

456
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,080
It was here.

457
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:18,570
The place where Eun Dong and I last saw each other.

458
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:26,250
This place is like the Bermuda Triangle for me.

459
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,530
Is that why you brought me here?

460
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,900
To make me give up?

461
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,960
Yes.

462
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,560
Let's stop. At this moment.

463
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:51,610
Us? Did you just say, us?

464
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:58,820
Stopping. I'm the only one who needs to stop. What is there for you to stop?

465
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,900
I'm the one who started it. I'm the one who liked you.

466
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,980
I want to be a close friend with you.

467
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,520
You're fun, refreshing,

468
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,290
chic, and always do whatever you want.

469
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:20,380
You're really charming.

470
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,910
It's still the same now.

471
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,000
You're an amazing woman.

472
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:36,130
I'm not in a hurry. I will wait,

473
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:41,080
so don't do childish things like this.

474
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,680
Hello?

475
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:12,460
It's me. Where are you right now?

476
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:48,600
 Miss Jung Eun, have you met the grandmother from the Korean Class? 

477
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,300
Ah, right! The autographs.

478
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,050
Ah...

479
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,860
 Be happy. Ji Eun Ho 

480
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:58,090
Wow! Thank you so much!

481
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,300
Well, it was a promise.

482
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,170
By the way, Miss Writer, can you take a picture with me as a keepsake?

483
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,730
It's hard to see each other now, so let's take a picture together.

484
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,350
Sure.

485
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:21,150
I'll take the picture. One, two, three.

486
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,600
You've worked hard.

487
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,240
Thank you. Goodbye.

488
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,470
Take care on your way.

489
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,150
Why are you constantly calling that writer into the office?

490
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,650
What do you mean calling?

491
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,780
Do you want to make it that known that it was ghostwritten?

492
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,160
Ah, don't worry.

493
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,510
Give it to me.

494
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,010
Open it.

495
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,830
 Delete 

496
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,880
Oh, why did you delete that?

497
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:15,290
That writer was never in our office. If there are remnants that she was here, then delete it all.

498
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,080
Listen to me.

499
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,480
Hello.

500
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,000
Oh, you came!

501
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,200
I was out of my mind so, I wasn't able to contact you. As promised, here is Ji Eun Ho's autograph.

502
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,460
Thank you!

503
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,780
Oh, I really like it!

504
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,800
I have something to show you, as well.

505
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,310
Come in.

506
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,860
Apparently, this is where the Korean classes were held.

507
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,330
Please wait for a minute.

508
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,770
Okay.

509
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,310
 My name is Ji Eun Dong. 

510
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,080
 Spring. 

511
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,700
 Summer. 

512
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,160
 Autumn. 

513
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,140
 Yes? 

514
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,720
 You and Teacher Ji Eun Dong look good together. 

515
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,620
I found it in the private house.

516
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,680
I thought it might help you, Miss Jung Eun.

517
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,930
Ah, yes.

518
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:08,340
This is a picture commemorating the Korean Writing Class and was taken when Ji Eun Ho was serving the military,

519
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,720
in 2005.

520
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,430
Ah, yes.

521
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,360
University students would come and teach writing in Korean letters, to grandmothers.

522
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,160
 Elders Korean Classroom 

523
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,580
Oh.

524
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,930
 Oppa, I'm very thankful. 

525
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:36,900
 -I won't forget.
-Watch a movie with me today.
-What exactly are your feelings for me, Oppa? 

526
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,230
 There is one thing that I know for sure. 

527
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:42,270
 - The ten years that I wasn't here...
- My love, Eun Dong... 

528
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,530
 I missed you a lot, Oppa. 

529
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,270
 I will wait. 

530
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:53,020
 Do you want to take the picture with you? 

531
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,570
 Your memories. Find them. 

532
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,380
 I am scared. 

533
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:05,950
 I feel like there is a huge whirlwind in the memories that I can't remember.  

534
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:11,590
 It seems like there is something there that I'm not supposed to know. 

535
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:13,040
 I'm scared. 

536
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,760
 Jung Eun. Seo Jung Eun. I'm sorry, Jung Eun. 

537
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:35,110
 Ji Eun Ho 

538
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:47,620
Hello?

539
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,550
 Ah, yes. This is Ji Eun Ho. 

540
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,880
You've worked hard all this time.

541
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,530
 It's nothing. 

542
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:02,510
I hope that you will find Ji Eun Dong.

543
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,420
Yes.

544
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,140
Then, take care of yourself.

545
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:19,250
Okay. Thank you.

546
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,360
 Everything will work out. 

547
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,510
 Hello. 

548
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:44,820
Oh, Reporter Park.

549
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,760
I've read the book.

550
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,540
Ah, yes.

551
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:52,180
I'm seeing you in a different light, Sunbaenim. This generation's last genuine man.

552
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,520
My wife read this and cried all night.

553
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,920
It must have been ghostwritten,

554
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,970
but the writing didn't feel like it was ghostwritten, but rather, written by her, from her heart!

555
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:07,290
 Whoever that writer is, she's very skilled. 

556
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,140
 By the way, there is a part like this. 

557
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:13,060
Because Eun Dong drinks milk due to her weak bones, Hyun Soo went to the stables

558
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,880
and got her fresh goat milk!

559
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,620
 The part where Eun Dong got diarrhea after drinking that milk. 

560
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,970
Wait. There's something like that in the book?

561
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:28,870
What are you saying? It seems that you really didn't read it.

562
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:32,040
Eun Dong was so embarrassed  that she kept a secret from Hyun Soo.

563
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,260
 That part was very weird. 

564
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,560
 It's like Eun Dong wrote it herself. 

565
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,520
That can't be.

566
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,160
 My Love, Eun Dong  

567
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:01,060
 The smell and taste must've been awful since it was raw milk,  

568
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:06,240
 but Eun Dong gratefully drank it all, as a thanks to him, and had a stomachache all night.  

569
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,040
 Out of her embarrassment, she could not speak.   

570
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,080
 Eun Dong stayed up all night going back and forth to the bathroom.   

571
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,420
 What is this?   

572
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,700
Shh.  Grandma will wake up.

573
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,600
Hurry up and drink up.

574
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:22,360
You drink this all up, by yourself.

575
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:27,280
  It's medicine to make strong bones. 

576
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,540
 Hello?   

577
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,480
You ... You know the writer's address, right?

578
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,400
Address?

579
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,960
Ask her right now, immediately.

580
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,600
 I'll ask my Noona. 

581
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,200
Hurry.

582
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,610
 Why, all of a sudden?   

583
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:52,210
Just because...

584
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,560
Even if it's just fruits, I should send her some.

585
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,620
Okay, got it.

586
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:06,910
That's right.  I never told this story before.

587
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,420
I thought she'd be embarrassed, so I never said it.

588
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,390
 Because she was embarrassed, she couldn't tell him that she was constantly going in and out of the bathroom.  

589
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:16,650
But then, how did you know this?

590
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,120
The thief said, "Moo!"

591
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,860
Moo! He sounded like a calf's moo.

592
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,720
Listen to that! It's the sound a calf makes!

593
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,760
 Ji Eun Ho    

594
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,260
Hello?

595
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,260
Hello. This is Ji Eun Ho.

596
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,760
I am, right now

597
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:38,820
in front of your apartment.

598
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,840
Please come out for just a moment.

599
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,800
Yes?

600
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,360
Just for a moment is fine.

601
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,860
Just... Just come out, please.  I'll be waiting.

602
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:11,020
 No, it's different from the sound a cow makes!    

603
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,780
 Is that so?  

604
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,540
  So, Grandpa made up the story, but the thief was dripping with sweat. 

605
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,120
 Dripping. Dripping down!  

606
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,860
 It was supposed to let out the sound that elephants make.  

607
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:38,600
 Aigoo, my fate! Looks like I'll be found out because of that one elephant!  

608
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:44,440
 The thief let out an even weirder sound while he was letting out that elephant sound in a hurry. 

609
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,600
Ko Ko! Kee Kee!

610
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,240
Ko Ko! Ko Kiri Kiri!

611
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,280
 - Ko Ko Kiri Kiri. 
- And it was crazy! 

612
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,980
 - Feet smell?
 - Wow! The elephant's feet smell! 

613
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,470
 - Don't be like that. 
- Stop it! 

614
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:09,840


615
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:16,550
 ♫ Could it be you? ♫  

616
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:26,380

638
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,100
 How much will it take? Please raise your part time compensation rates. 

639
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,620
 About 70,000₩ ($70) per hour? 

640
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,440
 If you find Eun Dong, please tell him,   

641
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,880
 that when she met Park Hyun Soo, she had another man's child in her belly.  

642
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,640
 Oh my! It seems like you have some strength in your legs now! 

643
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,780
 Please allow me to tell the doctor personally.  

644
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:12,220
 There was someone else I loved, right?   

645
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:17,300
 If Ji Eun Dong was already married? 

646
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,220
 I'll have to steal her away. 

647
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,780
 Hyung, don't avoid her. 

648
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,580
 Hey friend. Who's the one with the milk? 

649
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,680
 Is it you? 

650
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,480
 Come here! 

651
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,860
 Just a little. 

652
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,220
 Hey don't be like this and come here. 

653
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:24,270
 Come here, you! 

654
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:43,050
 Are you envious?  This is mine, you punk! 

655
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:48,530
 Eun Dong! 

656
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:49,450
 Oppa! 

657
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:51,430
 Come here for a second.  

658
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,890
 Hurry up and drink up. 

659
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:05,430
 What is this? 

660
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,450
 Grandma will wake up. 

661
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,320
 Oppa, you have some too. 

662
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:15,910
 Do you know how precious this is? You drink it all by yourself. 

663
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,610
  It's medicine to make strong bones. 

664
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:26,160
 Since it was raw milk, the smell and taste must have been awful.  

665
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,240
 Drink up... Yup, yup, all the way up. 
  "Eun Dong   

666
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,200
 drank it all up gratefully, 

667
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,910
 and I later came to realize   

668
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:38,250
 that Eun Dong, who drank the goat milk that I brought, 

669
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,890
 had a stomachache all night."  

670
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:41,490
 This is good for your bones? 

671
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:43,770
 Of course! 

672
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:47,770
 With a girl's knees like these, would you be able to get married? 

673
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:50,210
 - "I couldn't say anything because of my embarrassment. 
- Drink some more.  

674
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:54,380
 Eun Dong stayed up all night going back and forth to the bathroom."   

675
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,860
 Hurry up and drink up, a lot.
