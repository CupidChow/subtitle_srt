♫  Could it be you?   ♫

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,180
 Miss Seo Jung Eun? 

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,380
 On March 4th, 2002, you entered this school to major in Korean Language and Literature. 

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,760
 Until the first semester of 2005, you attended this school.

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,820
♫  Why does it feel so far away?   ♫

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,290
 - Hello.
- Hi! 

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,590
  See you later. 

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,680
 Bye. 

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,500
  Mom. Is it really true that Ra Il's father is my first love? 

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,120
 Where did you say you first saw me? 

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,300
  When I was a junior and you were a sophomore, I met you at an away-game in America. 

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,240
 Where in America? 

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,420
 Why are you suddenly curious about that? 

15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,060
 Do I possibly know Ji Eun Ho? 

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:11,680
 Do I know him? Park Hyun Soo. Do I possibly... 

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,000
♫  I hear you! I hear you!  ♫

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,880
 Be careful, 

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,660
 Eun Dong. 

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,580
 Do I possibly know Ji Eun Ho? 

21
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,100
 Park Hyun Soo. 

22
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,280
 I'm sorry, Jung Eun. 

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:41,380
  The most beautiful moment of my life. The most bright moment of my youth. 

24
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,070
♫  Why is love like this continuing even without you   ♫

There's nothing.

 My Love Eun Dong
Episode 8 

45
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,020
That man found out that Jung Eun is Eun Dong.

46
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,340
Ji Eun Ho found out.

47
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,480
Why do  I  have to feel and be aware of something like this? I don't like it.

48
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,060
I guess when a person has a disability, other senses become more developed.

49
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,280
That's a tragedy for people like us.

50
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,760
So what if he found out? What on earth can he do about it now?

51
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,580
There's nothing I can do to protect Eun Dong from that man.

52
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,460
He's a man who has everything.

53
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,180
There is.

54
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,750
Ra Il.

55
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,300
The fact is that you, Jung Eun, and Ra Il are a family together,

56
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,380
nobody can break that.

57
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,480
A long time has already passed.

58
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,620
He can't interfere in the relationship between you and her.

59
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,600
Wasn't I the one who interfered in their relationship?

60
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,200
Hello!

61
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,820
- I'll be back after changing my clothes.
- Jung Eun.

62
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,720
Yes.

63
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,000
You're going through a lot of hard times, aren't you?

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,160
What do you mean, hard times?

65
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,580
I'm talking about that part-time job.

66
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,820
Yes...

67
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,520
- I think that you should just work until today and then quit.
- Pardon?

68
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,720
My nephew has graduated college and he just keeps laying around.

69
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,800
Yes...

70
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,620
I deposited your pay for the part-time job for the work you did up until today.

71
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,720
Yes, thank you.

72
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,160
 Please take your bank book. 

73
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,200
  Please click the number.   

74
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,660
 ₩48 million ($48 thousand). 

75
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,320
Hello, I'm Seo Jung Eun.

76
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,740
Yes, Writer?

77
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,820
So you know why I called then.

78
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,860
Yes, I know.

79
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,360
What is this money?

80
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,840
  Since we sold over a million copies of the book, and because you worked so hard, 

81
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,980
  Eun Ho told me to give it to you. 

82
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,580
I'll accept it, thanks. I'll spend it well.

83
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,560
Tell Ji Eun Ho that I'm thankful, too.

84
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,520
 Contacts 

85
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,540
 Ji Eun Ho 

86
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,500
 A Dog of Flanders 

87
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,220
 Thank you, God. 

88
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,760
  Nello kneeled in front of the picture, 

89
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,400
 and he hugged Patrasche. 

90
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:55,100
  When Aloise's tears fell on Nello's hands, Nello's body became warm. 

91
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:02,360
  As Nello's temperature rose, Patrasche's temperature rose as well. 

92
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,760
  Nello and Patrasche came back to life. 

93
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,880
  That's how it should be.  

94
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,560
 I've never cried watching a sad movie. 

95
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,440
 I've never cried because someone died, either. 

96
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,820
 I thought that I was just that kind of guy. 

97
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:27,320
 But strangely, I cried that day. 

98
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,080
 How would I find you? 

99
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,040
 If, for some reason, I have to find you someday, how would I go about doing that? 

100
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,810
 Him &amp; Me 

101
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,900
Hey!

102
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,860
When do you dislike your husband the most?

103
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,220
When you can't even stand the sight of him?

104
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,440
Why would that—

105
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,030
Hey!

106
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,670
After you see me, then you go home to Suk Hoon, doesn't he look like a squid?

107
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:44,150
You are an actor! An actor comparing himself to a regular person is not fair.

108
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,170
Unfair my butt.

109
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,710
Oppa!

110
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,500
I love Suk Hoon!

111
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,340
Right! Did anyone tell you not to love each other?

112
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,380
Hey! I am the one who led your wedding!

113
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,620
So, why would you be doing this?

114
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,600
Doing what?

115
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,840
I just want to do my job.

116
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,820
Hey!

117
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,440
Hey!

118
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,840
Just hear me out!

119
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,560
If the woman I love is married to another man,

120
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
then I should give up on her, right?

121
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,240
Right! Obviously!

122
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,900
How is that obvious?

123
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,140
Oppa, that is illegal.

124
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,180
Illegal my butt!

125
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,800
Oppa that is also infidelity.

126
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,880
Infidelity my butt!

127
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,060
If a person does everything he wants to do, then is he a human? He is an animal!

128
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,440
Don't get so excited!

129
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,620
Is Suk Hoon having an affair?

130
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,480
No!

131
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,100
Be good to Suk Hoon.

132
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,670
  I'd like to have a meal with you. 

133
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,790
Hey!

134
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:09,100
What does it mean when woman asks a guy to have a meal with her?

135
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,720
You do that when you are hungry.

136
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,880
 I say that often when I don't want to eat alone. 

137
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,760
Right!

138
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,660
Be good to Suk Hoon, okay?

139
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,800
Where is my manager?

140
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,260
Hey, Dong Gyo!

141
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,900
Yeah?

142
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:31,040
So, you are saying that you fired the writ— no, the part timer?

143
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,280
Paying that much to an inexperienced employee...

144
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,360
You are too much!

145
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,340
No, let me do that part time work.

146
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,780
No, I want to do it myself, me!

147
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,240
Then let's do it together, huh?

148
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,020
If Eun Ho knows about this, you and I will be dead.

149
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,660
So, hurry up and call her and apologize a hundred times to her

150
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,400
and ask her to come back.

151
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,680
Hurry!

152
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,820
You have a visitor.

153
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,620
- A visitor? 
 - Yes.

154
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,190
I registered for a special office visit.

155
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,730
You don't seem to be ill for a special visit.

156
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,080
Cho Se Ryeong!

157
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,660
I had no other way to get your time.

158
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,660
Fine, buy my time!

159
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,060
What brought you here?

160
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,660
I've been having problems sleeping lately,

161
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,300
worrying that Oppa might playing with a dangerous fire.

162
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,760
My brother used play with fires and extinguish them on his own, from young age.

163
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,320
He's been living like that.

164
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,240
About Eun Dong.

165
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,760
Oppa found her.

166
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,120
I heard men instinctively look back fondly on their first love.

167
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,880
They say when times are tough, a man thinks about either his deceased mother or his first love.

168
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,500
She is a very special person to my brother.

169
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,160
For that woman,

170
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,170
he even purchased the retail store she works at, in order to help her.

171
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,270
He keeps interfering in her life.

172
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:21,530
- Cho Se Ryeong! 
 -The problem is, she has a husband and a child.

173
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,590
I already know about it.

174
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,820
Eun Ho knows about it, too?

175
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,220
Yes, he does.

176
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,480
 Of course he knows. Even you know about it. 

177
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,620
I guess it was just a matter of time.

178
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,100
This is between her and my brother. It's not something I should interfere with.

179
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:50,740
Her husband is a former baseball player who is handicapped with a spinal injury.

180
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,980
The wife is suffering amnesia from a car accident.

181
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,880
- No way! 
- That's right!

182
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,360
The  no way  that you're thinking of, Doctor, is

183
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,420
the wife of Choi Jae Ho, Seo Jung Eun also known as Ji Eun Dong.

184
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,300
- That's impossible! 
 - Please help.

185
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,760
We must stop Oppa before he starts to play with fire.

186
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,020
He can't extinguish it on his own now.

187
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,120
You came!

188
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,020
I am thinking about making chicken risotto for dinner.

189
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,480
I have a prior engagement.

190
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,900
I'm eating out for dinner tonight.

191
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,960
I made dinner preparations because you said you'd be home tonight!

192
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,340
Lately, because of the drama I'm filming, I don't get to eat much.

193
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:40,340
I know. That's why I made risotto made with chicken breast meat.

194
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,980
Why? I am not eat—

195
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,460
Anyway, you enjoy it alone.

196
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,560
I'll invite people to eat with you.

197
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,390
 Jung Eun! 

198
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,160
 You came! 

199
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,460
Make me totally sexy!

200
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,700
Getting bold!

201
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:30,800
I have money, so please treat me properly as your customer today.

202
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,060
I will properly pay you and properly receive your service.

203
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,840
And do it tomorrow, too. I will receive your service tomorrow as well.

204
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,740
What is wrong?

205
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,130
What you mean? I told you I got some money.

206
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,700
What money!

207
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,620
Money I can spend.

208
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,740
It seems that you want to be provocative today.

209
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,020
So, let's do everything you want to do.

210
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,300
Make me pretty.

211
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,880
Who are you wanting to impress?

212
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,780
Ji Eun Ho.

213
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,540
He's got style.

214
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,880
Why?

215
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,560
Can't I look at Ji Eun Ho and think he's stylish and good-looking?

216
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,280
No, I'm not saying that!

217
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,540
I am a woman, too!

218
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,960
Looking at that handsome man...

219
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,540
 How am I supposed to not have any feelings? 

220
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,760
What is wrong?

221
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,360
 Don't ask me anything. 

222
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,140
 Just make me pretty. 

223
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:47,250
 Make my hair look like that person's hair 

224
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,470
 in the picture. 

225
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,230
Move this!

226
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,390
 I asked you not to ask me anything. 

227
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,720
Jung Eun, what is going on?

228
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,920
I came because Hyun Soo wanted to have dinner together.

229
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,440
- Me too.
 -Please!

230
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,600
I am joining you because my employer told me to have a meal with you two.

231
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,220
I think of this as a part of my duty.

232
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,460
Uhm! Wow!

233
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,580
Director try some!

234
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,320
Hyun Soo doesn't like this sort of thing.

235
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,360
His taste buds are cheap, so he likes sweet or salty things.

236
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,500
His nickname in high school was Taru, because he liked sweets so much.

237
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,460
He's right! He really doesn't like greasy things.

238
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,520
He is such a picky eater.

239
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,040
Taste buds change.

240
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,000
But by the way, are you married?

241
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,100
Yes, I've been and back.

242
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,560
 Did your husband run around on you? 

243
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,500
 You couldn't be a battered woman. 

244
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,560
You're a such good cook, so why?

245
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,720
Did you say you are a director?

246
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,260
 You are very hateful. 

247
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,670
Hello.

248
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,030
Please have a seat.

249
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,780
Have you been well?

250
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,230
Yes.

251
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,770
I've been watching your drama well.

252
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,840
Yes.

253
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,480
I recently got my hands on some money.

254
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,770
So, I wanted to treat you.

255
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,490
Really? Then I accept.

256
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:12,210


257
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,880
Please give me Sole Mornay.

258
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,760
Please give me the same thing.

259
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,740
- Any wine? 
- No thanks.

260
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,670
Please give us wine.

261
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,360
It's fine. I'll drive you back home.

262
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,340
I don't want to call a driver.

263
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:49,250
I had an interview with a publisher today so...

264
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,630
Don't you work at the store?

265
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,480
Yes, but I was fired today.

266
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,900
What?

267
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,440
I just wanted to start doing some editing work for a publisher.

268
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,760
It's been decided that I'll start working next week.

269
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,080
Wasn't being a writer your dream?

270
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,410
How do you know?

271
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,370
When we met last time, don't you remember what I said?

272
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,810
I said I can see everything in your heart.

273
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,830
That's right. You did say that.

274
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,950
Dong Gyu told me

275
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,820
that you wrote that when you were in the States.

276
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,880
Yes. Alright.

277
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,380
Is there something wrong?

278
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,800
No, just...

279
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,510
It's like my heart keeps getting found out.

280
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,800
Did you get scared again?

281
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,600
You must be having a lot of thoughts that shouldn't be discovered.

282
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,200
Right?

283
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,190
Yes. That's right.

284
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:22,810
Alright, even if I can see them, I won't look.

285
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,740
Really?

286
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,330
Of course.

287
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:32,610
But... I really am curious as to what you're thinking about.

288
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,070
Filming must be difficult, right?

289
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,410
 Don't forget to eat your meals. 

290
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:49,830
You must! Even if you don't diet,

291
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,790
you're handsome.

292
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:02,260
So... Please make sure to eat properly.

293
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,750
Yes.

294
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,800
Would doing proofreading work at a publishing company

295
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,130
really help you with writing?

296
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,800
Don't do it.

297
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,060
I will help you.

298
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,820
We... are fated.

299
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,260
Eun Dong's dream was to be a writer, as well.

300
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,290
She came up with this bold ending for the book,

301
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:47,760
"A Dog of Flanders." I was very amazed.

302
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,290
I see...

303
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,180
When I watch your drama,

304
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,200
I think about this a lot,

305
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,320
about how I wanted to write a story like that.

306
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,680
Then try.

307
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,500
What should I write?

308
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,820
About your first love.

309
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,980
I have no memories regarding my first love.

310
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,640
My head is empty,

311
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,160
so I can't.

312
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,710
Then...

313
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,560
Think of me as your first love.

314
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,430
Can I do that?

315
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,330
Why?

316
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,750
Jung Eun,

317
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,440
don't avoid my gaze and tell me.

318
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,650
I— have to go to the bathroom...

319
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,500
Does your husband know that

320
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,930
you're meeting me?

321
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,790
He doesn't.

322
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:03,050
I would like him to continue  not  knowing.

323
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,390
Why?

324
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:12,200
Because if he knows, it might turn into a bad relationship.

325
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,630
Didn't you say we should just meet up once in a while?

326
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,580
That's why I came out tonight.

327
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,060
Is that all?

328
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,840
Really?

329
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,230
Let's do that. Whether it be once or twice,

330
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,040
because the fact remains that we do have to see each other

331
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,260
Right?

332
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,900
I'm going to tell my husband that I'm meeting you.

333
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:23,850


334
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,910
Can I ask you why you can't forget that girl?

335
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,920
I slept with that girl.

336
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,220
I can't forget that.

337
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,880
I'm sorry. I asked something unnecessary.

338
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,630
I told you through the recording as well.

339
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:46,070
That day, Eun Dong did not go home.

340
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,850
And then one week later, she said she was going on a graduation trip,

341
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:54,230
we went on a trip for two nights and three days. Do you remember?

342
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:59,370
Why? You knew things that I didn't even tell you,

343
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,350
but this confuses you?

344
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,490
When we went traveling that day,

345
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,930
- that night, we— 
- Stop it!

346
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,770
Listen til the very end!

347
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,800
That day, we loved each other to death.

348
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,240
The next day, too!

349
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,860
And then four days later...

350
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:31,800
She disappeared without a trace—four days later.

351
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,670
Do you know how much I was going crazy?

352
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,770
Find Eun Dong for me. Please.

353
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,150
If you wait...

354
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,000
I told you she will appear if you wait.

355
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,380
So what? She's living with another man!

356
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,840
She had another man's child!

357
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,600
She can't even remember me.

358
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,730
Wait...

359
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,680
Can't you stay here a little bit longer?

360
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,930
Yes.

361
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,410
Which day are you off from filming?

362
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,170
There's somewhere we need to go together.

363
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,800
Okay, I'll text you.

364
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,380
Please be careful on your way back.

365
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,870
Tonight...

366
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,730
Don't sleep with your husband.

367
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,240
You came?

368
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,460
Where were you?

369
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,280
I met Ji Eun Ho.

370
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,760
I told you not to meet him.

371
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,360
I want to ask you why.

372
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,280
Why did you tell me that?

373
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,830
Do you actually think he'd be interested in some boring ahjumma like me, who has both a husband and a child?

374
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,460
I'm curious about the reason why you told me not to see him.

375
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,980
Jung Eun.

376
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,440
The two of us have Ra Il.

377
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,220
Think about Ra Il.

378
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,320
I hope that you don't forget that, no matter what you do.

379
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,990
Why did you do that?

380
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,540
You knew who Ji Eun Dong was, right?

381
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,850
Why did you pretend not to know?

382
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,870
Why did you do that?

383
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:40,910
I wanted to protect you and Ra Il. I only think about that.

384
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,660
Nobody will tell me the truth.

385
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,540
For me, for someone who lost her memory,

386
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:57,220
I wish someone would feel sorry for me and tell me the truth out of pity.

387
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,140
There isn't anyone who can tell you.

388
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,040
- Why?
- Because it's a story that's already over!

389
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,010
You made me like this.

390
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,150
That's the only thing I can tell you.

391
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,010
Did I

392
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,590
love Ji Eun Ho?

393
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,770
Tell me what you already know.

394
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:31,460
While you were so passionately in love with me,

395
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,160
was I secretly in love with Ji Eun Ho?

396
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Is this book fake

397
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,600
- or are you—
- Stop!

398
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,940
Ra Il's father...

399
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,760
Which one do you wish was fake?

400
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,820
I'm going to wash up.

401
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,240
  Sleep well. 

402
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,380
  I will as well. 

403
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,920
  Sleep well. I will as well. 

404
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,980
  The message will be deleted. 

405
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,680
  You know that we are having auditions for new actors starting from next week, right? 

406
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,940
Is the preparation going along well?

407
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,320
How many people applied?

408
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,120
About 130 people.

409
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,040
- Hello!
- Dong Gyu, come upstairs.

410
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,520
Yes!

411
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:25,890
The writer willingly accepted the money.

412
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,620
Very willingly. She didn't say, "Who do you think I am?

413
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,780
Do you think I'm a beggar?"  or

414
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,280
"Do you think I'm a woman who has no self-esteem?"

415
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,520
I thought she would say that.

416
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,640
Hey.

417
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,920
Would you stop reading third-rate scripts?

418
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,600
Are you acting in front of me?

419
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,100
The fact that she accepts money from a man

420
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,000
shows that she's very open.

421
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,740
If I think about it in my perspective, if Jun Ji Hyun gave me money,

422
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,100
I would accept it right away.

423
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,160
Why would Jun Ji Hyun give you money? Is she helping the poor?

424
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:02,120
But if an ugly woman, that I don't like gives me money—

425
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,560
You should just accept it.

426
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,900
Just accept it. You just have to accept it.

427
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,040
If you are done talking, leave.

428
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,500
Oh, hey!

429
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,720
You know that ahjumma from the store... How can she have no humanity?

430
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,420
I heard she fired her.

431
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,160
How can she just fire a powerless part-time worker?

432
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,300
She doesn't have any consideration for the weak.

433
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,260
That's right.

434
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,820
How can she just...

435
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,880
Fire her!

436
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,640
Manager.

437
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,800
He's too much.

438
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,700
How are you so different from me?

439
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,990
Fine. Let's say we are different. It's just a face.

440
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,070
Fine, it's just a body.

441
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:12,650
Fine, just the age. This dirty world!

442
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,740
Why are you like that?

443
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,800
Seriously.

444
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,450
I hope the store goes bankrupt.

445
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,700
Where are you going?

446
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,840
  Message 

447
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,620
  What are you doing right now? 

448
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,920
  Why did you ignore my text yesterday? 

449
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:01,590
  What text? I didn't get anything.  

450
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,160
  I have the evidence that shows that I sent you a text. 

451
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,740
  From now on, if you ignore my text,  I'm going to call you right away. 

452
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,440
  Ji Eun Ho. 

453
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,640
Hello?

454
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,680
I told you that I will call you if you ignore my text.

455
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,950
I got it. I won't.

456
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,870
Did you eat lunch yet?

457
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:33,350
No, not yet.

458
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,470
  Oh, yes. 

459
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,570
I'm filming right now.

460
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,510
What are you going to eat?

461
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm going to eat buckwheat noodles.

462
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,800
Then we can eat together.

463
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,720
 Let's eat together. 

464
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,220
 We're eating today's lunch together. 

465
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,700
 Have a nice meal. 

466
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,500
Do you upload what you eat on SNS these days?

467
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,060
Superman!

468
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:35,360
Doctor, from my neck down, something is moving.

469
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,720
I think muscles are forming on my body.

470
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,520
I have this feeling where a new body is being formed.

471
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,900
We should start on the electric bicycle.

472
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,680
Choi Ho, let's recover quickly.

473
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,420
You have to protect Jung Eun.

474
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,910
Hello.

475
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,580
 President. 

476
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,700
You're DM Entertainment's president, Lee Hyun Bal, right?

477
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,640
Yes, I am. And?

478
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,400
Hello. My name is Oh Nan Shil.

479
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,220
President, I would like to audition.

480
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:31,300
Please watch me and see if I have potential or not.

481
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,740
What are you good at?

482
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,740
I can make it seem like I'm speaking in French.

483
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,950
Okay, try it.

484
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:52,200
Our international airport is very dangerous.

485
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,200
Because of the recent outbreak of MERS,

486
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,260
you must wear your masks.

487
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,220
What did you just say?

488
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,600
You know how it's crazy right now because of MERS,

489
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,120
so I said that you have to wear a mask in a public place like the airport.

490
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,420
Do it again.

491
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,200
Mr. Hyun Bal, you are  shibal-nom  (curse in Korean).

492
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,540
W-what?

493
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:20,540
I said that you were a very admirable looking man...

494
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:25,920
I can draw well and I can sing, too.

495
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,320
I heard Ra Il is attending a taekwondo academy these days.

496
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,480
Because he's just like his father, he's going to be outstanding in his athleticism.

497
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,400
Does he adapt well in school?

498
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,400
Mom.

499
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,100
Huh?

500
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,820
Thanks for raising me.

501
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:03,740
I was weak when I was young, and I fell easily. You raised me healthily like this.

502
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,350
Even though you didn't give birth to me,

503
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:12,790
I'll believe that I came out of your womb.

504
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:21,430
How much do you know?

505
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,100
Apparently, I'm Ji Eun Dong.

506
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,020
It's funny, right?

507
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:42,300
The girl Ji Eun Ho is frantically searching for is me.

508
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:46,130
Mom.

509
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:49,910
Can't you help me?

510
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:53,710
If you don't,

511
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,560
there is no one else who can help me.

512
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,400
Jung Eun. I can't.

513
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,920
Let's just live like this.

514
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,100
Whether you're Ji Eun Dong or Seo Jung Eun, nothing will change.

515
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,160
 You're Ra Il's mother and 

516
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,700
 Son-in-law Choi's wife. 

517
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,840
 Let's bury everything. 

518
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,660
I don't want to.

519
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,540
Jung Eun.

520
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,280
I want to start from that point,

521
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,600
the day before the accident,

522
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,140
the day Park Hyun Soo was waiting for me.

523
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,220
No, you can't, Jung Eun.

524
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,880
Mom.

525
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,380
When I see that person,

526
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,380
my heart trembles.

527
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,590
Should I be more honest?

528
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,590
I like that man.

529
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:55,990
Hey. Dong Gyu.

530
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:58,220
Hey.

531
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,200
How's the schedule looking?

532
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,640
I said you had to film this and go out later.

533
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,820
Not me.

534
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,380
Then who—

535
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,400
Hyung. Am I that writer's manager?

536
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,620
Did you or did you not say you were going to treat me well?

537
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,800
Writer Seo should be working at the store right now.

538
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,750
Okay. Good.

539
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,830
Where are you going, Hyung?

540
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,400
Come back by nine!

541
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,080
Welcome!

542
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,500
There are a lot of pretty clothes.

543
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,680
Did you eat?

544
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:54,220
No, not yet.

545
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,720
Let's eat together.

546
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,780
I'm working until late at night today.

547
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,540
Let's go together.

548
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,180
It's because you're saying such things.

549
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,580
I can't.

550
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,580
Let's go together.

551
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,480
Wait inside here.

552
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,540
 Welcome! 

553
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:35,830
 Do you have this in another color? 

554
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,870
 I don't think this is it. 

555
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,500
This isn't my style.

556
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,780
We'll come again some other time.

557
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,200
Ahh yes. Have a nice day!

558
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,140
They left. Come out.

559
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,120
Come out. They left.

560
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,300
Come outside instead of being in here.

561
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,300
Are you afraid of me?

562
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,310
You aren't, right?

563
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:39,830
No.

564
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,230
Do you know why?

565
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,230
Eun Dong was like that.

566
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:54,700
She said that she isn't afraid of anything in this world, when she is with me.

567
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:04,320
That's why you don't have a reason to be afraid of me.

568
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:11,330
I'm not afraid of you.

569
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,910
I'm afraid

570
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,010
of myself.

571
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:28,940
You know who you are, right?

572
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,600
Let's go outside.

573
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,690
You know who you are, right?

574
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:44,730
You know

575
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,600
who this woman is to me, right?

576
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,740
- Let's go out.
- Eun Dong.

577
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,360
  Is anybody in here? 

578
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:09,150
Stay here instead of coming out.

579
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:16,580
  Welcome. 

580
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:32,290
You can't do it like that. Don't. I will do it.

581
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:41,290
I'm going to Jeju Island tomorrow, to film.

582
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:42,570
I see.

583
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,730
Is that all you have to say?

584
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,680
Then what else can I say?

585
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:56,010
I mean... There are many things to ask me, like

586
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:58,300
"How long are you going to be there?" or "What are you going to film?"

587
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:03,540
I'm not curious about that.

588
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,000
Then what are you curious about?

589
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:14,980
After  being separated with Ji Eun Dong like that,

590
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,560
have you ever

591
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,210
dated a woman?

592
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:28,450
Excuse me. Can we talk while sitting down?

593
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,800
We can talk here. I have to finish this.

594
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,820
It's hard to concentrate. Let's talk while sitting down.

595
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,180
It's not for me.

596
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:48,670
I never dated a woman before.

597
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:50,380
I swear.

598
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:54,110
Why did you do that?

599
00:54:56,230 --> 00:55:00,930
It felt like Eun Dong would do the same, if I did.

600
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:06,740
 I didn't want Eun Dong to see an another man. 

601
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:11,650
For that to happen, somebody else shouldn't be next to me.

602
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:14,210
It was only fair that it start with myself.

603
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:25,350
Before hearing everything from Eun Dong's mouth, I am not going to decide on anything.

604
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,550
Why haven't you ever thought that

605
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,760
she might meet another man?

606
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:47,440
Are you really saying that in front of me?

607
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,190
Hey!

608
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,800
You... You are the same as before.

609
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,900
Were you born to hammer a huge nail in my heart?

610
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,330
How can you say that to me?

611
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:11,050
Hey, are you seriously telling me those words?

612
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,790
Don't talk informally to me.

613
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,250
Once a fool, always a fool.

614
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,310
It's too late. You should leave.

615
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:45,470
You told me to leave some time open because there is somewhere we have to go.

616
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:48,400
It's too late. We can go later.

617
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,240
No. I'm still working.

618
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,900
The president of this store is my friend.

619
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,390
What?

620
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:00,710
  Closed 

621
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:15,690
Isn't this the place that you wanted to come to?

622
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,350
Shall we get out?

623
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:11,280
♫  As if we met yesterday  ♫

624
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:18,480
♫  Not really needing to ask how you've been  ♫

625
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:24,430
♫  Perhaps I was needlessly worried  ♫

626
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:31,950
♫   Feeling awkward maybe I made it more awkward between us  ♫

627
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:40,320
♫  Telling me that you were a mess, because after my phone call you couldn't sleep all night  ♫

628
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:46,690
Like this, let's just try to walk over there. 
♫  Telling me that you were a mess, because after my phone call you couldn't sleep all night  ♫

629
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,690
Who knows, your memories might return.

630
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:58,320
And mind you, this hand was mine just ten years ago.

631
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,140
♫  Saying that we were too young back then  ♫

632
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:06,120
Let's go. 
♫  Saying that we were too young back then  ♫

633
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:12,370
 ♫ As we were laughing over past memories ♫  

634
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:21,630
♫  Upon hearing that you're still alone  ♫

635
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:28,370
♫  My heart secretly begins to ache  ♫

636
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:29,150
♫  Should I say I love you again?  ♫

637
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:33,090
 You can go a little faster. 
 ♫  Should I say I love you again?  ♫

638
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:35,730
♫  Should I say I love you again?  ♫

639
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:42,360
 Oppa, you can up the speed a little more. 
♫  That I took a long path but I've been waiting  ♫

640
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,770
♫  That waiting for you was the easiest thing for me  ♫

641
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:50,860
♫  That waiting for you was the easiest thing for me  ♫

642
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:55,950
♫  And I didn't even feel the passage of time  ♫

643
00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:02,560
 ♫ Should I say I love her again? ♫ 

644
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:09,770
♫  That would you accept me even though
 I'm still far from perfect  ♫

645
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:16,590
 ♫ That loving you was my entire life ♫ 

646
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:24,290
 ♫ It couldn't be helped ♫ 

647
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:32,290


648
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:42,180
♫  You said that you didn't realize it was love back then  ♫

649
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:46,050
 ♫ And upon hearing that when you heard news about me ♫ 

650
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,240
 How did you know that you were Eun Dong? 

651
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:52,710
 Heart. My heart races when I see you. 

652
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:54,960
 Jung Eun is with another man, 

653
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,040
 but I can't bring myself to hate Jung Eun. 

654
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,540
 Do you want to secretly meet a woman like me who has a husband and a child like this? 

655
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:02,740
 I want to see you. 

656
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:05,870
 I'll going somewhere for a bit. I'll be back. 

657
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:09,730
 You have to be in pain like I am! You have to have a hard time like I've had! 

658
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:14,790
 Even if it's hell, I want to live with her like that. 

659
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:20,710
 ♫ It was fate. Forgetting you...♫
