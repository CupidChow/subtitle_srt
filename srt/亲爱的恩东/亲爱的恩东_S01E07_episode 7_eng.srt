1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:07,230


2
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,830
 The elevator is going down. 

3
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,530
Ji Eun Ho? Ji Eun Ho?

4
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,360
 I think that was Ji Eun Ho. 

5
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,390
I'll be getting off now.

6
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,870
Just stay here.

00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,160
 My Love Eun Dong
 Episode 7

00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,970
 Should I Say I Love Her Again - Kim Dong Ryul 

9
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:37,170
 ♫ As if we'd just met yesterday ♫  

10
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,720
 ♫ To the point of putting my "how are you" to shame ♫  

11
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,260
 ♫ I wonder if my worries were unnecessary ♫ 

12
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,870
 ♫ I wonder if it was awkward because I'm awkward ♫ 

13
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:06,000
 ♫ You said that you couldn't sleep at all last night when you received my call ♫ 

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,540
 I want to make that girl smile a lot. 
 ♫  You said that you couldn't sleep at all last night when you received my call ♫  

15
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,300
 I'm planning to do that from now on. 
♫   While smiling shyly, how can you be the same as before?  ♫ 

16
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,830
 When I was writing your book, 
♫   While smiling shyly, how can you be the same as before?  ♫

17
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,900
 I was happy. 
♫   While smiling shyly, how can you be the same as before?  ♫ 

18
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,880
 It was like... 
♫   While smiling shyly, how can you be the same as before?  ♫ 

19
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,380
 ♫ You said we were too young then ♫ 

20
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,290
 I just heard about the sales from your manager, too. 

21
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,340
 I'm very thankful for just telling me. 

22
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,960
 Oh, yes. I wish you'd accept it. 

23
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,850
 I can't. I don't think that's right. 

24
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:54,290
 I just ghostwrote the story. Why should I receive royalties? 

25
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,980
It's not like that was my own story either.

26
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,560
 That was your story. 

27
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,980
 Yours and Ji Eun Dong's. 

28
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,480
 - That's why you should receive them. 
- Excuse me? 

29
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:21,770
 ♫ It was the easiest the thing for me to do, I didn't even know time was passing by ♫  

30
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:28,550
 ♫ Should I say I love her again? ♫  

31
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:35,650
  ♫ I still lack many things but will you accept me? ♫  

32
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:42,590
 ♫ Loving you, was my entire life ♫ 

33
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:52,210
 ♫ It couldn't be helped ♫ 

34
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,810
Dad, why isn't mom coming back?

35
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,070
Oh, she'll probably come back home soon.

36
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,940
Dad, are you okay?

37
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,560
Should I help you lie down?

38
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,700
No, I can do it alone.

39
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,380
Go inside and sleep.

40
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,070
Okay...

41
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,400
Ra Il, come here for a second.

42
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,530
Will you please get my phone for me?

43
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,930
Okay, I will.

44
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,370
Press the number four firmly.

45
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,520
 Doctor Park Hyun Ah 

46
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,520
-  Hello? 
-  Excuse me,

47
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,270
but my dad is in pain.

48
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,060
Please go back home safely.

49
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:30,270
How about we—see each other often?

50
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:39,220
Let's just—see each other often.

51
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,510
I would like that.

52
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,310
Writer Seo.

53
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,060
Yes?

54
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,030
How am I?

55
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,770
What?

56
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,570
Did you just become scared right now?

57
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,370
Yes.

58
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,330
Please don't tease me.

59
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,730
Who said I was teasing you?

60
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,130
It's fine if you didn't!

61
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,540
Please go already. What if someone sees you?

62
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,190
I'll call you when I want to see you.

63
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,870
I have to see you.

64
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,950
That way, I think everything will become clear.

65
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,170
What will?

66
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,950
- What will become clear? 
- Look.

67
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,610
You don't even understand what I'm talking about.

68
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:31,200
 ♫ Could it really be you? ♫ 

69
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:39,330
 ♫ My approaching heart is beating so quickly like this ♫  

70
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:47,460
 ♫ It's just a simple walk  but why do I feel such a weight on my shoulders? ♫  

71
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:54,340
 ♫ It must have followed breathlessly ♫  

72
00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:02,350
 ♫ I can finally walk after such a long time ♫  

73
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:13,630
 ♫ I want to tell you that I was always looking at you ♫ 

74
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,290
 ♫ I see you, I see you ♫ 

75
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,920
  I want to make that girl smile a lot. 
♫ Like this, in front of me ♫ 

76
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,140
 - Hold on tight! 
- Okay! 
♫ Like this, in front of me ♫

77
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,420
 You can't let go of me! 
♫ Like this, in front of me ♫

78
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,150
 - I got it! 
- How about we see each other often? 

79
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,740
 My love Eun Dong, I'll wait for you. 

80
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,830
 - I'm sorry, Jung Eun. 
- I also missed you a lot too... 

81
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:40,040
  Who do you love right now? 

82
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:46,050
 ♫ I hear your voice and breathe ♫ 

83
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,440
This is so hard, honestly.

84
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,470
It's not a shock on the spine, is it?

85
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,500
Since you already administered the drug, we'll just watch what happens for now

86
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,460
and do the CT in the morning.

87
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,090
Oh, okay. I'm on my way right now.

88
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,060
Mom, did another one of your patients collapse again?

89
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,200
Yeah.

90
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,830
Mom, every time a patient collapses,

91
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,000
do you have to always go whether it is morning or night?

92
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,470
No, it's not always like that.

93
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,080
There are other doctors on duty.

94
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,590
- Then why? 
- It's because this patient is

95
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:49,140
someone I'm especially concerned about.

96
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,020
- Why?
- I wonder why?

97
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,040
I think I know why.

98
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,700
Just wanting to treat him well without a reason... It's that, isn't it?

99
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,300
Aigoo, my daughter. So smart!

100
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,680
My daughter is a genius!

101
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,560
Choi Ho!

102
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,280
You should have taken it easy.

103
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,540
You overexerted yourself.

104
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,920
Don't worry, Superman.

105
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,340
Don't cry, Oppa.

106
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,840
My mom is here, so your dad is okay.

107
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,580
- You sure? 
- Yeah.

108
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,480
Believe me.

109
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,240
Mi Na!

110
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,240
Let's go.

111
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,020
You're Ra Il, huh?

112
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,580
Hello.

113
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,140
My dad... Is he okay now?

114
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,680
Of course! Your dad is Superman.

115
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,560
He won't ever fall.

116
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,520
Yes.

117
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,220
My dad is Superman.

118
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,460
Even though he can't walk, to me, he's Superman.

119
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,920
Doctor, I feel so sorry.

120
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,700
You can't even rest this late at night.

121
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,640
No, it's fine.

122
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,340
Please go in and rest.

123
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,100
How can I sleep when my son is lying in there?

124
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,680
But... Where is Jung Eun?

125
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,320
I can't even get in touch with her.

126
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,640
She's just flying around somewhere out there.

127
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,860
Then, I will take Ra Il home and put him to bed.

128
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,080
Tomorrow is Saturday anyway, so he doesn't need to go to school.

129
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,160
I will take him.

130
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,740
Ra Il's father!

131
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,340
Where have you been that you're coming now?

132
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,060
Mom...

133
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,620
You're a fool.

134
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,140
Are you okay?

135
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,480
I'm okay. I didn't want you to worry.

136
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,820
I'm sorry.

137
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,080
I'm really sorry.

138
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:07,020
Honey. Don't say you're sorry ever again.

139
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,180
No, doctor. I can't inconvenience you like that.

140
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,100
I will go get him right now.

141
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,400
You really don't need to.

142
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,280
I will put Ra Il to bed here tonight.

143
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,600
His eyes look so drowsy right now.

144
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,720
Yeah, he must have been shocked today.

145
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,740
Don't worry and just go in.

146
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,040
Yes.

147
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,300
There's nothing like monthly rent here.

148
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,860
The headquarters take all the revenue from the outlet, except 19%.

149
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,340
 That 19% of the total revenue comes to me. 

150
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,680
So that's the profit.

151
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,980
If we earn  ₩10,000,000 ($10,000), ₩1,900,000 ($1900)  is mine.

152
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,460
There's no rent.

153
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,840
Oh, maintenance fee! That's included.

154
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,140
Can you tell me how much you want?

155
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,740
I'm not sure...

156
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,060
Where did you come from?

157
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,220
Hyung, you seriously can't do this!

158
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,060
How much is it?

159
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,720
How much will it be?

160
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,580
 My real name is Park Hyun Soo. 

161
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,760
I see.

162
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,240
But, why do you want to do this?

163
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,960
I'm planning for my retirement.

164
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,720
I mean, my job is like that. You never know when you're going to get cut

165
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,420
and how long will my popularity last?

166
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,360
Is that why you want to open an outlet that sells children's clothes?

167
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,140
Yes.

168
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,540
Young children are our nation's future.

169
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,360
I mean...

170
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,760
Please don't tell the part-time workers that the owner changed.

171
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,140
Just tell them that you're still in charge

172
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,260
and... Please raise the part-time wages.

173
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,440
You said you give ₩7,000 per hour, right?

174
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,080
Yes.

175
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,440
Then how about... ₩70,000?

176
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,240
Please do it that way. I will pay the money.

177
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,120
But if you do that, the part-time workers will get more than the full-time workers.

178
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,520
- It's okay.
- I thought you are planning for your retirement.

179
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,620
Yes. I am.

180
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,500
Then could I work part-time?

181
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,860
 Excuse me. Please talk to me. 

182
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,120
The contract negotiations are complete, with this.

183
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,980
Please keep it a secret that Ji Eun Ho is the owner of this store.

184
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,600
And, since we're trying to do a good deed,

185
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,300
it would be difficult if people gathered.

186
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,000
What are you saying? Business has to go well.

187
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,300
Well then.

188
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,820
Excuse me, could I please get your autograph?

189
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,080
What do you mean, an autograph?

190
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,640
No, I mean, an autograph—

191
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,860
Excuse me! Autograph!

192
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,880
  We'll do it later. 

193
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,480
Hey, tell her not to say anything!

194
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,860
Are you going out right away?

195
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,500
Yeah.

196
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,380
 I know you're not sleeping. 

197
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,460
 I'll cooperate, Hyung. 

198
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,040
So, leave it to me.

199
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,940
Don't keep showing up out of nowhere.

200
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,140
Do what your heart wants.

201
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,160
 I know, after reading your book, 

202
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,200
 that you can't let go of that writer. 

203
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,840
It must be fate between you and that writer.

204
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,140
Am I an idiot?

205
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,480
When I look at you, you still seem like a seventeen-year-old.

206
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,140
You seriously seem like seventeen-year-old Hyun Soo.

207
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,780
Maybe that's why I like you, Hyung.

208
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,820
My Eun Dong is pretty, isn't she?

209
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,400
I told you she was pretty.

210
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,720
Her eyes look kind.

211
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,820
Her body is nice, too.

212
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,610
Hey.

213
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,650
Why did you look at her body?

214
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,670
Now that I think about it, I feel bad.

215
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,540
No, I mean, it's not like I saw her a couple of times.

216
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,180
If I see it, I shouldn't look?

217
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,860
Don't look at her from now on.

218
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,580
Yes.

219
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,780
Unni. Who does this look like?

220
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,100
 She resembles you. 

221
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,660
 She looks like me, doesn't she? 

222
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,180
I can believe it if you said she was your twin!

223
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,040
But who is she?

224
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,700
This girl is Ji Eun Dong.

225
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,680
Really?

226
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,440
I don't really know but she really looks like you!

227
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,880
Where did you get this photo?

228
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,420
 - Manager! 
- Yeah?

229
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,700
Hold on.
  What? 

230
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,820
 My name is Ji Eun Dong. 

231
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,180
  Hello, I am a senior at City University, 

232
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,040
  studying Korean Literature. 

233
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,340
 My Love, Eun Dong 

234
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,340
 Oppa, there's another man that I love. 

235
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,040
 I don't love you. 

236
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,880
 I'm sorry. 

237
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,200
 I got scouted by the LA Dodgers. 

238
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,240
 The person that I really love 

239
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,820
 - Jung Eun...
- is that man. 

240
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,260
 I got scouted by the LA Dodgers. 

241
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,760
Dad!

242
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,340
Ra Il!

243
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,440
Dad, I came right away after hearing you were released from the hospital.

244
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,900
 The doctor gave me a lift. 

245
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,260
 Don't be sick anymore, okay? 

246
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,300
Did you sleep well?

247
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,700
I became close with that doctor and her daughter.

248
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,100
That doctor's daughter's name is Yoo Mi Na.

249
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,700
She's not pretty, but her thoughts are very deep.

250
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,380
Really?

251
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,100
Dad! Now that I see you more closely, you've gotten a lot better!

252
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,520
Dad, just hang in there a bit more.

253
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,220
Let's both do our best.

254
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,980
- Okay? 
- Alright.

255
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,540
I'll do that, my son.

256
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,120
- I love you. 
- Me, too.

257
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,800
- Ra Il. 
- Yeah?

258
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,540
Don't tell Mom that I've gotten better.

259
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,900
Why not? Mom would be the happiest to know.

260
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,300
I just want to recover completely and surprise her.

261
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,060
- You know what I mean, right? 
- Yeah.

262
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,060
Grab this.

263
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,460
You can do it.

264
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,600
Yeah, I can really do it!

265
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,020
 Let's watch the drama together! 

266
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,840
Hey, when I go home, Jong Suk plays his guitar,

267
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,500
and my husband goes to some kind of golf practice.

268
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,440
I can't concentrate when I'm there.

269
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,660
It's starting!

270
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,660
 I Have A Lover 

271
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,110
 Ji Eun Ho 

272
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,190
 Wow, Ji Eun Ho. 

273
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,890
 Ji Eun Ho 

274
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,820
 They chose a good soundtrack too. 

275
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,880
 I know that your pride was hurt because of me. 

276
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,780
 You're someone who doesn't have anything once your pride gets taken away, too... 

277
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,680
 I'm sorry. 

278
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,000
 You don't need to be sorry. 

279
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,380
 You haven't thought about how my mom would treat you like that, even once? 

280
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,100
 Don't look at me with those eyes (that look)! 

281
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,360
 What's happening in the company isn't something you don't know. 

282
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,640
 I know. 

283
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,720
 I'm acting like this because I know! 

284
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,480
 If it gets settled like this, another incident will pop up and then another topic, because that's what a company is. 

285
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,180
 The company construction... 

286
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,620
 Yeah, I know your mother was behind it. 

287
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,680
 Then what about me? What do I become? 

288
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,240
 It's our problem. 

289
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,880
 It's not just your problem. 

290
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,780
 I won't let it be. 

291
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,880
What?

292
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,340
 It's amazing. Totally  amazing! 

293
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,520
The viewership rating is 16.8%!

294
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,060
That was our first airing and our opponent was Oh Sae Young PD, at that!

295
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,300
It must be nice for you, since it's a big hit.

296
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,040
Hang up. I don't want to talk to you for a while.

297
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,060
 I just... 

298
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,140
  Fine, think of that!  

299
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,100
 Then...  

300
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,220
 Sunbae! 

301
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,500
 Did you see the drama or not? 

302
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,620
 Please respond or I'll call you. 

303
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,880
 I saw it. 

304
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,020
 Was it entertaining? 

305
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,960
 Or not? 

306
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,760
 It was entertaining. 

307
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,680
 I think Eun Dong would be happy if she saw it. 

308
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,060
 Eun Dong was like that. 

309
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,760
 She always supported me 

310
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,420
 when no one else would accept me. 

311
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:52,960
 If she sees me, I'm probably still as cool as ever to her. 

312
00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:00,380
 The aged me, after ten years, must have been more amazing than back then.

314
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,060
 She definitely. 

315
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:31,880
 She definitely still has the same feelings she did ten years ago. 

316
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,260
 It might be that she missed you more. 

317
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,400
 Just a little. 

318
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,460
 Just wait a little more.

Don't want to do commercials. The script, director and the actors,

321
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,310
they say the successful dramas have those three parts in sync.

322
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,370
Would Ji Eun Ho go somewhere?

323
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,510
Of course not.

324
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,370
He got rejected so many times when he was a trainee because he couldn't act.

325
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,750
Really?

326
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,350
You didn't read his essay?

327
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,570
Everything should have been in th—

328
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,390
Wood!

329
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,590
Look at the wind!

330
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:08,970
What should I do when that ball doesn't go where I want it to go?

331
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,930
You just have to, you know...

332
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,190
I should change it to a new one, shouldn't I?

333
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,790
I have many other pieces. Even if it's not you.

334
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,690
I'm saying that I have many other possibilities.

335
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,710
You've never loved someone, have you?

336
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,470
What are you trying to say? Even I—

337
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,530
Then have you ever felt that pain inflicted on your lungs and heart,

338
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,790
because of that person?

339
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,950
I feel that way when I see Ji Eun Ho.

340
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,970
It's like my blood runs around in circles. I go crazy when I see him.

341
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,130
It may be that Ji Eun Ho is unlucky to have been caught by me.

342
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,470
You, too.

343
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,210
You are out of luck since you found out about how I feel.

344
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,570
Hyun Soo sent us money again.

345
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:10,850
Why did he send money again when there's enough money to last a lifetime?

346
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,930
He told us to get a second house here

347
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:17,590
because it's hard coming back and forth.

348
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:21,610
It's one hour by car so what second house?

349
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,710
That's why he should marry already.

350
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:41,010
It would be great if he found that girl named Eun Dong.

351
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,350
What is this old man saying?

352
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,350
I really must not have known him, even though he's my child.

353
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,090
I really was forced to realize after reading his book.

354
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,790
Why?

355
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,030
You don't know, do you?

356
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:59,330
When he was in his first year of high school, I caught him smoking,

357
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:04,690
but he couldn't stop his addiction to smoking.

358
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:10,630
But one day, there was a new cigarette just sitting in the trashcan.

359
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:17,830
It was when he became friends with that girl, Eun Dong.

360
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:23,310
 He never ironed his clothes when he was in the military. 

361
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,510
 He just wore his clothes just like they were. 

362
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:30,710
 But suddenly, he started acting like a navy soldier. 

363
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,850
 Do you know when that happened? 

364
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,370
 It was when 

365
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,570
 he met that girl, Eun Dong, again. 

366
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,370
But I wonder why

367
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:48,290
they broke up and aren't able to meet.

368
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:52,710
I really wish they would be able to meet again.

369
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,770
You should also choose either Jesus or the Buddhist god and pray to only one of them.

370
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,490
Pray that Eun Dong comes back.

371
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,990
Just know, that  that  is the way for your son to live.

372
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:11,110
I heard Hyun Ah is coming tomorrow.

373
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,740
What?

374
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,170
With Mi Na.

375
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,190
Why would you say that now?

376
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:21,290
I mean, I wasn't sure what I'd do if she wasn't going to come.

377
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,510
I thought you would be disappointed.

378
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,870
Honey. Hurry. Let's go home.

379
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:31,470
If she's coming tomorrow, we need to get ready. We should go grocery shopping.

380
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,640
Stop that. Stop it. Just leave it. Let's go.

381
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,590
- She's coming tomorrow! 
- It's fine. Let's go!

382
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:43,070
My daughter is coming!

383
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,650
Please put some strength in your leg and extend it outward.

384
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,460
Okay, that's good! A little bit more!

385
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,220
 That's good! A little more. 

386
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,930
That's good! I'm going to feel your ankle.

387
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,830
 Would you try to flex your foot? 

388
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,580
 Like this. 

389
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,130
 Choi Ho. 

390
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:18,000
You should change your wheelchair to a manual one.

391
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,970
Just give it to me.

392
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,350
Why?

393
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:26,050
- Doctor.
- Yes.

394
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:38,410
Could I be a man?

395
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,400
It would be difficult, wouldn't it?

396
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,930
No. Right now, you

397
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:57,960
have been doing things that we didn't believe were possible, every day.

398
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,840
And, you more than qualify as a man, now.

399
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,370
 You don't know how cool you are, huh? 

400
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:13,170
The perfect love between a man and a woman isn't necessarily completed by physical love.

401
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,730
Have you heard? The soul is the G-spot.

402
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:22,330
Real love needs to establish that first.

403
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:27,250
"Forever." That shouldn't change.

404
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,300
You should have been a therapist.

405
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,520
I mean, I wanted to do that,

406
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,930
but I ended up choosing this officially.

407
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,460
If I were a psychologist,

408
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,120
Freud wouldn't have been able to even compare to me.

409
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,540
Let's go.

410
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,100
Did you find out?

411
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,780
 Yes. Ji Eun Ho's younger sister is Seo Jung Eun's husband's primary doctor. 

412
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,090
Those two are really stuck together like crazy glue.

413
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,820
Okay. You did well.

414
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,270
Here, let's eat some rice cakes.

415
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,680
Dad is not back from the away game yet?

416
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,830
Yeah, he forcefully had the contract renewed because the scores were bad last season.

417
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,560
He works like a cow. Hurry up and eat.

418
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,000
Mom. Thanks for giving birth to me and raising me.

419
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,700
You're being so strange.

420
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Hurry up and eat. I bought this at the bakery because you were coming.

421
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,630
Whenever you saw these rice cakes, you loved them so much.

422
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,310
I liked rice cakes?

423
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:03,900
Don't even question it. You always had indigestion because of it.

424
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,310
Whenever you had indigestion, your father would prick your finger.

425
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,860
There are rice cakes in America?

426
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,020
Mom.

427
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,530
Tell me honestly

428
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:25,080
about myself, prior to the accident.

429
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,980
Tell me.

430
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:39,970
 Elderly Korean Class 

431
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:46,310
I'll accept whatever it is.

432
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:52,120
If you're really my mother, I'd like it if you told me everything.

433
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,200
Everything. Truthfully.

434
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:03,020
I can't. I can't tell you

435
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,950
because you'll get hurt.

436
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,580
I don't want you to get hurt.

437
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,640
I'm already hurt,

438
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,620
because I'm living as a person who's not really me.

439
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:26,040
Jung Eun. Just live like this.

440
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,800
This is how you should live.

441
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,720
You weren't happier before the accident.

442
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,970
Just tell me one thing.

443
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,950
There was

444
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,170
another man who loved me, wasn't there?

445
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,650
And it's not Ra Il's father?

446
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,030
No, Jung Eun.

447
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:00,440
You didn't love any other man besides Son-in-law Choi.

448
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:08,640
Mom, I guess you don't want to answer this question.

449
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,190
Then, I'll change the question.

450
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:17,200
Please tell me this truthfully.

451
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,080
Mom.

452
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,680
Are you

453
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,930
really the mom who gave birth to me?

454
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,120
I'm sorry, Jung Eun.

455
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,400
I'm sorry.

456
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,250
We did wrong to you,

457
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,790
but we thought this was all for you.

458
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,800
Mom.

459
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:58,640
I guess you don't want to answer these two questions.

460
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,770
Then...

461
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,190
I'll change the question again.

462
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:13,200
Do I know Ji Eun Ho?

463
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,010
Do I know that person?

464
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:24,110
Park Hyun Soo. Do I, by any chance—

465
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,640
No, Jung Eun. Definitely not!

466
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,840
Thanks, Mom,

467
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,660
for telling me  honestly.

468
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:55,810


469
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:11,790
Mi Na! When you go, you're going to see your grandma and grandpa.

470
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,170
You have to definitively greet them, okay?

471
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,740
Of course!

472
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:22,740
Hey, Park Hyun Ah. Relax. Are you going to die or something?

473
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,490
Oppa.

474
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:28,440
What if Mom says she won't forgive me?

475
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,630
Did she really say I should come?

476
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,520
I told you, yes.

477
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,310
Why did you cause a problem and then cut off ties?

478
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,590
You worry too much.

479
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,280
I know, right?

480
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:57,160
Father,  Hyun Ah is here.

481
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,810
Come in. Mi Na, come in.

482
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:06,670
Grandpa and Grandma. I'm Yoo Mi Na.

483
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,530
Alright.

484
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:31,120
I drank alone every April 9th.

485
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:36,340
 It's my one and only daughter's birthday. 

486
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,890
I couldn't even take care of you.

487
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,090
I wanted to see you.

488
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,220
I'm sorry, Father.

489
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,530
 And the cherry blossoms are scattered so much. 

490
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,580
I'm sorry, Father.

491
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,340
I wanted to see you...

492
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,810
 Japchae. 

493
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,490
Your mother used to like this dish the most.

494
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,810
 Do you like it as well? 

495
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,250
Yes.

496
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,590
Eat a lot.

497
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:28,190
After I had her, my palate changed.

498
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:31,110
Were you like that as well?

499
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:39,150
After having Mi Na, how did you take care of yourself? Who took care of you?

500
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:43,350
Oppa found me a person.

501
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:46,190
If I wasn't in this household, what would have happened?

502
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:50,830
You should have brought her in before.

503
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:58,750
It's nice for the whole family to eat together.

504
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:26,310


505
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,910
  Eun Dong 

506
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:49,610
  Ji Eun Ho file 11 

507
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:55,490
  I was always afraid of Eun Dong riding a bicycle. 

508
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:58,590
  After getting hurt by a motorcycle that I was riding, 

509
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:03,370
  I always felt bad. 

510
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:08,710
  Eun Dong always had bruises on her legs. 

511
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:16,050
  I'm worried about whether Eun Dong got hurt when I was gone, 

512
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:20,050
  or if she fell somewhere 

513
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,470
 and that's why she couldn't contact me. 

514
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,690
  Who will treat Eun Dong 

515
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,770
  and put bandage on her, 

516
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:34,090
  and disinfect her? 

517
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:38,590
  I was always worried. 

518
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:43,050
  Writer Seo. 

519
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,710
  We 

520
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:48,470
  should see each others' faces sometimes. 

521
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,730
  Just 

522
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,390
  from time to time, let's see each other. 

523
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,750
  I want to do that. 

524
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:08,570
  I want to make that woman laugh a lot. 

525
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,370
  I'm planning on doing that. 

526
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:33,690
  I love you. 

527
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:36,130
  Good job! 

528
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,690
What are you doing alone?

529
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:44,310
You should have come a long time ago.

530
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:48,230
Yeah. Thank you.

531
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:56,010
You are thinking about Eun Dong, right? Did you hear anything?

532
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:03,750
What is she doing?

533
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:10,010
Hey.

534
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:16,690
You know amnesia. You must know a lot about it, because your'e in that field.

535
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:22,970
When a person loses her memory, does it help to be stimulated

536
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,890
by old pictures or things that could be part of the past memory?

537
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:32,750
Well, we have to know if the reason behind the amnesia is pathological or psychological.

538
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:36,450
Car accident.

539
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,990
Car accident?

540
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:41,350
Then the brain was damaged.

541
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,230
Who are you talking about?

542
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,750
Eun Dong.

543
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:57,500
Oppa, you met her?

544
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:05,060
But she doesn't know me.

545
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,450
She doesn't recognize who I am.

546
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:14,250
You met Eun Dong? Really?

547
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:18,690
The writer that wrote my autobiography,

548
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:22,190
she is Eun Dong.

549
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,630
I have goosebumps.

550
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,270
That makes no sense.

551
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:29,290
How...

552
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:34,450
The gods

553
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:38,010
are playing around with us.

554
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:42,210
She didn't know that the story she was writing was hers!

555
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:46,630
 That was the case... 

556
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:49,810
 That's why she couldn't contact you. 

557
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,970
That's why she suddenly disappeared like that.

558
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:55,850
How can this be?

559
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,750
Is she still alone? Is she married?

560
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,050
She is already married.

561
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,430
She has a child as well.

562
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:22,030
The person who should get the amnesia is me.

563
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,070
What should I do now?

564
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,270
I'm about to go crazy.

565
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:54,750
♫   Your shining eyes  ♫

566
00:46:54,750 --> 00:47:01,630
♫   And voice  ♫

567
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:08,250
♫   Your everything that made my breath stop  ♫

568
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:16,750
♫   I still remember them as if I saw them yesterday ♫ 

569
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:25,450
♫   It seems like I can't ever see you again   ♫

570
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:32,990
♫   You, who just passes by without recognizing me, hurts   ♫

571
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:38,970
♫   Always, anywhere,   ♫

572
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:41,370
 What are you doing over here? 

573
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:45,230
 Honey, you are  here? I am just getting some air because the weather is so nice. 

574
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,870
 Let's go in. 

575
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:51,230
 Ra Il is sleeping. Should we get some beer? 

576
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:53,350
 Should we? 

577
00:47:53,350 --> 00:48:00,790
♫   I don't think I can hold on to you, who forgot about me   ♫

578
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:07,450
♫   We are now as if we met for the first time  ♫

579
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:16,950
♫   Without saying a word, we walk through that moment   ♫

580
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:28,770
 How can I help you? 

581
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:33,350
This school's graduate—

582
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:35,030
No.

583
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:39,340
Can I check the names of the undergraduates in this school?

584
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,360
Do you know the year?

585
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,280
No.

586
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,410
Are you the person?

587
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,910
I lost my memory.

588
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:53,450
I don't remember anything,

589
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:56,210
but I might have been in this school.

590
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,290
I need to know.

591
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,710
Can I just know that?

592
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:06,870
Can you tell me your  resident registration number?

593
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:27,650
Seo Jung Eun?

594
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,050
Yes?

595
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:34,870
 On March 4th, 2002, you entered this school to major in Korean Language and Literature. 

596
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:39,600
  Till the first semester of 2005, you attended this school. 

597
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:47,250
Are you certain?

598
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:50,720
Is it really my resident registration number?

599
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,280
Is it really

600
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,830
Seo Jung Eun?

601
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,850
  Are you very hurt? 

602
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:12,950
  No. I'm okay. 

603
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,380
  This won't do. I will piggyback you. 

604
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,310
  No! I'll be right back. 

605
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:18,600
  No, no. I will piggyback you and drop you off at the front. 

606
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,800
 No, no!  

607
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,590
  I can go by myself. 

608
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:26,610
  How can you climb up these stairs with your ankle? 

609
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:29,420
  Stop talking nonsense. Get on. 

610
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:35,490
  I was afraid of Eun Dong riding a bicycle. 

611
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:40,560
  After she got hurt by the motorcycle that I was riding, 

612
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,250
  I always felt bad. 

613
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,380
  You don't have a boyfriend, right? 

614
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,830
  Eun Dong didn't say anything. 

615
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:03,000
  I didn't know what that meant. Eun Dong isn't a person who would lie. 

616
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,130
  Eun Dong, be careful! 

617
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,450
  Be careful. 

618
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,550
  I got it. 

619
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,350
  - Where were you?
- You are bleeding!
- I am always next to you. 

620
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:13,290
  Know this.  

621
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:39,630
  I'm worried about whether Eun Dong got hurt while I was gone 

622
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:43,970
  and couldn't contact me. 

623
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:49,130
  Who will treat Eun Dong, and  put a bandage on her 

624
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:51,850
  and disinfect her? 

625
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:57,090
  I was always worried. 

626
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,620
 Be careful. 

627
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,490
 Eun Dong. 

628
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:09,200
♫  Could it be you?   ♫

629
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,070
♫  Slowly approaching  ♫

630
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:16,160

631
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,980
  I'm sorry, Jung Eun. 
♫  My heart is beginning to race as it gets closer to you  ♫

632
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,730
 I'm sorry for loving you.
♫   Even if it's just walking distance   ♫ 

633
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:28,310

634
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:35,180
♫   My breath is stifled  ♫

635
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:43,040
♫  I finally get to walk after such a long time   ♫

636
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,190
♫  I want to tell you to that I was watching you  ♫

00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,110
 Eun Dong 

639

 told me to wait. 

640

00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:04,040
  My love, Eun Dong. 

643

  You are the reason for my living. 

644
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:14,410
  For the ten years you were gone, that reason became my life. 

645
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,180
  I will wait for you. 

646
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,770
  My love, Eun Dong. 

647
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:28,160
♫  I hear your voice and breathing!  ♫

648
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:38,200


649
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,320
  If a woman asks you for a dinner, what does that mean? 

650
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,630
  Before Oppa starts playing around with fire, we need to stop him. 

651
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:56,440
  I'm going to tell my husband that I'm seeing you. 

652
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,660
  That's the only way my heart cannot run away.  

653
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,640
  Is this book fake, or are you? 

654
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,310
  Which one do you wish was fake? 

655
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:05,170
 - That day—
- Stop! 

656
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:06,750
  We loved each other, to the point of death. 

657
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:12,960
  I'm going to start again from that moment, the day before the accident, the day when Park Hyun Soo waited for me.  

658
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:19,290
  Don't sleep with your husband tonight.
