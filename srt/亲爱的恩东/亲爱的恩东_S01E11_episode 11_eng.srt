1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,360
 - Eun Dong! 
- Jung Eun... 

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,720
 The one who made me this way is you. 

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,270
 That's the only thing I can tell you right now. 

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,740
 Oppa... 

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,850
 Hyun Soo Oppa... 

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,870
 Hyun Soo Oppa... 

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,160
 We're leaving now. Both are in critical condition. 

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,520
 The man's name is Choi Jae Ho! The girl's name is still unknown. 

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,340
 I found the name! 

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,060
 The woman's name is Ji Eun Dong. 

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,380
 You and I, let's both end it here right now. 

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,400
 Oppa. 

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,320
 Stop the car! 

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,240
 Are you okay? 

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,700
 Honey, what's wrong? Where and how are you hurt? 

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,700
 I'm okay. 

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,780
 Please go out. I want to be alone. 

18
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,380
 You go to the US with Jung Eun immediately. 

19
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,680
 I will be responsible for it, so take her with you. 

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,080
 I'm telling you to go before something happens, you punk! 

21
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,140


22
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:09,240
 My Love Eun Dong
Episode 11 

23
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,920
 Cut! Okay! 

24
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,700
Okay! After a ten-minute break, we'll get ready so scene 2.

25
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,380
Sit down for ten minutes then get ready for the equipment.

26
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,500
Hyung, Miss Writer and my cousin are going together to my parents' pension house.

27
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,240
- Just the two of them?
- Yes.

28
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:42,060
Oh right, Hyung. You know how President Cho is setting up her own entertainment firm?

29
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,480
I keep getting this sense that she's going to try to entice the president to join her company.

30
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,160
Hey.

31
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,160
Where is your parents' pension house?

32
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,790
In Jebu-do (Jebu Island). Why?

33
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,280
 Children's World Piano 

34
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,580
  You heard Ji Eun Ho's speech today. 

35
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,200
 I want to shake up Ji Eun Ho's foundation. 

36
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,760
 I will make you a formal offer today. Please help me. 

37
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,380
  I give you carte blanche to decide your own salary. 

38
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,300
President!

39
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,020
President, I got my paycheck today.

40
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,520
I will buy you a meal.

41
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,080
Ah, what time is it already?

42
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,560
I already ate.

43
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,160
- I haven't eaten though.
- Is that so?

44
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,840
Then you have to eat. Let's go.

45
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,620
Yes, President Cho. Yes.

46
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,720
Yes. Tomorrow?

47
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,660
Ah, yes.

48
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,540
Yes. I understand. I'll do that.

49
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,880
If you were asked to choose between a friend and money,

50
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,360
which one would you choose?

51
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,700
Ah... Which one will make you happier?

52
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,680
You have to think which one would make you happier first, then choose.

53
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,460
For me, when I'm torn between black bean noodles and   spicy seafood noodles,

54
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,760
or when I can't decide between soy sauce crabs or seasoned crabs,

55
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,500
or between fried chicken and chicken with sauce,

56
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,560
that's the standard question. Which one would make me happier?

57
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,080
Okay.

58
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,500
I can just choose that one then.

59
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,940
Let's go.

60
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,920
- But you know what?
- Yeah?

61
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:15,040
When I don't know which one would make me happier, what do I do then?

62
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,140
Well...

63
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,160
Think about which one would make you more sad once it's gone.

64
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,140
Which absence would impact you more? Which one would you miss more?

65
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,480
I bet you were a good student in school, am I right?

66
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,140
I was really bad at school.

67
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,080
Actually, I was like that, too.

68
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,980
If you want to keep pirates from coming into the room,

69
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,860
a good strategy is to hang a few sea urchins in front of the door.

70
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,140
The pirates are creating a wild commotion in the living room.

71
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,060
Not only do they climb up and dangle from the curtains,

72
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,440
but they also run up and down the sofa, screaming loudly.

73
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,380
 Jung Eun! 

74
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,860
 I got scouted by LA Dodgers. 

75
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,700
 That's great. 

76
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,800
 It's not just great. After just one month since the scouting report, 

77
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,460
 I was selected favorably based on a high rating. 

78
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,940
 That's great, Oppa. Congratulations. 

79
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,840
 Hey! Is that it? Congratulations? 

80
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,260
 I'm starting to feel upset. This news isn't just about me. 

81
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,960
 It's about us. 

82
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,580
 It's about you. You're the baseball player, not me. 

83
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,880
 Jung Eun, what's wrong? 

84
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,860
 Oppa, 

85
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,600
 I want us to just have a close oppa-dongsaeng relationship. 

86
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,620
 What? 

87
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,280
 You doing things like coming to my house without notice, 

88
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,700
 I'd like it if you stopped doing it. 

89
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
 Hey, Seo Jung Eun. Why are you like this all of a sudden? 

90
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,480
 It's not all of a sudden. 

91
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,040
 I'm tired. I'm going in. 

92
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,300
 Jung Eun! 

93
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,280
 I don't love him. 

94
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,040
 Do you think even you're worthy of Jae Ho? 

95
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,680
 This rude girl! 

96
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,820
 Oppa, let me out. What are you doing? 

97
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,540
 You... Did you sleep with that bastard? 

98
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,540
 Yes. 

99
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,920
 Oppa, you have everything. The world is yours now. 

100
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,040
 - You can date any girl you want.
- Shut your mouth! 

101
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,380
 Tell me. 

102
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,320
 Is it going to be me or that punk? 

103
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,700
 Is it me or that punk?! 

104
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,880
 You and I, let's both end it here, right now. 

105
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,900
 Can I ask why you can't forget that girl? 

106
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,940
 I slept with that girl. 

107
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,700
 I can't seem to be able to forget that. 

108
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,860
 When we went traveling that day, 

109
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,260
 - that night, weâ€” 
- Stop! 

110
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,200
 Listen to what I have to say! 

111
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,420
 We loved each other to death that day, 

112
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,660
 and then four days later... 

113
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,380
 Four days later... 

114
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,680
 She disappeared without any trace. 

115
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,420
 Do you know how much I was going crazy? 

116
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,480
 Find Eun Dong for me. Please. 

117
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:36,140


118
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,860
 Let's see the sea tomorrow. 

119
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,040
 Let's see the sea in the evening. 

120
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,860
 It's warm... 

121
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,520
 Pretty Writer 

122
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,460
Hello?

123
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,520
Hello?

124
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,620
 Oppa. 

125
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,960
 Hyun Soo Oppa. 

126
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,040
Eun Dong.

127
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,680
Oppa.

128
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,840
Hyun Soo, Oppa.

129
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,760
Hyung, I said I will drive.

130
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,660
Dong Gyu.

131
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,720
 Oppa. 

132
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,660
 Hyun Soo Oppa. 

133
00:14:34,080 --> 00:15:00,200


134
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,960
 This call is not available. 

135
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,600
Ah, honestly...

136
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,720
I said I would drive!

137
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,560
How is he planning to drive on this night?

138
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,060
This is a big problem.

139
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,360
 Dong Gyu 

140
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:35,280
 â™« Could it be you? My approaching heart is beating this fast â™«  

141
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:44,420
 â™« It's just a simple walk, why does it feel so far away?  â™«

142
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:50,240
 â™« It must've followed breathlessly â™« 

143
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:59,260
 â™« I finally get to walk after such a long time â™« 

144
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:10,520
 â™« I want to tell you that I was always watching you  â™«

145
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:19,680
  â™« I see you, I see you like this in front of me â™« 

146
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:25,780
â™«   You are there in front of me, unchanged as ever  â™«

147
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:33,100
 â™« I hear you, I hear you everywhere and in my dreams â™« 

148
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:43,120
â™«   I hear your voice and breathing, which couldn't be heard before  â™«

149
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:03,020
â™«  Why is love like this    â™«

150
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:10,060
â™«   Continuing even without you   â™«

151
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:18,740
 â™« Even if the night passes and many years later  â™«

152
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,600
You've waited a long time, right?

153
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:33,000
The one who waited a long time is you, Oppa.

154
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:44,300
â™«   Without leaving a single thing out, I cry out everything to you  â™«

155
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:53,380
 â™« I see you, I see you like this in front of me â™« 

156
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:59,460
â™«   You are there in front of me, unchanged as ever  â™«

157
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:06,780
 â™« I hear you, I hear you everywhere and in my dreams, â™« 

158
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:18,040
â™«   I hear your voice and breathing
which couldn't be heard before  â™«

159
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:25,500
  â™« Can I go to to you now? I want to go to you now â™« 

160
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:33,320
 â™« Can you take a step towards me â™« 

161
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,760
 â™« If you can hear my voice? â™« 

162
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:48,000
 â™« Can you hear it louder if I miss you more? â™« 

163
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,010
Oh, it hurts.

164
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,370
Where did she go so early in the morning?

165
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,110
What time is it?

166
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,230
Wow!

167
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,810
Why do I have so many missed calls?

168
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,110
Ah! That scared me.

169
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,020
Hello?

170
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,450
Did I wake you up?

171
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,440
It's early in the morning ... What's going on?

172
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,180
Is Jung Eun next to you right now?

173
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,730
 No. 

174
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,250
I think she went to the washroom.

175
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,350
Is there anything wrong?

176
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:13,620
A husband is looking for his wife. Do I need a reason for it?

177
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,230
I'll tell her to call you when she comes.

178
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,790
Yes. Please make sure to tell her to call me.

179
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,610
I wanted to hear her voice.

180
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,070
Yes. I'll call you later.

181
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,860
This person is a big problem, too.

182
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,980
By the way, where did she go?

183
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,320
Jung Eun! Jung Eun!

184
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,140
Then, is it really okay for me to sleep over at Mi Na's house?

185
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,000
Why don't you ask Mi Na to sleep over at our house, instead?

186
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,190
Mom went on a vacation though. I'll go.

187
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,590
Do you like Mi Na that much?

188
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,110
It's not like that.

189
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,510
It's just that I feel something when I look at Mi Na.

190
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,890
Do you know why we got close?

191
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,060
Why?

192
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,960
Mi Na said her father passed away when she was three.

193
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,660
That's how we got close.

194
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:17,200
My dad is now getting better,

195
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,620
but Mi Na's dad already passed away.

196
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,870
I want to be nice to Mi Na.

197
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,090
Is that so?

198
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,350
Wow! My son has an amazing heart.

199
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,850
Come on. Whose son am I? The best college baseball pitcher for four years standing,  Choi Jae Ho,

200
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,190
his son, Choi Ra Il.

201
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,980
Did the doctor say she'll pick you up?

202
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,920
I will go by subway.

203
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,720
If I take the #4 line, it's just a three-minute walk after I get off.

204
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,860
You can't.

205
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,870
Why?

206
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,750
I'll get you a taxi. You can't ride the subway yet.

207
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,050
Mom lets me ride the subway.

208
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,100
What?

209
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,880
It's weird, but Mom says she doesn't like taxis,

210
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,070
says she doesn't like passenger cars.

211
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,060
She said it makes her feel upset.

212
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,780
That's why Mom only rides the subway.

213
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:23,090


214
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,000
â™«  How did I meet you like this again?   â™«

215
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,850
Did you sleep well?

216
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,210
Your phone keeps on ringing.

217
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:05,240
Hurry and go. You came while working, right?

218
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,340
I don't want to work.

219
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,160
 â™« The things I have in my hand, the things I haven't said â™« 

220
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,450
Hurry and go.

221
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:17,100
I know. Should we go together?

222
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,020
Don't act so stubborn.

223
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,760
â™«  The warm memories come with a smile   â™«

224
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:31,230
Let's stay for ten more minutes and go.

225
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,800
Should we get something to eat?

226
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,670
Do you have time for that? Hurry up and leave.

227
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:42,020
â™«  Back to the days we shared  â™«

228
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,610
â™«  As if we're dreaming, back to that time   â™«

229
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:50,690
â™«  We can go back now  â™«

230
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,720
â™«  Let's not grow apart again  â™«

231
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,770
Oppa.

232
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,670
Yeah?

233
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,600
Thank you

234
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,200
for waiting.

235
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,870
Say that again.

236
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,850
Thank you

237
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,980
for waiting.

238
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,280
No. The one before that.

239
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,490
 â™« Love, once again, fills up part of my heart â™« 

240
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,210
Oppa.

241
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,900
Ah... I like that like crazy,

242
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,950
you saying, "Oppa."

243
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:41,820
As always, you're handsome.

244
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,900
â™«  I can feel it right now  â™«

245
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,640
â™«  The meaning of my tears for you  â™«

246
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,520
I really don't want to go to work.

247
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,750
Hurry and go.

248
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,140
If you keep doing this, I'll be disappointed.

249
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,530
Okay, did I say I wasn't going to go?

250
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,250
- You're really the same as always.
- What is?

251
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,370
Your goofing off. Didn't I tell you to be diligent and sincere?

252
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:20,910
â™«  Back to the days we loved   â™«

253
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,740
As always, you act like you're so mature.

254
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,890
Okay, fine. I'm going.

255
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:31,300
I'm going. I'm going.

256
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,080
â™«  As if we're dreaming, back to that time   â™«

257
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,500
â™«  We can go back now  â™«

258
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,950
â™«  Stay with my heart   â™«

259
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,380
â™«  Let's not grow apart again   â™«

260
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:54,610
â™«  Stay with my heart  â™«

261
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:58,840
â™«  Let's not grow apart again  â™«

262
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,100
I'll be back.

263
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,530
Okay.

264
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,610
Go. Hurry up.

265
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:30,960
Even if you're late for filming, you have to eat.

266
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,230
Understand?

267
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,210
Yeah.

268
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:38,800
Don't eat things like rice rolls. Eat something good for your body.

269
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,490
Understand?

270
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,390
Yeah.

271
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:46,680
Don't just eat sweet things. Eat sour foods, too.

272
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,650
Yeah.

273
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,550
Go. Hurry up.

274
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,760
I'm scared that this is a dream.

275
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,970
It's not a dream. I pinched myself earlier.

276
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,420
Eat well. Okay?

277
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,580
- Yeah.
- Don't rush when eating.

278
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,930
Make sure to chew at least fifteen times. Understand?

279
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,850
Yeah.

280
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:35,280
Since you've gotten wet from the rain, don't let the cold wind get to you. Okay?

281
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,100
Yeah.

282
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,370
I'll go.

283
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:58,100
Don't disappear again. Understand?

284
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,830
Yeah.

285
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,580
I'll go.

286
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,850
Oppa!

287
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:26,020
Drive carefully. Understand?

288
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,910
Got it.

289
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:32,090
Be really, really, careful. Understand?

290
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,230
I'll be really, really, careful.

291
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,090
Don't answer a call when you're driving.

292
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,590
Understand?

293
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:45,120
I got it. I really, really, won't answer a call.

294
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,020
Go in.

295
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,660
Why is he not here yet?

296
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,020
I'm sorry.

297
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,700
What on earth is going on?

298
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,020
There was a problem at his parents' house.

299
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,380
He'll be here soon.

300
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,240
Ah, this is the perfect timing, too.

301
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,700
They said it was going to rain in the afternoon.

302
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,500
Aigoo, it doesn't look like it's going to rain though.

303
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,740
Aish.

304
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,140
You want to braid your hair

305
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,660
because that Ra Il Oppa is coming, right?

306
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,180
Do you like him?

307
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,600
It's not like that.

308
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,900
But why are you so insistent on appearing pretty?

309
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,000
It's being respectful.

310
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,980
What?

311
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,640
It's being respectful towards the visitor.

312
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,660
I wonder whose granddaughter she is, to be so smart.

313
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,400
That's right. It's respectful.

314
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,800
- Should we wear this, Mi Na? 
- Yeah.

315
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,180
Ah, this! I bought this at Ra Il's mother's store.

316
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,740
That lady is pretty, right?

317
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,220
Yeah, she is pretty.

318
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,140
She's tall and her legs are pretty.

319
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,720
And her face is very pretty. She looks like Miss Korea.

320
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,130
Yeah, Miss Korea.

321
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,760
But... Ra Il's Dad,

322
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,200
he's in a wheelchair because his body isn't well.

323
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,300
Really?

324
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,680
Yeah.

325
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:05,320
She is very elegant and pretty. I guess there is something like that.

326
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,860
Hmm?

327
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,240
Ra Il Oppa is here!

328
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,660
Aigoo, she loves it.

329
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,240
Oppa!

330
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,220
Already...

331
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,300
I'm sorry. I'm worried about whether he'll act up when the elders are there.

332
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,000
I know how cool and well-mannered Ra Il is.

333
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,520
You really raised him well.

334
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,160
At the risk of sounding like a Palbulchul, I agree there is that side to him.  (In Korea, if you brag too much about your child/partner, you are called  Palbulchul  = a fool or dimwit. )

335
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,280
Doctor...

336
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,640
I want to have a child.

337
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,220
Artificial insemination.

338
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,560
Did you talk about this with Jung Eun?

339
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,840
Jung Eun will most likely not want to do it.

340
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,780
Just focus on your rehabilitation for now.

341
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,760
I'm nervous. Very nervous.

342
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,520
I feel like I'm going crazy day by day.

343
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,680
I feel like that guy is going to steal Jung Eun away from me.

344
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,700
That man...

345
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,100
I want to kill him.

346
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,640
I'm sorry. My emotions were too extreme.

347
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,440
You have Ra Il, but that man is alone.

348
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,580
I need something that will tie Jung Eun and I together.

349
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,740
I don't have that something.

350
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,260
Eun Ho Hyung is here!

351
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,160
Hyung, honestly!

352
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,380
What?

353
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,720
Hyung, I ordered sashimi at the seafood restaurant over there.

354
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,880
We have to treat the staff.

355
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,640
- Why? 
- That day,

356
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,760
this seaâ€” Yeahâ€”

357
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,120
Tell them to catch every fish in this sea.

358
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,380
Did you meet that writer?

359
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,760
Why are you asking about my personal life? Don't worry about it.

360
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,760
Hey, where is that invigorating soup? 
 (Boyang=health aid for recuperating strength and virility)

361
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,600
You told me to eat it all.

362
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,740
When did I?

363
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,000
Ah, really!

364
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,920
I'm going to eat it. Bring it.

365
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,800
How can we figure out who is the vampire?

366
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,980
Vampire. Vampire.

367
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,900
Vampire. Vampire.

368
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,620
This little guy is so good looking.

369
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,260
 Canine teeth are very sharp. 

370
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,580
I wonder if Ra Il eats Kalgooksoo.

371
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,180
Honey, can you ask him?

372
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,920
Ra Il, do you like Kalgooksoo?

373
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,860
Yes.

374
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,620
There, this is Ra Il's.

375
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,800
Thank you.

376
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,180
Yeah, eat a lot.

377
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,080
- You have to eat a lot too, Mi Na. 
- Yes.

378
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,520
Do you not like scallions?

379
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,940
No, I don't eat green vegetables. I'm very sorry.

380
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,920
It's okay. No need to be sorry.

381
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,460
Why aren't you eating?

382
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,480
I don't like how it's slippery.

383
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,020
It feels weird when it goes into my mouth.

384
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,500
I just got chills.

385
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,600
What in the world?

386
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,320
It just felt like I saw Hyun Soo when he was young.

387
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,880
Is it good?

388
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,800
Yes, it's very delicious.

389
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,700
- Eat a lot. 
- Yes.

390
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,960
 Move the reflector this way!   

391
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,760
 Yes, yes! 

392
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,820
  Hold this one. 

393
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,680
What is that? I can't eat kimbap.

394
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,580
We only have ten minutes. Eat this for now.

395
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,940
I can't. I won't eat it.

396
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,660
Why?

397
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,760
This isn't just your ordinary kimbap.

398
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,540
It's a special kimbap that the boss had made just for you.

399
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,500
Wow. Look. Korean beef.

400
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,480
I won't eat it! I have to eat things that are good for me, except for sweets.

401
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,140
I told you we don't have time. Time.

402
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:31,300
I can just eat after I finish filming! Aigoo, this kid is so rigid...

403
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,920
  Wow. It's cool! 

404
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,280
It's so nice!

405
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,460
Be careful!

406
00:36:53,100 --> 00:37:00,160


407
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,320
Eun Ho came by yesterday.

408
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,960
You're saying Ji Eun Ho came all the way here from the South Sea, in all that downpour?

409
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,720
Yeah.

410
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,540
What will you do?

411
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,800
Really, what is your plan?

412
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,540
I'm going to live for that person.

413
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,680
I'm only going to do things to make him happy.

414
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,620
I just want to have thoughts like that.

415
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,460
Jung Eun, you...

416
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,440
Ra Il and his father, it's not that simple of an issue.

417
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,900
Everything needs to returned to its rightful place.

418
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,620
Aigoo, you're tired, right?

419
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,080
 It's not rice cake, but scallion kimchi. 

420
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,040
What?

421
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,980
It looks like his blood sugar is low.

422
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,300
After I make some sweet pumpkin soup and an egg pie, I will be going home.

423
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,320
Thank you.

424
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:38,320
 Choi Jae Ho! Choi Jae Ho! 

425
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:44,540
 Choi Jae Ho! Choi Jae Ho! 

426
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,660
Inviting Eun Ho to the Sponsorship Event seems to  have been a losing move, don't you think?

427
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,900
It doesn't matter, since we both experienced losses.

428
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,780
Jae Ho,

429
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,420
do you want to go back to America?

430
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,000
In my opinion, you have no chance of winning a direct match.

431
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,320
Go back to America.

432
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,480
I think it's a better choice than sitting by idly and getting your wife stolen, so don't refuse.

433
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,380
What if Jung Eun says she won't leave?

434
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,900
That's homework for  you  to do.

435
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,200
I will, of course, help you with it.

436
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,000
President, we got three movies for Eun Ho.

437
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,780
And one of them is a Chinese movie.

438
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,140
- It's a kind of martial arts movie. So, Eun Ho--
- When is it?

439
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,180
Early next year? The director will be...

440
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,880
President!

441
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,960
What is this? Am I not a person here? (literal = "Is he the only one with a mouth, and I just have a trap/pie hole?")

442
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,160
I didn't know you were here.

443
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,520
Thank you. I'll drink it well.

444
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,680
Let's have an emergency meeting tomorrow.

445
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,160
Call all the workers and Eun Ho as well,

446
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,440
because I have something important to say as President.

447
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,520
An emergency meeting?

448
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,040
Yeah. It's a meeting, but it's an urgent one.

449
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,320
So an emergency meeting.

450
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,220
 Oppa, are you sleeping? Did the filming go well? 

451
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,900
 Are you coming back tomorrow? 

452
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:14,630
 Yeah. I'm returning tomorrow. 

453
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,980
 What should we do tomorrow? 

454
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,620
 Whatever you want to do. 

455
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,080
 Ji Eun Ho 

456
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,240
 Hello? 

457
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,460
Did you eat?

458
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:46,000
Yeah. I ate a lot.

459
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,820
 Good job. 

460
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,360
What about you?

461
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,720
Mmm, yeah I ate, too.

462
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,700
Let's...

463
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,200
Tomorrow let's go there. The lake park.

464
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,420
Ahh. Shall we?

465
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:11,680
 Is the soondae house still there? It probably disappeared, huh? 

466
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,080
Eun Dong.

467
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,660
I love you.

468
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,320
I didn't have a chance to say these words to you

469
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,760
before we separated.

470
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,040
 These words... 

471
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,560
Having to keep them stored in my heart for ten years,

472
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,080
it's been really difficult for me.

473
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,900
I almost died.

474
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,100
I'm sorry, Oppa.

475
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,420
I'm really sorry.

476
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,700
I'll see you tomorrow.

477
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:09,200
Then, I'll forgive you for everything.

478
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,120
Go to sleep.

479
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,980
Don't put the air conditioner on full blast.

480
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,820
You catch colds easily.

481
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,920
I got it.

482
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:49,160


483
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,680
I'm Lee Hyun Bal, Ji Eun Ho's friend for twenty years.

484
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:17,740
If it's for Ji Eun Ho, I would be willing to die.

485
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:23,700
Today, I prepared a decisionâ€”

486
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,040
 Hey, you punk! 

487
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,840
Miss! Miss! You can't do this!

488
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,360
Who is this Oh Nan Shik woman?

489
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,000
WHO IS OH NAN SHIK?

490
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,520
Hey, Ji Sook.

491
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,340
Let's go out.

492
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,660
 Get out! 

493
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,940
- What's wrong? 
- Ji Sook.

494
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,340
Ji Sook, let's go outside and talk.

495
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,620
What is this?

496
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,860
Let's talk outside.

497
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,940
Hey, Ji Sook!

498
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,800
Hey, are you okay?

499
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,280
How can you hit him there?

500
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,640
Hey, don't get heated. Let's sit down and talk.

501
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,520
What is this?

502
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,180
Hyun Soo, I feel so wronged.

503
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:20,820
- You know I gave my entire youth to this bastard,
- I understand.

504
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:24,880
but this punk cheated on me with a younger woman!

505
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,100
Adultery is no longer a crime, so I can't even put him in jail.

506
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,280
What do I do?

507
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,200
Tell me. Tell me how I can take care of this punk!

508
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,400
How is this cheating? Weren't you guys just talking?

509
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,680
Ji Sook. This is my office. Let's go talk downstairs.

510
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,980
You... How far did you go with that woman?

511
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:50,660
I didn't pursue the pleasure with her.

512
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,260
You little...

513
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,960
- Ahhh! 
- Hey!

514
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,100
- HEY!!!
- Stop it!

515
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,300
Ahh seriously!

516
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,980
Aigoo, aigoo.

517
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,800
Aigoo... Sit down right here.

518
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,400
Aigoo... You and your shenanigans.

519
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,580
Thanks, friend.

520
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,480
What?

521
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,140
I didn't give it to you to eat.

522
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:56,040
Ahh... Yes...

523
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:11,520
This food doesn't really seem appropriate for our current situation,

524
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,960
but let's eat first and talk later.

525
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:32,160
So disgusting ... slobbering everywhere.

526
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,060
Aigoo...

527
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,180
I think my mouth sphincter muscles have become loose.

528
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,400
Is your mouth hole your butthole, you punk?

529
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:55,520
Hey. Ji Sook is asking if I'm with you right now.

530
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,760
You have to tell her we're here together.

531
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,100
She said to send her a picture of proof.

532
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,560
Hey. Everyone get over here and get close.

533
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,200
Get closer.

534
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,180
It's been a long time since I laid down like this.

535
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,300
Yeah right, whatever.

536
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,800
Laying here together, doesn't it remind you of our younger days?

537
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,620
I feel like you and I are fated.

538
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,180
Right?

539
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:05,000
Aigoo, just sleep.

540
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,160
It really does.

541
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,140
Get away from me!

542
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,440
So disgusting.

543
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,880
Hey, you better not breathe down my back.

544
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,800
Get away from me.

545
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:28,760
- Eun Ho. 
- Ah, this punk!

546
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,180
There are a lot of other rooms. Why are you here?

547
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,880
We slept together well, back in the day.

548
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,040
This crazy punk.

549
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,800
Really, this punk!

550
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,680
Hey, get out!

551
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,360
 I want to have a child. 

552
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:17,240
 You have Ra Il, but that man is alone. 

553
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,920
 I need something that will tie Jung Eun and I together. I don't have that something. 

554
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,560
Aish.

555
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,140
Disgusting punk.

556
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,130
This is cherry sage.

557
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,180
Wow, it's pretty.

558
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,920
- It's pretty, right? 
- Yes.

559
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,220
Try smelling it.

560
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,700
It smells really nice.

561
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:46,000
Now then, this is lavender.

562
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,780
If you put it inside a pillow or hang it in the room,

563
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,500
this makes people sleep well. For people who have a lot of worries,

564
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,660
this makes their worries fly away. Its flower name is  Good Fortune. 

565
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,920
Grandpa, can I take this home and take care of it?

566
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,110
Of course.

567
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:04,480
Now then, let's try it.

568
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,040
- Yes. 
- This is Mi Na's.

569
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,600
This is Ra Il's and this is mine.

570
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,540
Put a little bit of that in, for now.

571
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,520
That's right. Then this.

572
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,800
And we put it in like this for Ra Il, too.

573
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,760
Good! You're very good!

574
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,020
Why didn't you contact me?

575
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,280
A woman who has a husband and a child,

576
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,080
wouldn't it be normal for her to call her family at home after leaving for two days, in case they might be worried?

577
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,660
I need time to think.

578
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:11,680
You, me, and Ji Eun Ho. No, Park Hyun Soo.

579
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:17,700
- It hasn't been resolved. 
- What do you mean it hasn't been resolved?!

580
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,180
I...

581
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,340
I found Ji Eun Dong.

582
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,960
Ten years ago,

583
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:35,260
that day when you put me in your car at the lake, I saw it. It came back to me.

584
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,100
I've recovered all of my memories.

585
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,240
I remember everything vividly, just as if it was all a lie,

586
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,480
as if it was a movie that we just watched yesterday.

587
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,920
You...

588
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:02,380
That's right, you remember?

589
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,900
Then at the time of the accident, do you remember

590
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:09,780
how I got crushed trying to save both you and the child you were carrying inside of you?

591
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:15,140
There's no way you would remember that, since that only exists in my memory.

592
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,200
Return my life back to normal, too.

593
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,800
My messed up legs and life, return them back to normal.

594
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:28,220
I won't forgive you. You and Ji Eun Ho,

595
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:31,600
I will make sure to see with my own two eyes, that both of you get crushed the way I did.

596
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,300
 It's that punk's turn now. 

597
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,280
I will make that punk hit rock bottom.

598
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,300
The day you meet him again,

599
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,680
I might even kill him.

600
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,880
 Do you think I wouldn't be able to? 

601
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,040
I have nothing to lose,

602
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,580
but that punk has a lot to lose,

603
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:59,240
so I'll make sure to do it!

604
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,780
Hello?

605
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,400
It's me. We promised to meet up today.

606
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:29,500
Oppa, don't call me.

607
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:34,710
Why do you sound like that?

608
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:37,170
I will call you back later.

609
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,040
Hello?

610
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:46,460
 Who are you? Who are you to be calling someone's wife so freely like this? 

611
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,010
I definitely warned you,

612
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:55,050
that I wouldn't leave you alone if you linger around my wife one more time!

613
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:18,810


614
00:57:58,610 --> 00:57:59,780
 Get out of this house right now! 

615
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,500
 There is nothing else that I can do, other than becoming cowardly. 

616
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,690
 This book, everything is a lie. 

617
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,140
 If you hurt that woman again, 

618
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,460
 I'll kill you. 

619
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,120
 - DM Entertainment will undergo a seizure and search.
- The main actor in the movie has been changed. 

620
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,840
 I never loved you. 

621
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:17,460
 The only person I loved was Park Hyun Soo. 

622
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,100
 This is where I eat while forever thinking of you. 

623
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:24,460
 Right here, and over there, is where I poop and wash thinking of you. 

624
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:28,480
 I had this room made thinking you might be coming some day. I hope you like it. 

625
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,960
 I have nothing left to get hurt, because I'm already hurt, 

626
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,540
 but I don't want you getting hurt. 

627
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,100
 It doesn't matter if I get hurt. 

628
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,940
 I will speed up.
