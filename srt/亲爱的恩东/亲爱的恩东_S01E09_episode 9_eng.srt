00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,560
 My Love, Eun Dong 
Episode 9 

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,110
Isn't this the place that you wanted to come to?

3
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,390
Shall we get out?

4
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,400
Like this,

5
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,380
let's just try to walk over there.

6
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,890
Who knows? Your memories might return.

7
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:49,600
And mind you, this hand was mine just ten years ago.

8
00:01:49,800 --> 00:02:09,000
Let's go.

9
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:16,420


10
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,520
This was the place

11
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,080
where Eun Dong and I had our first kiss.

12
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,870
There was a telephone booth here, but I guess it's gone now.

13
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,020
If people knew that this place was where Ji Eun Ho had his first kiss,

14
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,340
they wouldn't have gotten rid of it. How regretful.

15
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,090
Do you know how much of a fox she was?

16
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,430
She seduced me.

17
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,400
I was really innocent back then.

18
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,710
Even when I just trying to hold Eun Dong's hand, my heart would race really fast.

19
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,110
When I think about it, Eun Dong planned it all out

20
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,630
and came to me.

21
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,780
That's not true. Don't accuse someone innocent of doing that.

22
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,190
Oh! The memories are coming back, right?

23
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,230
That's not it. I'm just saying that there's no way Eun Dong would have done that.

24
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,470
I told you over the recording file as well.

25
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,950
"Oppa, you can go faster." She seduced me by saying this!

26
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,410
Because at the time, it was okay to do that.

27
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,980
What about now?

28
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,560
What?

29
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,770
Can I not do that now?

30
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,870
What are you saying right now?

31
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,100
I was talking about Eun Dong,

32
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,490
not me.

33
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,870
Do you feel relieved when you say it like that?

34
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,210
Even if you don't have any memories, let's try starting with you

35
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,200
acknowledging that you are Eun Dong, herself.

36
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,710
You know, talking like that, as if you're a different person,

37
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,580
I'm saying, don't do stuff like that.

38
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:39,040
Ah, you still don't understand my position, since it isn't your problem.

39
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,540
To me, Eun Dong is still unfamiliar. Understand?

40
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,740
Are you angry?

41
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,930
Ah, don't be like that.

42
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,060
- I just—
- I'm not angry.

43
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,270
Do you think I'm you?

44
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,830
What? What does that mean?

45
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,810
Do you see me as a small-minded person?

46
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,270
- I guess that hit a nerve. 
- Hit a—!

47
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,700
I mean, it's not that, I just—

48
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,300
 Ji Eun Ho?  

49
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,650
 Ji Eun Ho!  

50
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,980
This is somewhere Eun Dong and I came often to eat.

51
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,700
The broth here is amazing.

52
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,680
Shall we sit here?

53
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,670
- Please enjoy your meal.
- Yes.

54
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,420
I'm doing what I did back then.

55
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,970
Because it might help you recover your memories.

56
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,640
I'm going to eat a whole bowl of rice.

57
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,560
I know.

58
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,990
Go ahead and eat.

59
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,650
Aren't you going to eat, Eun Ho?

60
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,870
I have to film.

61
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,480
Since it's a scene where I'm having a late-night meal, I need to go with an empty stomach in order for it to work.

62
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,310
You know what ring this is, right?

63
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,580
I went through hell to find this,

64
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,550
and then you just disappeared.

65
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,820
You really found it?

66
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,240
After hearing what you said, I thought it was a lie.

67
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,980
Your food's getting cold. Hurry up and eat.

68
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,240
Eat it slowly.

69
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,430
My Eun Dong used to get indigestion very easily.

70
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,370
 Miss Writer, if you are with Eun Ho Hyung right now, can you send him to the filming site? 

71
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,490
 It's going crazy right now. I'm asking for your help.  

72
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,840
It's your manager. Hurry up and go! Why would you handle your work like this?

73
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,050
You said we should hurry up and leave.

74
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,910
It's such a waste. You're already late anyway.

75
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:36,460


76
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,810
  Subject: No subject 

77
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,460
Hello!

78
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,870
 Jae Ho! 

79
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,990
Yes, Doctor.

80
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,650
 What are you doing? 
 Tomorrow is Saturday.

81
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,790
Do you want to go on a picnic with my family and your family?

82
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,600
Thank you.

83
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,000
 - Hello?  
- Yes.

84
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,220
I think the weather is supposed to be good tomorrow, so let's go together. I'll pack lunch.

85
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,400
Do you think we can do that?

86
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,190
  ♫ Your everything that made my breath stop ♫ 

87
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,890
Jae Ho!  Did something happen?

88
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:23,350
Doctor...

89
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,710
 ♫ It seems like I won't be able to ♫ 

90
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,580
 Jung Eun is 
♫ Cry again ♫ 

91
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,460
with another man.

92
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,450
 But... 

93
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:47,090
 I feel like I am going crazy. 

94
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:53,690
But I can't hate Jung Eun.

95
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:59,480
 ♫ It seems like I won't come again ♫  

96
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:07,390
I think I'll sleep well tonight.

97
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,940
Go on.

98
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,890
- You go in first. 
 - Yeah.

99
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:21,450
Yeah, go back safely.

100
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:27,990
 ♫ It seems like I won't ever see you again ♫ 

101
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:35,480
 ♫ You, who pretended not to notice,  try to endure it ♫ 

102
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:42,330
 ♫ Just as you were all those times, the image of you ♫ 

103
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:49,240
 ♫ Is like starlight to me ♫ 

104
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,900
♫   After much time has passed   ♫

105
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:03,230
 ♫ When you shed painful tears in front of me, ♫ 

106
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:09,700
 ♫ I asked if you were okay and we both held each other ♫ 

107
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:18,450
♫   It tells the time in which we  were not together   ♫

108
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,460
 ♫ That time ♫  

109
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,800
Do you like me?

110
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,180
Do you? Why are you doing this—

111
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,890
That man...

112
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,920
Throw him away.

113
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,400
He doesn't love you.

114
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,790
Do you know you've gone over the line?

115
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,640
I don't like you changing because of him.

116
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,150
I'll be the bad guy, instead. I'll

117
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,040
get dirty, instead.

118
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,430
You can just pretend you don't see any of it.

119
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,040
You must have fallen for me as a woman.

120
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,760
I am sorry.

121
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,610
Don't like me.

122
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,030
Just because I sleep with you, doesn't mean I like you.

123
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,010
I am aware of that.

124
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,460
I won't see you for a while.

125
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,380
I am only going to focus on work.

126
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,940
You may leave.

127
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:56,480


128
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,380
You don't have to work at the store tomorrow, right?

129
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,050
Let's go to Lake Park with Doctor Park Hyun Ah's family.

130
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,910
Tomorrow?

131
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,700
Yes, tomorrow.

132
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,290
Okay, let's do that.

133
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,840
Let's just go, not think about anything, and have a good time.

134
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,440
I'm excited.

135
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,440
Hyung!

136
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,170
Hyung! After changing location to the Southern Sea because of the storm on Jeju Island,

137
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,350
they're going nuts over there trying to find a place to film.

138
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,000
They said to wait for updates.

139
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,560
You heard what I said, right?

140
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,210
By any chance, did you meet with the writer?

141
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,500
You need to be careful. Even one photo could end your career.

142
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,580
So that means we're not filming today?

143
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,430
The weather is great!

144
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,460
It would be great to go on a picnic on a day like this,

145
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,460
eat some Kimbap, eat some chicken,

146
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,000
and run around as much as I want.

147
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,450
How nice would that be?

148
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,370
It's not like you guys are kids.

149
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,100
- Where are you going, Hyung? 
- Don't look for me!

150
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,480
Yeah?

151
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,990
Hello, Ahjusshi!

152
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,800
Ra Il, you might fall. Be careful!

153
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,540
- Hello! 
- Hello.

154
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,740
You are getting it on your dad. Ra Il, get in the car first.

155
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,530
Okay!

156
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,550
  Don't do that to Dad. 

157
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,160
Ra Il, hurry and get in the car!

158
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,640
It's me. Let's meet.

159
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,070
 My filming today was moved. 

160
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,400
I need to go somewhere with my family right now.

161
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,570
- Come with me. 
- I can't.

162
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,900
I...

163
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,600
I need to be with you today.

164
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,700
I will call you back later.

165
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,350
- We're ready. 
- Ah, yes.

166
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,050
Be careful, Ra Il!

167
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:03,010
Wow! This place is really nice, Mom.

168
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,610
- Yeah. 
- Dad, let's go! 
- Yeah, thank you!

169
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,230
Hey, be careful, Choi Ra Il!

170
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,980
Don't run!

171
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,790
Hurry up, Dad!

172
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,530
Wow!

173
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,000
- Hey, Choi Ra Il! 
- What?

174
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,600
 Ji Eun Ho 

175
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,800
- Hello? 
- I want to see you.

176
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:10,590
 I'm in the parking lot. I'll be waiting. 

177
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,470
Jung Eun, hurry up and come!

178
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,940
Oh, I need to go somewhere for a minute.

179
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,310
I'll be back soon.

180
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,470
Jung Eun.

181
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,450
Ra Il!

182
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:57,580


183
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,030
- Hello, Ra Il.
- Hello!

184
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,530
- You've come? 
- The weather is nice.

185
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:17,520
You're right. But where is Jung Eun?

186
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,110
She said she needed to go somewhere quickly.

187
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,880
She'll come.

188
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,260
Yes, shall we go?

189
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,130
Mi Na!

190
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,820
- This smells nice. Smell it.
- Yeah, it's nice.

191
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,090
Let's go over there!

192
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:51,420
Do you know what I want to do first, once I start walking again?

193
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,420
Walk around the whole day, barefoot.

194
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,290
Walk until my feet start to bleed.

195
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,450
Jae Ho, I'm positive you're going to walk again.

196
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,710
If I can stand up and walk,

197
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,090
will Jung Eun come back?

198
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:16,980
If that could be possible, I would even sell my soul.

199
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:23,360
On the day of Mi Na's father's funeral,

200
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:28,490
the only person from my family that came was my brother.

201
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,440
When I was going through with a marriage that my whole family was against,

202
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,590
the only one who supported me was my brother.

203
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,530
We're very close, we siblings.

204
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,370
But that brother of mine is deep in love right now.

205
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,670
I need to support him,

206
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,210
but it's not easy.

207
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,960
- Why not? 
- Because it's selfish.

208
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:00,130
 He doesn't seem to care at all 

209
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,270
 whether or not other people get hurt. 

210
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,580
It seems like that happens to everybody when they're in love.

211
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,600
I understand your brother.

212
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,110
Jung Eun,

213
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,640
it doesn't look like she's coming back, right?

214
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,180
 I wanted to do many things with Eun Dong. 

215
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,830
I thought, once I found her,

216
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,100
I wanted to go everywhere, holding her hand.

217
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,630
Go on dates with each other

218
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,750
and travel together. But...

219
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,940
I became too famous.

220
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:07,500
That's why I bought this villa, so we can run around and play together.

221
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:13,870
Because of Eun Dong, I became a person. Because of Eun Dong, I became an actor.

222
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,910
Because of Eun Dong, I bought this villa.

223
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:22,560
My life is all about Eun Dong.

224
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,310
I waited for ten years. Waiting is not

225
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:37,530
that hard for me to do. The problem is,

226
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,080
even after I wait and wait,

227
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,460
if you don't come back as Ji Eun Dong,

228
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,840
I'm going to see you as Seo Jung Eun.

229
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,580
Just...

230
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,550
you and I, as we are in the present,

231
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,900
as you and I are right now,

232
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,220
I plan to start over again.

233
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,800
How did you know that I knew...

234
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,430
That I knew I was Ji Eun Dong.

235
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,850
How did you know?

236
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,470
When you accepted the money I gave you without any complaints...

237
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:58,430
How did  you  know that you were Eun Dong?

238
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,920
My heart.

239
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,570
My heart jumps

240
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,610
whenever I see you.

241
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,060
But Ji Eun Ho,

242
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:27,920
meeting you and talking with you like this,

243
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,830
I want to stop. No, we need to stop doing this.

244
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,970
Ji Eun Ho, even if you happened to be a man who had absolutely no history with me,

245
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,160
without a doubt, you're a man who would still make my heart waver.

246
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,940
So...

247
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,710
No more.

248
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,810
Whether I have memories of my past or not,

249
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,550
I'm my husband's wife,

250
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,950
and I'm my son's mother.
♫   I'm keeping you in my heart  ♫

251
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,990
♫   I'm keeping you in my heart  ♫

252
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,630
♫   So you remain with me  ♫

253
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,420
Do you love your husband?
♫   So you remain with me  ♫

254
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:08,610
Do you love your husband?
♫   It will never change , my overpowering love  ♫

255
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,830
♫   It will never change , my overpowering love  ♫

256
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,370
♫   Me, who smiles when I see you  ♫

257
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,190
♫   If I could see you then I could finally breathe  ♫

258
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,780
Yes.
 ♫   Me, who breathes for you   ♫

259
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,670
♫   Me, who breathes for you  ♫

260
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,290
This is the end for us.
♫   Me, who breathes for you  ♫

261
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,360
This is the end for us.
♫   I'm looking only for you  ♫

262
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,500
♫  That's what my heart is like   ♫

263
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,300
Don't contact or meet me.
♫  That's what my heart is like   ♫

264
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,540
♫  I loved so much, I went to find you   ♫

265
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:40,280
Hey! You're always like this.

266
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,620
Then you shouldn't have come out in the first place!

267
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,250
Now that I think about it, you played with me that time.

268
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:52,710
You shook my heart and then suddenly disappeared!

269
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,300
I'm sorry.

270
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,490
If not, at least you should be living well.

271
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:01,910
Live well so that I could just give you up!

272
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,630
 You left me to live like that? 

273
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,590
You ruined my heart and now what?

274
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,640
"Don't contact me or meet me"?

275
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,340
- What do you want? 
- What?

276
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,890
 What is it that you want? 

277
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,730
Are you saying you want to date me?

278
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:26,320
Do you want to live your life secretly dating a woman like me who has a husband and a child?

279
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,660
There's no way.

280
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,340
You need to face hardships like me!

281
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,700
You have to struggle as much as I did!

282
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,090
You have to look at me until it becomes so difficult that you feel like you're going to die!

283
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:53,700
♫  My heart is still ever with you  ♫

284
00:31:53,700 --> 00:32:02,180
♫  Even if I can't catch you, my love will only flourish  ♫

285
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:12,340
♫   I only smile when I see you, I only breathe because of you   ♫

286
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:19,700
♫   I'm looking only for you, that's what my heart is like   ♫

287
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,270
You should have told me sooner.

288
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,640
As you can see, everything is being taken care of.

289
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,230
Ra Il!

290
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,800
 Mom! 

291
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,900
You came?

292
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,510
Yes.

293
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,290
Hi Mi Na.

294
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,190
Hello.

295
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,390
Honey, you came.

296
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,090
I told you I would come.

297
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,590
Ra Il, did you eat a lot? Should I give you some fruit, too?

298
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,290
Hold on for just one second. I'll peel it for you.

299
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,860
Eat this. Should I give one to you, too, Mi Na?

300
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,900
Yes.

301
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,670
 Okay. 

302
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,860
How could you not show a glimpse of the fact that you raised Jung Eun?

303
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,640
Is Son-in-law Choi your son?

304
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,000
How can you only feel sorry for Jae Ho and not see what a sad situation your daughter is in?

305
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,100
Won't you shut it?

306
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,280
If that man still hasn't given up on our Jung Eun,

307
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,940
then I need to rethink this.

308
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,130
What are you saying?

309
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,190
I saw an article the other day, and

310
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,470
it said that actor makes ₩1 billion  just from making one commercial!

311
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,110
Even though he became that successful, he still lived his life waiting only for our Jung Eun.

312
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,490
Stop talking trash. You're becoming crazy over the money.

313
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,690
That's not what I'm saying right now!

314
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,690
If he hadn't become successful, but still waited for Jung Eun this long,

315
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,550
do you think you would've said that same nonsense about it being true love?

316
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:13,170
What? You don't want to see her struggle? So what?

317
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:16,820
That man may be the one Jung Eun is supposed to be with.

318
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,880
The book Jung Eun wrote,

319
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,920
read at least five pages. I'm begging you.

320
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,300
I'm going to pretend like I never heard you.

321
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,720
I know, right? No, I was just wondering.

322
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,330
The drama has been doing so well, so I was just asking.

323
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:41,700
Ji Eun Ho has no slump. I mean, when someone has such a wide range of talents...

324
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,480
Hyung-nim.

325
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,590
 Come to the pig skin restaurant today. I'm going to get drunk tonight. 

326
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:53,240
Ah yes, let's go eat beef intestines sometime soon. I found someplace amazing.

327
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,660
Okay. Bye.

328
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,310
Get the car.

329
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:17,460


330
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,800
Ra Il, open the door for me.

331
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,540
Okay!

332
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,030
Auntie!

333
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,300
- Hello!
- Ra Il!

334
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,650
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

335
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:34,200
Thank you!

336
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,280
Unni, you came?

337
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,330
- You came? 
- Oh Jae Ho! Have you been well?

338
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,830
Wow, your hair grew so much!

339
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,900
I'm sorry. My salon has been so busy lately.

340
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,660
No, it's fine. You've been doing well, right?

341
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,440
Yes.

342
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,300
I feel sorry.

343
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,470
Don't say sad things like that!

344
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,460
Jae Ho.

345
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,740
Yes?

346
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:59,600
I think our country is the best in the whole world.

347
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,100
Why?

348
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:06,160
We have four seasons that distinctly and truly feel like four seasons. Is there a country better than this one?

349
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,120
Of course. It's nice.

350
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,070
The cicadas, too. The sound of our nation's cicadas singing is strong and clear.

351
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,990
American cicadas are pretty amazing too.

352
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,450
Is that so? I haven't gone to America in the summer.

353
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,040
Don't you want to go back to America?

354
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,320
No, I like it here right now.

355
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,520
It's nice here.

356
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,280
 Wow! 

357
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,640
I'm sorry. Please don't take photos.

358
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,720
I'm sorry. Please don't take photos.

359
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,970
- I'm sorry. Please don't take photos.
- Aigoo.

360
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,080
He drank a lot again.

361
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,740
Ahjumma, please bring us more drinks

362
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,080
and please change the pan.

363
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,020
Hey, I'm here!

364
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:11,860
Look me in the eye like a human being.  What is going on here?

365
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,970
What kind of friends are we?

366
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:21,430
I'm the one who made you into a person. Don't ever forget that.

367
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:24,770
Don't say that crap, you crazy bastard.

368
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:28,890
Hey, when I hear curse words from you, I feel comforted.

369
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,090
I feel like a shallow pervert.

370
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,400
 I'm sorry. 

371
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:36,660
Ahh...I feel lonely.

372
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:52,600
I'm so lonely, I think I'm going crazy.

373
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,470
I'm so lonely, I can't express it in words.

374
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:04,210
You think you're the only lonely one? I'm lonely, too.

375
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:08,350
Every morning, a black crow cries in my heart.  Caw, caw .

376
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:12,510
Hyung, everyone is lonely.

377
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,500
Hey. Should I just

378
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,180
marry and have a kid and live with Seo Ryeong?

379
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,420
She's the daughter of the Yong Seong Group.

380
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,930
Should I just quit everything

381
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:34,870
and live the rest of my life traveling to different places?

382
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:40,650
Of course! That's the way! You finally came to your senses with some alcohol in you.

383
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:48,910
I feel lonely.  Too lonely.

384
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,660
You know I married my sweetheart and we've been living together.

385
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,380
Honestly, as life goes on, I've become lonelier.

386
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,140
On days like this, you need memories of your first love.

387
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:05,100
But since my wife was my first love, I have no memories, only hell.

388
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:09,240
Same thing. If you had married Eun Dong, it would have been horrible.

389
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,090
That's right. That's probably true.

390
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:22,050
I would've had to fight to death and we'd have been living that.

391
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,270
But...

392
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,300
I still would like to try living a life with her, even if it is like that.

393
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:40,100
Even if that place was hell, I still wish I could have

394
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,310
lived with her like that, together amidst all the chaos.

395
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,270
This is like a gae-kkot (fake chamomile = an azalea flower that looks  edible but is actually poisonous if consumed).

396
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,400
Why is my life so crappy?

397
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:59,850
I mean, why can't she recognize me?

398
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:03,650
How could she have another man's child and live with him?

399
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:07,360
My love hasn't ended yet.

400
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,300
I mean, if she was going to do that, she should have put an end to it before disappearing like that.

401
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,870
But...

402
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,260
Why...

403
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,590
Why is she still so pretty?

404
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,070
- Dad! 
- Yeah?

405
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,870
About Auntie Mi Soon and Mom.

406
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,990
Yeah?

407
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,210
They're really close even though they're not siblings, right?

408
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,390
Right?

409
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:01,410
But, they say that people who made a lot of friends like that, succeeded.

410
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,980
Like the fairy tale you read to me last night?

411
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,550
That's right!

412
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,520
There.

413
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,570
You caught it with both your hands, Dad!

414
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,840
Wow! I caught it with both of my hands!

415
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,580
Yeah!

416
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:25,380
My dad caught a ball for the first time!

417
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,650
Woo hoo!

418
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,150
Oh, it looks delicious.

419
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:39,190
Mmm! Yeah!

420
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:42,660
Do you remember how you made this for me

421
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,830
when we met in the States for the first time?

422
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:51,700
I thought to myself, who is this person, an angel like no other?

423
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,320
How long has it been since then?

424
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,910
I want to go back to that time.

425
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,310
I don't know whether I was doing the right thing

426
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,540
to you, or not.

427
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,260
What?

428
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,610
Ji Eun Ho's autobiography... Me recommending you as a ghostwriter...

429
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,260
Unni...

430
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:25,730
I know. I heard it all.

431
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,750
Unni...

432
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:41,260
Unni... I...

433
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,660
What do I do now?

434
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,050
I'm going crazy because I love him so much.

435
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:56,720
I feel like I'm really going to go crazy.

436
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,830
My heart feels like it's going to burst at the thought of him.

437
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:06,220
It's getting hard for me to just get through the day.

438
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:16,470
When he's by my side, he comes right into my heart.

439
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:20,060
He just walks right in without even thinking about knocking.

440
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:25,570
I really like that feeling.

441
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:29,180
What should we do? Jung Eun!

442
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,600
What do you do now?

443
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:39,090
What are the two of you going to do now?

444
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,930
Jung Eun.

445
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:12,210
Can you come home tomorrow?

446
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,850
Alright.

447
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,790
Please come to your senses, Hyung!

448
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:32,860
I'm completely fine.

449
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,920
- Hey...
- Oh!

450
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,230
Oh, salute!

451
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:45,260
Hey, open the door!

452
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,830
 I'll do it! 

453
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,390
Well then, have a good night.

454
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:10,160
But... What smell is this?

455
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,220
I'm making an extract consisting of red ginseng, balloon flower roots, jujube, and ginger.

456
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,080
He's in the middle of a film production right now, isn't he?

457
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,160
The goal is recovery and restoration of both his vocal cords and energy.

458
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,280
Ahh...

459
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:24,120
What is the extent

460
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,330
of your duty? Do you by any chance, for our Hyun Soo—

461
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:30,850
No, our Eun Ho, do you happen to do things like

462
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:34,920
take his clothes off or wash his feet?

463
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,700
My main duties are to care for my employer's health

464
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,980
and help him maintain a happy daily life

465
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:45,360
by providing regular meals and a comfortable residential environment.

466
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,860
Absolutely no physical contact is involved!

467
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,620
In addition! For me, fundamentally speaking,

468
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:57,280
I don't treat people that become a completely wasted mess after chugging down large amounts of alcohol,

469
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,270
as human. Now then...

470
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:05,180
You're saying that you'll treat him like a human when the alcohol wears off, right?

471
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,240
Please make him some hangover soup when he wakes up tomorrow.

472
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,160
He has a filming scheduled very early tomorrow morning.

473
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,890
Of course!  Once he's back to being human, I'll treat him accordingly.

474
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:18,790
Right now it's difficult for me to stand seeing you two as well.

475
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:22,310
You look like something halfway between human and "dduk" (=rice cake; a.k.a. a completely sticky mess).

476
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:24,900
I think it would be best if you hurry on home.

477
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,740
Now then...

478
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,590
Stay well.

479
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:38,810
  Hope Baseball Team "Eclipse"

00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:40,830
I am sorry to make you prepare this in a hurry.

481
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,070
No, it's okay.

482
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:46,060
Come in.

483
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,210
We've agreed to make the final decision tomorrow. The chairman signed off on it as well.

484
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:03,800
Yes.

485
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,910
Get familiarized with this side of the business. You've expressed interest in it before.

486
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,480
Yes.

487
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,160
Do you know Choi Jae Ho?

488
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,950
You know, the unlucky pitcher who got into an auto accident right after he was scouted by the Major Leagues?

489
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:22,200
- That person is— 
- I know. It's not for a personal goal.

490
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:27,070
I thought of it while working on some strategic planning for the launching of CNK.

491
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,360
I'm thinking about sponsoring a baseball team for players with disabilities.

492
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:34,480
It would be CNK sponsoring it, not the company.

493
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,870
- Is it off the record? 
- No.

494
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:42,580
We need to call the press and let them know. I'm really planning to go through with it.

495
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,940
Because, you know, it would be considered good work.

496
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,640
Yes.

497
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,270
Do you happen to know what Ji Eun Ho is doing right now?

498
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:55,430


499
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,240
Come on in.

500
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,170
Come in.

501
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,730
Let's go upstairs.

502
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,240
 Open it. 

503
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,820
 Everything will be in here. 

504
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:05,330
I don't know if I'm doing a good thing.

505
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,070
  Whenever I think of you, 

506
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:54,360
 it feels like my heart 

507
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,730
  is cramping. 

508
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:59,900
  Your hair pin is pretty. 

509
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,110
  Your hair pin is pretty. 

510
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,400
  Thanks for the shoes. 

511
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,610
  I will wear these shoes until I turn twenty years old. 

512
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:26,350
  Are you going to keep living like a little kid? 

513
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,960
  You have to grow. 

514
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:43,680
  How can I find you? 

515
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,740
  If I have to find you, 

516
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:49,750
  how can I find you? 

517
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,490
  222 Modern Korean Poems That You Must Read 

518
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:23,900
  During that time when both you and I were wandering souls, 

519
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:29,430
  we met as one, in a seed of grass, and made flowers bloom across the field as if we had been sown as such. 

520
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:31,810
  The beautiful days were short 

521
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:36,410
  and I could not forget the broad wind and sky  during the time of wandering. 

522
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:39,530
  It was you who first began to leave my side, 

523
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:43,820
  and I was lost for a long time in that place that had neither you nor I. 

524
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,470
  Time passed, 

525
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:50,400
  and I too flow endlessly in the same way. 

526
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:54,360
  After coming back to this place, where we met each other long ago, 

527
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:59,700
  in the midst of the fall sunlight, a softly printed footprint, 

528
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,500
  somebody was waiting there, holding flowers. 

529
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,840
  A single trace that has slowly been disappearing, 

530
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:09,270
  it was abandoned in the direction facing the path I used to take. 

531
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:17,520
  Lately I have another wish. 

532
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:22,510
  At first, my one wish was to find Mom, but now I have  one more. 

533
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:27,160
  It's very embarrassing, but my wish  

534
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,700
  is to marry Hyun Soo. 

535
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,660
  I have to grow up quickly. 

536
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:35,450
  When will I become an adult? 

537
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:39,740
  When I see him, my heart begins to thump 

538
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:42,870
  and my face becomes hot. 

539
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:47,100
  I wonder if he wants to marry me as well? 

540
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,180
  I waited, waited, 

541
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:54,760
  and waited, but if you don't come back as Ji Eun Dong, 

542
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,100
 I'm going to see you 

543
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,500
  as Seo Jung Eun. 

544
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,650
  Just 

545
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:08,570
  you and I, as we are in the present—as you and I are right now, 

546
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:11,020
  I plan to start over again. 

547
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,250
I don't remember anything about yesterday.

548
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,810
How did I get home?

549
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:09,180
When did my toenails get this long?

550
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,120
Seriously...

551
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:30,270
I don't even remember coming back home. I stopped drinking...

552
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:33,870
How did I get here?

553
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:36,920
 Oppa! 

554
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,040
 I told you not to cut your toenails while eating food. 

555
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,410
 Seriously. 

556
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,250
 You spent a lot of money this month. 

557
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:49,420
 If you do that again next month, I'm going to kill you. 

558
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:58,590
 Oppa, this toothbrush is yours and this one is mine! Stop using mine! 

559
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,240
 This t-shirt got stretched out again! 

560
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,540
 Oppa! 

561
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,650
 I told you not to stretch the neck when you put it on! 

562
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:13,290
 What is this, again! 

563
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,760
 Seriously, you always do this. 

564
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:23,010
♫  No matter how much I try to hold back,   ♫

565
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:26,920
 If you tell me to make hangover soup when I'm sleeping one more time, seriously! 

566
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:36,610
♫  I cry out everything to you   ♫

567
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:45,960
♫   I see you, I see you like this in front of me  ♫

568
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:52,220
♫   You are there in front of me unchanged as ever  ♫

569
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:59,380
♫   I hear you, I hear you everywhere and in my dreams  ♫

570
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,300
♫   I can hear your voice and breathing,  ♫

571
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:10,620
♫   Which I couldn't hear before  ♫

572
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:18,170
♫   Can I go to you now? I want to go to you now   ♫

573
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:25,930
♫   Can you take a step toward me if you can   ♫

574
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:32,500
♫   Hear me?  ♫

575
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,210
♫   Do you hear me if I miss you more?  ♫

576
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:41,050
♫   Do you hear me if I miss you more?  ♫

577
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:48,240
  Can you briefly stop by the hospital tomorrow? 

578
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,650
Go back in.

579
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:13,430
See you later.

580
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:16,290
Okay, I'll be back.

581
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:30,910
Jae Ho.

582
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:34,330
You look good in the suit.

583
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:38,430
So you decided to meet your sponsor today?

584
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:40,630
Yes, I just want to meet for now and hear what they they have to say.

585
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,740
It was such a sudden proposition, so it's still hard to believe.

586
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,200
Things turned out so well.

587
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,570
You now have some strength in your legs. We need to have a party.

588
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,260
 Hyung, we arrived. 

589
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:01,000
 You only have an hour. 

590
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:39,440


591
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,240
  Seo Jung Eun is my wife. 

592
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,140
 - Don't shake up that man's family.
- Can that man  sleep with a woman? 

593
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:59,070
  You, when did you improve this much? 

594
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:01,360
 - Where do you think I am?
- Where are you? 

595
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,790
  We have to end Ji Eun Ho and Seo Jung Eun's wretched fate. 

596
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:05,910
  I can trust you, right? 

597
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:09,030
  Let's go till the end, until one of us dies. 

598
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:10,570
  You are going to come with me to the event, right? 

599
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:12,840
  I already told you that I can't give you up. 

600
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,360
  If that's why, you are making a mistake. 

601
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:19,420
  I will play fairly. I will not wait any more. 

602
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,420
  Hyun Soo Oppa... 

603
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,030
  Oppa... 

604
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:25,870
  Eun Dong!
