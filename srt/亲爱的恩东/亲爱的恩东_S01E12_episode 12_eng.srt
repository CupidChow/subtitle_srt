1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,940


2
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,480
 My heart felt like it was cramping up every time I saw Oppa, 

3
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,720
 but now that I can't see Oppa any more, 

4
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,960
 it feels like a lump forming in my heart. It's painful and suffocating. 

5
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,740
 When will I be able to see him again? 

6
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,700
 - Eun Dong, let's go. 
- Yes. 

7
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,340
 Oppa, you have to wait until I find you. 

8
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,920
 Hyun Soo Oppa and I will definitely meet again, 

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,320
 because I can recognize Oppa just by looking at his warm back. 

10
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,620
 I have to make sure everything returns to its rightful place. 

11
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,900
Did you sleep well?

12
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,540
 I'm going to live for that person. I'm only going to do things to make that person happy. 

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,260
 I'm only going to think about that. 

14
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,620
 My Love Eun Dong 
Episode 12 

15
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,520
 Oppa, don't call me. I'll call you back later. 

16
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,980
 Hello? Who are you? 

17
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,660
 Who are you to be so freely calling someone else's wife like this? 

18
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,640
 I definitely warned you 

19
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,820
 that I won't leave you alone if you linger around my wife one more time! 

20
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,600
 I want to have a child. 

21
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,520
 I need something to tie Jung Eun and I together. I don't have that something. 

22
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,940
Hi Dr. Lee, it's me,  Park Hyun Ah from neurology.

23
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,640
 Choi Ra Il (10) 
Park Hyun Ah (36)  

24
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,960
 I wanted to ask you for a favor. 

25
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,720
 Hey, you! See that, yah! 

26
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,840
Ra Il, who are you planning to give that potted plant to?

27
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,320
My dad.

28
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,780
Oh, is that so?

29
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,700
Yes. I hope that good luck comes to my dad.

30
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,180
You told me that this flower brings good luck.

31
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,140
Yes, I did. What kind of good luck do you want to come to your dad?

32
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,660
I want to play baseball with my dad.

33
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,660
My dad was our nation's best pitcher.

34
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,580
He told me that he'll teach me how throw a straight ball  when he's able to walk again.

35
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,380
Bam!

36
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,940
It will definitely happen.

37
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,920
My premonitions have never been wrong.

38
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,400
Thank you.

39
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,780
What are you thankful for?

40
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,240
Since you did so many good things.

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,400
This little guy.

42
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,080
 - You like it?    
 - Hahaha.

43
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,540
 Ah, rock, paper, scissors. 

44
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,100
Oh, Ra Il.

45
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,580
Are you almost here?

46
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,840
Okay, I'll be downstairs.

47
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,340
I'll go downstairs for a moment to pick up Ra Il.

48
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,360
I'm sorry.

49
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,660
Dad!

50
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,420
- Did you have fun? 
- Yeah.

51
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,040
Dad, Grandfather gave me this flowerpot, too.

52
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,340
He said you would be able to walk again if we raise this well.

53
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,980
- Really? 
- Yeah.

54
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,340
- Hello.
- Yes.

55
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,860
- Mi Na, hello. 
- Hello.

56
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,660
I'm worried that he acted up or something.

57
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,940
Aigoo, what are you saying?

58
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,920
He has very good manners and there weren't any wrinkles at all. You've raised him very well.

59
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,360
Thank you.

60
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,540
- Wow, you made this by yourself? 
- Yeah.

61
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,940
Wow, you're amazing.

62
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,020
 Hello? 

63
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,280
Come out.

64
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,500
Oppa.

65
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,600
Come out before I charge in.

66
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,240
 Oppa, don't be like this. 

67
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,140
Let's talk tomorrow. I'll call you tomorrow.

68
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,940
No, I need to see you right now.

69
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,440
Come out before I go in!

70
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,780
- Is it good? 
- Yeah.

71
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,540
Did you cry?

72
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,900
No.

73
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,700
What do you mean  no? 

74
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,860
Is that guy harassing you? Is he?

75
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,340
I guess there's nothing left for him to do but cause you trouble now that he knows you're meeting up with me.

76
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,060
It's definitely not anything like that, Oppa.

77
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,080
Hey.

78
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,400
What is this?

79
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,840
Did you get hurt?

80
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,740
Ra Il.

81
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,580
Mom wants to play hide-and-seek with you.

82
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,680
She's hiding somewhere right now.

83
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,100
- Can you go find her? 
- Really?

84
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,900
Where?

85
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,380
Over there. You see the black car over there, right?

86
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,940
She's hiding in that car.

87
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,860
Have a good day.

88
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,980
Oh my, it's Ji Eun Ho!

89
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,560
Oh my, Ji Eun Ho!

90
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,260
Excuse me.

91
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,880
Please give me some bandages and antisepticâ€”and an ointment to prevent scarring.

92
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,920
Did you get hurt somewhere?

93
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,260
It's not me that got hurt. Please hurry.

94
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,280
Ah, yes.

95
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,900
Ji Eun Ho, could I get an autograph?

96
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,460
Yes.

97
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,340
Do you have any paper?

98
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,200
Ah, on my back. Please make it big.

99
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,860
Here.

100
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,040
 Me too. On my back please. 

101
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,640
Okay.

102
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,560
But, who got hurt?

103
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,990
Please just hurry and wrap it all up. How much is it?

104
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,360
 My Son 

105
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,450
Ra Il.

106
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,860
 Mom, whose car is this? 

107
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,480
You thought I wouldn't be able to find you?

108
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,540
I found you!

109
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,880
 Dong Gyu 

110
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,600
What do you want?

111
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,900
Going to that man?

112
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,640
Go.

113
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,230
But you can't take Ra Il.

114
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,010
Ra Il is my son.

115
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,280
Pick it up.

116
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,230
- It's okay. 
- Pick it up!

117
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,360
Hello?

118
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,700
Give him the phone.

119
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,620
 Give your husband the phone. 

120
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,940
Oppa, let's talk later.

121
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,440
Give it to him before I charge in.

122
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,530
Talk.

123
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,430
Don't let that woman get hurt.

124
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,470
If you let her get hurt one more time,

125
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,740
I'll kill you.

126
00:12:53,390 --> 00:13:01,110


127
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,950
Oh, did the results come in, Dr. Lee?

128
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,580
 Doctor, you must have dozed off during genetics class. 

129
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:23,800
 The hair samples... Choi Ra Il, age 10, is a male and Park Hyun Ah, age 36, is a female. 

130
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,750
Ah, that's right.

131
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,060
Testing for the "Y" chromosome.

132
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,190
 You definitely dozed off. 

133
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,940
 A female relative such as a maternal or paternal aunt can't be used. 

134
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,660
You're right.

135
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,030
How about the grandfather?  That would work, right?

136
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,990
 Yeah, that's right. 

137
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,020
Oh okay, thanks.

138
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,620
Eun Ho.

139
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,340
Is Ji Eun Ho not here?

140
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,240
Just a moment please.

141
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,930
 This caller cannot be reached. 

142
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,040
 Eun Ho Hyung 

143
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,680
Ah, Hyung, what the heck?

144
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,280
What? Your younger sister suddenly collapsed?

145
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,730
Aigoo, I didn't even know that and...

146
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,160
Yes.

147
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,870
The director?

148
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,150
I will make sure to pass it on to him.

149
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:43,040
Acute gastroenteritis? You mean where you're like throwing up, having diarrhea, and all that madnâ€”

150
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,420
Director, that isn't it.

151
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,270
His younger sister collapsed? Due to acute gastroenteritis?

152
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,710
Ah so that's why an actor brother is taking care of his doctor younger sister.

153
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,410
Since she's a neurologist, I think she doesn't really know internal medicine very well.

154
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,980
Ji Eun Ho will just end in one shot if he acts like this.

155
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,940
 Do you think there's a permanent number one in this field? 

156
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,480
You see...

157
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:20,620
I've witnessed many an actor having their career end.

158
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,240
The fame and reputation that they spent ten years fighting for, just collapsing altogether within a mere ten minutes.

159
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,250
It's nothing in this field.

160
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,090
Understand? He's coming to the final episode  celebration, right?

161
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,450
Aigoo, it's hot. But it's still quite cool here.

162
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,450
You've come?

163
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,090
Chief Jo.

164
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,910
What? Did you think I wouldn't be able to do  it?

165
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,730
This doesn't make sense.

166
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,720
It's not like you. Why are you doing this?

167
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,960
Ji Eun Ho can't do that movie.

168
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,200
I'm just telling you beforehand.

169
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,920
The more you act like this, the less likely you'll be able to capture Eun Ho's heart.

170
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,320
I'm changing my strategy.

171
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,490
I'm going to make that man kneel in front of me.

172
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,830
Ji Eun Ho won't collapse easily.

173
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,490
What move do you think will make him cave in?

174
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:22,050
I know that he won't break easily.

175
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,480
I'm going to have DM Entertainment undergo a search and seizure.

176
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,870
You know, when President Hwang's gambling scandal went public, everything I worked so hard for completely fell apart.

177
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,740
- Chief Jo!
- The corruption cases in the entertainment management business will be revealed soon.

178
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,730
And at the same time, entertainment companies will be searched and seized as well.

179
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,930
Of course, DM Entertainment is one of them.

180
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,980
Come out of there, President Lee. You should avoid the rain.

181
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,470
So, if I come here,

182
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,370
you're going to make Eun Ho, no Hyun Soo, get hit by that rain?

183
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,380
Yes. That's my goal.

184
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,280
I want to end everything for him. After he loses friends, women, and his name,

185
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,000
then...

186
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,450
He might be able to see me.

187
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,840
 I'll take Ra Il with me. 

188
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,040
On whose will?

189
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,160
Jae Ho.

190
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,020
I...

191
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,140
will really destroy that asshole.

192
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,820
You will see it happening in front of your eyes.

193
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,800
And you...

194
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,220
will live the rest of your life suffering, next to me.

195
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,020
You stole my entire life.

196
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,940
What you did was worse than what I've done to you.

197
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,980
You did worse to me.

198
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,780
Before that punk showed up,

199
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,480
your choice was me.

200
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,920
No, I

201
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,840
never loved you.

202
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,040
Not even once

203
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,080
have I ever loved you.

204
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,880
The man I loved

205
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,220
was only Park Hyun Soo.

206
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,340
We should have never met each other.

207
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,720
Seo Jung Eun.

208
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,820
You made me this way.

209
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,440
The person who made you this way

210
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,880
is your own self, not me.

211
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,540
Did that dog bastard ask you to come with him?

212
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,400
Did he promise a big house and an expensive car?

213
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,360
A nice house, nice car,

214
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,320
I don't need any of that.

215
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,120
Did your heart race like this even when he didn't have anything?

216
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:51,040
Ten years ago, you were a man who had everything

217
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,380
and that man had nothing.

218
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,440
My choice back then was that man.

219
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,520
It is still the same now.

220
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,240
Ra Il...

221
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,380
 Do you have a new man?  

222
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,680
Tell me!

223
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,920
Is it like that, tell me!

224
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,940
Mom!

225
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,180
My son became crippled to save a person like you.

226
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,040
I feel so betrayed that it makes me  want to make your legs and body just like his.

227
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,300
  You make my son like that, and now you have a new man? 

228
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,660
  Get out! 

229
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,560
 Get out of this house right now!  

230
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,320
- Mom! 
 - Get out!

231
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,880
 Get out right now! Get out of this house right now!  

232
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,600
- Jung Eun! 
 - Get out!

233
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,540
Get out of my sight! Get out!

234
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,140
Get out!

235
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:06,220
Jung Eun! Jung Eun!

236
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,080
Thank you.

237
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,060
  - It's me.  
 - Yeah!

238
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,340
Yeah, Jae Ho.

239
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,700
Jung Eun left home.

240
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,260
There's a chance she might head over there.

241
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,140
I have a favor to ask. Please stay with Jung Eun.

242
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,780
I am looking for her now, but she even left her phone.

243
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,960
Okay, if she comes here, I call you right away.

244
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,440
Alright.

245
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,980
  Thank you. 

246
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,880
Ah, sorry I am late.

247
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,980
Father.

248
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,200
Your mom is here.

249
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,300
What about your brother? I heard the drama filming is finished. Did he say he's not coming?

250
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,840
Oppa's probably really busy.

251
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,680
What the...? He doesn't even have a woman, so how can he be all that busy?

252
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,520
Hey, don't you have any charming hoobae (younger associates) at your hospital?

253
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,540
Why, so you can set her up with Oppa?

254
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,400
Yeah. We shouldn't just leave him like that.

255
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,080
Aigoo, you know Oppa, so why do you say things like that Mom?

256
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,940
How about the only daughter of Myeong Sung Hotel...

257
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,220
Does he not have any feelings for her?

258
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,680
None!

259
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,860
Is that Eun Dong person wearing honey on her face or something?

260
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,140
How is it that your brother can't forget her and acts like that?

261
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,160
Ugh! Have you seen her face?

262
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,520
Uhm.

263
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,260
You saw her?

264
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,520
No, I haven't!

265
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,900
Excuse me, Father!

266
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,820
What?

267
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,180
Can you please give me a strand of your hair?

268
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,600
Why my hair?

269
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,360
Ah... They say it is needed for your health exam.

270
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,000
Ah, they say there's something to test.

271
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,240
What kind of test is it?

272
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,400
Just a simple test.

273
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,420
Oh, I saw Hyun Soo earlier.

274
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:14,840
I was dropping off Ra Il and saw Hyun Soo there in front of the apartment building.

275
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,000
Why would he be over there? You must have seen it wrong.

276
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:46,020


277
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,820
Excuse me!

278
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,820
I lost my phone. May make one phone call?

279
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,320
Yes.

280
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,260
Thank you.

281
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,440
Hello?

282
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,460
- Unni! 
 - Hey! 

283
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,280
 Where are you at?  

284
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,200
I heard you left home. Ra Il's father called me.

285
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,020
Unni.

286
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,760
Please come and get me.

287
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,300
What?

288
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,060
 Why couldn't I make contact with you all day? 

289
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,720
Why?

290
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,240
We are in serious situation now.

291
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,200
President Jo...

292
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,780
No, let's meet up and talk. Come to the office.

293
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,640
I have no energy now. Let's talk tomorrow.

294
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,720
What? I told you I have no energy now.

295
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,280
 I am not sure if I am doing the right thing, 

296
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,340
but I'm not going to regret my decision today.

297
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,480
I'll leave our Jung Eun in your hands for now.

298
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,500
Where are you at? I will go there.

299
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,180
Just tell me your address. I'll go there.

300
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,420
No, no. I'll go there.

301
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,620
What are you going to do?

302
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,240
Don't know.

303
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,600
What is really going on?

304
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,960
There is drama, just like I expected and braced myself for.

305
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,180
That's all.

306
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,200
Okay.

307
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,020
My grandmother's grave...

308
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,960
I miss my grandmother.

309
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,660
Hyun Soo Oppa, too.

310
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,780
To a young child who had nothing,

311
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,640
he was the entire world to me, that oppa.

312
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,640
I miss him.

313
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,180
He said he's coming here.

314
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,940
I called him.

315
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,460
Wait a moment.

316
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,880
 Jae Ho  

317
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,780
Hello?

318
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,480
Have you found Jung Eun?

319
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,740
 Ah yes, I found her and she's staying with me,  

320
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,160
  but she is a bit out of it right now. 

321
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,900
I'll just have her stay with me today.

322
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,680
Please bring her home.

323
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,600
Jae Ho, I'll just keep her here with me overnight, so don't worry too much.

324
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,820
I'll hang up now.

325
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,440
Ahooo, this is just too much.

326
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,640
Hello?

327
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,400
Father-in-law.

328
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,200
I think Jung Eun is planning on leaving me.

329
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,460
  Please help me like I helped you before. 

330
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,220
You are okay now because I testified in court for your incident.

331
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,280
You came to this position because of my help.

332
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,300
 So please help me.  

333
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,160
 Help me so Jung Eun will come back to me.   

334
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,140
Hey you, Jae Ho, are you nowâ€”

335
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,660
There is nothing more I can do now

336
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,060
other than become a coward.

337
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,260
Hello?

338
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,820
You said you'd help me with my homework, right?

339
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,180
I need that help now.

340
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,880
 Yes, Oppa. 

341
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,790
Come to my house later tonight.

342
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,410
You have clothes for women to wear at home, too, right? Bring those, too.

343
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,210
Oppa.

344
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:30,500
You are not to tell anyone about this, okay?

345
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,140
And...

346
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,370
And bring some women's undergarments, too.

347
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,540
You've come?

348
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,850
 No, stay there. We'll go out. 

349
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:04,510
â™«   Left in my heart so I can't forget you   â™«

350
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:10,030
 â™«  My hidden feelings for you â™« 

351
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:16,380
â™«   If you knew how empty I feel without you  â™«

352
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,990
Thank you. I'll come by sometime soon.

353
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:25,970
Aigoo, that would be just too much of an honor for me if you did so.

354
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:34,080
 â™«  You make my numbed heart flutter â™« 

355
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,510
â™«   I keep picturing your face  â™«

356
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,380
â™«   You keep crossing my mind  â™«

357
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,450
- I'll see you next time. 
- Ah, yes.
â™«   You keep crossing my mind  â™«

358
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,110
- I'll see you next time. 
- Ah, yes.
â™«   What should I do about this my swelling heart?  â™«

359
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,070
- Please be careful on your way. 
- Yes.
â™«   What should I do about this my swelling heart?  â™«

360
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:46,510
â™«   What should I do about this my swelling heart?  â™«

361
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:53,370
 â™«  I'm keeping you in my heart so you remain within me â™« 

362
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,900
We need to sterilize this first.

363
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:02,010
 â™«  My overpowering love â™« 

364
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:11,130
 â™«  Me, who smiles when I see you, me, who breathes because of you â™« 

365
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:17,850
 â™«  That's what my heart is like â™« 

366
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,270
Don't get hurt again.

367
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,810
It hurts me more

368
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,250
when you get hurt.

369
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:32,230
 â™« Remember me who has always kept
 a place in my heart for you â™« 

370
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:41,550
 â™«  My heart is still ever with you, only looking for you â™« 

371
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:48,850
â™«  It will never change, my overflowing love  â™«

372
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,650
Let's go.

373
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:59,230
 â™«  I breathe because of you â™« 

374
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:06,210
 â™« That heart of mine that yearns for you is like that â™« 

375
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,710
This is where I live.

376
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,150
My Oppa,

377
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:51,700
it feels good to see you living so well.

378
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,720
Really?

379
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,920
You... Did you eat?

380
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,670
It's your habit. You came to the restaurant earlier.

381
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:04,670
Ah, that's right.

382
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,870
I'll give you a tour of the house.

383
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:18,180
This is where I eat, always thinking of you.

384
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,160
This is where

385
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,480
I sleep, always thinking of you.

386
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:38,960
There are times that I drink and sleep in the living room, too.

387
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:44,280
And that place is where

388
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,430
I poop and wash, thinking of you.

389
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,410
This is where

390
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:05,970
I get fresh air, always thinking of you.

391
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,810
This is

392
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,010
the room that I had made, thinking of you.

393
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,800
I hope you like it.

394
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,340
Thank you, Oppa,

395
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,390
for waiting for me like this

396
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,750
and for living well.

397
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,010
Thank you,

398
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,520
for appearing in front of me like this again.

399
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,850
Oppa.

400
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,710
You're hungry, right?

401
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,710
Want me to make you something delicious?

402
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,320
- How did it go? 
- The two of them

403
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,190
are together right now.

404
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:29,060
The woman is at Ji Eun Ho's house right now.

405
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,000
- You can go. 
- That woman's husband...

406
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,490
- Are you going to tell him? 
- No.

407
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:42,850
If that husband goes to look for Ji Eun Ho,

408
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:48,350
Ji Eun Ho will really steal that woman. That's how he is.

409
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,110
That would be a move a lesser amateur would make.

410
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:00,440
Oh, it smells nice.

411
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,890
- Try it, Oppa. 
- Wow! It looks delicious.

412
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:10,990
Ramyun definitely tastes better when you eat it with the lid.

413
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,970
It's delicious! Delicious! Wow!

414
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,270
You aren't even going to ask me to try it?

415
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,380
You said you ate earlier.

416
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,940
Do you want to try it?

417
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,600
When was it that l called you?  Why now? Why not come tomorrow?

418
00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:00,450
Well, I felt like I needed to prepare my heart.

419
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,900
What about the clothes?

420
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,990
You...

421
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,880
You didn't tell anyone, right?

422
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,650
Okay, go.

423
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,380
 Yes? 

424
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,060
This...

425
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,540
You can change into these.

426
00:38:54,850 --> 00:39:00,170
I brought a few things so you can wear something comfortable. I don't know if they'll fit though.

427
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:10,510
I wonder if you'll be able to sleep since the light is a bit bright.

428
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,630
I should change it.

429
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,600
You know the bathroom is over there, right?

430
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,890
Sleep.

431
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,460
I'll go.

432
00:39:53,090 --> 00:40:01,090


433
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:06,890
 â™« As if we met yesterday â™« 

434
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:13,140
 â™« Not really needing to ask how you've been â™« 

435
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,050
 â™« Perhaps I was needlessly worried â™« 

436
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:26,160
 â™« Maybe feeling awkward made it more awkward between the two of us  â™« 

437
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,490
â™«  Telling me that you were a mess  â™«

438
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:40,590
â™«  Because after my phone call you couldn't sleep all night  â™«

439
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,870
â™«  While smiling shyly  â™«

440
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,140
â™«  How could it be that you're still the same  â™«

441
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,090
â™«  How could it be that you're still the same  â™«

442
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,640
 â™« You said that we were too young back then â™« 

443
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:07,220
 â™« And while we were laughing at past memories, â™« 

444
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:16,260
 â™« Upon hearing you say that you're still alone, 

445
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,310
 â™« My tears started to fall â™« 

446
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:23,980
 â™« Suddenly without me knowing â™« 

447
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:29,240
 â™« Should I tell her I love her again? â™« 

448
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,290
â™«  That you were destined to return to me some day  â™«

449
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:37,700
â™«  That you were destined to return to me some day  â™«

450
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:41,160
â™«  That forgetting you was the most difficult thing for me to do  â™«

451
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,460
â™«  That forgetting you was the most difficult thing for me to do  â™«

452
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:51,410
â™«  So I couldn't even think about it  â™«

453
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:56,100
 â™« Should I tell her I love her again? â™« 

454
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,700
â™«  That if you would accept me like I was a good friend  â™«

455
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,040
â™«  That if you would accept me like I was a good friend  â™«

456
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,850
â™«   That even if I were born again  â™«

457
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:12,000
â™«  Loving you is the reason for living  â™«

458
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:18,840
â™«  Loving you is the reason for living  â™«

459
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,610
 â™« Should I tell her I love her again? â™« 

460
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,780
 â™« Should I tell? â™« 

461
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,100
â™«  That I took a long path but I've been waiting  â™«

462
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,710
â™«  That I took a long path but I've been waiting  â™«

463
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:36,240
 â™« That waiting for you â™« 

464
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,320
 â™« Was the easiest thing for me to do â™« 

465
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:46,250
â™«  And I didn't even feel the passage of time  â™«

466
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,900
 â™« Should I tell her I love her again? â™« 

467
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:08,070


468
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:12,920
Oppa, did you sleep well? Hurry and go wash up.

469
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:17,110
Oh, okay.

470
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,170
What ... should we do today?

471
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,110
Hello?

472
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:42,240
Yes, I understand.

473
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:01,620
Hello? Reporter Park, it's me.

474
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:06,330
Can you meet me later?

475
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:09,120
I have an article for you.

476
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:11,740
Yes.

477
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:37,860
Jung Eun, call me back as soon as you get this message.

478
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,590
Right away!

479
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:01,650
- Hello, Coach. 
- Ah, yes. Nice to meet you.

480
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,590
Please have a seat.

481
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,590
The Eun Dong that actor is looking for

482
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,580
is actually my daughter.

483
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,170
Please wait a moment.

484
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:24,360
Would it be okay for me to record this?

485
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,990
That book is all a complete lie.

486
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:37,590
Right now, my daughter and son-in-law,

487
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:40,390
are struggling a lot because of this book.

488
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:43,480
That guy stalked my daughter.

489
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,670
It was a one-sided interest on his part and he was harassing my daughter.

490
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:51,120
- Ji Eun Ho did? 
- And now he's coming out and

491
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,750
acting like he's  been innocently suffering for ten years. It's so fake.

492
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,110
Ji Eun Ho really did that?

493
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:02,490
Then are you saying you think I'm lying because of my daughter?

494
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:05,500
The problem is that this actor

495
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,900
is still interfering in my daughter's life.

496
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:13,640
She has a child, too. As long as he decides to continue disturbing this family,

497
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:18,500
I could no longer stand by and just watch, as a father. That's why I made a difficult decision like this.

498
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,420
But, why would Ji Eun Ho do that?

499
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,970
Think about it. Who is Ji Eun Ho?

500
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:28,610
What is frustrating him so much that he would do that?

501
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:32,660
Why are you asking me that, like I'm supposed to know?

502
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:46,040
Oh, Dr. Lee. Did the results come in?

503
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,820
 Of course they did. 

504
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,860
 The test results conclude that it is undeniable that 

505
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,300
 they are blood-related, established along the paternal blood line. 

506
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,320
 That's what it came out to be. 

507
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,540
So... You mean...

508
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,040
Hey.

509
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,140
What if it's urgent?

510
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,120
There's nothing more urgent than you. It's okay.

511
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,300
 I don't want to be bothered. 

512
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:41,240
Ah, I need to call the store. I'm going to use your phone.

513
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,060
You're fired.

514
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:44,840
What?

515
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,320
You have plans to be an undependable employee in the near future.

516
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,160
I prepared all this ahead of time.

517
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,560
Where do you come off doing that?

518
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,620
What do you mean, where? I'm right here.

519
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,160
Dong Gyu's girlfriend works part time there.

520
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,980
She says her legs swell up a lot and it's really hard work, so don't go back to work there again.

521
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,540
That work was fun for me.

522
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,060
No, you can't! Don't do it.

523
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,440
You even got hurt because of that job!

524
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,440
How is this getting hurt?

525
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,840
What are you saying? It's a  serious wound the way I look at it!

526
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,180
You're saying such crazy things.

527
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,280
We can't break up now.

528
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,320
We are like that. Last night,

529
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,480
I found out once more.

530
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:50,650


531
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,060
Hey, Kiddo.

532
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,920
Do you remember?

533
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,440
The promise you and I made here.

534
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,720
 I'll find you, Oppa. 

535
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,880
 I need to grow a bit more so you might not be able to recognize me. 

536
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,720
 I can recognize you just by looking at your back. 

537
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,080
 Hey! How could you find me just by looking at my back? 

538
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:36,260
 Because your back is the world's warmest back. 

539
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:39,300
 I can recognize it immediately. 

540
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,680
 Wow, I think I'll be able to recognize you right away, 

541
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,940
 no matter how much you've changed. 

542
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,620
 How? 

543
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:52,040
 Just... I just have a feeling. 

544
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,160
 I don't feel like that would ever be a problem. 

545
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:02,620
 Even if we got separated for some reason, I just have this feeling that we'd definitely meet again. 

546
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,440
 Like Nero and Patra?  

547
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,860
 Yeah. Like Nero and Patra.  

548
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:16,420
 Oppa, be careful when riding your motorcycle. 

549
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,100
 It's too dangerous. 

550
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,020
 Okay. 

551
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,600
 Promise. 

552
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,060
 Alright, I promise. 

553
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,460
 I'll also promise you one thing. 

554
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,140
 What? 

555
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,420
 What is it? 

556
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,360
 Hey, what is it? 

557
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,400
You made me a promise.

558
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:57,880
But... The promise you made to me,

559
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,080
I haven't heard what it is yet.

560
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,220
That promise was

561
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:15,600
to get married to you.

562
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,480
I see.

563
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,760
It was that.

564
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,360
I'm sorry I wasn't able to keep it.

565
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:46,540
Was the accident on that day?

566
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,300
I'm sorry.

567
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,220
You told me not to get hurt,

568
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:04,780
but I got hurt a lot, didn't I?

569
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,820
It's fine.

570
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,520
We met again like this.

571
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,440
Like ten years ago, we met again like this.

572
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,500
That's enough then.

573
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,860
Oppa, I apologize

574
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,980
for not listening to you and getting hurt.

575
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:29,020
Why are you crying?

576
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:35,120
How about let's not cry today

577
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:40,420
and instead spend the day playing and joking around.

578
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:44,780
Alright, let's do that.

579
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:48,500
Okay.

580
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,300
Aish!

581
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,680
 â™« As if everything at one moment â™« 

582
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:59,280
 You think you can just laugh? 

583
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,460
 â™« The thing I've kept in my hand â™« 

584
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:07,960
 Oppa, go slowly. 

585
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,780
 I don't want to. 

586
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:16,320
 When it comes to me, I can't get hurt any more, because I've already gotten hurt. 

587
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,440
 But I don't want you to get hurt, Oppa. 

588
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,480
 It doesn't matter if I get hurt. I'm going to go fast. 

589
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:30,040
  I'm going to speed it up. 

590
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,620
 â™« Back to the days we shared â™« 

591
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,070
 Oppa. 
 â™« Back to the days we shared â™« 

592
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:36,820
 Yeah? 
 â™« Back to the days we shared â™« 

593
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:41,260
 I'm happy. 

594
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:51,940
 â™« Stay with me, stay with me, let's not separate again â™« 

595
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:55,040
Kiddo, are you ready?

596
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,760
Yes, Captain!

597
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,720
I'm going!

598
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,380
Eun Dong!

599
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:11,360
 We are only just beginning! 

600
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:16,360
 â™« Love once again â™« 

601
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:24,560
 â™« Fills up part of my heart â™« 

602
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:32,060
 â™« I didn't know that day, those days
 when I was too young to know about love â™« 

603
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:36,940
 â™« Those days, but now â™« 

604
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:40,100
 Should you, me, and Ra Il go live in America? 

605
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,600
 Search and seize DM Entertainment. If I can't have it, I'll just destroy it. 

606
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,580
 Shouldn't you be begging me not to ruin Ji Eun Ho? 

607
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:50,020
 Listen well, if you bother Park Hyun Soo, I won't stand still. 

608
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,560
 Hello! 

609
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,400
 He's Seo Jung Eun's son. 

610
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,360
 Oppa, listen well. 

611
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,120
 I found my fiancÃ©. 

612
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:03,380
 That girl was already married and she even has a child. I... 

613
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:10,840
 â™« We can just go back to the days when we dreamed â™« 

614
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:18,440
