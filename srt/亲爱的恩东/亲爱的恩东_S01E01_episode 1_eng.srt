1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:09,960


2
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,490
Everything's ready.

3
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,530
 He's here! 

4
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,690
 Hello. 

5
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,010
 What is a good thing about being famous? 

6
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,970
 It is easier to find someone. 

7
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,430
 Who were you looking for? 

8
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,370
My fiancé.

9
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,810
 What was her name? 

10
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:59,630
  My Love Eun Dong
Episode 1 

11
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:06,390
 Year 1995, Chuncheon 

12
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,830
 Hey! 

13
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,070
 Do you want to die, you bastard? Stay there! 

14
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,980
Stay there! Stay—

15
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,500
- Stay there!
- Stay there!

16
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,790
- Aigoo! Aigoo!
- Ah, please!

17
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,190
I'm feeling so— Really!

18
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,950
 - You look like you are going to hit your mom.
- Ah, not at all. He's not like that. 

19
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,150
Don't ever go out riding again. Understand?

20
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,330
What did he do wrong?

21
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:35,070
A freshman in high school with no driver's license and a special theft.

22
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,790
- A theft? 
- Because of no license, you will be sent to a prosecutor.

23
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,370
 Being underage, and this being your first offense, this probably ends with just an indictment. 

24
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,430
The problem is, the motorcycle was reported stolen.

25
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,250
Stolen!

26
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,550
You didn't know?

27
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,250
Then you didn't know you were riding a stolen bike?

28
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,730
The motorcycle you sold me was stolen?

29
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,570
So, you survived the bike accident?

30
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,930
It's a miracle, you punk.

31
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,630
Speak.

32
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,270
- Tell me. You sold me stolen goods? 
- Of course. That's why I sold it to you for ₩80 thousand  ($80)

33
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,410
- What? What?
- Ah!

34
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,290
Blood... I'm bleeding you bastard!

35
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,470
Aishi! What do we do?

36
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,750
- Aish!
- Are you alright?

37
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,610
Let me go!

38
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,830
This isn't stolen goods, right?

39
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,520
 Stand him up. 

40
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,900
Let go! I wasn't scared.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,920
I am not scared.

42
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,010
Look here! Come to your senses! Look here!

43
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,210
Look here! Are you okay?

44
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,010
Come to your senses, kid!

45
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,750
Are you okay?

46
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,610
You woke up?

47
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,970
Look here! Look here! Look here!

48
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,510
Excuse me! Call an ambulance!

49
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,130
Hey!

50
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,950
Kid, kid!

51
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,310
Please call the ambulance! I hit a kid!

52
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,870
Hey!!

53
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,470
 Defender 

54
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,510
Will be punished.

55
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,510
Student Park Hyun Soo has a prior prosecution,

56
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:59,310
a motorcycle accident with no driver's license, and because of adolescent assault

57
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,110
was put into a detention center.

58
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,470
Despite all the protection provided, he did not reflect on his actions.

59
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:16,850
Hence, I sentence him to be in detention center for six months, according to Section 9 of the Korean Juvenile Court.

60
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,870
 It wasn't Oppa's fault. 

61
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,950
I just slipped and fell.

62
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,270
That Oppa took me to the hospital and saved me.

63
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,910
Please don't give that punishment to Oppa.

64
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:03,170
 It was raining like this on the first day I met Eun Dong, too. 

65
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,130
 That day, Eun Dong, lied. 

66
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:19,170
 After a long time, I came to realize that it wasn't easy for Eun Dong to lie. 

67
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:43,330
 I was thankful for that child and was worried that she might still be hurt, so I went to find her. 

68
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:53,870
 And, I was curious about why she helped me. 

69
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,550
Hey, kid!

70
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,330
Where you were hurt? Is it okay?

71
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,610
It still hurts a bit.

72
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,030
Then you should go the hospital.

73
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,570
Let's go have an examination.

74
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,270
What isn't seen may also be  hurt.

75
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,090
It'll be fine after a couple of days.

76
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,290
What's your name?

77
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,270
You little runt asking for stare contest?

78
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,450
I'll go. Don't worry.

79
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,770
 You must tell me if you're hurt. 

80
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,330
I'll be here at this time.

81
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,470
Aren't you a high school student?

82
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,450
That's right.

83
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,750
You finished school at this hour?

84
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:50,470
No, of course it doesn't end now. I just walked out by myself. Professional term: ditching .

85
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,390
I hope you become nice.

86
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:03,290
If what I lied about becomes useless, I will be sad.

87
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,140
Take care.

88
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,400
Hey, kid!

89
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,020
 That's how Eun Dong came into my life. 

90
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:26,130
 Whether she was eating, or whether someone was bothering her, 

91
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,650
 the feeling that I had to know came all at once. 

92
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,690
 I remember that day like that. 

93
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,120
But why are you speaking informally to me?

94
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,490
There are not many days left before exams. Please thoroughly prepare for the exams.

95
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,130
If you ditch the self-study periods and get caught, you know what will happen, don't you?

96
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,570
Yes!

97
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,110
Gi Sung, come a little earlier.

98
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,250
Hurry, hurry.

99
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,270
- He doesn't change at all.
 - Let's do 'fighting' today as well. 

100
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,770
Yes.

101
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,070
Where are you going?

102
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,450
I have already learned enough for today.

103
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,470
 She seems not to have much time left. 

104
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,650
 Who will take care of Eun Dong? 

105
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,730
  We have to go through the adoption procedure, but it will be hard. 

106
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,950
Father!

107
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,990
- This.
- Aigoo.

108
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,750
I left this there.

109
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,250
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

110
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,490
Eun Dong. Don't forget to give Grandma the medicine on time.

111
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,510
Yes. Thank you.

112
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,170
- You did well.
- Yes.

113
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,570
Eun Dong.

114
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,730
So, her name is Eun Dong.

115
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,670
 Grandma, please just lie down. 

116
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,790
 Since I keep lying down, I feel getting moth-eaten (bored). 

117
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,310
  Please help me get up. 

118
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,430
 Okay. Grandma, be careful. 

119
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,550
Be careful, be careful.

120
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,930
  Are you fine where you got hurt? 

121
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:43,650
  You should have asked for medical expenses. 

122
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,890
I said, it's okay.

123
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,850
Don't ask, Grandma.

124
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,970
Who do you take after,  and  you are so nice?

125
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:59,690
 Since your mom is the worst wench in the world, you must take after your father. 

126
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,550
 I had never cried when I watched sad movies. 

127
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,670
 I had never cried when I heard someone died, either. 

128
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,730
 I thought I was that kind of man. 

129
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,810
 But on that day, very strangely, I had tears. 

130
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,450
 Hyun Soo? 

131
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,610
Are you asleep, Hyun Soo?

132
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,110
He didn't turn off the light.

133
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:29,250
 Darling, Hyun Soo's  dad! Wake up quickly! 

134
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,890
 Our refrigerator was robbed!  Probably, a robber came! 

135
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,270
  What are you talking about, so early in the morning? 

136
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,170
  Oh, No! Who on earth robbed nothing else but in the refrigerator? 

137
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,650
 - Hyun Ah!
- I am here.  

138
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,710
  Nothing happened to you, right? 

139
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:49,090
 Well, we were robbed overnight! 

140
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,610
Mom?

141
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,210
What are you doing?

142
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,530
This crazy boy! Why are you ruining a perfectly good pair of shoes!

143
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,470
You're driving me crazy! When will you grow up!

144
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,630
You'd better run! Don't let me catch you!

145
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,750
How much more praying do I have to do before he straightens up?

146
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,650
Mom, I'm sorry.

147
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,590
- Thank you.
- Take care.

148
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,290
Yes.

149
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,630
Eun Dong.

150
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,190
- Let me.
- I can do it.

151
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,410
Give me this. Your wrist is going to hurt.

152
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,170
 Share with everyone 

153
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,370
Girls shouldn't carry heavy stuff.

154
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,570
You can carry it to over there.

155
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,330
Is that your house over there?

156
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,510
No. It's not like that.

157
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,310
Quickly, show me the way.

158
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,130
I didn't ditch school.

159
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,330
Today is the anniversary holiday for my school.

160
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,310
- I'm serious.
- I know.

161
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,770
Eun Dong.

162
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,150
Do you see that I try to be nice to you?

163
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,070
I'm really, really grateful to you. I'm definitely in your debt, you know.

164
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:50,690
Truthfully, you saved me from going to the juvenile detention center.

165
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,810
On top of that, you injured your leg.

166
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,910
If I don't do things like this I'll feel really guilty,

167
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,210
so you can order me around as much as you want.

168
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,210
It's here.  Give it to me.

169
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,410
Just move.

170
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,250
I can do it by myself, actually.

171
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,110


172
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,570
I said I'll do it for you.

173
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,110
- Where did I put it?
- Just put it down here.

174
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,330
I understand.

175
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,970
Oppa, thank you very, very, much.

176
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,270
- Eun Dong. Did someone come?
- Take care.

177
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,290
Grandma, hello.

178
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,930
Come here.

179
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,670
This one is quite interesting.

180
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,390
Quickly.

181
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,540
Come here quickly.

182
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,720
- Aren't your parents home?
- No.

183
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,580
And your grandma's sick?

184
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,340
Then you do everything, like cooking and laundry?

185
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,070
There is the landlady and unnis.

186
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,350
Father and Sister, too. (priest and nun)

187
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:22,370
Now... I have you too, Oppa.

188
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,870
- It's hot today isn't it?
- Yeah.

189
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,960
Oppa, eat it with kimchi.

190
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,550
It tastes good, right?

191
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,630
Yeah.

192
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:08,050
Kimchi tastes like kimchi...

193
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,010
It's a familiar taste, right?

194
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,230
The kimchi still tastes good.

195
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,210
Grandma, please have some of the soup.

196
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,350
Do you want some soup?

197
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,690
Then, I'm going to have it for myself.

198
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,590
Ah, sneakers?

199
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,030
My family is struggling a bit,

200
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,150
not really in the best position to buy sneakers.

201
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,570
No matter what anyone says I will tell them

202
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,470
being poor isn't something to be embarrassed about.

203
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,250
I run faster than

204
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,610
the guys who wear expensive sneakers. I'm really fast.

205
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,090
So, don't lose your spirit!

206
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,830
You too, Oppa.

207
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,830
What's your dream?

208
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,510
I'm going to become an actress.

209
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,890
Actress? With that face?

210
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,770
You have to be really good at acting, then.

211
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:51,430
When you become an actress, you get famous.

212
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,930
If I become an actress, I can go on the people search program on TV.

213
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,730
To find whom?

214
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,890
My mom.

215
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,930
I'm going to find my mom.

216
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,730
That's the reason you want to become an actress?

217
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,230
To find your mom?

218
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,470
 You punk. 

219
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,790
Did you tell the police that I sold you that motorcycle?

220
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:34,490
Do you know why I cut off all ties with you? Because you're trash.

221
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,330
Family members shouldn't cheat each other.

222
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,290
- Who will believe in this dirty world now?
- Even still, how could you?

223
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:46,910
Hey, do you know who is above me?

224
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,950
So, you did it because No Suk Young told you to?

225
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,290
Then tell that hyung that this is the end.

226
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,850
How lowly is it to suck the blood from kids?

227
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,990
Who is that strange looking girl?

228
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:30,930
Next time you see people like that, make sure to run.

229
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:37,010
 All  guys are dogs, except for me. Got it?

230
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,540
 It's the truth, Oppa. 

231
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,890
 The truth? Do you know what you're doing to me right now? 

232
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,090
  I wasn't doing anything and you stabbed me in the back.  

233
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,810
 After you've stabbed me in the back, what else should we do? Let's just get divorced. 

234
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,960
She's so pretty.

235
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,410
When you grow up a bit more Hyun Ah, you'll be just as pretty!

236
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,990
How is she pretty? I know someone prettier.

237
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,390
Who?

238
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,230
There just is, this kiddo.

239
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,470
Thank you for the fruit.

240
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,550
Did Oppa just say thanks for the fruit?

241
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,050
I guess he's finally maturing.

242
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,010
My praying for a hundred days is working!

243
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,650
Also, this month he didn't skip school at all.

244
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,930
- Really? 
- Yes.

245
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,150
- Dong-ah.
- Yes.

246
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,210
Grandma can't sleep.

247
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,990
Can you read me a book?

248
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,350
Okay, Grandma.

249
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,030
Where did you leave off?

250
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,550
 The snow has stopped. 

251
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:12,490
 Suddenly, the moonlight showed the two pictures. 

252
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,930
Ah, I can finally see.

253
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:22,470
Nero looked at the pictures emotionally, for he had waited so long to see them.

254
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,890
 Heavenly Father, thank you. 

255
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,630
 Nero knelt down before the pictures. 

256
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:35,110
Then, Nero hugged Patra tightly.

257
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:40,130
The next day, the people of Entwoff

258
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:46,550
discovered Nero and Patra frozen, dead, in the church,

259
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:53,690
Aurora calling Nero and crying next to him.

260
00:25:54,310 --> 00:26:02,190
But pitiful Nero and Patra had already gone to heaven.

261
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:08,130
Oh dear! That poor girl. Did she really die?

262
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,390
Is that what is written?

263
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,430
No, Grandma.

264
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:22,450
Just as Aurora's tear dropped to Nero's hand, Nero's body started to warm up.

265
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:29,710
As Nero's body temperature rose, Patra's body started to warm up, too.

266
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:35,310
Nero and Patra were alive again.

267
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:39,510
 That's right. It should be like that. 

268
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:43,870
 That's great. That's great. 

269
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:58,250


270
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,370
 The husband I thought of wasn't Japanese or American. 

271
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:09,690
And boasting that he is an officer of the Jin Joo region,

272
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,210
 Asaco and I bowed many times and went separate ways, without a handshake. 

273
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,870
 Despite longing, not seeing each other, but once. 

274
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,530
 Not being able to forget for a lifetime, but still go on living. 

275
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:27,110
 Asaco and I met three times, but the third time, it would have been better if we had not met. 

276
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,610
 I plan to go to Chuncheon this weekend. 

277
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,190
 The autumn scenery would be beautiful around the Soyang River. 

278
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,870
 Up to here will be on the test. 

279
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,870
 Let's end the class here. Class president! 

280
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,170
Attention. Bow to the teacher.

281
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,430
Thank you for the lesson!

282
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,650
Fate. Fate.

283
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,850
Hyun Soo! You're really shocking me!

284
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:58,370
You didn't doze off during the lesson or leave school early.

285
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,090
Have you gotten in your right mind?

286
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,850
Y-Yes...

287
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,130
Why are you laughing?

288
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,710
Hey, kiddo!

289
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:52,610
Perhaps, did you come for me?

290
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,850
I'm touched.

291
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:01,030
Thanks for the shoes.

292
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:06,370
Such a small kid came all way to school to express thanks for this.

293
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,310
You don't have to, punk.

294
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,830
I'll wear these shoes until I turn twenty.

295
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,550
You're going to continue living as a kid?

296
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,990
You have to grow up, too.

297
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,130
Let's go.

298
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,670
Your hair pin is pretty.

299
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:42,050
Patra surely went to heaven, right?

300
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:48,800
I mean, there's no way there are only humans in heaven.

301
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:54,550
Besides, if Nero alone goes to heaven, don't you think Patra would be lonely?

302
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,260
Patra would find Nero.

303
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,810
How would she find him?

304
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,360
By smell.

305
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,060
She would find him by smell.

306
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:10,530
How would I find you?

307
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,140
If, by any chance, I have to find you,

308
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,210
what would I use?

309
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:29,940


310
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,870
I'll find you.

311
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:43,890
Since I have a lot more growing to do, you probably won't be able to recognize me.

312
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,770
I can identify you just looking at your back.

313
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:51,350
Hey, how can you recognize me from my back?

314
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,370
Since your back is the warmest back in the world,

315
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,280
I would recognize you right away.

316
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,010
I think, no matter how much you change,

317
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,300
I would be able to recognize you immediately.

318
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,390
How?

319
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,900
I just have this feeling...

320
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:21,930
I don't think it would be hard at all.

321
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:28,270
An even-if-we-get-separated-we'll-definitely-see-each-other-again kind of feeling.

322
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,470
Like Nero and Patra?

323
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,720
Yes, like Nero and Patra.

324
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,930
You are Patra?

325
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:41,050
Hey! Am I a dog?

326
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,150
You're laughing!

327
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,200
Don't laugh!

328
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,570
It's that funny to you?

329
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,690
Woof, woof.

330
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,650
I think you're a really good person.

331
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,100
When I think of you,

332
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,610
it is like my heart is getting cramps.

333
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,500
 Eun Dong and I were young, 

334
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:36,260
 but my feelings for Eun Dong at that time, exactly what they were... 

335
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,240
 I still don't know exactly what I could call it. 

336
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,350
 But, whenever I thought about Eun Dong, 

337
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,770
 I felt my heart get cramps. 

338
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,290
 I felt it every time I saw Eun Dong. 

339
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:58,970
Oppa, today was really fun.

340
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,370
Take care.

341
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:03,530
Take care.

342
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,130
Hey!

343
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,690
Why does this keep making creaking noises?

344
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,270
Uh... This...

345
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,360
This should be fixed tomorrow.

346
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,250
Go inside.

347
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,780
I'll see you tomorrow?

348
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,160
Go, Oppa.

349
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,430
Okay. You go in.

350
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,510
Y-You go in...

351
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,650
O-Okay...

352
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,100
Park Hyun Soo.

353
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,350
You're a man, aren't you?

354
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:14,860


355
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,790
 Hey, Park Hyun Soo. 

356
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,990
Let's talk.

357
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,550
I'm pretty sure I warned you.

358
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,390
I don't associate myself with trash.

359
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:36,760
Hey, bastard! Because of you, No Suk went to prison.

360
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,320
Why didn't you go?

361
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,420
Oh... Even though you dropped out, you're still a minor!

362
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,050
Yeah, yeah. You're right.

363
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,630
 Hey, but who's that little kid, the one that looks like an elementary school kid that follows you around everywhere? 

364
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,740
Do you have a preference for young girls?

365
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,800
No, right?

366
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:58,390
Don't talk about her with that dirty mouth of yours. I'll kill you.

367
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:03,360
Are you trying to raise her so you can eat her later? Huh?

368
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,050
 Doesn't that take too long? 

369
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:08,440
- I warned you.
- Don't be so overly dramatic.

370
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,650
Because of you my life is in danger when No Suk is released.

371
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,710
You brought it on yourself,

372
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,850
so you take care of it yourself, punk.

373
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,960
Should I return it to her instead?

374
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,450
I always return what I receive. Is kid's taste different?

375
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,280
Let's see an end to this today, punk.

376
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,830
Yo, hold him back! Hold him back!

377
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,840
Ah... Take this!

378
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,120
Come closer! Come closer!

379
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,370
Mom, can you please turn this off?

380
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:03,860
So embarrassing.

381
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:11,850
It's because I religiously attend, regardless of church or temple, that you're at least in this decent state.

382
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,560
Otherwise you would have died!

383
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,790
I'll go get your dad's food and come back.

384
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:22,000
Why are you coming back? Don't come back!

385
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,180
- I can be by myself.
- Shut it!

386
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:04,640
When our hearts drifted, we met as one seed

387
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,150
and we bloomed in two days.

388
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,610
 I'll see you tomorrow? 

389
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,480
 Grandma! 

390
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,600
 Grandma! 

391
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,800
 Grandma! 

392
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,170
 Grandma! 

393
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,600
 Grandma! Grandma! 

394
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,520
 Grandma! 

395
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,400
 Grandma! 

396
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:18,420
 After I was released from the hospital, the first place I went was to Eun Dong's house. 

397
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,700
Ahjumma!

398
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,130
- Where are the kid and grandmother? 
- Ah...

399
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:55,740
Student! I was going to go to your school to find you if you didn't come.

400
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,240
I'll just make this delivery quickly. Go and wait for me at the shop.

401
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,730
She told me to give this to you and left it with me.

402
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,760
Do you know where they went?

403
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,860
The priest and sister took her with them.

404
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,660
Do you know which Catholic church they're from?

405
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,620
I don't know.

406
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,540
But don't worry. She matches well with anyone. She'll be living well.

407
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:57,570
Dear Oppa Hyun Soo, Thank you for making lots of  good memories. I will not forget you. I will miss you. Don't forget me. Live well until we meet again. - Eun Dong.

408
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,660
 Eun Dong, let's go. 

409
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,730
 Oppa, thank you. 

410
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,440
 I won't forget you. 

411
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:18,840
 Why didn't I know that Eun Dong could leave like that? 

412
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,070
 I didn't even know Eun Dong's last name, 

413
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,530
 but I understood. 

414
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,870
  So, Eun Dong, 

415
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:33,800
  how did she know my shoe size so well? 

416
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,870
 I wanted to meet her and ask her, but 

417
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:40,860
  I wasn't able to. 

418
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:52,790
♫  I loved so much that I went to find you  ♫  

419
00:43:52,790 --> 00:44:00,970
♫  Like the wind blowing, that was how much I missed you  ♫  

420
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:07,230
♫  Should I say I want to stay with you?
 Should I say I want to laugh with you?  ♫

421
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:12,930
♫  The words I couldn't say are bursting out of me   ♫

422
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:16,180
Eun Dong! 
 ♫  Should I carry them in my hands?  ♫

423
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:20,210
Where are you? 
♫  Because they are still remain in me  ♫

424
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:26,140
Eun Dong! You're doing well, right? 
♫   My love I can't have but still fluttering my heart   ♫

425
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:34,150
Oppa will definitely find you! Until that time,

426
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:38,910
don't get sick. Don't get hurt.

427
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:44,660
♫  My heart is just longing for you   ♫

428
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:50,820
I'm sorry. Oppa is sorry.

429
00:44:50,820 --> 00:45:00,510
Eun Dong! I miss you.

430
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:09,860
Eun Dong! Eun Dong...

431
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,380
EUN DONG!!!

432
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:17,580
♫   My bursting love  ♫

433
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:26,740
♫   If I see you, I could then just breath  ♫

434
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:33,310
Eun Ho, let's go.

435
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:37,020
 Even when I moved from Chuncheon to Seoul, I thought that 

436
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:41,390
 perhaps, in Seoul, I could meet Eun Dong there. 

437
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:45,020
 I tried to think of a plan to find Eun Dong. 

438
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:55,890


439
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:02,550
  Looking For a Lost Child 
 Name: Go Seong Hee, female
 Age: 7 years old 

440
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:07,310
Mom, does releasing an ad to find a person cost a lot of money?

441
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:08,860
Of course.

442
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,990
- How much?
- A few hundred probably.

443
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:16,080
It has be in the papers for some time. It needs to be in all the different provinces, too.

444
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,630
Probably in a few different papers, too.

445
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,910
Nothing, I was just wondering if people can see such a small ad.

446
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,850
 Did you see? 

447
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,200
 I will become an actress. 

448
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,350
 If I become an actress, I can become famous. 

449
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,910
 If I become an actress, I can go on the people search program on TV. 

450
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:57,120
 The reason I decided to become an actor, 

451
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:01,160
 surprisingly, wasn't because of dramas or movies. 

452
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,710
 It was because of the TV show "Finding People". 

453
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,570
I am here to register for the acting program.

454
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:21,770
We offer three month, six month and one year programs.

455
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,380
For one year.

456
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,740
- We don't offer refunds or accept cancellations.
- Okay.

457
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:29,070
Your name?

458
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:32,800
Park Hyun Soo. I'm Park Hyun Soo.

459
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,120
What exactly are you telling me to do?

460
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,700
Naturally, like you are saying it to me.

461
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,520
- What exactly are you telling me to do?
- A bit louder.

462
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,430
- What exactly are you telling me to do?
- It's not that serious.

463
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:46,040
- What exactly are you telling me to do?
- It's not a question.

464
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,620
What exactly are you telling me to do?

465
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,730
Comfortably, comfortably. Relax your eyes.

466
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,760
Hello, I'm Park Hyun Soo.

467
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,900
- Hello, you can start.
- Yes.

468
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,360
Yes.

469
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,230
There wasn't any evidence!

470
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:31,010
Even the millionaire and the roses. Uh didn't bring the roses.

471
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:34,830
Everything that you dreamed of was from your imagination.

472
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,740
You only have lies, fraud and petty thoughts.

473
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,270
Wait a second.

474
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:41,020
Are you smiling or crying right now?

475
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,900
The direction says the lips are smiling, but the eyes are crying.

476
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,900
Like this.

477
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:54,820
The expression is right. Let's do it one more time.

478
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,630
Like Adam felt loneliness,

479
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:05,070
I felt the emptiness, Oh God...

480
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:07,140
- Oh, oh.
- That's all.

481
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,910
Thank you.

482
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:13,770
Showing up there every morning, sickens me.

483
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:18,790
I'd rather get a hit on the head by a sledge hammer.

484
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,800
 I had no talent for acting. 

485
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,710
 That's right. 

486
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:28,260
  Because it was a way to meet Eun Dong again, 

487
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,420
 I recklessly learned to act. 

488
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:35,490
 Before the TV program "Finding People," disappeared, 

489
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,000
 I had to quickly learn how to act. 

490
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I came from Chuncheon to see this.

491
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,590
Yeah, next time if it is okay.

492
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:46,430
 Only My Sunshine!  Discount coupons. It starts at 5:30.

493
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:47,810
If you don't have this, you'll be in big trouble!

494
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:50,350
Couples, ₩8000. One is usually ₩5000.

495
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:53,350
Discounts! This is it.

496
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:10,410
Hello?

497
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:14,170
Is this the TV program,   Finding People? 

498
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:20,130
This is a viewer. First of all, I wanted to thank you for making such a great program.

499
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:25,390
For the quality of the program, I think it must not be canceled.

500
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:30,150
 The TV program "Finding People," even after ten years, 

501
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,450
 it did not get canceled. 

502
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:01,130
 From when I first met Eun Dong, 

503
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:04,430
 ten years flew by. 
2005, SEOUL

504
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:07,430
 I finally got into college after the third attempt. 

505
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:10,850
 Many things happened. 

506
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:15,810
 I cultivated a dream to become an actor. 

507
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:21,370
 I also got into an entertainment company. 

508
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:28,650
 The artists will put the efforts on developing the creative works and pursuing the pure are... 

509
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:53,550
Oh.

510
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,690
- You've been looking for me?
- Yes.

511
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,830
From today, train Eun Ho.

512
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:02,430
Huh? Eh? Really?

513
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:06,830
Looked ten years older than his age already, Hyun Bal's time seemed to have stood still.

514
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,670
Let's change your name.

515
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:14,370
Park Eun Ho. What the hell is that? It's not cool at all!

516
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:19,370
You know, there are certain names that just sound like an actor's, like  Jung Seong or Jang Dong Gun.

517
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:22,050
- Change it.
- I already did.

518
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:24,190
- What was it originally?
- Park Hyun Soo.

519
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:26,790
That's practically the same thing, you punk.

520
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:30,070
I mean, change it to something drastically different.

521
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:31,610
Change it!

522
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:35,970
It's because Jang Dong Gun became a star that his name  is cool.

523
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:39,110
You don't immediately think of an actor when you hear that name.

524
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:44,750
You remember that stolen bike?  That Gu Ro city counselor's name was Park Woo Song.

525
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:49,510
Oh, and in junior high school, our principal 's name was what? Choi something.

526
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:51,510
I'm just going to leave it as Park Eun Ho.

527
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:54,910
I think Park Eun Ho is not particularly good.

528
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:00,530
 When I become an actor, I need a new name. 

529
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,770
 I just want to leave mine as Eun Dong. 

530
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:07,870
 What the heck is Eun Dong? For an actress, that name is too tacky. 

531
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:11,150
 - Oppa, you should be Eun Ho.
- Eun Ho? 

532
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:16,530
 Eun Ho and Eun Dong. Sounds like we're siblings. 

533
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:17,890
 You. 

534
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:21,670
 Do you wish I was your real older brother? 

535
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,710
 No. 

536
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,550
 Why? 

537
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:31,310
 If you become my older brother, 

538
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:35,010
 we would have to live together. 

539
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,650
 My house only has one room. 

540
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,230
 I think you'd be uncomfortable. 

541
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:48,490
 Your last name and your first name should fit perfectly. 

542
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:52,750
Park Eun Ho... I don't think it's right.

543
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:59,450
 Why didn't I ask Eun Dong her last name? 

544
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:02,650
 It's something I deeply regret. 

545
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,090
Miss Hwang Bong Ok!

546
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:12,710
The package I'm delivering is not Miss Hwang Bong Ok's, but someone else's. It's someone else's.

547
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:16,190
-S.o.me.one..e.l.s.e
-The feel is amazing. You will get the Academy Award.

548
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:19,950
- You're a scene stealer! 
-  Delivery guy! 

549
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,690
Yes?

550
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,250
Action.

551
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,830
- Miss Hwang Ok Bong!
- Cut, cut, cut.

552
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:30,990
- Hwang Bong Ok. Hwang Bong Ok. Let's try again.
- I'm sorry.

553
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:33,310
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

554
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:35,250
Miss Hwang Bong Ok!

555
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:38,570
- The packaging of the delivery is not—
-  Cut, cut, cut. 

556
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,750
- Aish...
-  "The package I'm delivering," okay? 

557
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:42,710
Miss Hwang Bong Ok!

558
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:47,490
- The package I'm delivering is not Miss Hwang Ok Bong's—
 - Hwang Bong Ok! Hwang Bong Ok! 

559
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:50,030
The package I'm delivering—

560
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:55,090
 Aish! It's Bong Ok! Who brought this kid? 

561
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:58,010
Hwang Bong Ok—

562
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:00,350
 Oh my god, this kid... 

563
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:02,590
What the hell are you doing, you punk?

564
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,890
Hey! Hey!

565
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:06,890
Are we shooting an erotic film?

566
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:09,110
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Ah!

567
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:11,790
Send him off! Hurry!

568
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:14,410
Miss Hwang Bong Ok! The package I'm delivering is not Miss Hwang Bong Ok's but...

569
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:19,870
 My very first acting job ended that way. 

570
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:22,270
 Per my mother, I'd have triple bad luck in that year. 

571
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:26,290
 I volunteered to join the military and got assigned 

572
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,930
 to work in city hall. 

573
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,770
Ah! Oppa, Oppa!

574
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,510
 With Lee Suk Tae, of all people, and at the same place. 

575
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:50,470
 Suk Tae is outshining all of us. 

576
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:53,590
What are you doing, not greeting your fans?

577
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:56,350
 Ah! 

578
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:58,310
I have to make signs in the parking lot.

579
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:02,290
Well that... Hyun Soo can do it instead!

580
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:05,610
 That's right! Mister, you do it instead, please. 

581
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:10,930
 At the time, the most popular actors were Bae Yong Joon and Lee Suk Tae. 

582
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:14,230
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

583
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:15,990
We've got to go far together.

584
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:21,630
 Playboy Lee Suk Tae, impregnating a woman, caused a problem. 

585
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,970
 So, he rushed to join the military. 

586
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:27,890
 Thanks to him I had to serve my junior 

587
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:30,270
 in military life, 

588
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:43,250


589
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:49,750
Hello?

590
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,810
 What are you doing? 

591
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:55,030
Why are you calling me? You should take care of Mi Sun.

592
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:58,370
  You punk. I'm just checking on you. You just need to work hard for three more months. 

593
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:00,050
I understand.

594
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:16,850
  I wonder how the last ten years have been treating Eun Dong? 

595
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:22,850
 Even though I'd been keeping a place for her in my heart, 

596
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:29,990
  I'd started, little by little, to forget her face. 

597
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:45,310
Hey, are you okay?

598
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:48,130
- I'm okay. 
- Hey...

599
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:52,990
 It's Eun Dong. 

600
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:14,710
Have

601
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:18,510
things been well with you?

602
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:28,710
Hey...

603
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:32,210
Did you eat yet?

604
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:42,610
 If, by any chance, I have to find you, how should I? 

605
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:47,510
  I'll look for you Oppa. I still have more growing to do. 

606
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:50,250
  It's possible you won't be able to recognize me, 

607
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:53,330
 but I'll be able to recognize you, just by seeing your back. 

608
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:58,710
  How could you recognize me by seeing my back? 

609
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:04,590
 Because yours is the worlds warmest back, I'll be able to recognize it right away. 

610
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:12,270
 I think no matter how much you've changed, I'll be able recognize you. 

611
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:13,750
 How? 

612
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:17,310
 I just feel like it will be like that. 

613
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:22,950
 Like it won't be that hard. Even if we haven't seen each other for awhile, 

614
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:25,850
 we'll definitely meet again. It's that kind of feeling. 

615
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:27,810
 Like Nero and Patra? 

616
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:30,550
 Yeah, like Nero and Patra. 

617
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:33,990
 You are Patra? 

618
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:40,430
 Am I dog? You're laughing? 

619
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:43,390
 Don't laugh. 

620
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:48,510
 Is that funny to you? Woof, woof. 

621
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,410
 Ten years without me... 

622
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:05,850
  Have you been anxious? 

623
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:08,370
 You don't have a boyfriend, right? 

624
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:10,670
 - Let's date!
- Let's just be brother and sister. 

625
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:15,290
 - Why are you bothering a girl with a boyfriend!
- Ah! Oppa! 

626
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:19,470
 Why don't you listen to your father? 

627
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:24,140
 What do you want from that oppa, anyway? 

628
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:28,710
  It's critical condition! 

629
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:31,290
 Eun Dong, where are you?
