00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,670
 My Love, Eun Dong
Episode 13 

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,470
 So Coach Seo is saying that he and his daughter are being deceived by Ji Eun Ho. 

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,440
Since his daughter can't remember anything, Ji Eun Ho implanted false memories into her mind.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,470
What would motivate Ji Eun Ho to do something that extreme to an ordinary person?

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,960
 What does that Coach Seo person say about Ji Eun Ho's reason for doing this? 

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,590
 He said there wasn't much he could do, and there was no point in discussing things with a crazy person. 

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,200
 Then he's basically saying Ji Eun Ho is just crazy? 

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,290
Yes, if he went so far as writing a book like this, then he definitely is not normal.

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,540
 You don't think maybe that Coach Seo is the strange one? 

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,900
Ay, no. We've known each other for more than ten years.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,260
Hey! I've known Ji Eun Ho for more than ten years, too.

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,290
 Even though he's a bit full of himself, Ji Eun Ho is not a psycho. 

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,890
 I would say among the top stars, based on his personality, he's a pretty decent person. 

14
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,550
So are you saying that we shouldn't take this opportunity to write the entertainment piece?

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,000
I suppose we need to go with it.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,560
But then why do you keep asking questions and arguing?

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,970
As you know, Ji Eun Ho is quite—

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,100
If you're talking money, the article is a slam dunk. It'll totally fly.

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,310
But DM Entertainment surely won't just sit still, and then when the lawsuit comes in,

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,000
our company might just fly out the window, too.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,430
Hurry, go write the article and bring it to me. We'll limit the intensity of the accusations as much as we can.

22
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,610
Ah, I don't know! Let's just do it, and then see what the reaction is going to be.

23
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,230
Grandmother, this is Hyun Soo.

24
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,810
 You worried a lot because of Eun Dong, right? 

25
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,700
You don't have to worry any more.

26
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,950
I'll raise her well.

27
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,110
What do you mean 'raise'? What are you going to do if I grow even more?

28
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,070
Grandmother.

29
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,250
We're going to live well.

30
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,250
Look after us.

31
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,040
Grandma, I miss you.

32
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,320
Oppa, even your driving is cool.

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,940
Of course.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,200
Oppa, you're the most handsome when you're wearing a dress shirt, you know that?

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,460
Really?

36
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,510
Do you know when you were the coolest, Oppa?

37
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,690
 Remember when you left shoes for me? 

38
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,580
 When I wore those shoes and went to your school to find you, 

39
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,360
 Oppa, you were walking down from the top of the hill. 

40
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,250
 Carefree and messy, you didn't even button up your shirt. 

41
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,830
 But I don't know why that looked so cool at the time. 

42
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,270
 Hey, kid! 

43
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,060
 Did you perhaps come here to see me? 

44
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,080
 What was the second coolest? 

45
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,450
After you were released from court, the first time you came to find me.

46
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,940
 That time, Oppa, you were wearing a white t-shirt, blue plaid shirt, jeans 

47
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,090
 and white sneakers. And the sneakers were still new. 

48
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,910
 Wow, how do you remember all that, huh? 

49
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,850
 Hey, kid! 

50
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:20,130
How could I ever forget that? It was the happiest memory I had ever had.

51
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,070
Thank you for remembering all of that.

52
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,450
I'll make you happy.

53
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,180
You don't have to put in too much effort.

54
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,300
Even when we're just together like this, I feel so happy.

55
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,240
Okay. Again. When again was I cool?

56
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,100
This last drama you were in, Oppa.

57
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,350
Writer Park Jung Eun really writes well.

58
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:58,450
Oh, right. I need to call that Noona.

59
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,290
Let's pull the car over for a minute.

60
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,470
 Ms. Mi Soon: Hello. You're with Jung Eun now, right? 

61
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,260
 Jung Eun's son, Ra Il, is really ill. 

62
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,720
Eun Dong.

63
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,490
I think we need to go back up.

64
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,320
What did you say your son's name was?

65
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,080
Ra Il.

66
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,840
Choi Ra Il.

67
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,190
He's a pretty kid, he takes after you.

68
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,450
Nothing will change. Don't worry, Oppa.

69
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,580
What happened?

70
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,030
Mom already took him to the hospital.

71
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,390
Where and how much was he ill?

72
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,180
He had a small fever.  You know how he usually gets cold fevers around this time of the year.

73
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,890
Thank you.

74
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,900
Thank you? What do you mean?

75
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,100
Ra Il...

76
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,050
The three of us, let's go to America together.

77
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,800
Let's start again there.

78
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,030
Let's

79
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,840
break up.

80
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,300
What did you say?

81
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,670
I think we need to do that.

82
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,650
I think that's the only thing left for us to do.

83
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,010
What about Ra Il?

84
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,850
Then, Ra Il...

85
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,650
 Is your son okay? 

86
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,610
 Yeah,  he's okay. 

87
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,080
 Oppa... 

88
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,850
 Would you like to meet Ra Il? 

89
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,220
Yes.

90
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,240
  Hey, Hyung! Where in the world are you and what exactly are you doing? Plus, I can't get a hold of you, either! 

91
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,540
- You really want to see me die from the stress? 
-  Ah... 

92
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,030
 Okay, I got it. 

93
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,520
Did you call General Manager Nam?

94
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,470
Oh, that guy? Once I go play a few rounds of golf with him, he'll loosen up and forget about everything. Don't worry.

95
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,890
 Ah, Hyung. What's up with you, really? 

96
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,840
 I mean, it's not just once or twice but all the time— 

97
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,800
Hey, hurry and get over here.

98
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,370
Why? Where?

99
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,070
Hello, Ms. Writer.

100
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,740
What about Eun Ho?

101
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,860
First, please take these.

102
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,650
What is this?

103
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,760
Miss Writer, there's another present. None other than—

104
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,860
Noona!  Hahaha!

105
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,520
It's been 3000 years since I saw you last.

106
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,100
What are you talking about? We saw each other when we had the reading the other day.

107
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,900
- What brought you here all of a sudden? 
 - What do you mean, sudden? I came because I missed you.

108
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,400
Noona! Are you aging backwards?

109
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,020
Why do you look even younger, huh?

110
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,600
You even changed your hairstyle.

111
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,520
I know, right?  Even though I'm always inside working and not getting any photosynthesis (sun), I don't seem to be aging.

112
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,560
By the way, did something happen to you?

113
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
What is it? What's going on?

114
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,980
I really came to see you because I missed you.

115
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,120
You're my savior and the best writer, Park Jung Eun.

116
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,240
Missed me...

117
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,140
- What do you want to drink? 
 - I want coffee.

118
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,060
So you are saying you want me to hire her as my assistant writer and train her?

119
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,500
No, not to hire as your assistant but to teach, as your student.

120
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,720
And Noona, you can't make her do physical work. Her body is frail.

121
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,560
She even injured her hand.

122
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,780
You must be crazy.

123
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,800
Do you not know that I'm going on vacation after I complete this production?

124
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,940
Shall we go together? Let's go, the three of us together, huh?

125
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,440
Did you eat something wrong?

126
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,020
Who is she anyway?

127
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,380
Noona, what kind of relationship do you and I have?

128
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,500
Don't ask anything, just help me out. My friend said her dream is to become a writer.

129
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,920
It's because I kind of owe her when it comes to this dream of hers.

130
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,900
Noona. If you help me out  this one time, I will never forget this favor for the rest of my life!

131
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,760
Noona, if there's a project you're working on, even if it's playing a corpse, I'll do it.

132
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,860
Why? Should I write an MOU?

133
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,240
- Hey Dong Gyu! Bring paper—
 - Be quiet.

134
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,640
Okay I got it. Bring her by some time. We'll start from there.

135
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,440
Okay.

136
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,360
Noona, you've totally become a Miss.

137
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,120
I am a Miss.

138
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,600
I mean you've gotten younger looking.

139
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,860
You got slimmer and changed your style, as well.

140
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,920
That writer seems to getting old very quickly. She must be eating all the time.

141
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,140
She gained a lot of weight!

142
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,580
  You need go to your office directly. President has been continuously looking for you. 

143
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,340
The company is in a really serious situation right now.

144
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,820
What is so serious? Why are things always so serious with that damn company?

145
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,360
This is  really  serious.

146
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,060
When was it ever "fake" serious? Of course it's  always  really serious.

147
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,000
It's late. Let's go tomorrow.

148
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:08,760
  Choi Ra Il. 

149
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,340
- Son! Are you alright now? 
 - Yeah.

150
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,520
- We need to quickly wash up and go to school. 
 - Yeah.

151
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,760
- Ra Il. Do you want to go to grandmother's house with me today? 
 - Yes.

152
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,820
- Then I'll come pick you up, so wait for me at school.
- Okay.

153
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,980
Bring the lavender pot with you when you come.

154
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,560
I need to give it some water. They said it brings good luck.

155
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,500
Dad has to walk soon.

156
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,340
Dad can water it.

157
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,660
Isn't dad going, too?

158
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,320
Just you and I are going, Ra Il.

159
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,460
Why?

160
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,720
Dad said he likes it here.

161
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,520
How many days are we staying?

162
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,060
- It could take a very long time. 
 - I don't want to.

163
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,500
If dad isn't going, then I won't go either.

164
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,480
 It's okay if it was just two days, but I don't want to go if it's longer than that. 

165
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,920
I don't like it without dad.

166
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,440
 These are last year's accounting records. 

167
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,160
Aren't these when President Hwang was in charge?

168
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,660
Get rid of all the records when President Hwang was in charge.

169
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,440
President! We have a big problem.

170
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,620
What? What is it this time?

171
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,500
    Ji Eun Ho's Autobiographical Essay  is Uncovered as a Complete Lie 

172
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,380
  What is this? And who is Choi Jae Ho? 

173
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,860
Without even trying once to verify this with me...

174
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,280
- What site is this? 
  - It was posted a minute ago from Weekly Journal. 

175
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,910
  - There is no way Eun Ho would do that. 
- No, it was suspicious from the beginning. 

176
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,880
 - He's coming. 
 - Hello. 

177
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,360
What is with the atmosphere?

178
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,620
Chief, how can you release such a one-sided article like that?

179
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,380
You should have asked for our side of the story, too!

180
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,880
I have to go, I will call you again later.

181
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,660
Where in the world were you?

182
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,600
Why?

183
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,520
    Ji Eun Ho's Autobiographical Essay  is Uncovered as a Complete Lie 

184
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,800
At times like these, it looks like we can depend on the essayist herself to help us out.

185
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:34,440
Ah, Jae Ho. Is Ra Il home now?

186
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,180
Would you send Ra Il to my home?

187
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,760
Mi Na has been bugging me, saying they need to finish the coloring book they were working on together.

188
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,760
 Victim Seo Jung Eun's Father Claims "Entire Family is Suffering" 

189
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:58,900
 Mr Seo said "During the writing process, Ji Eun Ho became deeply lost in his feelings for his first love, and began pressuring Ms. Seo, to the point that she is now, mentally, like a slave." 

190
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,260
- Just one question!
 - Hold on!

191
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,880
Hold on.

192
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,640
We will state our position officially, so please wait just a little bit.

193
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,000
Is it true? All of it?

194
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,220
I have been Ji Eun Ho— No, Park Hyun Soo's friend for twenty years.

195
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,400
I know about him better than anybody.

196
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,340
I'm putting my name on the line to say, that article is completely one-sided, fabricated, and distorted.

197
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,880
That person who's saying he's Eun Dong's father,

198
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,340
why would he say something like that if it's not true? For what reason?

199
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:46,200
Then, are you saying there would be a reason for Ji Eun Ho to be stalking a married woman?

200
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,720
  If you all are true reporters, 

201
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:56,720
shouldn't your first step be to question why that so-called father is making false statements?

202
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,060
Why is Father doing this?

203
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,560
Your know your father's special love for Jae Ho.

204
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,800
He is doing everything he can to protect your and Jae Ho's relationship.

205
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,760
This make no sense.

206
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,960
Is that why he lied like that?

207
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,040
- I need to meet with Dad. 
 - Jung Eun, what are you going to do with Ra Il?

208
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,890
Ra Il is...

209
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,940
Ji Eun Ho's son.

210
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,820
Mom...

211
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,820
I found my memories.

212
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,270
I remember everything.

213
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,200
How about Ji Eun Ho?

214
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,510
No... He doesn't know yet.

215
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,280
Why don't you tell him?

216
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,830
Ra Il...

217
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,070
I have to protect Ra Il.

218
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,910
When it comes to Ra Il, Jae Ho's love for him

219
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,030
is genuine.

220
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,080
Also, if Hyun Soo Oppa knew...

221
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,910
This problem is complicated.

222
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,830
Hello?

223
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,750
Oppa, are you okay?

224
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,350
Yeah.

225
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,690
During the ten years that I wasn't there,

226
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,710
was your adoptive father abusive to you by any chance?

227
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,660
- Oppa...
-  I just suddenly got that thought. 

228
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:01,370
Even  if he is just your adoptive father, how could he report a story like that without so much as a care?

229
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,260
I need to find out how you lived until now.

230
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,760
No, Oppa. It wasn't like that.

231
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,570
I'll meet with my father and talk to him.

232
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,570
I'll fix this.

233
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,450
I'm sorry.

234
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,640
 It doesn't matter what happens to me. I'll be fine, regardless. 

235
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,630
My concern is you.

236
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,950
I will take care of my own problem. Don't worry.

237
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,710
Oppa, I'll call you later.

238
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,300
Don't worry. Everything is going to work out.

239
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,300
 Did you eat yet? 

240
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,670
I'll eat later.

241
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,270
I'll call you once I'm done with work.

242
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,470
You have to eat well.

243
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,860
You have to eat well too, Oppa.

244
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,940
  Go meet with Chief Jo. 

245
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,450
Let's face this head-on.

246
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,340
Tell them to start the search and seizure.

247
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,090
Once they start shaking, they'll find we've got dust (i.e. wrongdoings) everywhere. And you think we're the only ones?

248
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,400
As long as they're searched, all of the companies will be found guilty.

249
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,410
Tell them to do it.

250
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,150
This is a situation where either you or I might even get arrested.

251
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:21,350
When President Hwang was here, amidst his gambling scandal, on top of the breach of trust, there was the double financing and the rigged accounting.

252
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,160
Do you understand how serious these problems are?

253
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,120
In addition to that, what are you going to do about President Hwang manipulating stock prices under your name?

254
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,440
President Hwang, where is he now?

255
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,820
Rumor is he's stuck in Macao because of his gambling debt.

256
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,250
They say he can't leave or  go anywhere.

257
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,240
Even if he could return, he's not someone who would testify for us anyway.

258
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,480
Hello?

259
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,410
Reporter Park, why don't you answer any of your calls?

260
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:52,350
Hyung. You know how Chief Jo's goal right now is to ruin you?

261
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,370
Well, I heard she had offered President a deal to come over to her company.

262
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,460
I see the president in a whole new light now.

263
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,030
He's got so much loyalty for you!

264
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,520
- Have you seen the article about Ji Eun Ho? 
- Why does it have to be a married woman?

265
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,650
It doesn't make any sense.

266
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,230
Ms. Writer, you got here first.

267
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,980
Because of my father...

268
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,200
The part about you being married is indeed a problem.

269
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,270
The public usually only focuses on what they want to see.

270
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,420
I will go and meet with the reporter.

271
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,140
I will make it so that it won't be difficult for Oppa.

272
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,180
If Hyung finds out, he'll probably be against that.

273
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,080
Even at this moment, he's only worried about you getting hurt.

274
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,260
We've actually got a bigger problem than that.

275
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,510
There's a possibility that Hyung might get arrested.

276
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,380
You know a person named Jo Se Ryeong, right?

277
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,940
 Two years ago when our company merged with another company, 

278
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,420
 I think there were a lot of tough problems that came up. 

279
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,040
 At that time, Chief Jo really went out on a limb for us. 

280
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,020
  The accounting firm of DM Entertainment is affiliated with Myung Sung Group. 

281
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:33,680
 If the company is seized and searched for the audit, things are going to get really difficult for Eun Ho. 

282
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:50,470


283
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,980
Hello.

284
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,820
It seems burdensome to greet each other like that.

285
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,570
How much do you know?

286
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,030
What's the reason?

287
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,880
What do you mean?

288
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,870
Your reason for harassing Ji Eun Ho,

289
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,740
I want to know.

290
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,920
You're saying I'm harassing him?

291
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,690
The reason for backing my husband,

292
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,550
is that also to harass Ji Eun Ho?

293
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,680
Is that what it is?

294
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,840
Shouldn't you be begging me

295
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,720
to protect Ji Eun Ho, to please not destroy Ji Eun Ho?

296
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,070
Shouldn't you be doing that?

297
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,110
If I do,

298
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,050
would you do all those things?

299
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,760
No.

300
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,110
I don't want to.

301
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,600
What is it that I need to do

302
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,090
for you to leave Ji Eun Ho alone?

303
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:24,610
Go back to America and don't ever come back again.

304
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,940
 Ji Eun Ho will end up losing everything because of you. 

305
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,100
His fame. Money.

306
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,160
And in the end, even you.

307
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,590
If you harass Park Hyun Soo,

308
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,890
I won't just stand and watch it happen.

309
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:49,350
Jo Se Ryeong. You are the heiress of  Myung Sung Group, aren't you?

310
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,390
The heiress of a major conglomerate like this,

311
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:58,690
the actions she takes, just because things aren't working out the way she wants with the man she has a one-sided crush on,

312
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,350
the world will know about it. All of it.

313
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,350
The things you did when you came to the store where I worked, each and every single thing—all of it.

314
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,400
Are you threatening me right now?

315
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,970
To someone who is used to threatening,

316
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,830
I can see how they could hear this as a threat.

317
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,420
I will repeat that threat for you then.

318
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,610
Listen well.

319
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,900
Don't harass Ji Eun Ho.

320
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,200
I put up with you trying to humiliate me,

321
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,760
however,

322
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:49,890
you harassing Ji Eun Ho, I won't stand for it.

323
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:03,320


324
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,020
Hey, where did you go?

325
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,400
I just met with Ms. Writer.

326
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,490
What? Hey, why would you go and meet with someone I can't even go see?

327
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,750
She said she'd take care of the problem with her dad.

328
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,330
You should have stopped her! Why would she...What...Why... Why would she go and meet with her dad?

329
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,360
I did. I tried to stop her but,

330
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,620
"Yes I understand. I'm a just weak woman."

331
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,240
Do you think she would've said that and just left?

332
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,000
Right.

333
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,110
It'll get figured out somehow.

334
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,560
Let's figure it all out tomorrow.

335
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,320
Hyung, I'm always on your side.

336
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,420
If you are arrested, then I will follow you into jail.

337
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,330
Ah, this guy is going to jinx us.

338
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,320
Hyung, I have something to confess.

339
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,790
- What?
- Honestly, the reason why I'm doing this work is because of you.

340
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,910
Hey, a long time ago you said with your own mouth

341
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,920
that you got into this because of actor Kim Min Seok.

342
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,370
I did. When it comes to acting, Kim Min Seok is a hundred times better,

343
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,820
but to me, Hyung, you are way cooler.

344
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,060
Hey, punk! That makes me feel worse, you punk.

345
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,000
Hey!

346
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,880
I'm feeling kind of depressed so cheer me up by doing that impersonation you used to do of Kim Min Seok.

347
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,550
This might be the last time, but I'll do it for you.

348
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,940
What are you doing? You took away a Wisteria card and  put in a Rain Pi card from under your seat?

349
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,030
Do I look stupid, you bastard?

350
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,470
 - Do you have proof?
- Proof? I have proof. 

351
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,960
 I don't think you want to give that Ddong combination to me.  This card! This is what you want to give to him!

352
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,680
Does this card make Jjang combination?

353
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,800
Everybody, look at this! He tried to give this to create  the Jjang  combination so he can win.

354
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,950
 Stop it! Is that Jjang combination? 

355
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:07,170
 Don't take sides with him. I will kill you.   Bring a hammer.

356
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,970
- Do you really have to do this way?  
 - Are you incompetent? 

357
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,720
 Incompetent?  

358
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,570
If I can't do it, I will bet on my wrists. Tie both of them.

359
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,530
Are you ready? Should we go?

360
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,790
Okay. At this time I will start  confirming the cards.

361
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:24,400
♫   Jja la la jjat, jja la la jjat, kung jak jak, kung jak jak   ♫

362
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,430
- ♫   Dda ree ri ra   ♫  Uhh...Is this a cherry blossom card?
- A cherry blossom card!

363
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,080
I saw it. I clearly saw you taking out the card from there. I am sure.

364
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,900
 Didn't you learn that you should not bet on it if you are not sure? 

365
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,600
  Why are you not smashing your brother's hands? 

366
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,110
 Hey! Hey! Bash this punk's wrists. 

367
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:41,590
When I read the essay memoir, it says she was adopted. He's her adoptive father, not biological father.

368
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,180
What are you going to do?

369
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,070
We need to counter attack with a strong, high-handed move so that we can shut this down.

370
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,800
Publish those and make sure it gets around. I'm going to sue that news company.

371
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,930
You don't want to try meeting him once, that man calling himself her father?

372
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,900
Only if there was any value to meeting him. Did you read the book?

373
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,220
Of course I read it.

374
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,160
Hyun Soo and I have been friends since we were seventeen years old.

375
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,940
There is no one who knows Hyun Soo and Eun Dong's story better than me.

376
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,410
I get it for now.

377
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,370
I've got to go. I'll put my trust in you.

378
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:21,980
Ji Eun Dong is Player Choi Jae Ho's wife.

379
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:27,340
He's a very unfortunate baseball pitcher who got into a car accident right after being scouted by the Major Leagues.

380
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,840
The Nexen coach is Pitcher Choi Jae Ho's father-in-law, right?

381
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,650
Then the person claiming to be her father, his claim could be considered credible.

382
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,340
It's not just credible, it's a fact.

383
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,180
I see.

384
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:45,900
According to Sports Reporter Kang, I heard that you are sponsoring  Player Choi Jae Ho.

385
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,720
If I may ask, the reason you're sponsoring him is possibly...

386
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,600
What do you mean, possibly?

387
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,580
Are you saying that I'm backing Player Choi Jae Ho

388
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,940
because I have feelings for Ji Eun Ho?

389
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,200
I didn't mean to say that was exactly the reason...

390
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,520
I'm not one who has a lot of time to spare.

391
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,100
I will sum it up in a nutshell and excuse myself.

392
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:16,670
Ji Eun Dong's father's claims are all true.

393
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:27,830
 The fact that Ra Il is not Son-in-law Choi's son, 

394
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,110
 did you know that all this time? 

395
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,900
 Are you Miss Seo Jung Eun's guardian? 

396
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,890
 Yes, that's right. 

397
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,810
 Ah, the results from the blood test just came out. 

398
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:47,020
 Miss Seo Jung Eun is pregnant. 

399
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,350
 What? 

400
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:53,230
 What did you just say? 

401
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:57,210
 Our Jung Eun is pregnant? 

402
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,930
 You didn't know? 

403
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:03,020
 It's been over a week since the accident. Considering she has not yet regained consciousness, 

404
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,020
 it looks like we're going to have to run some brain scans. 

405
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,870
 Since she's pregnant, it would be harmful to do a CT scan since that would expose her to x-rays. 

406
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:13,070
 So we'll just perform an MRI. Can you please complete the consent form for medical treatment? 

407
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,690
 Is Jung Eun 

408
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,660
  awake? 

409
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,560
  Not yet. 

410
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:40,040
 Jung Eun is pregnant. 

411
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,910
 Did you know about it? 

412
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,880
 Is it your baby? 

413
00:33:54,310 --> 00:34:01,340


414
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,610
 It's my child. 

415
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,220
I wanted to believe you.

416
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,810
You told me with your own mouth that Ra Il was your son.

417
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,320
You already knew that he wasn't.

418
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:36,050
It was for your own good. Wasn't that what you had wanted?

419
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,750
You probably believed it for yourself, Father.

420
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,770
What did you say?

421
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:43,880
You probably thought I would become your pride and glory.

422
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,150
You probably never thought I would continue to be unable to walk.

423
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:53,310
It's fine even if you misunderstand me,

424
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:58,320
but I was sincere with my affection toward you.

425
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,180
I was the same.

426
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:05,220
My love for Ra Il is genuine.

427
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,350
Ra Il is my child.

428
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,930
Why did you do it?

429
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,750
You should have just said it wasn't your child back then.

430
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,580
It's because of Jung Eun,

431
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,260
because I sincerely loved her.

432
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,730
 Just because my love is unrequited, that doesn't mean my love is not true love. 

433
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,980
No one knows

434
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,160
how much I've truly loved Jung Eun.

435
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:43,120
But since that man has appeared, everything has gotten messed up

436
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,490
for me as well...

437
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,450
For me as well... Jung Eun is my first love, too.

438
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,890
Don't be affectionate with Ra Il any more.

439
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:01,580
You're not even blood-related anyway.

440
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,450
I'm different from you.

441
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,720
What did you say?

442
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,780
Why did you only take my side?

443
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,210
Why?  Because I was holding your life line?

444
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,380
Even though she's not your birth child, Jung Eun is your daughter.

445
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,120
Why didn't you take your daughter's side?  Why'd you only take my side?

446
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,600
It hurts my heart so much even when Ra Il just hurts his finger.

447
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,740
How could you, Father?

448
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,490
How could you not once take Jung Eun's side?

449
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:37,700
I wanted to help you recover and make a comeback out on the field.

450
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,660
That was my goal.

451
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:44,700
You were like another self to me.

452
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,700
That's why you don't know what I feel.

453
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,860
Ra Il is my son.

454
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:00,840
No matter what anyone says, Ra Il is my son.

455
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,850
I've handled and smoothed out most of the mess.

456
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:25,570
It looks like her father did it to protect his son-in-law.

457
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,040
You're making quite the effort.

458
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,850
It's not just a couple of things that need to be blocked.

459
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:46,340
You know you've been replaced as the main character in the movie? And there's a vicious rumor spreading about that.

460
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,860
It's just a never-ending line of yellow corvina fish (i.e. bad news).

461
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:58,700
Why didn't you go to Chief Jo?

462
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,930
She probably would have given you a lot of money, too.

463
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,160
That time when you were injured from getting hit by me,

464
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,940
why did you say you got that injury on your own, twenty years ago?

465
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:20,520
There are a lot of things I'm going to have to take care of. I have a headache from all the trouble you've caused.

466
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,330
Go home. Ji Soo will be calling.

467
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,660
I'm not going home.

468
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,170
What?

469
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,530
I love Na Eun Shil.

470
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,780
Hey you bastard, you—

471
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:40,490
So is only a  twenty year love considered love, but a twenty day love isn't love at all?

472
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,780
You know, honestly,

473
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,710
I was always your shadow. Ji Eun Ho's manager. Puppet President.

474
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:54,530
Who acknowledges me in this whole company?

475
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:58,730
Even my decisions get overthrown just with your one word.

476
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:06,240
But that girl thinks that I'm really great.

477
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,900
She says I'm the coolest in this world.

478
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,820
She said I'm way more handsome than you.

479
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,860
It's funny, right?

480
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,170
Being acknowledged,

481
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:24,940
you wouldn't know much about that. For a man,

482
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:29,190
a woman who recognizes and appreciates him,

483
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,650
he wants to protect a woman like that, forever.

484
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:35,130
Hey, whatever the case, you shouldn't be doing this to Ji Soo.

485
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,900
But Eun Ho,

486
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,890
I want to keep this love for a long time.

487
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,570
So don't try to talk me out of it.

488
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,010
You know I never try to persuade you either.

489
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:26,740
Why did you do it? If you ruin Ji Eun Ho,

490
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,560
what good do you get out of it?

491
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,480
You... Why didn't you tell me sooner?

492
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,140
Why did you wait until now to say that Ra Il's biological father is that punk, Ji Eun Ho?

493
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:49,500
If I had told you any sooner, what would have changed for you?

494
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,900
Is Jae Ho a victim in your eyes?

495
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,610
"You must be good to Jae Ho, no matter what."

496
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:03,210
"You just need to keep in mind that you're the one in the wrong." Why am I in the wrong?

497
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:07,550
What about the time I have lost?  What about the man I love?

498
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,310
The people who separated us were you and Rae Il's dad...

499
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:17,540
No, that person Choi Jae Ho.

500
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:22,400
I did not love Choi Jae Ho.

501
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,740
Jae Ho loved you. He truly loved you.

502
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,720
That isn't love. It's greed and obsession.

503
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:37,380
Jae Ho isn't the one who's being obsessed and being greedy. It's you and that punk who are.

504
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,470
How is that obsession and greed?

505
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,940
What did Hyun Soo Oppa and I do that was so wrong?

506
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,910
 I don't want to hear it! 

507
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:49,730
This is the thanks I get for raising you and clothing you?

508
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,440
For a young girl who had nothing,

509
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,720
Oppa gave me a will to live.

510
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,510
After my grandmother passed away,

511
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:05,370
do you know how I mentally endured on my own?

512
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,960
I endured with the thought of seeing him again.

513
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,780
Your beatings, your ill treatment,

514
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,190
I endured it all with the hope of seeing him again. But then,

515
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:24,490
I dated Jae Ho because I was scared of you, Father,

516
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,690
because you told me to date him.

517
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:35,590
That way, you wouldn't scold me.

518
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,100
What is the use of talking about the past?

519
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:46,790
Please meet with the reporters and tell them that it's not true.

520
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:51,830
If not, I will meet them. Please take care of it right away.

521
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:57,910
I won't forgive anybody who tries to destroy Ji Eun Ho.

522
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,140
Even if it's you, Father.

523
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,500
  Mi Na, Mom is home! 

524
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,450
Mom!

525
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,570
Aigoo. Are you having a good time?

526
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,160
Hello.

527
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,940
  I've been playing games with Oppa. 

528
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,930
- Is that right? 
- Uhm.

529
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:29,240
You are home. The dinner is set at the table—you just need to dish out the rice.

530
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,750
Yeah, thank you.

531
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,200
  Ra Il! 

532
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,660
Yes.

533
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,520
Come here.

534
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,330
- Mi Na, you keep playing with this. 
 - Yeah.

535
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,280
Just wait a little bit. Let's have dinner together.

536
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,900
Yes.

537
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,670
Do you want to sleep over tonight?

538
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,830
I need to go to school tomorrow.

539
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,400
I will take you to school.

540
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,820
I have to get my mom's permission.

541
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,500
I'll do that for you, too.

542
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:25,340


543
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,160
- Uh, Oppa. 
 - Yeah?

544
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,940
Okay, I will be there.

545
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,990
  - Ra Il! 
 - Yes? 

546
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,230
 Eat a lot. 

547
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,130
Yes.

548
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,180
It's Uncle!

549
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,480
Mom will get it.

550
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,230
Wow, did you see the Internet today?

551
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:14,030
I came close to becoming a dead man today.

552
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:15,110
  Uncle! 

553
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:19,540
Ah, Mi Na! You've been well?

554
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,600
  Hello 

555
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,940
Yeah...

556
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,350
Oppa, this is Seo Jung Eun's son.

557
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,710
Right. Hello!

558
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,670
Oppa, my uncle is really famous actor.

559
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,450
Yeah, Ji Eun Ho.

560
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,690
Do you know who I am?

561
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:48,630
Yes, you are famous, Ajusshi.

562
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:51,910
I saw you often on television.

563
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,630
  Oppa, let's eat together. 

564
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:05,510
Yeah, let's eat!

565
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,680
Eat a lot.

566
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,280
Yes.

567
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:32,420
Did you say your name is Ra Il?

568
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,360
Yes, I am Choi Ra Il.

569
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:40,550
Got it. I see you're full of life.

570
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:48,730
What do you want to be when you grow up, Ra Il?

571
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,470
A baseball player.

572
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:54,310
Becoming a baseball player like my dad.

573
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,330
Is that your dream?

574
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:04,080
My dream is for my dad to be able to walk soon.

575
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,410
 - Hello 
- Hello 

576
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:25,700
You are especially cute today.

577
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,320
Uh, I feel shy.

578
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:33,070
Why are you folding your arms? Hello.

579
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:35,250
What are you doing my friend?

580
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:40,310
  - We're here at the restaurant...  
 - Don't come in. 
 - So am I not your friend? 

581
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,710
Oppa.

582
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,530
What?

583
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:59,980
Hey! Why have been acting so weird since earlier? You have something to tell me, don't you?

584
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,060
Yeah.

585
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,760
What is it?

586
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,350
Oppa, listen to me carefully.

587
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,430
  Choi Jae Ho 

588
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:24,930
  Please take good care of Ra Il. 

589
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:28,810
  I'm sorry, he had a cold fever, but I forgot to send along the medicine. 

590
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:32,510
  Please don't let him sleep with the fan on, Doctor. 

591
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,170
What is it? Why are you acting this way?

592
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:48,320
No... That is...

593
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,320
Forget it, never mind.

594
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,330
  Ahjumma! 

595
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:05,710
  I'd like to order a glass of strawberry juice and a steak. 

596
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,580
Yes, I understand..

597
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,810
  Wow, it looks really tasty. 

598
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:15,740
  Cutting my steak. Suksak suksak suk... 

599
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:23,770
  Was it that day you had the accident? 

600
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:25,690
  I am sorry. 

601
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,720
  Oppa, you told me not to get hurt. 

602
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,340
  I got hurt too much, didn't I? 

603
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,280
  She was with child at the time of accident. 

604
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,920
  I think it must've been a pretty big traffic accident. 

605
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:48,230
  To protect the woman who was carrying his child, 

606
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:52,940
 her husband turned the handle and became crippled himself. 

607
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:05,710
  Jung Eun's son, Ra Il, is very ill. 

608
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:17,680
  Nothing is going to change. Don't worry, Oppa. 

609
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:28,330
  You know this, right? 

610
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:34,020
  Yeah, and this is exactly like us! 

611
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,090
  Does that man 

612
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:40,550
  sleep with his wife? 

613
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:43,320
  No. It's impossible. 

614
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,360
- Oppa—
- Don't say anything.

615
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,380
I have to hear it from her directly.

616
00:50:56,830 --> 00:51:00,140
Ra Il is sleeping at Mi Na's house.

617
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,280
Tell your mother about the issue with Ra Il.

618
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,240
Let's untangle everything that's gotten twisted and return everything to its proper place.

619
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,540
What do you mean, return everything to its proper place?

620
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,700
Ra Il isn't your son.

621
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,280
Jung Eun.

622
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,050
How can you say that?

623
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:33,100
You know how much Ra Il means to me, as well as how much I mean to Ra Il.

624
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,860
How can you say that?

625
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:38,870
I know.

626
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:44,000
That's why I came this far, but there is no other way.

627
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,290
Ji Eun Ho should know.

628
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:52,020
No, you can't.  You can't ever do that, Jung Eun.

629
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:55,650
You can't let Ji Eun Ho know.

630
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,200
Please, I beg you.

631
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:59,600
I'm thankful for everything you've done.

632
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:06,540
Your sincerity towards Ra Il, I know it's real.

633
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,110
What do you mean, thank you? For what?

634
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:13,570
Did I raise  another person's child?

635
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,030
Don't say things like that.

636
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,810
Ra Il isn't your son.

637
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:21,570
Jung Eun.

638
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,180
You can't do this to me.

639
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:29,000
That is exactly what I said to you ten years ago.

640
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:34,180
Jung Eun. You...

641
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,000
Has there not even been one single moment that you ever liked me?

642
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,670
We lived together for ten years.

643
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,330
Then we are a family.

644
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,610
I was your husband.

645
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,990
I was Ra Il's father.

646
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:02,570
Are you saying I was really nothing to you?

647
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:09,290
Even while washing your feet for ten years,

648
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:12,290
I didn't have a hard time,

649
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,310
because it was my wish

650
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,980
for you to walk.

651
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,010
The only thing that helped me endure it all,

652
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:33,240
was remembering that we had loved each other.

653
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:38,270
 That fate had led us to fall in love with each other. 

654
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:45,240
Although I didn't remember them myself,

655
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:48,260
those were memories that I had never doubted.

656
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,090
But,

657
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,670
they are fake.

658
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:05,190
There is nothing real

659
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,110
left between us.

660
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,240
There is no longer any need

661
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:21,240
for either of us to be sorry to one another.

662
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,220
  Hello? 

663
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:25,900
Oh, it's me. I'm in front of your house.

664
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,760
Come outside for a moment.

665
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,860
  Okay. I will. 

666
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:07,990
Ra Il...

667
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,350
Your son, Ra Il...

668
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:21,170
Is Ra Il

669
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,200
really that man's son?

670
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,830
My entire life,

671
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,270
I have never loved

672
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:55,490
another man besides you, Oppa.

673
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,840
Ra Il

674
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,410
is your son, Oppa.

675
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,200
What...

676
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:26,190
Why— Why didn't you tell me sooner?

677
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:28,140
Oppa.

678
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,650
Why didn't you tell me that sooner?

679
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:34,150
I was going to tell you, Oppa.

680
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:48,300
My son...

681
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,880
So, he's really

682
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,320
my son?

683
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:59,630
He's your son, Oppa.

684
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,250
Then that bastard,

685
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:22,440
as if my woman wasn't enough,

686
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,880
he stole my son as well.

687
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:30,860
- Stay here for a moment.
- Oppa, don't be like that.

688
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,920
I couldn't tell you sooner because I was afraid you might react this way.

689
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,660
Don't stop me.

690
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,230
Oppa!

691
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,230
I will take care of it on my own.

692
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,180
Stay here!

693
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,100
 Choi Ra Il 

694
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:48,430


695
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:08,480
  After you and Ra Il suddenly came into my life, it just took an instant to come to my senses. 

696
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,010
  My son, my woman. 

697
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:13,420
  - Do whatever you want.
- You can't take them. Never. 

698
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:14,940
  Have you mentally prepared yourself? 

699
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,430
  I've already made my decision. 

700
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:18,280
  Would you be willing to give everything up for that woman? 

701
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,330
  Just watch what I can do. 

702
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:22,820
  Ra Il. What's the code to your house? 

703
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:26,540
  - Jae Ho!
- I will be taking back my fiancée and my child. 

704
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,140
  I  

705
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:33,240
  will retire from my career as an actor.
