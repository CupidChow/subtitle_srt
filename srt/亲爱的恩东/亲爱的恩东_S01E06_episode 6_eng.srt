1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,450
 Hey, that's my fate! It looks like I'm going to get caught because of that elephant! 

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:14,210
 The thief let out an even weirder sound while he was hurriedly letting out that elephant sound. 

3
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,400
Ko Ko! Kee Kee!

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,000
Ko Ko! Ko Kiri Kiri!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,110
 - Ko Ko Kiri Kiri. 
- And it was crazy! 

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,090
 - Feet smell?
- Ahhhh! 

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,770
 Elephant foot odor! 

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,000
 Don't be like that!  

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,160
 Stop it!  

10
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:47,880

 My Love Eun Dong
Episode 6 

52
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,970
- Where did you go? 
- Ji Eun Ho.

53
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:44,800
I went out because he wanted to see me for a moment, but because he was busy, he left.

54
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,820
If you're famous and popular, can you be that selfish?

55
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,570
I think he's so one-sided.

56
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,130
Since he did that to Eun Dong, that's why she got mad.

57
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,000
He did whatever he wanted with Eun Dong, so she got hurt.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,240
Do you know how much Eun Dong loved Hyun Soo?

59
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,480
She was going to break up with her boyfriend.

60
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,160
How do you know that?

61
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,450
Huh?

62
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,800
How do I know that? How could I know that?

63
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,700
I wrote it. I wrote the book.

64
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,590
Eun Dong must have really loved Hyun Soo.

65
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:53,450
You never know. Eun Dong could have loved Hyun Soo a lot more than he loved her.

66
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,600
But Ji Eun Ho wouldn't know that.

67
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,680
Because...

68
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,980
Let's sleep.

69
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,740
 Who is it? 

70
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,670
Oh my! You scared me! Hyung!

71
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,860
Is someone inside?

72
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,860
What?

73
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,720
Are you with your girlfriend?

74
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Not right now, but she should be here soon.

75
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,600
Is something wrong, Hyung?

76
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,830
Did you deliver her the fruits well?

77
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,070
Dong Kyu.

78
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,050
You...

79
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,730
That writer...

80
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:36,670
How did your cousin and that writer meet?

81
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:44,870
When Noona was in America for a seminar, that writer was her part-time translator guide.

82
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,980
The writer wrote some kind of speech to the seminar sponsor for her. Then they got closer.

83
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,210
But, is something seriously wrong?

84
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,650
Why did she live like that?

85
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,410
So far away...

86
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,020
Her husband got into an accident too...

87
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:16,630
 Yes. She really suffered a lot because of it. You heard it, right? 

88
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:23,150
 Her husband was a baseball player, Choi Jae Ho and was scouted to play in the Major Leagues, 

89
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:29,110
 but as he got into the accident, he turned the handle last minute to protect his girl, 

90
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,430
 so that writer wouldn't get hurt. 

91
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,720
But Hyung, seriously. Why are you like this?

92
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,450
That writer...

93
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,820
You said she was having a hard time, right?

94
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,500
Because of her husband's hospital bills, she's been working extremely hard.

95
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,760
They must have no money.

96
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,340
Dong Gyu!

97
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,070
 Shhi. Hold on 

98
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,510
  What happened? 

99
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,450
Dong Gyu.

100
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,170
Find out about that writer.

101
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,340
Where her part-time job is.

102
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,520
If she isn't hurt anywhere.

103
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,630
How hard it is to live where she lives.

104
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,830
If she's eating well.

105
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,610
And...

106
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,110
Now,

107
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,310
if she rides a bicycle, does she not fall?

108
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,050
Eun Dong.

109
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,420
I'll make you smile.

110
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,640
Until you remember me,

111
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,360
I,

112
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,550
as if nothing's wrong,

113
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,420
will do that.

114
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,470
I'm an actor.

115
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,860
Until your memory returns,

116
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,790
I can do well.

117
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,490
He's going to do a movie after this drama, right?

118
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,280
Yes. He's going into a $150 million production.

119
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,010
Please have a seat.

120
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,780
I'll invest in that then.

121
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,110
Well, we  have a lot of investors.

122
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,790
- How about the joint investment with Jamie?
- Aigoo.

123
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,970
There's the matter of the joint drama with China this time,

124
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,110
and the actresses from last year's filming are not good at all.

125
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,370
Therefore, we don't want to receive stratagem support for a while.

126
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,970
Ji Eun Ho passionately does it all by himself,

127
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,790
and Hyun Soo doesn't like it.

128
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,480
He doesn't have any interest in money.

129
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,230
- The script seemed good. 
- You read it?

130
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,830
Of course. The only things that I read other than non-fiction,

131
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,240
are Ji Eun Ho's scripts.

132
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,580
I'm thinking about officially starting an entertainment business.

133
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,830
I need your help.

134
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,220
Well, if you just order me to,

135
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,820
I will do everything.

136
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,950
I'll give you time. Please think about it.

137
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,410
Yes, I understand.

138
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,540
But, did you make me come here to tell me that?

139
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,900
If you don't feel well, shall I ask them to delay the filming?

140
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,180
I'll call them.

141
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,070
Just go.

142
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,760
Will you be okay?

143
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,640
Don't talk to me and just go!

144
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,770
I'm sorry.

145
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,990
Let's go quickly.

146
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,060
You... Go as soon as we arrive.

147
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,430
Okay.

148
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:06,250


149
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,890
We will have a rehearsal, as the script has been revised.

150
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,420
We will do the screen shot first.

151
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,100
Your face doesn't look too well today.

152
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,750
Is there something wrong?

153
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:24,620
You... How long has it been since you married Suk Hoon?

154
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,940
It's been about five years.

155
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,130
Do you still love him?

156
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:35,140
I don't know. Do you only live for love?

157
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,020
Even if you have a husband,

158
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,110
do other men come into your eyes?

159
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,380
Of course.

160
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,680
How about me?

161
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,710
How am I as a man?

162
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,080
Oppa.

163
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,030
What I mean is...

164
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,140
In the eyes of a married woman,

165
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,390
am I seen as a man?

166
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,160
You see me as a man. Right?

167
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,040
Oppa, I...

168
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,440
Well... Of course...

169
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,250
The thing is...Yes.

170
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,550
Of course, I see you as a man.

171
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,660
Right?

172
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,380
But even so, I still love Suk Hoon.

173
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:29,590
And it's not like you and him don't know each other.

174
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,170
This industry is small.

175
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,460
What are you saying?

176
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,410
- What? 
- Forget it.

177
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,740
Forget it! Go.

178
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,980
What's up with him?

179
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,430
Oh, Hyung!

180
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,280
Long time, no see. I haven't seen you in a while.

181
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,000
Wow, you look the same.

182
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,010
What are you doing these days?

183
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,900
I was running a business.

184
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,100
Living seemed so lacking so I decided to act again.

185
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,530
I'm Jo Min Hyuk.

186
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,180
I'm embarrassed. I don't even come out in a lot of scenes.

187
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,840
Yeah, I heard.

188
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,660
Let's do well.

189
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,360
Would my talent go far?

190
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,340
I found it! I found the tape!

191
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,720
Team Leader, it was wrong. There was a shortage no matter how much I tried to stop it.

192
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,900
They said their contract with him ended.

193
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,620
It's because you're doing it after a long time.

194
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,260
Hey, hold the cue card properly. I can't see.

195
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,160
Don't get annoyed.

196
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,900
I understand.

197
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,230
Go!

198
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,020
I found it! I found the tape!

199
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,970
Team Leader, it was wrong.

200
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,920
It's beyond our ability no matter how much I tried to stop it. They said their contract with that Katra punk ended.

201
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,220
Oxidental stan—  Ah.

202
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,520
Oxidental Standard betrayed us. Sa—

203
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,840
Sahwail— Cut. Cut.
- Ahh.

204
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,890
I found it! I found the tape!

205
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,650
It's beyond our ability. Katra service is beyond our service.

206
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,250
Oximetal— Ahh!

207
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,630
It's not working.

208
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,190
What is it?

209
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,930
I'm filming right now. Filming.

210
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,750
Oh, yeah.

211
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,350
 I love you. Yeah. 

212
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,660
Hey, we're filming right now.

213
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,950
- We're filming right now. 
- Oh, we can't pick up phones?

214
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,500
Did you lose your instinct after not doing it for a long time?

215
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,270
What instinct are you talking about? The fruit?
(Persimmon sounds the same as instinct)

216
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,110
What did you say, you punk?

217
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,520
What are you saying?

218
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,030
Hey, you punk!

219
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,530
What's wrong with them?

220
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,300
Are you joking around?

221
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,890
I never liked you. Is this somewhere you can come when you want and leave when you want?

222
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,890
What? You started acting again because you were bored?

223
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:56,270
Hey, you punk! Because of guys like you, the real actors get cursed out!

224
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,250
Do you think  shit actor,  or  sloppy acting —those words came out nowhere?

225
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:05,450
- This punk. Do you think you can just say anything? Just because I treated you like a hyung. 
- What? You punk!

226
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,500
How did you even get to the top?

227
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,470
You were able to because you took the role instead of me!

228
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,090
Hey, you punk!

229
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,940
You became more of a piece of trash after ten years.

230
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,130
What's wrong? Stop!

231
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,330
Stop him! Stop him!

232
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,570
Let go of me, you punk!

233
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,680
We will contact  you after rescheduling, tomorrow.

234
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,640
Please enter.

235
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,240
Go!

236
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,380
Go to the office immediately.

237
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,050
Yes, Hyungnim.

238
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,190
Please wait a moment.

239
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,020
Yes, welcome!

240
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,950
Ah, this?

241
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,180
Hello?

242
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,200
How'd it go?

243
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,590
-  What do you mean?  
- What did you find out?

244
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,650
 Find out what? 

245
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,020
 Eighty-four customers stopped by,  

246
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,880
and the part-time pay is $7 per hour.

247
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,950
She works Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Three days. She works six hours each day.

248
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,280
 But there are a lot of customers.  

249
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,140
I think she's been working without eating lunch.

250
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,310
But Hyung, can't I just ask one thing?

251
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,570
No, you can't. Don't ask me anything.

252
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,250
Just answer my questions.

253
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,580
 Why do I have to watch this writer? 

254
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,700
You... Find out who the owner of that shop is.

255
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,900
How it's managed... Go talk to the management office for the outlet

256
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,330
and meet that shop's owner.

257
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,180
 What do you want me to do after meeting her?  

258
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,690
Buy that shop!

259
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,120
 What? 

260
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,910
 Just let him meet that girl.  

261
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,220
Tell him she was pregnant when the accident happened.

262
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,130
Tell him when she met Eun Ho, she was two-timing with  her present husband as well.

263
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,810
When he finds out about Eun Dong, be sure to tell him

264
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:14,340
that she was pregnant when the accident happened,

265
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,230
and that Ji Eun Ho— No—

266
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,470
That when she met Park Hyun Soo, she had another man's child in her belly.

267
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,580
There's no way. She really loved Hyun Soo.

268
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:31,170
We need to end Ji Eun Ho's love. We need to make his love, not real love.

269
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,910
 We need to make him get out of that fantasy.  

270
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,750
Did you finish filming?

271
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:09,000
- Lock the door.
- Hey, why are you like this?

272
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,140
 You little punk! 

273
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,230
 What was that? What's going on? 

274
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,530
- Hyun Soo! 
- Don't call me Hyun Soo, you punk.

275
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,160
Hey, Eun Ho.

276
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,720
You knew I was looking for Eun Dong more than anyone else.

277
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,960
- You saw her and what? 
- You knew? That it was Eun Dong?

278
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,840
Why did you do it?

279
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,760
It's because I'm your friend! That woman

280
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,310
has a kid and a husband.

281
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,230
 I'm sorry. I was wrong. 

282
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,810
 When I first met that woman, I thought I was going to faint. 

283
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,350
How could something like this...

284
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,110
 After I found out that writer was Eun Dong, 

285
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,230
 I had so many thoughts! 

286
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,400
 What do you know? 

287
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,690
How I carried a piece of trash like you all the way up to this point.

288
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,830
About my memories of Eun Dong,

289
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,060
you are the  only one  who remembers them with me!

290
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,150
That's why I brought you this far. Do you even know that, you punk?

291
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,110
You're still the same.

292
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,460
There are two kinds of people in the world.

293
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,130
Eun Dong and the rest of the world.

294
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,540
When she got into an accident, apparently she was carrying a child.

295
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,580
The accident must have been big.

296
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,060
Her husband, in order to protect his woman with a child,

297
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,380
twisted the steering wheel

298
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,520
and became handicapped.

299
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,140
I wish you would snap out of this mood.

300
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:15,450
To you, that woman was probably your all, your life and your destiny,

301
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,250
but that woman was carrying another man's child at that time.

302
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:28,170
There's no way. You don't know. No.

303
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,440
No one in the world knows

304
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,650
how much Eun Dong and I meant to each other.

305
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,260
I need to hear everything from Eun Dong herself.

306
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:46,280
Before that, I don't want to believe anyone.

307
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,550
What do you not want to believe?

308
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,650
To be quite honest, your feelings and whatever, are all history.

309
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,170
She has a husband and a kid. Doesn't that mean it's over?

310
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:07,410
And, how are you going to hear everything from a girl who doesn't remember anything?

311
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,380
Eun Ho.

312
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:18,320
Just forget everything and marry Director Cho.

313
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,140
Eun Dong and I...

314
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,220
Why do you think we became like this?

315
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,280
Why is loving this one girl so hard?

316
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,810
Others say that it all works out in due time.

317
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,250
How come it doesn't work that way for me?

318
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,100
You're not sleeping?

319
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,060
Yeah, I want to finish this before I sleep.

320
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:19,170
Where did you say you first saw me again?

321
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,580
- At the baseball field.
- Where was the baseball field?

322
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,200
When I was in twelfth grade and you were in eleventh grade in high school.

323
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,480
We met during an away-game in America.

324
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,280
Where in America?

325
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,230
Why are you so curious all of a sudden?

326
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,990
I became curious about all the events that happened before the accident.

327
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,230
I have to know.

328
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,280
Was I really in America when I was in high school?

329
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,920
I wasn't in Korea?

330
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,000
Of course.

331
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,850
Fine. You must be right.

332
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,980
There's no reason for you to lie to me.

333
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,750
Sleep.

334
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,300
Where are you going at this hour?

335
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,990
It's a bit stifling in here, so I'm going to go out for a bit.

336
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:57,260


337
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,150
♫   Your scent approaches me  ♫

338
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,980
♫   Left in my heart so I can't forget you  ♫

339
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:27,560
♫   My hidden feelings for you  ♫

340
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:33,620
♫   If you know how empty I am without you  ♫

341
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:43,310
♫   Your smile comes and finds me   ♫

342
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,670
♫   You make my hardened heart  ♫

343
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:51,500
♫   Flutter  ♫

344
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,000
♫   I keep thinking of your face   ♫

345
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,880
♫   You keep coming to mind   ♫

346
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:03,930
♫   What should I do with this widened heart?  ♫

347
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:07,490
♫   Putting you in my heart   ♫

348
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,970
♫   So you remain in me  ♫

349
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,100
♫   So it won't be different  ♫

350
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,120
 Why was Ji Eun Ho so curious about you? 

351
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,420
 He was so serious. 

352
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,370
 Who are you? Let's meet right now. 

353
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:27,440
 Let's meet right now. We should meet right now! I have to! 

354
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,730
♫   Seeking only you  ♫

355
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,770
♫   My heart is that way  ♫

356
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:46,250
 We met for such a short period of time, 

357
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,260
 and were separated for such a long time. 

358
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,580
♫   Should I say I want to be with you?  ♫

359
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,250
♫   Should I say I want to laugh with you?  ♫

360
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,190
♫   All the words I didn't say  ♫

361
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,760
♫   They're all going to explode  ♫

362
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,480
 Eun Dong. We have to meet again. 

363
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,180
 No. I'm going to meet you, 

364
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,360
 because I'm going to look for you until I find you. 

365
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:28,220
 Just as Eun Dong said, "A star that forms the latest shines brightly the longest." 

366
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,740
 If only we can meet late and shine bright for a long time, 

367
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,910
 I will wait. 

368
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:44,320
♫   I want to stay by your side a little longer  ♫

369
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,640
 If you're reading this book, 

370
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,150
 I would like to ask you to come back to me. 

371
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,450
 My feelings for you did not change at all. 

372
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:58,770
 I became more certain than I was ten years ago. 

373
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,530
♫   I am going to find you  ♫

374
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:07,190
 My love Eun Dong. You are always my reason for living. 

375
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,560
 In the ten years without you, 

376
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,250
 that reason became my life. 

377
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,100
♫   I, who breathe because of you ♫  

378
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,860
 I will wait. my love, Eun Dong. 

379
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,170
♫   Seeking only you  ♫

380
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:27,140
♫   My heart is that way  ♫

381
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,060
- Hello?
-  President Cho? 

382
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,150
 Hyun Soo's at the bar right now. 

383
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,260
One for me, too.

384
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,710
You should've gone somewhere far away where I couldn't find you.

385
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,540
You didn't pick up my phone calls and ignored my texts.

386
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,460
Then, you stay within my reachable range. What am I going to  do?

387
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:29,640
I will be drinking until I get drunk today.

388
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,710
So drink alone and be on your way.

389
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,160
What's so hard?

390
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,170
You're really funny.

391
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,130
Everyone thinks that their love is special.

392
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,670
They are mistaken in that they think there is no emotion higher than theirs.

393
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,590
I can't even get drunk today.

394
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,230
 Bermuda Triangle. 

395
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,340
Our love is exactly like that.

396
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,240
Bermuda Triangle. A triangle relationship.

397
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,200
I'm looking at you and you are looking at that girl whose existence you don't even know.

398
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,480
It will only end if someone from that triangle falls out and dies.

399
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,940
When I was seventeen,

400
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,190
I met this little girl.

401
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:39,200
She was like a meteorite that fell from the sky.

402
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,760
She came into my life just like that.

403
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,240
And ten years later,

404
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,810
that child became a woman and appeared in front of me again.

405
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,680
And Eun Dong and I started again.

406
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,150
As if we loved each other for many years,

407
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,200
my emotions grew big like a snowball.

408
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,810
Stop.

409
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,840
When I see her again, what my emotions will be like.

410
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:23,090
When I see Eun Dong, if I'll feel the same as I did back then,

411
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,450
just like ten years ago.

412
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,130
If I can love her again,

413
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,650
I was curious about these kind of things.

414
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:40,270
So, do you know now?

415
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,970
I'm not as cool and chic as you think I am.

416
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,800
At least, please don't tell me your true feelings in front of me.

417
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:09,190


418
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,090
Shall I turn on some music?

419
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,640
No.

420
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,670
Please drive slowly.

421
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:33,160
I have to go out once more, later on.

422
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,370
Slowly.

423
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,320
Please.

424
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,050
Our Ji Eun Ho. You are so foolish.

425
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,760
Hyung.

426
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,290
Hyung, wake up now.

427
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,920
You have an interview at the CINE program today.

428
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:34,860
Hurry! Hurry up and take a shower so we can go.

429
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,760
I'm hungry.

430
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,540
What do you want to eat?

431
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:47,300
Hey... Why did you come today instead of Ji Eun?

432
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,600
Ji Eun went to training today.

433
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,600
What do you want to eat?

434
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,530
Rice porridge.

435
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,110
What kind?

436
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,160
Just any rice porridge!

437
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,130
Okay.

438
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:28,550
 I took you home. I need to tell you so you remember and repay me someday. 

439
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:33,100
 Change your house pin number. I could intrude at any time.  

440
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:46,510
Rice porridge! Rice porridge! I told you to buy that!

441
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,600
We need hangover soup. Hangover.

442
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,240
You can't eat rice porridge. You'll immediately throw up.

443
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,810
He doesn't listen to the dying degree.
(In Korean, porridge and dying rhyme.)

444
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,030
Ah so hot!

445
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,370
- Hyung.
- What?

446
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,730
I think you're really cool.

447
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,820
What?

448
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:21,090
Hyung, you're a really cool man.

449
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,660
You didn't buy the porridge I wanted, but you are chattering now instead.
(In Korean, porridge and chattering rhyme.)

450
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:34,240
If I were a girl, I think I'd fall in love with you.

451
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,950
You... I think you're acting like this to help me get rid of the hangover.

452
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,140
But even if you don't say such things, I feel like throwing up.

453
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,560
So don't say such things. My stomach gets turned upside down.

454
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,460
Go over there.

455
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,650
Even if I look like this, I have very complicated relationships with women.

456
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,090
I've dated over ten girls.

457
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,300
And I've slept with all of them, too.

458
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,280
Are you bragging?

459
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,240
But how could you love just that one girl?

460
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,720
I respect you. I really do.

461
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,080
I will do my best for you from now on.

462
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,500
Yeah. Yeah.

463
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,080
When you finish eating and shower, I'll warm up the car.

464
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:31,640
Hey! Don't use that lotion!

465
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,080
And when I tell you to buy rice porridge, buy it!

466
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,700
 Now please get to your seats! Audiences! 

467
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,980
 Now, we will start recording in five minutes! 

468
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,830
  When we  record later, please cheer for them well. 

469
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,310
 Pretty Writer 

470
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,160
Sunbaenim, let's go.

471
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,330
  Whaaa! 

472
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:20,300
 Hello! It's Keum So Young's CINE interview! 

473
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:25,050
Today, we are bringing in our nation's best actor, Ji Eun Ho,

474
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:30,300
who just finished filming his movie,  Southern Islands,  with Director James, to speak with us today.

475
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,760
Nice to meet you.

476
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:42,330
The studio really does become brighter.

477
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:45,810
Oh you look twenty-thousand times more handsome in person.

478
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:46,870
Ah thank you.

479
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:50,170
- You must hear that very often. 
- I'm used to it.

480
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,760
Ah he said he was used to it.

481
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,880
I will stop with the compliments and start with the questions.

482
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,220
The subject of this new drama is, I have a lover.

483
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,360
Do you have a lover?

484
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,230
No, I don't.

485
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,650
 That's such a relief, isn't it? 

486
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:14,760
Now, I read your personal essay. The title is,

487
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,480
"My Love, Eun Dong."

488
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,960
Ah, that's right. "My Love, Eun Dong."

489
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,130
Have you received any news from Ji Eun Dong?

490
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:29,370
I told them not to ask him about that! That interviewer...

491
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,750
No, I haven't.

492
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,120
The thing I was curious about after reading the book was

493
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,600
when you read the book, it felt like if you manage to find Ji Eun Dong,

494
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,310
you plan to marry her.

495
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:50,290
But what if Ji Eun Dong is already married?

496
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,670
What will you do?

497
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,240
I'll just have to steal her away.

498
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,910
I'm just joking.

499
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,550
 I was so surprised! I thought you were serious. 

500
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,870
I will wait for her,

501
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,850
until that girl remembers me.

502
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,010
 The new drama starts airing on June 27th, right? 

503
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:44,340
 But after you finish, I heard you're... 

504
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,160
 What part are you going to take role of? 

505
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,850
 No.  We are not doing 

506
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:56,430
 the traditional marketing. 

507
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,400
 Most of my parts... 

508
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,910
I am sorry for calling you only when I need you.

509
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,300
That's fine.

510
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,750
I am not the only one enjoying this, right?

511
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,340
No, not at all.

512
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,890
I hope you don't get emotionally attached to me.

513
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,640
I'm not.

514
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:24,070
- Tell me if you need anything. Bonuses or— 
-  Money. 

515
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,180
Give me in cash. Cash.

516
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,580
Alright.

517
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,030
Hyung, you are scheduled for a one-million copies sold ceremony, signing event.

518
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,700
Should I cancel it?

519
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,710
Yeah... I won't go.

520
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,020
Yes.

521
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,440
You should meet the writer

522
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,620
 to say thank you for a million copies. 

523
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:18,530
No, why should I?

524
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,640
You want to see her.

525
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,170
All profits from the book sales are already promised for donation.

526
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,320
From my own money,

527
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,760
and don't tell her it is my money,

528
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,160
tell her it is a bonus for a high profit.

529
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,740
Will she be upset if I give her money?

530
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:45,760
Why would she? She'll be grateful!

531
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,390
Will she?

532
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,800
Then make it happen.

533
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,510
How much?

534
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,730
As much she wants.

535
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:58,950
What?

536
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,720
Give her enough to eat what she wants to eat,

537
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:11,570
buy what she wants to buy,

538
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,010
and do what she wants to do.

539
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:30,280
I love this smell the best.

540
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:36,870
Are you really meeting my father and the people from the league?

541
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,350
Yes, we are.

542
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:46,020
You are really charming.

543
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:50,720
I do believe you'll walk again.

544
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:57,130
I'll wait. Do you know what my wish is?

545
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:01,110
You taking three steps with me on your back.

546
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,990
That's it.

547
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:11,810
Jung Eun, come and hug me.

548
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,610
What's up with you this morning?

549
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,260
Do well at the meeting.

550
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,610
Okay?

551
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:31,490
Okay. I'll do well.

552
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:34,730
You are meeting Ra Il's teacher today, right?

553
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,840
You too, do it well.

554
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,210
Open his locker and check, and

555
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:44,380
find out who his best  friends are.

556
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,870
I'm worried because Ra Il is a bit melancholy these days.

557
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,610
I understand.

558
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:12,270


559
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:27,820
 I think Ra Il should attend international school. 

560
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,970
 Academics are not a problem, but 

561
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:34,410
 his emotional state is not suited to the Korean educational reality. 

562
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:38,550
 He's not naturally making any friends. 

563
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,550
 Are you alright? 

564
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,460
 You are doing fine. 

565
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:56,670
Now, let's give a kick this time if you feel up to it.

566
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,190
You did it! You did it so well!

567
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:06,080
I think you are getting some strength in your leg!

568
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,360
- Excuse me. 
 -Yes.

569
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,070
Please allow me to personally tell the doctor about my progress.

570
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,580
Of course, I understand.

571
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,340
 Let's do it slowly. That's right! 

572
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,940
 You did well. 

573
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,930
 Now then... 

574
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,060
Welcome!

575
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,990
Hello!

576
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,520
Yes...

577
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,950
I really came to get some clothes for my niece today.

578
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:44,340
Hold on.

579
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:53,080
Here, the clothes you had left the last time.

580
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,650
I told you they were your presents.

581
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,330
Customer,

582
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:03,250
you and I are not close enough to exchange gifts.

583
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:07,740
Why do you think that way?

584
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,360
How much do you get per hour?

585
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:16,430
I do these sort of things often. I also give money to the homeless, too.

586
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:19,220
In a capitalistic society, people like me

587
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,050
 should be generous to spread wealth to the needy. 

588
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:27,760
It is the same concept as the rich paying higher taxes on inheritance and income.

589
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,260
You can accept it.

590
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,110
You really are rude.

591
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:40,220
Did I upset you? It wasn't my intention.

592
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:44,840
Why can't you accept it casually? It's nothing!

593
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:50,490
Jewish people teach to donate to the poor.

594
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:54,670
For what reason? Pride.

595
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:57,520
 To protect their pride. 

596
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,230
Give it someone else.

597
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,680
I guess I wasn't a welcome guest today.

598
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:10,920
I'll get going or go to another store.

599
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,590
 Go Dong Gyu. 

600
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,820
Wow, what is this?

601
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,550
You want to eat here?

602
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:40,360
Are you bragging your wages increased, in front of me?

603
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:45,060
You are a funny guy.

604
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,990
Don't avoid her, Hyung.

605
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:15,250


606
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,830
Hello!

607
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,540
Writer Seo Jung Eun?

608
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,240
Oh.

609
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,580
The manager was supposed to come,

610
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,270
but I didn't expect you to come...

611
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:46,210
Please have a seat.

612
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:50,270
The manager told me

613
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:54,260
that you are very pretty, have kind eyes, and have a great body.

614
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:59,080
So, I was curious and asked him to let me meet you.

615
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,140
Did the manager really say that?

616
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,550
Yes.

617
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:10,010
That punk is someone who goes crazy over pretty girls.

618
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:17,230
Here. Look at this.

619
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,900
 Pretty Writer  

620
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,770
I need to change it, right?

621
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,260
Why?

622
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,120
It doesn't bother you?

623
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:33,070
Not at all.

624
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,610
Then, I'll just leave it.

625
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:58,690
But... I was very flustered that day,

626
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:03,260
when you told me to come out for a moment after calling me.

627
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:07,320
When I went out, you left, saying that you were busy.

628
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:15,250
That day...

629
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:18,680
I have an Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

630
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,500
That day, I suddenly... I'm sorry.

631
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,100
Oh my, if it happens during filming,

632
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,280
it must be very uncomfortable.

633
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:36,450
I must have been so nervous, since I was told you were very pretty.

634
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:43,130
But... You should be seeing pretty actresses almost every day.

635
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:48,390
Does that mean it keeps happening like this every time you see a pretty actress?

636
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,420
She's only pretty if  I  feel that she is.

637
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:03,240
I thought top stars like you would be very cocky

638
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,500
and such.

639
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:12,010
I am plenty cocky.

640
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:14,240
What?

641
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,250
If a perfect man like me were

642
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:19,980
to be humble as well,

643
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,260
wouldn't it seem very annoying?

644
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:26,520
So annoying.

645
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,360
What?

646
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,240
It's fine if you didn't hear it.

647
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,980
I have sharp ears, too.

648
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:41,220
I can see what

649
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,140
you're thinking about right now.

650
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,100
You got caught, right? You're surprised, right?

651
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,460
What was I thinking about?

652
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:02,490
"This man is reading my heart."

653
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:04,820
"Aigoo... So annoying."

654
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,200
Right?

655
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,070
No, I wasn't thinking that...

656
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,820
Then what were you thinking?

657
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:41,570
When I was writing your book, I was happy.

658
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:46,420
It was like I...

659
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,420
 Would you like to order? 

660
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:11,050
Ah, yes.

661
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,120
Please give us steak.

662
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,280
Please give me a sirloin and a tenderloin for her.

663
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,900
Please give me a medium-well done and her a well done.

664
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,380
Please don't add any sauce for the lady, either.

665
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,110
I read your heart, right?

666
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:38,580
Wow, you really did.

667
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:41,280
It's amazing.

668
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,500
What do you want to do?

669
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,280
What?

670
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,220
Do you have anything you want to do?

671
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:06,940
For example, a future dream?

672
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,700
He said a future dream.

673
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,830
A future dream for a thirty-three year old ajumma?

674
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,900
 Why are you laughing? 

675
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,800
So you became enemies with that director ever since?

676
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,420
It was because I dropped some vinegar red pepper paste sauce on his head without knowing that it was a wig.

677
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:48,330
Oh, what the heck? That doesn't even make sense.

678
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:52,060
I told you, I like things that don't make sense.

679
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:10,060
Ji Eun Dong, she must have been very happy.

680
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,490
What?

681
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:18,510
When she was dating you, she must have laughed a lot.

682
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,840
So she must have been really happy.

683
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,540
I really did want to make her happy,

684
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,640
but I couldn't.

685
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,200
So...

686
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,940
I plan to do that from now on.

687
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:54,480
I want to make that girl laugh a lot.

688
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,890
 It's time to close the restaurant... 

689
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:11,420
Ah... It's already closing time?

690
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,530
 I apologize. 

691
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:14,290
It's okay.

692
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,160
Shall we get up?

693
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,640
Yes.

694
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:45,240


695
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:56,030
 ♫ Could it really be you? ♫  

696
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:03,930
 ♫ My approaching heart is beating this quickly ♫  

697
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:06,650
 ♫ It's just a simple walk ♫  

698
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:12,170
 ♫ But why do I feel such a weight on my shoulders? ♫  

699
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:17,760
 ♫ It must have followed me breathlessly ♫  

700
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,690
 ♫ I finally get to walk ♫  

701
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:26,990
 ♫ After such a long time ♫  

702
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:32,110
 ♫ I want to let you know ♫  

703
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:33,890
I'll get off right now. 
 ♫ That I was watching you ♫  

704
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:35,890
 ♫ Constantly ♫  

705
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:38,330
Just stay here.

706
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:44,170
 ♫ I see you! I see you! In front of me, ♫  

707
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:49,890
 ♫ Like this with your slightly changing appearance, ♫  

708
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:53,530
 ♫ You are there ♫  

709
00:58:53,530 --> 00:59:00,840
 ♫ I hear you! I hear you! Anywhere and in my dreams, ♫  

710
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:05,380
 ♫ You, who couldn't hear me, ♫  

711
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:08,640
 He found out that Jung Eun is Eun Dong. 
 ♫ I hear your voice and breathing! ♫   

712
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,290
 Can I check the records of the students that graduated from here?    

713
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:14,720
  Yes. She finished the courses here. 

714
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,540
 I had someone else I loved, right?  

715
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,920
 Be careful.... Eun Dong. 

716
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,320
 Can I be a man?  

717
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,340
 I need to see the writer's face.  

718
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:29,200
 My heart trembles whenever I see that person.   

719
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,780
 I like that man.  

720
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,610
 ♫ Longing for you even more ♫  

721
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:42,050
 ♫ I wonder if you can hear it ♫
