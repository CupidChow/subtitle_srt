1
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,010
   

2
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,380
Happy acceptance day to you!

3
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,110
Happy acceptance day to you!

4
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,720
to our lovely Song Ah,

5
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,970
happy acceptance day to you!

6
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,250
After graduating from Seoryeong University School of Business, the envy of all high school moms in the country,

7
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,080
how does it feel to be the first line of students to gain acceptance into the School of Music at age 26?

8
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,060
But more importantly, who was your violin teacher anyway?

9
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,050
Thank you so much, Teacher.

10
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,880
Yoon Dong Yoon, if you actually taught her well, would she have needed to retake the exam four times?

11
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,310
 Yeah, you weren’t that great after all! 

12
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,160
  - Song Ah  
 - Hmm?

13
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,090
 Are you happy? 

14
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,080
Yeah. I’m happy.

15
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:47,350
   
   

16
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:54,380


17
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,340
   

18
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,200
   

19
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,040
   

20
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,090
   

21
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,650
Song Ah Unni, this was your club, right? The school’s amateur orchestra?

22
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,650
Yeah, the S.R.P.  back when I played full-time.

23
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,790
That’s right, S.R.P.

24
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,710
Why did we leave our school to perform at the arts center all the way out here?

25
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,020
That’s what I’m saying. At least pay for the taxi fees.

26
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,100
Are they saying we should just be grateful to be able to play at the arts center or what?

27
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,100
As if anyone hasn't performed here yet.

28
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,000
Me. I haven’t yet.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,610
I’m totally excited right now.

30
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,550
You’ve never performed here before, Unni?

31
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,770
How come?

32
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,380
You must have performed here with your orchestra at your performing arts high school.

33
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,000
Oh, you went to an ordinary high school, right?

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,910
Sorry.

35
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,660
It’s no big deal.

36
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,250
 Rehearsal will begin. Everyone, enter the stage. 

37
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,890
   

38
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,100
You’re 29, right?

39
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,650
- Yeah.
 - You’re the same age as Park Joon Young!

40
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,390
Then you must have gone to school together, right?

41
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,290
During your days at music school?

42
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,700
No.

43
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,330
We only graduated in the same year, I was still in business school then.

44
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,590
- This is also my first performance. 
 - Ah.

45
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,880
   

46
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,200
   

47
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,700
   

48
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,420
Oh come in, come in.

49
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,370
Now, this man here has just finished his national tour,

50
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,570
coming straight from the airport. Your most adored Sunbae,

51
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,150
Park Joon Young.

52
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,640
All right. Shall we begin?

53
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,980
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait.

54
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,520
First violins, in the very back, the final row.

55
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,540
Yes, you two.

56
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,040
Right now the violins are too loud so I think I'll have to take out a row.

57
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,280
You two won’t need to perform today, so go home.

58
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,210
And cello!

59
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,440
 Can’t you play a little more expressively? 

60
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,140
 It's molto espressivo. 

61
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,690
A high position.

62
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,610
Why are you still here?

63
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,810
What are you fidgeting around here for? I told you to go home!

64
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,330
That is—

65
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,960
I…

66
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,990
I practiced a lot for this.

67
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,220
What?

68
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:56,030
Couldn’t I perform together with you?

69
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,560
What’s your name?

70
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,330
It’s Chae Song Ah.

71
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,850
No, no, no, no.

72
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,950
I don’t want your apologies. What’s your name? 
 (T/N: "Chae Song" and "sorry" sound similar.)

73
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,170
M-My name is—

74
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:25,840
So, my name is— It’s Chae Song Ah, sir.

75
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,690
- Chae Song…
   - No! 

76
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,810
I asked for your name. Don’t you understand? “Name!"

77
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,720
Did I ask you to leave without reason?

78
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,170
The violin’s volume is too loud.

79
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,470
Are you the conductor?

80
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,910
Your positions here are ranked by performance, right?

81
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,440
Then you shouldn't have gotten last place!

82
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,610
Forgive me.

83
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,820
My hand slipped.

84
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,300
Sit down. Just play.

85
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,580
Let’s begin.

86
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,710
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

87
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,510
This just won’t work. You...

88
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,270
get out.

89
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,100
Don’t come in for today’s performance.

90
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,000
Now everyone!

91
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,990
Smile.

92
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,690
 Hey Song Ah, I’m at the arts center! 

93
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,000
 I’m here to see your performance! 

94
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,740
I’m here to buy some tickets.

95
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,450
I’m sorry, but we currently don’t have any more tickets remaining.

96
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,410
Not even a single ticket?

97
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,290
No.

98
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,250
Later when the performance starts, the stage will show up on the TV, right?

99
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,970
Yes, you can check it out then.

100
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,680
They show each member of the orchestra too, right?

101
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,790
No, this is purely for monitoring purposes, so it will focus on the piano.

102
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,470
- F-Focus on the piano? 
 - Yes.

103
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,890
Thank you very much.

104
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:12,240
What the heck? Is Park Joon Young the only performer?

105
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,950
   

106
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,490
 They didn’t have any more tickets, so I thought I’d watch you from the lobby TV, but they only show the piano. 

107
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,030
 It looks like I won't be able to see you. 

108
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,270
 Did you say you're going to America after grad school? 

109
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,640
 Probably? 

110
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,130
 But about Song Ah Unni, what happens after she graduates? 

111
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:46,150
The heck if I knew. I’m sure she’ll figure it out.

112
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,320
If you’re so curious, go ask her yourself.

113
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,450
It’s okay. It feels awkward to ask her about stuff like that.

114
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,370
 The concert will begin in 10 minutes. 

115
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,780
 All members please standby for entrance. 

116
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,920
- Let’s go.
- Yeah.

117
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,810
   

118
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,340
   

119
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,610
 Thank you for your letter and DVD. 

120
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,690
 Upon reviewing your materials, unfortunately, 

121
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,090
 I am unable to accept you into my studio 

122
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,000
 for the Master of Music Degree at Daleson University. 

123
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,380
 The soloist and conductor will enter now. 

124
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,700
You may enter now.

125
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,730
Hey, there.

126
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,810
If you want to see the stage,

127
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,970
you can go over there.

128
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,250
 I started to cry. 

129
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,710
 The music that spilled from him 

130
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,470
 burned so hot. 

131
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,220
 What’s contained within me 

132
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,990
 felt so small and pathetic in comparison. 

133
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,260
 I cried. 

134
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,330
You should come with me to the reception area.

135
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,910
Even Mr. Lee came.

136
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,270
No, don’t worry about it.

137
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,420
I know when I’m not wanted.

138
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,560
I already got tickets for the bus.

139
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,120
Yes, have a safe trip home. I’ll call you.

140
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,590
Okay.

141
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,900
But Joon Young…

142
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,810
your pay for this month’s performances…

143
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,190
Oh… you haven’t gotten them yet?

144
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,330
I’ll ask my company about it.

145
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,940
I’m sorry, Son.

146
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,330
Even so, your father has changed a lot these days.

147
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,740
I’m leaving now, okay?

148
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,830
Stay safe!

149
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,680
Go in!

150
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,340
Oh, Unni!

151
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,020
Why are you here? Didn’t you leave earlier?

152
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,850
Oh… t-that—

153
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:37,870
Ah right. I meant to ask you about this earlier.

154
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,630
Are you going to do the internship?

155
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,090
Huh?

156
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,320
Kyunghoo Cultural Foundation's summer internship.

157
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,800
Today's the last day to accept the spot.

158
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,380
I emailed them that I'm doing it.

159
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,980
I haven't yet.

160
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,060
What? You haven’t yet?

161
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,330
If you aren’t going to do it, it’d be better to reply now that you won’t.

162
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,360
It’s not that I’m not doing it.

163
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,130
I just haven’t decided yet.

164
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,670
Oh… I see.

165
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,820
Well, I’m going to use the restroom now. Goodbye.

166
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,270
Oh, Min Seong, where are you?

167
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,560
I’m at— Hmm?

168
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,220
One second.

169
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,460
Sorry, but could I take one more?

170
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,000
Yes.

171
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,120
Song Ah!

172
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,180
Thank you.

173
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,280
Congrats on your debut!

174
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,780
Just a moment.

175
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,350
 Then you shouldn't have gotten last place! 

176
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,850
   

177
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,910
How was it? Did you do well?

178
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,300
Good work today.

179
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,980
He told you good work!

180
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,860
Want to eat? You haven't eaten yet, right?

181
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,160
Want me to buy you meat?

182
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,040
I'll buy.

183
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,850
I congratulate you on the 60th year anniversary

184
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:36,150
of the Seoryeong University School of Music.

185
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:45,270
I think I have a special connection with Seoryeong University's School of Music.

186
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,330
Today's pianist, Park Joon Young,

187
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,670
studied here at Seoryeong's School of Music.

188
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,820
And my granddaughter

189
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,880
is a violinist who graduated from the same school.

190
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,180
It's a shame Jung Kyung isn't here.

191
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,830
If she's in America, will she even come back once a year?

192
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,900
 In this position, 

193
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,780
 I made a promise to myself. 

194
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,460
   

195
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,470
It's a shame. You did well in the past.

196
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,020
Well. It's time for me to think of my health.

197
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,410
Don't you know? We're still 29.

198
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,520
Ah, right.

199
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,230
Surprise! It's a present.

200
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,390
What's this?

201
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,600
A calendar that starts on your birthday.

202
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,820
I made it.

203
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,790
Thank you!

204
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,220
   

205
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,540
Yoon Dong Yoon is the same as now.

206
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,370
Yeah. You're right.

207
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,830
It's been years since we broke up after dating for just 100 days,

208
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,230
but why am I still fussing over Yoon Dong Yoon like this?

209
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,870
If you tell him that I still like him or whatever, you're dead.

210
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,850
Why would I say that?

211
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,360
Cheers!

212
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,510
I heard you're taking a break this summer in Korea.

213
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,950
I'm the Performance Arts Director of Korea's Philharmonic Orchestra.

214
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,320
What are your thoughts on joining me for next year's New Year Music Festival?

215
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,610
Thank you so much for the invitation,

216
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,390
but I'm not planning to perform this year.

217
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,740
It seems like it'll be hard.

218
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,430
I heard you're doing a performance for Kyunghoo.

219
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:52,410
Well, that's something that came up a while ago.

220
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,450
I'm sorry.

221
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,750
I still haven't decided whether to do that internship yet.

222
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,360
What? Why?

223
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,680
If I go to work, I feel like I won't have as much time to practice.

224
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,480
Hey. You can just practice on weekends or after work.

225
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,810
Still, you know what they say.

226
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,720
If I don't practice for one day, I'll notice.

227
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,820
If I don't practice for two days, my colleagues will notice.

228
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,910
And if I don't practice for 3 days, the audience will notice.

229
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,840
Just think of it as gathering next semester's tuition.

230
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,330
Okay.

231
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,720
When are they going to let you graduate, Min Seong?

232
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,340
I don't know.

233
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,090
Why did I go to grad school?

234
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,600
Darn. I just had to like something like chemistry.

235
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,490
Me too. I just had to like something like music.

236
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,260
Yeah. You're the problem here.

237
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,090
You suddenly said you'd do violin,

238
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,150
and wouldn't listen even if I told you not to.

239
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,040
Right?

240
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:11,160
Back then, the only person who supported me was CEO Yoon.

241
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,580
It'll all work out. Don't worry.

242
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,160
How do you know? Are you a fortune-teller?

243
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:26,360
Because you're my friend.

244
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,470
Was my Song Ah touched?

245
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,970
I'll go to the bathroom, so don't cry and stay here.

246
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,310
I'll be right back.

247
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,800
 What's this? 

248
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,160
Yoon Ah!

249
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,740
It's okay.

250
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,050
This is a violin.

251
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,770
Violin?

252
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:02,499
Yeah. Violin.

253
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,830
Unni,

254
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,430
are you good at the violin?

255
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,200
Are you good?

256
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:28,120
I like to play. A lot.

257
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,300
I can drop you off on the way.

258
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,470
No, I can walk.

259
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,260
- Really? 
 - Yes. Hurry and go.

260
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,000
Okay.

261
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,610
Text me when you get home. I'll go then!

262
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,280
- Okay, bye! 
 - Bye!

263
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,020
   

264
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,160
 Ah, Park Joon Young! 

265
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,660
 He said he's busy, so he can't do ours. 

266
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:09,330
But he said he's doing Kyunghoo's end of the year performance.

267
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,200
Well, I understand since Kyunghoo has done so much for him,

268
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,820
but he should work hard when he gets offers.

269
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,900
  Does he think he's still the same Park Joon Young as several years ago?  

270
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,040
Sorry, sorry. You waited for a while, right?

271
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,450
No.

272
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,630
How is Director Lee's health?

273
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:41,970
Yeah. She just has difficulty with long flights.

274
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,310
She was very upset that she couldn't go to your New York performance

275
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:49,490
or attend her grandson's Juilliard doctorate graduation.

276
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,290
Jung Kyung must have seen your performance in New York.

277
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,220
She's doing good, right?

278
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,600
 Jung Kyung. 

279
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,810
She doesn't even call back home often.

280
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:14,610
Is it because her boyfriend is in America, too?

281
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,500
The forecast didn't say rain.

282
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,750
 Chae Song Ah! Congrats! 

283
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,930
 How did it go? Did you do well? 

284
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,550
Noona, do you have an umbrella in the—

285
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,040
  What?  

286
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:08,200
Never mind.

287
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,710
I'm back.

288
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,560
Did you get rained on?

289
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,090
It's okay.

290
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:34,330
Your sister just came back. Put your things away and come out.

291
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,500
You're home?

292
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,670
  You need to study enforcement to be considered a lawyer.  

293
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,710
If you're not sure, talk to our legal team.

294
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,250
Okay.

295
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,970
How was today's performance?

296
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,070
It was okay.

297
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,440
I heard next semester's your last.

298
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,830
 Do the kids in your major all study abroad after 4 years? 

299
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,050
 What are your plans? 

300
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,160
Just say you threw away a couple of years of your life and quit.

301
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,670
 You're 30 next year. 

302
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:22,860
Starting next week, I might go work in an office.

303
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,260
What? Work?

304
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,170
- You got a job? 
 - Where?

305
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,670
It's called Kyunghoo Cultural Foundation.

306
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,700
I'm an intern for their performance development team.

307
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,400
I passed after taking a test.

308
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,940
Good job.

309
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,770
What are you doing there? Is it related to Kyunghoo Group?

310
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:49,030
Yeah. Kyunghoo's former president is the chairman,

311
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,000
and it opens up performances for young performers

312
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,690
and gives scholarships.

313
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,320
Why become an intern all of a sudden?

314
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,330
Do you want to get a job there?

315
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,290
No, it's not that.

316
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,950
If you were going to get a job, why did you play an instrument? You took the entrance exam four times, too.

317
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,400
  If you didn't go to music school, you would've already graduated from business school and become a businesswoman.  

318
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,980
It's not like anyone can go there.

319
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:17,860
Also, the only reason I took the exam four times is because you said you would only let me go if I got into Seoryeong's School of Music—

320
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,210
Shut up.

321
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,150
  It's not too late now.  

322
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,330
  If Rank 5 is too hard, even Rank 7 will work.  

323
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,080
Mom.

324
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,690
I want to play violin.

325
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,090
Then do that as a hobby!

326
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,340
She should graduate, at least.

327
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,460
- This is all your fault! 
 - Why?

328
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:41,910
You always played classical music around the house, saying you wanted to raise her EQ.

329
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,650
Stop it.

330
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,900
It's already in the past.

331
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,380
So what are you going to do? Do you even have a plan?

332
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,420
I don't know.

333
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,230
Gosh.

334
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,000
Thank you so much.

335
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,290
You even got me a place to stay.

336
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,380
Director Lee arranged the officetel.

337
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,370
No need to be thankful to me.

338
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,120
If you need anything, let me know.

339
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,300
If something is tiring or you need something.

340
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,670
If you tell someone else, will they just do it for you?

341
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:43,170
   

342
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:47,360
   

343
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,340
 Then you shouldn't have gotten last place! 

344
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:58,770
 Just say you threw away a couple of years of your life and quit. 

345
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:03,570
♫  Stay with me, close to me  ♫

346
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,050
♫  Stay with me, lean on me  ♫

347
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:13,430
Gosh!

348
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:17,590
Oh no!

349
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:21,340
♫   You've always been my side   ♫

350
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:26,260
    
 ♫   You comforted me   ♫

351
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:31,280
♫  I can't believe  ♫

352
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:36,000
 Hello, my name is Chae Song Ah and I applied for the summer internship at Kyunghoo Cultural Foundation. 

353
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,580
 I will work hard during these 2 months. 

354
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,140
 See you next week. 

355
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,040
     

356

361

♫   to leave you   ♫

365
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,420
   

366
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,820
These are the two interns who will work with us for the next two months.

367
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,330
Can you introduce yourself?

368
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:58,620
Hello! I'm Kim Hae Na. I look forward to working with you.

369
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,640
I'm Chae Song Ah.

370
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,230
What?

371
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,270
What?

372
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,980
What are you sorry for?   
 (T/N: "Chae Song" and "sorry" sound similar.) 

373
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,790
My name is Chae Song Ah.

374
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,170
"Chae" as in "chae so".   
 (T/N: "chae so" means vegetable.)  

375
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,560
Oh, Chae Song Ah!

376
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,060
Why did I suddenly think you were apologizing? Sorry.

377
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,340
Okay, then let's each introduce ourselves too.

378
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,690
I'm Cha Young In,

379
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,710
the Performance Development Team Leader.

380
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,430
I'm Park Seong Jae.

381
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:36,610
I'm in charge of Overseas Communication.

382
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,800
I'm Im Yoo Jin.

383
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,220
I'm in charge of Performance Planning at Kyunghoo.

384
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,320
I'm Jung Da Eun from Marketing and Advertising.

385
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,260
Nice to meet you.

386
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,990
Three of our team members come to work in the afternoon, so we'll introduce you to them later.

387
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,320
Then first, your duties...

388
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,290
Song Ah will go with Yoo Jin, and Hae Na

389
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,680
will be led by Da Eun.

390
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,030
Work hard.

391
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,680
Yes!

392
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,660
 If you don't keep repeating this... 

393
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,830
 It hurts! 

394
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,080
   

395
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,910
   

396
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,750
   

397
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:28,320
This is the waiting room and this is the rehearsal room. Let's go in.

398
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,440
This is the rehearsal room.

399
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:02,310
   

400
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:07,650
   

401
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,880
Song Ah?

402
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,450
You haven't gone home yet?

403
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,680
Oh, no.

404
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,710
What are you doing here?

405
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,060
Just stopping by.

406
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:17,980
This room is mainly empty unless our hall is holding a performance.

407
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,970
Team Leader.

408
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,750
By any chance,

409
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,140
by any chance,

410
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:32,810
during lunch, can I use this space?

411
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,720
The rehearsal room? Why?

412
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,760
Well...

413
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,410
I want to practice the violin.

414
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:47,360
I don't really have time to practice at home anymore.

415
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,070
When nobody's here,

416
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,900
just the space...

417
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:00,480
Yoo Jin manages the practice room, so check with her before you use it.

418
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,780
Okay, thank you!

419
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,900
Make sure to eat! If you can't work in the afternoon because you don't have any energy, I won't stand for it.

420
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,140
Okay. Thank you, Team Leader.

421
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,220
What's this?

422
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,640
Eat it well.

423
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,240
I'm sorry! I didn't know anyone was here.

424
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,950
N-No, it's fine.

425
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,180
Did you want to use this space?

426
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,870
N-No.

427
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,910
No, I'm really sorry.

428
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,770
I'm sorry!

429
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,380
 What is your name? 

430
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,270
 It's Chae Song Ah. 

431
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,680
Ah yes, Deputy. I—

432
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,610
 Song Ah, where are you? The rehearsal room? 

433
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,610
I'm sorry?

434
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:42,670
 Well, Park Joon Young called to ask if he could use the rehearsal room. 

435
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,950
 I completely forgot about you, Song Ah. My bad. 

436
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,940
 Did you meet Joon Young? 

437
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,750
Ah, yes. Well, I did meet him, but...

438
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,320
 Gosh, you must have been so shocked! 

439
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,650
 I'm sorry. 

440
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,910
No, it's fine.

441
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,870
 You're quite good at cooking the meat! 

442
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,940
 Looks good! 

443
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,690
How did you find out this was the best eatery in this neighborhood?

444
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,150
I put my heart into finding it.

445
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,970
You must really practice the violin a lot, Song Ah.

446
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,210
- Your neck... 
 - Oh, um...

447
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,330
it's not quite like that.

448
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,850
That only happens with people who aren't fit for the violin.

449
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:27,210
I also practice a lot but look how clean mine is.

450
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,230
 Oh, you're right. 

451
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,020
 Hae Na must be born for playing instruments. 

452
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,590
Yes!

453
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,190
Why isn't he coming?

454
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,950
Is someone coming?

455
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:39,610
Joon Young. I told him to come, but I guess he's forgotten since he's too busy practicing.

456
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:41,880
Why don't you call him?

457
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,000
I don't know his number. He hasn't gotten a Korean phone yet.

458
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,060
- Ms. Song Ah 
 - Yes?

459
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,930
I'm sorry to ask this, but could you go and pick up Joon Young?

460
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,120
Oh. Sure.

461
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,960
The smell...

462
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:28,240
   

463
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,510
Oh!

464
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:33,320
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

465
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:41,060
I'm Chae Song Ah, an intern for the Kyunghoo Cultural Foundation.

466
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,170
We were told you'd be coming, but you never came, so I

467
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,810
was on the way to pick you up.

468
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,580
You're here.

469
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:57,070
Oh, yes. Sorry for being late.

470
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,860
Oh, not at all.

471
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:04,630
Then shall we go in?

472
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,300
Are you all right?

473
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:15,280
- Oh, I'm fine, it's just that my legs fell asleep. 
 - Ah.

474
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,230
Then let's stay here a bit before going in.

475
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:20,960
Oh no, no. I'm f-fine...

476
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,490
Then just... 30 seconds?

477
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:30,040
Yes, 30 seconds.

478
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,200
I heard you didn't have a Korean phone yet

479
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,680
So that's why I was on my way to get you.

480
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:48,860
I just got a phone.

481
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:52,160
Could I have your number?

482
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,540
What? My number?

483
00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:00,470
Deputy Yoo Jin told me that I should contact you in advance if I wanted to use the rehearsal room.

484
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,280
Ah, yes, yes.

485
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,660
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

486
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,060
My name is Chae, not Choi.

487
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,540
"Chae" as in the vegetable, Chae—

488
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:16,890
Yes, I know. Chae Song Ah.

489
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,500
The 30 seconds.

490
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,070
Yes.

491
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,120
 Welcome in! 

492
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,400
 You're so funny! 

493
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,290
Then does everyone in the instrumental music department graduate in four years?

494
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:54,840
Yes, that's for most music school students.

495
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,490
It's especially true for Seoryeong University. They all go to study abroad once they graduate.

496
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:03,290
But will you be attending classes with us this year?

497
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:04,610
Yes, probably.

498
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:07,180
After the Chopin Piano Competition, there's a lot of overseas performances,

499
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:11,020
so I couldn't finish my last year.

500
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:15,560
That's right! You two are the same age.

501
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,530
Song Ah finished Seoryeong Business School before starting over at music school.

502
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,600
I'm your direct junior from the Korean School of Performance Arts, middle and high school.

503
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,920
Can I call you Oppa?

504
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,970
Whatever is comfortable.

505
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,410
Yes! Oppa!

506
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:35,660
Then Joon Young and Song Ah are the same age, so you two should be friends.

507
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,800
You could even talk casually.

508
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,910
No, no, no.

509
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,990
Why? Because he's a superstar?

510
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:44,800
- I'm no superstar! 
 - But you are!

511
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,100
I'm not usually good at speaking informally,

512
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,930
and he is a superstar.

513
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:53,810
 Do superstars not have friends? 

514
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:56,980
Anyway, let's empty our glasses,

515
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,600
and shall we get going?

516
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,500
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

517
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,500
Let's just clear what's in front of us and go.

518
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,260
- Thank you for your hard work. 
 - Thank you for your hard work.

519
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,570
Looking forward to working with everyone.

520
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,610
   

521
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,870
Boss Yoon?

522
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:49,030
 Song Ah, I'm second place. 

523
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,990
 It was announced just now.  

524
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,170
Congratulations! Really, congrats!

525
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,920
 Thank you. Have you been well? 

526
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,070
 What have you been up to? 

527
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,820
I've just been practicing.

528
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,480
 As expected, Chae Song Ah. 

529
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,460
There's nothing to expect.

530
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,250
But my instrument is a little weird.

531
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,620
 Weird how? 

532
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,300
I don't know exactly. When you're back in Korea, take a look at it.

533
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:20,500
  Italia Airlines flight departing from Rome, arrival at Incheon Airport tomorrow, 5:30 p.m.  

534
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:25,270
 I'll take a look at it as soon as I'm back, come pick me up at the airport. 

535
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:27,130
The airport?

536
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,690
 Someone's calling for me. I'm hanging up. See you tomorrow! 

537
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,350
 In Italy during a business trip. 

538
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:56,420
     

539
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:16,000
 Surprised over this sudden email, right? 

540
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,210
 I'm returning to Korea. July 4th, 5:30 PM at Incheon Airport. 

541
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,870
 You'll come meet me, right? 

542
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:24,560
 Park Joon Young, I miss you so much. I'm going crazy. 

543
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,000
Yeah, right.

544
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,510
This guy. Went to America and became more bombastic.

545
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:38,440
   

546
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,910
   

547
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,950
   

548
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,770
   

549
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:01,350
   

550
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:04,290
   

551
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:06,100
  Dream?  

552
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:32,730
   

553
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,340
Has he never performed that piece?

554
00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:01,880
There are so many dreams out there. Why isn't there a dream I want?

555
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:19,480
 Joon Young! Do well in the competition. Hyeon Ho and I will support you here in Korea. 

556
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,470
 Fighting! 

557
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:28,710
 Park Joon Young, fighting! 

558
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,010
 Get first place! 

559
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:38,250
 Park Joon Young, fighting! 

560
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,700
 Get first place! 

561
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,180
 Jung Kyung! 

562
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,160
 Jung Kyung. 

563
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:20,160
   

564
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:33,590
 I miss Yoon Dong Yoon. He hasn't contacted us once since he went to Italy. 

565
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,430
   

566
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:31,520
Are you here to pick someone up?

567
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,150
Yes, a friend is coming.

568
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:41,100
A friend. A male friend.

569
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,600
Just a friend... that's a guy.

570
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:52,160
It's a friend who makes and fixes instruments.

571
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,010
I said my violin was sounding a bit weird, so he said he would look at it for me.

572
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:57,690
I see.

573
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:06,700
Are you also here to pick someone up?

574
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,470
I'm also picking up a friend.

575
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:28,910
By the way, what kind of exam do you have to take to get into Kyunghoon Cultural Foundation?

576
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:34,020
We had to write a proposal for a chamber music performance.

577
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:38,410
I wrote about a performance program and a marketing proposal.

578
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:41,850
That's amazing.

579
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,600
It's something that anyone could write.

580
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,160
If anyone could write it, would they all get in?

581
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:54,880
What pieces did you use in your plan?

582
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,960
It wasn't anything special.

583
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,700
You're not allowed to tell me?

584
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:19,130
Brahms, Schumann and Clara. 
 (T/N: Robert Schumann and Clara Schumann.)

585
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:32,400
I guess your theme must have been an unattainable love.

586
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,240
No.

587
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:44,610
It's the friendship amongst the three of them.

588
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:51,090
Do you like Brahms?

589
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:57,920
 Why did I ask him that? 

590
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,900
 Then, 

591
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:07,870
 he answered me. 

592
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:13,120
No, I don't like Brahms.

593
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:21,110
Song Ah! Chae Song Ah.

594
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:31,080
 The person that Brahms loved all his life 

595
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:35,310
 was Clara, Schumann's wife, 

596
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:39,660
  who was also his senior, his colleague, and his best friend. 

597
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:47,320
 Clara was also a musician and often played Brahms' pieces, 

598
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:51,150
 but her husband Schumann  

599
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:54,410
 was always by her side. 

600
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:03,100
 So Brahms, who was always by Clara's side, 

601
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,290
 lived alone his whole life. 

602
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,390
 I realized it later. 

603
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:29,470
 That he... 

604
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,700
 never plays Brahms' pieces. 

605
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:53,220


606
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:58,470
   

607
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:04,660
♫  These tears that have gotten cold  ♫

608
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:09,240
♫   cannot be considered part of our farewell  ♫

609
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:15,460
♫   Return to me a bit less late   ♫

610
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:20,010
♫   Even these tears that are falling   ♫

611
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:24,090
♫   will become   ♫

612
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:30,760
♫   part of my last farewell to you   ♫

613
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,410
♫  Only one, just one thing  ♫

614
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,750
♫  I hope you won't forget  ♫

615
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:40,620
 You must've been surprised, right? You probably never imagined we would come back together. 

616
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:43,480
 That day... the day of my performance in New York... 

617
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,970
 - Should I get married? 
- Do you mean it? 

618
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:46,120
 It's Träumerei. 

619
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,590
 I happened to hear you play that piece. 

620
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:51,420
 Jung Kyung, did you say your name was from that piece? 

621
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,160
 Listen carefully because I'm not going to play it again. 

622
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,770
 When I think about it, it hits me right in the heart, somehow. 

623
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:58,640
 I'm your fan. 

624
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,970
 Could you flip the pages of my sheet music for me? 

625
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:06,680
 Don't worry. You can do it. 

626
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,670
♫   It will become  ♫

627
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:12,260
♫   part of my last farewell  ♫
