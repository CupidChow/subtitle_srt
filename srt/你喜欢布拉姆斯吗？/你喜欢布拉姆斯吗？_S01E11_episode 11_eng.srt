00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,140


2
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,700
 Between you and Jung Kyung... 

3
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,210
 that is, between the time you shared together... 

4
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,720
 is there room... 

5
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,700
 for me to join? 

6
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,400
♫   Like the winds that scatter,   ♫

7
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,230
♫   I hope my sadness will disappear   ♫

8
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,640
♫   Like the flowers in the fields,   ♫

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,950
♫   that had to endure many seasons before their bloom   ♫

10
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,280
♫   that had to endure many seasons before their bloom   ♫

11
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,370
♫   I sing so you can hear me   ♫

12

♫   My loved ones, here   ♫

13
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,350
♫   Let's all dream   ♫

♫   Even in this world that is often difficult and hard  ♫

15
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,490
Of all the songs, why the same one?

16
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,020
♫   Even in this world that is often difficult and hard  ♫

17
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,020
♫   there will be a path for you  ♫

18
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,420
Song Ah!

19
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,810
Were you here, all along?

20
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,450
I practiced at school today because there was a mistake signing up for the rehearsal room.

21
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,410
You saw the text, right?

22
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,960
Yes.

23
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,710
Did your session with your accompanist go well?

24
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,060
Yes. It was... good.

25
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,340
♫   I sing so you can hear me   ♫

26

♫   There will be a path for you   ♫

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,800
 Do you want a drink? 

32
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,250
 No. 

33
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,760
 Don't you have other friends? 

34
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,410
 I don't. 

35
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,980
 I've only ever had two friends. 

36
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,580
 Hyeon Ho and you. 

37
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,900
Give me what she's drinking.

38
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,520
How did you get here?

39
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,110
 What? 

40
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,970
 Come again? 

41
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,630
 I think she went to have a drink. 

42
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,080
 But she doesn't look good. 

43
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,140
 Where did she go? 

44
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,850
 That I don't know. 

45
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,080
 All right. 

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,320
You always go to the same place.

47
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,290
Thank you.

48
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,800
 Hyeon Ho... 

49
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,040
Did you wake up?

50
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,960
Where am I?

51
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,440
You had too much to drink.

52
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,820
Hyeon Ho...

53
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,030
Yeah?

54
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,360
Can't you hate me a little?

55
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,450
I wish I could...

56
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,400
it's easier said than done.

57
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,890
Song Ah.

58
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,080
What are you thinking about so pensively?

59
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,820
The Franck Sonata...

60
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,140
Franck? That's your entrance exam song.

61
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,700
Yes.

62
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,080
I wondered...

63
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,160
if I should change that music piece.

64
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,590
Why?

65
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,330
I thought I could do it well, but...

66
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,730
suddenly...

67
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,860
it doesn't feel like a music piece that I could ever do.

68
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,990
I've lost a little bit of confidence.

69
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,240
Has that ever happened with you?

70
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
Yes, of course.

71
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,530
Music pieces that don't feel like my own.

72
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:23,550
I sincerely want to make them mine, but they're just that difficult.

73
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,820
I want to run away to more comfortable music pieces.

74
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,240
 But running away doesn't improve anything. 

75
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,150
My thirst for the music piece I gave up on keeps growing.

76
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,330
In the end, I'm miserable again and yearn for it again.

77
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,610
Is it a lingering attachment?

78
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:51,970
Lingering attachment... possibly?

79
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,050
So... when you change your music piece...

80
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,700
think very carefully about it before you do.

81
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,200
Though I'm just basing this off my personal events.

82
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,800
Yes.

83
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,680
 Have strength. I'm sorry I can't do more to help. 

84
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,380
Not at all.

85
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,080
It's fine.

86
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,960
Oh, are you done?

87
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,340
It sounds fine. Yeah.

88
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,890
Let's stop here.

89
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,800
Yes.

90
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,460
Oh right. You've taken care of him, right? Han Hyeon Ho?

91
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,700
Not yet...

92
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,100
You didn't yet?

93
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,820
Why is our Song Ah hesitating?

94
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,300
I can't work with him, Song Ah. Song Jung Hee is keeping Lee Jung Kyung close,

95
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,200
announcing to the world that she's like her own daughter.

96
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,520
Does it make sense that I take Lee Jung Kyung's boyfriend into my chamber?

97
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,050
Why?

98
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,530
That is, Professor... about Han Hyeon Ho...

99
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,330
What about him?

100
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:01,950
He has one of the better track records among our members.

101
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,340
If he comes into our chamber, I think it would be a great boon for us.

102
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,200
- If he could join us... 
 - Hey Song Ah.

103
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,080
Did I cut him because I have no ears? What did you hear just now?

104
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,320
No, Professor, it's not that. It's just... Han Hyeon Ho...

105
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,670
has broken up with Lee Jung Kyung.

106
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,500
Break up?

107
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,840
- Yes. 
 - Hey, Song Ah!

108
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,890
Then you knew those two were dating from the start?

109
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,660
And when I said I'd include him, you kept your mouth shut anyway?

110
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,260
Song Ah.

111
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,450
Why do you think we do these chamber performances?

112
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,270
It's for the music lovers,

113
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:02,100
and for those of us who are of one heart to study music together, right?

114
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:08,290
- You're right. 
 - Right. And the point here is "People who are of one heart".

115
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,880
Han Hyeon Ho is not that.

116
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:16,880
If one person feels uncomfortable, the whole ensemble falls apart. Everyone's hearts must be in harmony!

117
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,700
That's why he can't join. Understand?

118
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,520
Why aren't you answering? Did you not understand?

119
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,480
No.

120
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,690
I understand.

121
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,320
   

122
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,240
   

123
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,190
Where is it?

124
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,690
Found it.

125
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,610
♫   Please don't leave   ♫

126
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,280
 I'm so sleepy. What did you do? 

127
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,370
 Nothing at all. 

128
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,200
 What the... 

129
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,390
 It's my score. Why would you doodle on my scores? 

130
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,840
 Sorry, I'll erase it. 

131
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,470
 Wait. 

132
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,450
 You doodled on my music sheet? 

133
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,600
 Then as punishment, give me a peck. 

134
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,030
 What the. Give me your scores. 

135
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,850
 - I'll erase it! 
 - You can't undo what you've already doodled. 

136
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,560
 - Where does this rule come from? 
 - From here. 

137
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,680
 Ah, seriously.

Hello, have you been well?

148
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,530
The chamber orchestra?

149
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,050
Is it maybe because of my relationship with Jung Kyung?

150
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,210
Is it because we used to date?

151
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,720
Ah, the thing is...

152
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,050
I don't really know...

153
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,130
Yes, I understand. It must be tough being the intermediary.

154
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,040
   

155
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,930
I should try a latte next time.

156
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,090
 The doors are closing.  

157
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,630
Unni, hello.

158
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,050
- Hello. 
 - Yes.

159
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,390
 The doors are closing.

161
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,220
Right, the girl who won Gyeongdong Daily's competition last time.

162
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,610
Was her name Jeong Da Sol? A third year.

163
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,890
I heard she's your pupil. Congratulation.

164
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,060
Well, I didn't do anything. She's the one who is good.

165
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,380
That's right. Jeong Da Sol is ambitious.

166
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,270
She even went to get supplementary private lessons from another teacher.

167
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:55,330
Another teacher? Da Sol gets supplementary lessons from another teacher?

168
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,880
You didn't know?

169
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,720
Can't you tell when you hear her during your lesson?

170
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,340
One's music changes when they get lessons from someone else.

171
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,460
Is that important?

172
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:14,070
They are ambitious in their studies so they go for supplementary lessons and likes.

173
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,050
When that happens, I just pretend not to know.

174
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,770
It's my name which will be on their profiles anyway.

175
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,810
Why do you think they are supplementary teachers?

176
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,760
They can't even put their names on the kids' profiles.

177
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,090
That's right.

178
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:32,400
But still, it's obvious right away when they get lessons from someone else.

179
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,430
I can't pretend not to know even if I wanted to.

180
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,660
My ears know.

181
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,910
Okay, so we'll go back to the example here.

182
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,250
If we look at the progression from here, 
    

183
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,790
the semitone D# goes along a gradual ascent,

184
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,990
and the chord is resolved with the third note of this harmony, F, going along a gradual descent.

185
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,770
In this situation, the notes A and C

186
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,820
are the same notes in the German sixth and in the first scale degree,

187
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,720
so you can keep these notes in the same voice part, right?

188
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,770
Okay, that's it for today.

189
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,980
Good work.

190
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,630
- Good work. 
 - Good work.

191
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,490
- Unni. 
 - Yes?

192
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:27,080
I heard Joon Young played Jung Kyung's accompaniment at school the other day.

193
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,660
Yes...

194
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,480
Ah, so you knew as well.

195
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,960
The kids are all talking about that. Saying they were so cool.

196
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,560
I also saw them.

197
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,070
Unni, that person is the one who taught your master class last time, right?

198
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,350
- Yes. 
 - Yes, that's her, Lee Jung Kyung Unni.

199
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,000
She's best friends with Joon Young.

200
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,530
Oh, you know her?

201
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,100
How could I not know her? She's the daughter of Kyunghoo Group.

202
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,280
She was super famous since a long time ago.

203
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,800
Back then, she was famous for her great skills and her pretty looks.

204
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,520
She also got a doctorate from the Julliard School recently.

205
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,560
   

206
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,330
Wow, incredible.

207
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,240
What is it?

208
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,380
There's something on Gyu Hui's interview with SBC.

209
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,170
It says she'll participate in the Tchaikovsky competition this winter.

210
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,780
The Tchaikovsky competition?

211
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,380
Woah, Gyu Hui is really incredible.

212
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,220
If it were me, after winning the Queen Elizabeth competition, 
    

213
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,120
I would never enter another competition.

214
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,470
She could get a lower score on this one.

215
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:15,420
What if our Master Joon Young enters the Tchaikovsky competition, too?

216
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,710
 When I was in my sixth year of elementary school,  

217
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,810
 I saw a video of senior Park Joon Young at the final of the Chopin competition 

218
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:23,390
 and thought I wanted to become a pianist.  

219
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,750
 I am very happy to have won first place at the Queen Elizabeth competition this time,  

220
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,610
 and I hope that for next year's Tchaikovsky as well— 

221
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,670
 Incoming call: Team Leader Cha Young In 

222
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,600
Hello?

223
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,490
My mom, why?

224
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,700
Yes. I clearly said I wouldn't do it, though.

225
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,810
Yes.

226
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,640
Okay.

227
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,400
Hi mom.

228
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,410
I heard that the Section Chief talked to you about a TV appearance.

229
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,400
I mean, this is something for me to handle,

230
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,830
so why do you call Young In Noona about that?

231
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,570
It's nothing to brag about.

232
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,700
You could have told me right away, why do you...

233
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,800
 No, I just... 

234
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,550
 It's because Team Leader has been overseeing your work for a long time. 

235
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,250
Please don't call the foundation.

236
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:35,730
And if you need anything, ask me, okay?

237
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,540
Yes.

238
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,460
- I'll go. 
 - Uhm...

239
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,650
Are you in touch... with Hyeon Ho?

240
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:05,370
I mean... I heard Hyeon Ho got cut from Professor Lee Soo Kyung's chamber orchestra.

241
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,490
I was wondering if you knew something about it.

242
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,600
What do you mean?

243
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,650
No just... one of our colleagues got in,

244
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,100
but Hyeon Ho was the only one who was rejected.

245
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:23,070
Professors Song Jung Hee and Lee Soo Kyung's relationship is quite well-known,

246
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,860
so people were talking about whether it might have something to do with you.

247
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,990
 What are you doing? You didn't practice properly and ruined your private lesson. 

248
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,730
 Where do you get this arrogance from? 

249
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,850
 Replace your bow hairs first, then we'll talk at home. 

250
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:53,090
Don't think about sleeping before you fix what the professor pointed out earlier.

251
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,810
 Do you get it? 

252
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,350
Excuse me... Hello.

253
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,290
Hello.

254
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,380
I'm so glad to see you here.

255
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,420
Yes, me too.

256
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,920
Uhm, could I ask you something?

257
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,470
Yes.

258
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,060
Ji Won can't really control her mental state.

259
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,210
I'm so embarrassed that I can't tell anyone about it.

260
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,180
Professor Song Jung Hee only says good things about her,

261
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,470
so people think that she always gets first place in every competition she enters.

262
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,720
But that's not true.

263
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,150
She either gets first place or gets disqualified in the preliminaries.

264
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,690
I'm ashamed to face the professor.

265
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,550
Even if she does well ordinarily, as soon as she gets nervous,

266
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,710
she ends up not doing as well as the average kids.

267
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,190
I'm sorry. My apologies.

268
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,250
You can take the call.

269
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,780
Ah, yes. I need to take it. Just a moment.

270
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,900
Park Joon Young.

271
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,620
Why can't you get the music to stick to you?

272
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,510
It makes the listener uncomfortable and anxious.

273
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,900
What is it? What exactly is the problem?

274
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,650
How can you think of participating in the Tchaikovsky competition with this?

275
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,950
Did you see Kim Gyu Hui's interview today?

276
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,930
Imagine if the girl who said you were her role model enters the same competition and crushes you.

277
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,320
What do you think it'll look like?

278
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,830
Can you handle that?

279
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:41,300
Either find a way or come to your senses.

280
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,030
- Yes. 
 - Again.

281
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,090
Ji Won.

282
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,290
Can I ask you something?

283
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:07,670
Why do you think you get very nervous when you stand on the stage?

284
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:14,440
If you know the reason, you might find a way to cope with it.

285
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:22,960
I'll give you a few examples, then. Choose from them.

286
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:28,600
First one. You haven't practiced enough yet.

287
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:35,330
Second. There are spectators in front of you.

288
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,930
And third.

289
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,320
You're afraid of your mom.

290
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,330
Which one was it for you?

291
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:14,000
 Kyung Seon. Don't you feel an ounce of pity for your daughter who is stuck inside the practice room for hours everyday?  

292
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,190
 Jung Kyung is only six! Just because she has a little talent—  

293
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,210
 If it were "a little talent", I wouldn't be like this.  

294
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,890
 Jung Kyung is a genius. How can you let that gift go?  

295
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:28,610
 Kyung Seon! Are you really doing this for Jung Kyung's sake?  

296
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,370
 And it's not that you're forcing her to achieve the dream you couldn't?  

297
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,990
 I don't care what you think.  

298
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,890
 I will do everything I can to let Jung Kyung exploit her talent to the fullest.  

299
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:49,680
 She has plenty of both talent and money. Why mustn't she use it? 

300
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,310
 And third.  

301
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,670
 You're afraid of your mom.  

302
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,010
Song Ah, Song Ah. Did you forget something at home?

303
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,210
Why can't you focus? What's going on, really?

304
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,160
Have you always been bad at focusing?

305
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,960
I mean, if you entered the college of music at this age,

306
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,580
you should try harder and do better.

307
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,420
Do it again.

308
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,240
- You see, I... 
 - What?

309
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,720
It's true that I'm not very good at playing the violin.

310
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:47,950
But still, I'm also... working hard.

311
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,010
Song Ah.

312
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,640
I don't really care about that.

313
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,980
It's the College of Music here. The College of Music.

314
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:07,930
This is a place where you get evaluated on your performance, from first to the last place.

315
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,920
You didn't come here not knowing that.

316
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,800
Will you be practicing at school today?

317
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:29,260
No, I'll do it at home today.

318
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,510
Because I'm a bit tired.

319
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,640
You aren't sick, are you?

320
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,590
No, I'm not.

321
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:50,700


322
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,540
I'm so worn-out.

323
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,280
I'm really tired.

324
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,280
It's your friend.

325
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,780
What?

326
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:15,570
The one who plays the violin and always comes to hang out. She was there.

327
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,320
Ah, really? Ah right, I heard you got told off by the professor yesterday?

328
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,300
No!

329
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,700
   

330
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,750
 the notes A and C— ... and in the first scale degree,  

331
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,930
 so you can keep these notes in the same voice part, right? 

332
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,580
   

333
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,310
Me?

334
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,920
I'm thankful for the offer, but why me...?

335
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,360
I should have thought about you long before, but I had too much on my mind.

336
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,350
So I heard you and Joon Young are dating these days.

337
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,310
Is that right?

338
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,080
I mean, when I heard that, I thought about you.

339
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,000
Well, let's forget the personal talk.

340
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,150
You're good at your work, Song Ah. And you have common sense.

341
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:21,510
So I thought it might be nice to work together.

342
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,860
Uhm...

343
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:28,610
I... Thank you for saying that,

344
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:33,120
but I don't feel comfortable with handling both work and the violin at the same time.

345
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:40,210
At the same time? No, I meant, after you graduate. You're going to quit the violin... No?

346
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:48,560
I have no intention of giving up the violin.

347
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,740
Song Ah. How long have you been playing the violin?

348
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,750
- Sorry? 
 - Not counting the times it was a hobby. From when you started preparing for the college of music.

349
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,340
It hasn't been ten years, has it?

350
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,370
No.

351
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:15,060
I'm sorry to be saying this, but you can never beat time.

352
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,400
You know that, too.

353
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,720
People say that if you put ten thousand hours into something, you become an expert or whatever.

354
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,490
But ask all your friends around you.

355
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,630
They've all probably practiced more than ten thousand hours by the time they're ten years old.

356
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:31,440
Everyone pursuing music must be those who started out at the age of four or five, practicing endless hours daily

357
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,180
and receiving private lessons from professors.

358
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,260
I'm also sorry about saying this,

359
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,340
but your start was too late, Song Ah.

360
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:48,130
Irrespective of whether you're good or bad at it, it's not something you can catch up to.

361
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,700
I understand that you like it,

362
00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:01,660
but I thought you needed someone to give you a realistic viewpoint. That's why.

363
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,210
Sorry?

364
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,200
"Confirmed"?

365
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:14,740
Ah, you haven't heard yet? Oh my.

366
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,050
Anyway, I have been confirmed as the representative of the Korean branch,

367
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:21,760
 so let's work well together from now on.  

368
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,650
Should we meet up soon?

369
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:30,770
 We'll discuss the reality show— Oh! Should we meet with the PD, too? 

370
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:36,820
No. I told you I wouldn't do it.

371
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:41,580
But why did you go to see my mother?

372
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,460
What do you mean?

373
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,860
I went to pay my respects, of course. It's a given since she's our artist's parent.

374
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:53,880
While we're on the topic, I also met Chae Song Ah just now.

375
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,540
Song Ah? Why?

376
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:02,000
I heard you're dating her.

377
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,300
So of course! What's a manager?

378
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,650
But by the way, when did you two get into that sort of relationship?

379
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,590
What did you tell her?

380
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,150
I'm being interrogated right now, aren't I?

381
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:24,710
I didn't say anything special. Is there anything to talk about besides you?

382
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,280
Joon Young, don't worry.

383
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:36,190
 I didn't talk about your family situation. Why would I tell her that?  

384
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,540
Anyway, let's set a date for us to meet.

385
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,590
I'm hanging up.

386
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,800
"Why did you go see her?" "What did you tell her?" Gosh, really.

387
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,770
Go, come on!

388
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,830
   

389
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:18,230
 Your positions here are ranked by performance, right? 

390
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,580
 Then you shouldn't have gotten the last place! 

391
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,030
 You started too late, Song Ah. 

392
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:35,410
 Irrespective of whether you're good or bad at it, it's not something you can catch up to. 

393
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,940
 You can never beat time. 

394
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:57,990
   

395
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,560
 Song Ah! 

396
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:29,769
I heard... you met Section Chief Park Seong Jae.

397
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,469
Yes.

398
00:34:33,709 --> 00:34:36,449
Did he say anything in particular?

399
00:34:38,569 --> 00:34:43,849
He's not someone who speaks softly.

400
00:34:44,509 --> 00:34:48,119
So I'm wondering if he might have said something hurtful to you.

401
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,639
He only told me good things.

402
00:35:02,629 --> 00:35:07,809
That there are other paths beside the violin.

403
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:15,939
He said that I am too late, realistically.

404
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:20,879
That the others have played the violin for twenty years,

405
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:26,229
but I haven't done it for even half that time.

406
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:33,419
That it's actually impossible to catch up to that.

407
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:42,559
It's not like I have the talent to overcome all that accumulated time, either.

408
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:52,769
I did feel like I was about to cry...

409
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:01,209
But his words were so true, that I just said

410
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:03,679
"Thank you for your advice."

411
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:58,759
   

412
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,419
♫   Like the winds that scatter   ♫

413
00:37:03,419 --> 00:37:08,119
 It's been fifteen years. Joon Young and I. 

414
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,299
♫   I hope my sadness will disappear   ♫

415
00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:12,479
 Since I met him late.  

416
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:18,219
 However, I am just waiting.  

417
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:19,719
♫   Like the flowers in the fields   ♫

418
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:24,689
 Just like Joon Young waited for me during all this time. 

419
00:37:24,689 --> 00:37:26,589
♫   That had to endure many seasons before their bloom   ♫

420
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:28,549
 Since I started late.  

421
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:33,019
♫   I sing so you can hear me   ♫

422
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:34,949
 With just my feelings for him...  

423
00:37:34,949 --> 00:37:38,059
    
 ♫   My loved ones, here   ♫

424
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,039
♫   Let's all dream   ♫

425
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:42,209
 is it impossible to catch up...  

426
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:47,149
♫   Even in this world that is often difficult and hard  ♫

427
00:37:47,149 --> 00:37:51,819
 to all the time that has already accumulated? 

428
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:57,459
♫   There will be a path for you  ♫

429
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:04,249
- D-Daejeon? 
 - Yes.

430
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:11,819
It's just a brooch. I really wanted to buy it, but it's never in stock.

431
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:14,589
Someone is selling one that they almost haven't worn,

432
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:18,589
but I've been scammed often with buying secondhand objects via parcel delivery.

433
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:21,349
So I told them I'd just go get it.

434
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:25,169
Daejeon is at a distance that's similar to a simple commute,

435
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,929
so if you go now you'll be back within today.

436
00:38:28,929 --> 00:38:33,719
I'm so thankful to have someone like you who does her work so perfectly, Song Ah.

437
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:12,679
Daejeon?

438
00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:18,999
Yes, Joon Young?

439
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:21,299
 Where are you right now?  

440
00:39:21,299 --> 00:39:25,839
I'm in front of the school. I'm waiting for the bus to go to the bus terminal.

441
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,529
I plan on taking the 3 p.m. bus.

442
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:33,359
But why are you suddenly going to Daejeon?

443
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:38,219
Because Professor Lee Soo Kyeong asked me to do something.

444
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:40,229
In Daejeon?

445
00:39:41,169 --> 00:39:45,599
Because of her chamber orchestra...

446
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:48,939
I see.

447
00:39:55,569 --> 00:40:00,119
Then are you going to Daejeon and coming back today?

448
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:02,339
Yes.

449
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:05,079
Then you'll come back really late.

450
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:07,709
It's alright.

451
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:13,109
There are people who commute between Daejeon and Seoul, after all.

452
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:15,789
Where in Daejeon is it?

453
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:17,319
Yuseong-gu?

454
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:19,859
That's far away from the terminal, though.

455
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,089
How do you know?

456
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:28,079
Ah right! You're from Daejeon, right?

457
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,569
I can't really say I'm from Daejeon, since I've left a long time ago.

458
00:40:31,569 --> 00:40:34,449
But I do know where that place is.

459
00:40:35,189 --> 00:40:40,409
Don't worry. It's still in the Republic of Korea, where I understand the language.

460
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:43,169
I'll go and come back safely.

461
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:48,569
Did you come here to go to the foundation for practice today?

462
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:53,589
No. We planned on practicing for the accompaniment at Jung Kyung's place.

463
00:40:56,029 --> 00:41:00,029
Ah right, you said you were going today.

464
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:08,409
The bus is here.

465
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:12,019
I'll be back. See you tomorrow.

466
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:34,729
There's a guest.

467
00:41:34,729 --> 00:41:36,429
Yes.

468
00:41:55,869 --> 00:41:57,769
You're here?

469
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:23,049
- I didn't miss you. 
 - Oh?

470
00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:25,049
Joon Young!

471
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:30,179
What are you doing here? Didn't you go practice for the accompaniment?

472
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:31,829
No.

473
00:42:32,649 --> 00:42:36,789
I didn't want to let you go alone, so I came.

474
00:42:50,169 --> 00:42:52,929
Did you come by yourself?

475
00:42:56,929 --> 00:43:00,889
What about your mom? Does she know you're here?

476
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:11,429
I... It's number three.

477
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,899
I'm too scared of Mom and the professor.

478
00:43:18,789 --> 00:43:23,369
It's not that I dislike the violin. I actually like it.

479
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:25,549
- But... 
 - I know.

480
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:31,699
Your mom scares you, and so does the professor, right?

481
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:36,099
You're scared you might not get first place,

482
00:43:36,099 --> 00:43:40,959
and scared of what other people will think.

483
00:43:41,849 --> 00:43:48,369
But at the same time... you like playing the violin.

484
00:43:49,659 --> 00:43:55,089
You like it so much... that you can't quit, either.

485
00:43:57,659 --> 00:43:59,989
How do you know?

486
00:44:01,399 --> 00:44:03,849
I was the same.

487
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:10,839
I want to play the violin with you.

488
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,139
I just came by.

489
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:52,229
Kyung Seon. I keep thinking of you these days.

490
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:56,279
It must be because I'm old.

491
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:01,479
You probably miss your daughter a lot, too.

492
00:45:03,749 --> 00:45:07,189
She's becoming more and more like you.

493
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:11,049
She grew up well and is very pretty.

494
00:45:25,549 --> 00:45:29,409
 Jung Kyung, I'm sorry but I don't think I can practice today.  

495
00:45:29,409 --> 00:45:31,979
 I'll contact you again tomorrow.  

496
00:45:37,959 --> 00:45:40,269
It's in. Goodbye.

497
00:45:40,269 --> 00:45:42,089
Goodbye.

498
00:45:55,249 --> 00:45:57,059
Yes, Professor.

499
00:45:57,059 --> 00:45:59,789
The payment has been verified, too.

500
00:45:59,789 --> 00:46:01,839
Yes.

501
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:06,399
Yes, I'll bring it to you tomorrow then. Yes.

502
00:46:23,299 --> 00:46:25,499
Did it go well?

503
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:26,779
Yes.

504
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:30,489
- Then should we go now? 
 - Yes.

505
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:34,399
Ah but I didn't know how long it would take,

506
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:38,399
so I didn't buy a ticket back to Seoul yet. You didn't either, did you?

507
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:42,269
A ticket? I didn't, of course.

508
00:46:45,089 --> 00:46:48,989
That's a relief. But why are you smiling?

509
00:46:50,059 --> 00:46:51,869
Let's go.

510
00:46:52,919 --> 00:46:57,029
Should we have a simple dinner at the bus terminal?

511
00:46:57,029 --> 00:46:59,499
I'm not going to the terminal right now, though.

512
00:46:59,499 --> 00:47:00,949
What?

513
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:03,549
Let's hurry.

514
00:47:03,549 --> 00:47:06,189
Why? Aren't we going to Seoul?

515
00:47:07,129 --> 00:47:12,559
This is where I first learned the piano.

516
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:14,059
When I was six.

517
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:16,949
Back then it used to be called Hanbat Piano.

518
00:47:18,459 --> 00:47:24,879
Until I moved to Seoul in middle school, this is where I spent most of my time.

519
00:47:24,879 --> 00:47:27,969
We didn't have a piano at home.

520
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:34,209
   

521
00:47:34,209 --> 00:47:37,269
   

522
00:47:37,269 --> 00:47:42,949
 My parents were busy because of their restaurant, so I would spend the whole day here.  

523
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:47,759
 But I liked that.  

524
00:47:47,759 --> 00:47:51,139
 Since there wouldn't be anyone at home anyway.   

525
00:47:51,139 --> 00:47:57,549
 I think that's why I enjoyed playing Czerny and Hanon, which all the others hated.  

526
00:48:00,249 --> 00:48:02,069
Why are you laughing?

527
00:48:02,069 --> 00:48:07,999
It's just that I can't really imagine you playing Czerny and Hanon.

528
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:11,439
Why? I did my homework very diligently.

529
00:48:11,439 --> 00:48:15,369
And you colored in an apple every time you played it?

530
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:17,969
A grape.

531
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:19,939
Ah, a grape.

532
00:48:21,379 --> 00:48:25,569
The elementary school I graduated from is close from here, too.

533
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,629
Joon Young!

534
00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:49,759
Yes, Professor?

535
00:48:49,759 --> 00:48:54,809
- Yes. The recital preparation is going well, right? 
 - Yes.

536
00:48:54,809 --> 00:49:00,659
 Good. By the way, when will you join our chamber orchestra?  

537
00:49:00,659 --> 00:49:02,449
 Ah, that's not it! 

538
00:49:02,449 --> 00:49:08,729
-  Didn't you say you wanted to start by sponsoring our concert?   
 - Yes.

539
00:49:08,729 --> 00:49:11,629
 Alright, then my secretary general 

540
00:49:11,629 --> 00:49:16,669
- will call you tomorrow or soon after. 
 - Yes.

541
00:49:18,269 --> 00:49:21,419
I hope you can be a member of the orchestra soon.

542
00:49:21,419 --> 00:49:23,429
Right, Jung Kyung?

543
00:49:23,429 --> 00:49:25,479
Yes, Professor.

544
00:49:25,479 --> 00:49:29,719
Yes. Goodbye, then.

545
00:49:40,999 --> 00:49:45,939
 Many of our colleagues got in, but only Hyeon Ho was rejected. 

546
00:49:45,939 --> 00:49:51,469
 Professors Song Jung Hee and Lee Soo Kyung's relationship is quite well-known, 

547
00:49:51,469 --> 00:49:55,909
 so people were talking about whether it might have something to do with you. 

548
00:49:59,879 --> 00:50:02,109
When did you come?

549
00:50:02,829 --> 00:50:04,989
Ah, this must be a friend of yours.

550
00:50:04,989 --> 00:50:07,009
Yes. Hello.

551
00:50:07,009 --> 00:50:09,679
- I am Chae Song Ah. 
 - Yes, hi.

552
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:12,529
She's my girlfriend.

553
00:50:12,529 --> 00:50:15,589
Your girlfriend?

554
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:18,979
Ah, what to do? Look at me. I came out as I was working...

555
00:50:18,979 --> 00:50:22,969
No, no. I didn't know I would meet you either.

556
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:25,619
It's nice to meet you.

557
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:30,299
We shouldn't be standing here. Did you have dinner?

558
00:50:30,299 --> 00:50:33,619
If you haven't, come to our restaurant and we'll eat together.

559
00:50:33,619 --> 00:50:37,609
It's fine, we bought our bus tickets so we need to hurry.

560
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:43,629
Why? Your father isn't here today. Just come by.

561
00:50:43,629 --> 00:50:46,569
- Have dinner before you leave. 
 - It's fine.

562
00:50:46,569 --> 00:50:49,199
Yes, we will.

563
00:50:49,969 --> 00:50:52,009
Would you?

564
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:56,159
Uhm, will that be alright?

565
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,329
Yes, of course.

566
00:51:06,549 --> 00:51:07,559
Here.

567
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:08,709
Thank you.

568
00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:10,279
Enjoy.

569
00:51:10,279 --> 00:51:12,619
- Eat together with us. 
 - Ah, no, no.

570
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:14,979
You can eat comfortably.

571
00:51:17,529 --> 00:51:25,039
It's the first time Joon Yeong brought someone to Daejeon, so I was so happy that I held onto you.

572
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:27,799
But I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

573
00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:30,559
I don't know if the food will suit your taste either.

574
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,829
Oh no, I really like traditional Korean food.

575
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:37,389
Really? Oh, it'll get cold. Go ahead and eat.

576
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:40,389
Thank you, I'll enjoy the meal.

577
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:42,229
Can we have another bulgogi set?

578
00:51:42,229 --> 00:51:43,589
Ah, yes.

579
00:51:43,589 --> 00:51:45,489
Well then, enjoy your meal.

580
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:47,299
Yes.

581
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:55,149
Thank you. It must be uncomfortable for you.

582
00:51:59,189 --> 00:52:02,869
You're really an insensitive son, Joon Young.

583
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:06,619
We came all the way here, after all. Had we not met your mother, it would be different,

584
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:09,899
but how can we just leave when we met her?

585
00:52:09,899 --> 00:52:13,389
She even said you never brought any friend over?

586
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:18,669
Yes. It's the first time.

587
00:52:19,819 --> 00:52:22,519
And it's also the first time feeling like that.

588
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:34,049
I'm hungry, let's hurry up and eat.

589
00:52:34,049 --> 00:52:36,229
It looks delicious.

590
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:41,229
Here. Eat a lot.

591
00:52:41,229 --> 00:52:43,999
Please eat too, Joon Young.

592
00:52:44,889 --> 00:52:47,319
- Han Hyeon Ho? 
 - Yes.

593
00:52:47,319 --> 00:52:51,479
He is a good cellist, but it seems like there was a misunderstanding along the way.

594
00:52:51,479 --> 00:52:55,259
That's why I asked to meet you.

595
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:59,759
I know who he is. I saw his master class at school.

596
00:53:03,749 --> 00:53:08,809
It isn't difficult to tell him to come back into my chamber orchestra, you see.

597
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:14,479
But let's talk about you, Jung Kyung.

598
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:19,069
You know how Jung Hee Unni is retiring this year?

599
00:53:19,069 --> 00:53:23,669
If you take her place, then we'll be seeing each other for a long while,

600
00:53:23,669 --> 00:53:28,059
as colleagues in the same workplace, right?

601
00:53:29,629 --> 00:53:32,289
I'm really looking forward to it.

602
00:53:35,319 --> 00:53:37,189
On that topic,

603
00:53:37,189 --> 00:53:42,859
with that in mind, what do you think about sponsoring my chamber orchestra just a little bit?

604
00:53:42,859 --> 00:53:47,289
Then I'll think of letting Han Hyeon Ho in again.

605
00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:53,539
I think you are misunderstanding something.

606
00:53:54,749 --> 00:53:55,469
Misunderstanding?

607
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:59,849
I came to see you today because I think he is the victim of an unnecessary misunderstanding

608
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:03,359
regarding his relationship with me.

609
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:05,489
But?

610
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:07,229
But I don't think he is a musician who deserves

611
00:54:07,229 --> 00:54:11,559
to be treated as an item in a transaction.

612
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:17,819
I almost made you misunderstand the situation with my needless meddling.

613
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:22,309
My apologies. Please forget about today.

614
00:54:33,339 --> 00:54:35,589
Be safe on your way.

615
00:54:35,589 --> 00:54:37,379
And do come next time.

616
00:54:37,379 --> 00:54:40,859
Yes. I really enjoyed the meal.

617
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:42,569
Thank you.

618
00:54:42,569 --> 00:54:43,929
Go back in.

619
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:48,059
Yes, after I see you leave. Go.

620
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:49,239
Goodbye.

621
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:52,229
- Be safe on the way. 
 - Yes.

622
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:13,709
Your mother is a really good cook.

623
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:18,889
Song Ah.

624
00:55:20,019 --> 00:55:23,299
Do you want to have a cup of tea before we leave?

625
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:42,359
My father... I don't even know when I last saw him.

626
00:55:44,209 --> 00:55:47,489
He's a really nice person to others.

627
00:55:47,489 --> 00:55:53,099
He does drink a bit too much, but he has never fought with anyone.

628
00:55:55,059 --> 00:56:01,919
But the problem is... he keeps creating issues.

629
00:56:02,849 --> 00:56:07,379
He wants to start a business or to invest in something...

630
00:56:07,379 --> 00:56:11,089
I understand that he wants to try and do things,

631
00:56:11,089 --> 00:56:16,449
but of all those, none have worked out.

632
00:56:18,389 --> 00:56:21,269
That's why, from a certain point,

633
00:56:22,289 --> 00:56:29,559
I've started to think that I am playing the piano to replenish the money my father squandered.

634
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:37,459
But still, with the thought that at least I wasn't burdening others,

635
00:56:37,459 --> 00:56:45,359
but was solving the issue by myself, I could bear with it again and again.

636
00:56:47,459 --> 00:56:50,199
But that wasn't even the case.

637
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:58,489
Chairman Na... and even Jung Kyung...

638
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:04,569
I recently found out that they were helping us.

639
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:14,739
I wasn't expecting to talk about this when I followed you here.

640
00:57:19,459 --> 00:57:24,189
Thank you for telling me.

641
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:29,689
I'm the one who is thankful.

642
00:57:30,529 --> 00:57:33,249
For letting me tell you about this.

643
00:57:39,259 --> 00:57:43,939
Actually, I also have something to tell you.

644
00:57:47,659 --> 00:57:54,299
My coming here today isn't related to the chamber orchestra.

645
00:57:57,629 --> 00:58:04,139
The professor bought a secondhand piece of jewelry online,

646
00:58:05,189 --> 00:58:11,419
and she didn't feel at ease having it delivered by post, so I'm here on an errand.

647
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:17,249
I was wondering if my role really includes this kind of thing...

648
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:22,319
But I said "Yes, I understand." and came here.

649
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:31,409
So honestly, I bought my bus ticket thinking I really didn't want to go to Daejeon.

650
00:58:32,689 --> 00:58:39,959
But now... I think it was a really good thing that I came.

651
00:58:44,329 --> 00:58:49,659
Thank you. For coming with me.

652
00:58:59,609 --> 00:59:06,579


653
00:59:07,869 --> 00:59:13,009
♫   My feelings towards you  ♫

654
00:59:13,009 --> 00:59:20,249
♫   Have always been the same   ♫ 
 ♫  I've always stood behind you   ♫

655
00:59:20,249 --> 00:59:27,299
♫    Like this   ♫
 ♫   I pray again today   ♫

656
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:35,609
♫   That my sincerity may reach you   ♫

657
00:59:39,699 --> 00:59:43,949
♫   Because you're my everything   ♫

658
00:59:44,739 --> 00:59:49,559
♫   I confess now   ♫

659
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:55,459
     

660
00:59:55,459 --> 00:59:59,019
♫   A melody directed towards you   ♫

661
00:59:59,019 --> 01:00:05,419
♫   My beautiful, unwavering feelings   ♫

662
01:00:06,249 --> 01:00:13,499
♫   No matter who asks   ♫ 
♫   My answer is you   ♫

663
01:00:13,499 --> 01:00:21,389
♫   I love you with my whole heart   ♫ 
 ♫   Only you   ♫

664
01:00:21,389 --> 01:00:28,519
♫   Even if you don't know anything else, know this   ♫

665
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:35,459
♫   That I was sincere   ♫ 
 ♫   I've only looked at you  ♫

666
01:00:35,459 --> 01:00:36,199
♫  and wanted you   ♫

667
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:39,879
 Just seeing you tire me out, Dad. I don't want to live that way. 

668
01:00:39,879 --> 01:00:42,889
 Your violin career ended a long time ago. Why can't you accept it? 

669
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:46,059
 I can't tell Joon Young. What do I do? 

670
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,399
 This. It's a present. 

671
01:00:47,399 --> 01:00:48,529
 Chae Song Ah! 

672
01:00:48,529 --> 01:00:49,229
 Unni... 

673
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:52,399
 The gap in their skills is too big. There seems to be a lot of gossip about that. 

674
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,429
 Park Joon Young is a public figure.  

675
01:00:54,429 --> 01:00:57,319
 There won't be anything good coming from a rumor that he has a girlfriend. 

676
01:00:57,319 --> 01:00:58,669
 - Why are you like this? 
 - Sorry? 

677
01:00:58,669 --> 01:00:59,659
 I'm sorry. 

678
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:02,079
 Come here. Come on.  

679
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,619
 It's alright.  

680
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:07,389
♫   The world I envision is full of you   ♫

681
01:01:07,389 --> 01:01:08,749
♫   With just that thought   ♫
