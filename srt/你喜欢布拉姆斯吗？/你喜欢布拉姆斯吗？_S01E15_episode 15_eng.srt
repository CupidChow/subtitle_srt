1
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:49,080


2
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:33,490
    
    

3
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,840
I never liked you,

4
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,330
but I did not expect things would end this way.

5
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,100
I'll leave now.

6
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,720
Do you think you can do this without me?

7
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,760
The Tchaikovsky Competition.

8
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,850
I may have learned from you...

9
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,590
to aim for an average of 7 or 8 points among 10 judges.

10
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,110
But I never learned that even if I got 5 or 6 points from 9 people,

11
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,050
earning 10 points from one person

12
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,640
could be more meaningful.

13
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,050
So that's why I feel regret.

14
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,900
Thank you for your hard work.

15
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,270
Um...

16
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,370
Unni.

17
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,710
Unni, just because I said some things,

18
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,480
are you really quitting the chamber?

19
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,130
You said you were going to graduate school.

20
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,760
How will you go to grad school like this?

21
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,950
Don't do that.

22
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,110
I don't know if I even like the violin.

23
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,380
But you do like it, don't you? The violin.

24
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,150
Tell the professor that you'll join the chamber again,

25
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,520
and take the entrance exam, okay?

26
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,410
I'm not quitting because of you, Hae Na.

27
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,140
And I'm taking the entrance exam as planned.

28
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,040
I'm sorry?

29
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,650
What's the point of taking the exam now?

30
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,240
You're already on her blacklist,

31
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,250
so you'll fail the test.

32
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,580
At any rate, it's what I started,

33
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,800
so I want to tie things up neatly.

34
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,250
 Yes, the cellist withdrew his application. 

35
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,370
 We're calling you to see 

36
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,970
 if you're interested in changing the date of your appointment. 

37
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,000
 Yes, it's Han Hyeon Ho. 

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,980
 He suddenly left overseas. 

39
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,420
   

40
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,140
 You're here? 

41
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,920
 Don't cuddle me anymore. 

42
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,540
 Your hand's cold. 

43
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,120
 I bet you didn't know when you're sad, your hands turn cold first, did you? 

44
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,910
 So when your hands are cold, my heart hurts. 

45
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,590
 What do you like so much about me? 

46
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,570
 I'm always irritated and prickly with you. 

47
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,090
 You can be prickly. It's okay with me. 

48
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,900
 You do everything that you want. 

49
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,580
 Just don't be sad, okay? 

50
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,720
Oh, you're here, Song Ah?

51
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,160
Hello.

52
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,930
Ah, Chairman.

53
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,520
Oh, right.

54
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,570
Ms. Chae Song Ah.

55
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,690
Yes?

56
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,310
Were you surprised I suddenly asked you to walk with me?

57
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,040
Not at all.

58
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,270
Joon Young is...

59
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,980
someone who hid a lot of baggage in his heart.

60
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,380
So he struggled a lot.

61
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,360
But now, it looks like he's seeking out his own happiness,

62
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
so I'm happy.

63
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,080
Joon Young needs to be happy.

64
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,140
He's more than earned it now.

65
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,790
I hope you and Joon Young

66
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,870
will continue to stay close, just like now.

67
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,080
Thank you.

68
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,100
Oh no. This is fine.

69
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,540
Please, I can still handle this much on my own.

70
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,500
But still...

71
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,630
You're just alike.

72
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,990
I'm sorry?

73
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,280
Sorry for taking up your time.

74
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,450
Let's meet again next time, okay?

75
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,060
Yes, then... have a safe trip home.

76
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,140
Bye.

77
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,050
I said this after Kyung Seon's funeral,

78
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,940
"You can choose to leave this family and live freely.

79
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,110
Or you could choose to inherit the chairman's position,

80
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,640
and stay in this family."

81
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,310
Yes.

82
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,070
Didn't you hate me for it?

83
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,330
I did.

84
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:15,250
But still... no matter what condition you placed, I...

85
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,800
I would have chosen to stay by Jung Kyung's side.

86
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,110
So are you happy now?

87
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,770
You quit working for the chamber?

88
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,160
Yes.

89
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,160
But if you need anything in regard to planning for the orchestra,

90
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,230
for the time being, feel free to contact me.

91
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,100
Why? You just said you quit.

92
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,830
But still... I want to end on a good note.

93
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,550
I understand, but today,

94
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,660
I wanted to ask for your help

95
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,140
for next month's 15-year anniversary concert.

96
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,680
You remember that Joon Young, Jung Kyung, and Hyeon Ho

97
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,760
had originally planned for a piano trio?

98
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,760
But... the trio isn't going to work out.

99
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,620
Instead, I'm considering changing it to a solo performance for Joon Young.

100
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,580
So when you're done with your grad school entrance exam,

101
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:35,210
I wanted to ask if you could head the communication and organization planning for Joon Young.

102
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,120
Would that be possible?

103
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,600
Umm...

104
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,680
I mean, Joon Young isn't someone who requires a lot of attention,

105
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,180
because it's you, I especially wanted you there.

106
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,630
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can help you.

107
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,390
You must be really busy!

108
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,320
No, it's not that...

109
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,660
We broke up.

110
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,260
I honestly...

111
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:33,960
still feel uncomfortable seeing you.

112
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,910
But still... I'm trying.

113
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:48,030
It might not be easy to go back to the old days.

114
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:53,360
But over time, wouldn't things get better?

115
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,660
   

116
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:22,660
♫   My feelings towards you have always been the same   ♫

117
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:29,820
♫   I've always stood behind you, like this   ♫

118
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:36,700
♫   I pray again today   ♫

119
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,700
♫   that my sincerity may reach you   ♫

120
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,560
♫   Because you're my everything,   ♫

121
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,980
♫   I confess now   ♫

122
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,020
You're home?

123
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,580
Oh, is that yours?

124
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,320
I used it today.

125
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,590
♫   A melody directed towards you   ♫

126
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,440
Isn't it yours?

127
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,810
♫   My beautiful, unwavering feelings   ♫

128
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,560
♫   No matter who asks   ♫

129
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,390
♫   my answer is you   ♫

130
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,590
♫   I love you with my whole heart   ♫

131
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:29,550
♫   I'll give you my heart   ♫

132
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,310
Let's turn on the GPS before going. What do you want for dinner?

133
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,620
Whatever you want, Noona.

134
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,750
I knew you'd say that.

135
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,100
But don't you have an umbrella?

136
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,370
A piano that can record what's being played?

137
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,020
Yes.

138
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,740
At any rate, it's a relief that the song was taken down,

139
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,060
but Joon Young, while we've taken care of damage control,

140
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,090
this incident is no small matter.

141
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,370
Are you going to just cover it up?

142
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,490
- If you're doing this because it's inconvenient for Professor Yoo— 
 - It's not that.

143
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:38,720
I think none of that matters anymore.

144
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,830
Okay. I understand.

145
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,700
Thank you for your concern, Noona.

146
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,240
Section Chief Park— I mean...

147
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,220
Representative Park still did amazing work for you.

148
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:10,790
Right, let's talk about something else.

149
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,430
Oh. About the 15th anniversary concert for the foundation...

150
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:23,430
instead of the piano trio, could we change it to a piano solo with you?

151
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,760
Yes.

152
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,140
Okay. Thank you.

153
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,650
I waited, hoping for Jung Kyung and Hyeon Ho to make up.

154
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,430
I don't feel great about this.

155
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,140
Still, it's a relief that Hyeon Ho got accepted at a good place.

156
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,520
An American orchestra. How great is that!

157
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,240
He said he was busy so he called me just before leaving.

158
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,850
Did he at least see you before leaving?

159
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,210
   

160
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:15,040
   

161
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,130
It was raining outside.

162
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,590
Song Ah was carrying her instrument.

163
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:52,740
In case she didn't have an umbrella,

164
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,290
I worried she wouldn't be able to go out.

165
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,000
So I went down to give her an umbrella.

166
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,820
 She wasn't able to leave. 

167
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,020
 I gave her the umbrella. 

168
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,710
 So she could use it. 

169
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,650
 I told her I'd carry an umbrella every day, 

170
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,660
so she wouldn't have to worry about the rain.

171
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,880
But I made things difficult

172
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,360
for Song Ah.

173
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,360
She told me she was unhappy.

174
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,640
Because of me.

175
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,160
 Tchaikovsky Competition... 

176
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,270
 Can you do it alone without me? 

177
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,200
 Park Joon Young was absent today too. 

178
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,520
 I had high hopes of taking classes with him too. 

179
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,940
 He's harder to meet than a celebrity. 

180
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,400
 He wasn't showing up for other classes either. 

181
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,420
 Are you sure he's not gone overseas again? 

182
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,970
I couldn't bring much,

183
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:32,910
but I still prepared a few dishes,

184
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,180
so eat proper meals.

185
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,740
Yes.

186
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,580
Are you going somewhere?

187
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,740
I'm just going to walk a bit. You can sleep first.

188
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,610
Joon Young...

189
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,670
how have you been?

190
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:02,630
Your dad and I feel very sorry toward you.

191
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:11,320
Your face looks very gaunt.

192
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,550
It's nothing, don't worry.

193
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,470
Is something wrong?

194
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:31,680
Even when there's something wrong, you're not the kind to say you're struggling.

195
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,010
They said it might rain tonight. Take an umbrella with you.

196
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,690
Mom.

197
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,990
It's so hard.

198
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,740
♫   I'm reminded again   ♫

199
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,790
♫  of you who drifted away   ♫

200
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:35,520
♫   Though I loved you   ♫

201
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:42,990
♫   The radiant memories of our past days  ♫

202
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:49,500
♫   Come visit me again  ♫

203
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,330
   

204
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:58,080
♫   In the end, I wasn't able to forget anything about you   ♫

205
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,740
♫   I must have loved you too much   ♫

206
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:11,710
♫   Because I miss you, I cry out your name   ♫

207
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:18,990
♫   Even if it's just a lingering attachment, I'll have no regrets   ♫

208
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:27,650
♫   Can you hear my heartfelt story?  ♫

209
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:33,980
♫   Without you, I'm nothing   ♫

210
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:43,110
♫   Though I can't know where you're going   ♫

211
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:51,390
♫   If only you're there, I'd want to go anywhere   ♫

212
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:59,000

213
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,270
    
 ♫   Since it was me who only loved you   ♫

214
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:14,940
♫   Someday in the future, will we be able to meet?   ♫

215
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:22,750
♫   I will wait until that time   ♫

216
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,490
   

217
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,090
   

218
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,370
   

219
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,120
You worked hard today, Song Ah.

220
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,150
Thank you.

221
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,970
Cheers.

222
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,940
Sorry. I'm a bit late.

223
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,740
I called him.

224
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,760
Is that why you said we should meet here?

225
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,470
Yes.

226
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,460
You came late because you're treating us tonight, right?

227
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,840
Come on, let me off. I'm just a small business owner.

228
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,150
And I'm a graduate student.

229
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:33,130
Are you whining in front of a graduate student right now?

230
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:36,760
Sorry, sorry. I'll buy tonight.

231
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,770
- Can you give us one more beer, please? 
 - Yes.

232
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,400
Yeah.

233
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,160
You probably know very well yourself.

234
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:52,320
So I don't feel like condemning you. I just came to talk.

235
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:01,280
Fifteen years ago, after Joon Young met you for the first time,

236
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,970
he liked you a lot.

237
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,900
He said you taught him with a lot of passion.

238
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,510
And that you were a good teacher.

239
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,920
You have ambition for the kids.

240
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:23,260
Didn't you buy that piano because you wanted to teach them even better?

241
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,520
While working in this field,

242
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,680
I haven't met a lot of teachers who are ambitious.

243
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,340
Anyone can make a mistake.

244
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,990
The problem is when you learn nothing from your mistake.

245
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:56,970
You lost Joon Young, but try to be a good teacher to the other students.

246
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,730
Don't look at their fingers only, and study their feelings too.

247
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,670
Not as a professor, as a teacher.

248
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,630
You can do it, Tae Jin.

249
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,940
Go back safely.

250
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,040
Bye!

251
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,220
You'll walk home, right?

252
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,820
Yes.

253
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,550
Dong Yoon.

254
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,040
Yes?

255
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:48,040
After you quit the violin,

256
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,200
were you alright?

257
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:58,920
And you, after your breakup with Joon Young, are you alright?

258
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,530
Yes.

259
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:13,310
I'm doing better than expected. It's a relief, really.

260
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:20,000
At first, when I made the decision to quit the violin,

261
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,250
I was fine too. But after I sold my violin,

262
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:30,840
I got really sick. I couldn't even get up for a few days.

263
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,980
But now that I think about it,

264
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,290
I think it was only natural that I was that sick.

265
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,900
I played violin for fifteen years, after all.

266
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,520
At some point, I was really in love with it,

267
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,380
so how could I cut off that time all at once?

268
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,160
Getting rid of your feelings takes time.

269
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,270
And getting seriously sick for a while is only natural.

270
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,480
 I heard it. Träumerei. 

271
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:21,930
 Song Ah, that... was the last time I played it. 

272
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,350
 - It was really the last time. 
 - I tried to understand  

273
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:28,160
 your feelings for Jung Kyung. 

274
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,500
 Even though you said you no longer loved her, 

275
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,180
  I wanted to understand those complicated feelings you couldn't get rid of. 

276
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:38,560
♫   Like the winds that scatter  ♫

277
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,820
 Only after I left it,  

278
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,170
 only after I lost it... 

279
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:46,940
♫   I hope my sadness will disappear   ♫

280
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,760
 did I realize 

281
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,900
 that I loved too much,   

282
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,710
 and not just within reason. 

283
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,760
 How much you will love  

284
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:07,550
 wasn't something you could decide from the start. 

285
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:12,520
♫   My loved ones, here   ♫

286
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,880
♫   Let's all dream   ♫

287
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,600
♫   Even in this world   ♫

288
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,270
♫  that is often difficult and hard  ♫

289
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:31,800
♫   There will be a path for you  ♫

290
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,950
♫   Close your eyes   ♫

291
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:41,790
♫  And listen to the sounds of the world  ♫

292
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:46,760
♫   Because you'll realize you're not alone   ♫

293
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,820
I will...

294
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,020
quit the violin.

295
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,590
I... will quit.

296
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,580
The piano.

297
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,390
And...

298
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,001
everything.

299
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,500
Joon Young said he would quit playing the piano?

300
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,320
Yes! Has Park Joon Young always act as he pleased like this?

301
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,010
Whenever I suggest something, he always rejects it.

302
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,670
And now he isn't even answering his phone.

303
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,040
I left the company putting all my trust in Park Joon Young.

304
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,730
So what do I do if he doesn't change his mind?

305
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,630
Chris also called me and threw a huge fit.

306
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,510
Team Leader.

307
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:22,270
Please persuade Park Joon Young. Okay?

308
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,220
He listens to you.

309
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,760
Mr. Representative Park Seong Jae.

310
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,030
Yes.

311
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,200
Joon Young must have his own reasons.

312
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,450
Let's wait for him.

313
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:44,270
And... don't tell his family in Daejeon.

314
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,570
You understand what I mean, don't you?

315
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,330
Yes.

316
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:58,190
But Team Leader, if he doesn't come back,

317
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,380
what do I— I'm repeating the same thing over and over, aren't I?

318
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,540
I'm going crazy.

319
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,460
But Team Leader,

320
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:17,000
the seat I used to occupy...

321
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,290
Why don't you hire someone to fill it?

322
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,730
 I thought you might be the only one capable of changing his mind, 

323
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,540
 so I decided to contact you, at the risk of being impolite. 

324
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,410
 Aren't you his closest friend? 

325
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:56,630
 I  ask you to persuade Park Joon Young, please. 

326
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,510
 Park Joon Young's retirement 

327
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:05,530
 is a colossal loss to the Korean music industry. 

328
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:26,280
I heard you said you won't play the piano anymore.

329
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,950
Don't do that.

330
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,860
You don't know

331
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,700
how precious it is, what you have.

332
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,360
I kept on trying to figure out

333
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,020
what my feelings toward you may be.

334
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,750
Comfort?

335
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,120
That's right.

336
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,750
I had become too accustomed

337
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,730
to the comfort you brought me.

338
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,390
But Joon Young,

339
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,310
I was jealous of you,

340
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,740
of your talent.

341
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,270
So because of that, I might have been mistaken

342
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:27,130
that I loved you.

343
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,050
Jung Kyung.

344
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,910
I also want to be happy.

345
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,680
Though it might already be too late.

346
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:58,580
Playing the piano... doesn't make me happy.

347
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,870
That's why I'm quitting.

348
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,810
 There's an expression you only show in front of Hyeon Ho.  

349
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,920
 You looked different when you smiled in front of Hyeon Ho. 

350
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,090
 I wouldn't have been able to give you that.  

351
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,150
 Though you might not even know what expression I'm talking about. 

352
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,360
    
    

353
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,710
   

354
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,460
Yes, Teacher?

355
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,810
Ah, for parking?

356
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:56,570
You can park in front of the school's concert hall.

357
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,290
Should I send you a rough map?

358
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:02,090
Yes, understood. I'll see you later. Yes.

359
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:15,250
   

360
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:26,880
 I am writing to let you know that I will have to withdraw my application due to personal reasons. 

361
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,540
 I apologize once again for the inconvenience. 

362
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,490
I'm sorry?

363
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,830
Kyunghoo Cultural Foundation's Chairwoman?

364
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,620
Yes.

365
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,960
She passed away this morning.

366
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,660
   

367
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,970
Jung Kyung.

368
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,010
Dad.

369
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,860
Joon Young.

370
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,520
When did you arrive?

371
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,230
A bit earlier.

372
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,440
I got on a plane as soon as I saw the news.

373
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,590
Should we go in?

374
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,430
 Thank you, Joon Young. 

375
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,960
 Be well. Take care.  

376
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,520
Thank you for coming.

377
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,300
Be strong.

378
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,860
Yes. Thanks.

379
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:57,600
Congrats on getting into the orchestra.

380
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,540
Thanks.

381
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,820
The guests must be waiting. Go in.

382
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,760
Go back safely.

383
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,630
She's Chae Song Ah, who was an intern at our foundation.

384
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:35,750
Ah, is that so? Thank you for coming.

385
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,020
Thank you.

386
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:14,770
Have you... been well?

387
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,810
Yes.

388
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,410
What about you?

389
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,720
Yes. Me too.

390
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:39,720
It's my graduation recital today.

391
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,730
I'll play Brahms.

392
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,370
You changed your piece.

393
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,370
Yes.

394
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,620
And now...

395
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:01,980
I will quit playing the violin.

396
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:14,850
I thought about it, and realized that I'm a bit like Brahms.

397
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:20,530
I kept on pursuing a love that was never returned.

398
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:27,950
I plan on quitting that one-sided love now.

399
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:36,800
But it's alright.

400
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,650
I kept on loving on my own and getting hurt on my own,

401
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:43,810
and in the end, this is how it'll end.

402
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,750
But still, during that time...

403
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:54,260
I think I was happy.

404
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:03,460
I think... it's enough with that.

405
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,510
Then, I'll go now.

406
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,570
Take care.

407
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,070
Song Ah!

408
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:55,490
Please... let me be your accompanist.

409
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,040
Sorry?

410
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:05,200
Please let me be your accompanist today. I want to do it.

411
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:12,440
But... you can't play Brahms.

412
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,060
- You don't like it. 
 - I can play it.

413
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,360
I want to play Brahms.

414
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,180
   

415
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,480
Hello.

416
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,880
- Can I take one? 
 - Yes.

417
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,550
Thank you.

418
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,380
 In 1853, Schumann, 

419
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,390
   

420
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:41,110
 his pupil Dietrich,  

421
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:48,600
 and the young Brahms composed a violin sonata together. 

422
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:51,820
 In this, Brahms...  

423
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,980
 wrote the third movement, "Scherzo."   
    

424
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,860
Are you ready?

425
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,600
Yes.

426
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:13,270
 Their friend, the violinist Joachim,  

427
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:14,320
Let's go.

428
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,860
 played this piece for the first time to Clara's piano accompaniment.  

429
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,190
 The piece was composed using a phrase Joachim liked as its motif, 

430
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:27,830
 and thus titled "F-A-E Sonata." 

431
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:32,880
   

432
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:36,630
Are you ready?

433
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:43,320
Yes.

434
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:46,350
We will enter.

435
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:48,250
Thank you for today.

436
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:06,540
Then... I'll go now.

437
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,660
About Träumerei...

438
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,160
I thought about it.

439
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:26,650
About why the professor would have stolen your playing of the Träumerei.

440
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:34,320
You must have played multiple pieces on the piano that day.

441
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:41,000
So why did he choose Träumerei?

442
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:48,620
Maybe...

443
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:56,800
among all the pieces you played that day, the one that touched his heart the most,

444
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,070
might have been Träumerei.

445
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,930
Because your Träumerei

446
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:13,140
is the one you play following your heart.

447
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:24,020
So I hope that from now on,

448
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:35,950
you can play following your heart.

449
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,690
You know, the piece we played today,

450
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:00,100
the F-A-E Sonata,

451
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:05,080
means "Free but lonely."
  (T/N: F-A-E stands for Frei Aber Einsam. Free but lonely.) 

452
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:12,490
But I hope... that you can...

453
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:22,790
be free... and happy.

454
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:35,120
Thank you for playing with me today.

455
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,550
Go back safely.

456
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:48,810
I love you.

457
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:06,800
I love you.

458
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:17,690
You told me to follow my heart.

459
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,990
That's why I'm telling you.

460
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,970
I know I have no right to say this.

461
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:38,260
And I know that it could be hard on you if I tell you this.

462
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:42,770
But I've been struggling so much,

463
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:51,120
that I felt like I would regret it my whole life if I didn't tell you now.

464
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:57,100
I'm sorry.

465
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,210
But right now...

466
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:07,730
I also want to think of myself only.

467
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,080
I love you.

468
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,550
 I found out later.  

469
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:38,220
 The piece we played that day 

470
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,920
   

471
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,200
 was the "free but lonely" sonata. 

472
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:50,090
 But the phrase that Brahms liked 

473
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:59,400
 was F.A.F. 

474
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,760
   

475
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:08,280
 Free... but happy. 

476
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,460
   

477
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:24,160
 I found out much later.  

478
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:42,210


479
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:49,040
   

480
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:53,230
♫   Your fair face   ♫

481
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:56,650
♫  Your pure eyes  ♫

482
00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:03,330
♫   Make my heart beat again   ♫

483
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:07,200
♫   Your warm hands  ♫

484
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,960
♫   Your voice calling me   ♫

485
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,570
♫  Feels like an embrace  ♫

486
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:23,010
♫   Please remember this one thing   ♫

487
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:28,610
♫   That I can't be without you  ♫

488
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:35,390
♫  My beautiful love   ♫

489
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:36,680
♫   My one love that makes my heart flutter   ♫

490
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,240
 We all want to work with you, Song Ah. 

491
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,650
 Mom, get a divorce. 

492
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:42,560
