1
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,150
Oh, Joon Young!

2
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,540
Oh, hello.

3
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,540
You must be going home.

4
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,030
Yes.

5
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,510
That's great.

6
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,690
So... I want you to come with me

7
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,270
I'm sorry?

8
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,100
Are you sure that's somewhere I can go?

9
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,850
Of course, and you need to come with me so I get scolded less.

10
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,080
It's because I unintentionally blurted out my thoughts.

11
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,030
Come again?

12
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,180
At any rate, isn't there anything you want to ask me?

13
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,400
Uh... what do you mean?

14
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,450
I know everything there is to know about Song Ah. I'm sure you have questions...

15
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,280
Ah... uh...

16
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,540
 I'm serious 

17
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,460
There are no secrets between me and Song Ah, and there couldn't be any.

18
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,620
If you did anything to upset her, she'd report that to me right away.

19
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,650
- We're those kinds of friends.
 - I see.

20
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:06,910
I probably know how much she likes you better than you do.

21
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,860
This is the first time she said she liked anything besides the violin.

22
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,050
So that's why I want to ask you...to take good care of her.

23
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,300
Oh...yes.

24
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,100
Just one sec.

25
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,210
 Oh Eun Ji. 

26
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,430
 I'm on my way. The taxi. 

27
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,560
 Okay! 

28
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,820
Thank you!

29
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,870
Huh? I think that's them.

30
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,480
Ah, Song Ah doesn't know you're here right?

31
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,560
So, let's surprise her! Shh!

32
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,820
 You see, Dong Yoon... 

33
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,950
 I...  

34
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,230
like Joon Young a lot.

35
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:31,090
Is that... your answer?

36
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,170
The answer to my confession...

37
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,230
was that it?

38
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,150
I too...

39
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,820
liked you.

40
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,350
For the longest time...

41
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,840
A lot actually.

42
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,820
 The inner thoughts that I didn't want people to know... 

43
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:32,920
 was that. But you know... 

44
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,570
Min Seong...

45
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,260
Min Seong!

46
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:21,260
I just told Joon Young... that we had no secrets... that we knew everything.

47
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,910
I bragged we were friends like that.

48
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,680
Min Seong.

49
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,340
But I didn't know you liked Yoon Dong Yoon.

50
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,680
No, please listen...

51
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,890
Don't even.

52
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,420
I don't want to hear it.

53
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,510
Are you happy to make an idiot out of me?

54
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,580
Drink some water.

55
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,170
I didn't want to hurt anyone...

56
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,930
so I feigned ignorance, feigned denial...

57
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,650
and kept a lot of things to myself.

58
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,770
I thought that was being considerate.

59
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,220
Min Seong was probably very hurt.

60
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,930
When she said she made a fool of herself...

61
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:16,980
I know all too well what that feels like.

62
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,260
So it's making me crazier.

63
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,630
Why are things so hard?

64
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,690
    
    

65
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,040
Song Ah.

66
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,390
- Song Ah! 
 - Yes. Yes?

67
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,480
Were you listening?

68
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,660
For the tickets, let's make each member get five more.

69
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,410
Yes.

70
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,170
Five more each?

71
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,410
Yes. It's our inaugural performance, we need to sell out the venue.

72
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,270
It's 50,000 won per ticket, so five by five, twenty-five: let's have each put in 250,000 won  (≈ $250)  more.

73
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,030
Everyone pitches in. How nice is that?

74
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,440
Excuse me...

75
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,490
Professor.

76
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,250
Yes? What is it, Song Ah?

77
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,280
That is, uhm...

78
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,640
Everyone already bought five to twenty tickets each,

79
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,520
so asking for more than that is a bit...

80
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,590
A bit what?

81
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,030
- No, it's nothing. 
 - What is it? Finish what you started to say.

82
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,860
No, it's just that, Uhm...

83
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,530
If it gets sold out just with members purchasing tickets,

84
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:05,420
people from the general public who want to see the concert won't be able to buy tickets.

85
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:11,170
That's why I thought it might be good to leave some aside, maybe?

86
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,780
Oh my!

87
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,470
Oh my, you're right! Goodness!

88
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,280
Song Ah, how are you so clever?

89
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,100
My goodness. Okay, then in that case,

90
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,360
let's not get five, but three each. Tell that to everyone.

91
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,140
Oh my goodness.

92
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,530
I don't want to.

93
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,190
I know exactly what you are worried about.

94
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,410
I do know.

95
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,780
But we will never take that kind of cheap sentimentalism route.

96
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,080
You're my artist,

97
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,450
so, of course, I'll control that well.

98
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,970
I still don't want to.

99
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,900
I don't want to make my family matters public on TV—

100
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,950
Park Joon Young.

101
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,350
If Seung Ji Min appears on such a TV show,

102
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,770
then he can talk about music only.

103
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,680
But your situation is different.

104
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,690
Okay? I'll drop a facts bomb just this once.

105
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,880
Right now people have no interest in hearing about your music, you see.

106
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,840
If you want people to gain interest in hearing about your music,

107
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,380
realistically, making them interested in something else about you first

108
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,420
will be faster. That's what I'm telling you here.

109
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,350
In this year 2020,

110
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:06,430
we're not in one of those times where people will come find you for your aloof and solitary artist attitude.

111
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,130
If you stay put and everyone forgets you,

112
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,840
then do you want to be playing piano alone in some corner,

113
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,300
while living off crumbs?

114
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,780
In order to get what you want,

115
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,040
you need to know how to endure it and do the things you don't want, too.

116
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,830
- Section Chief. 
 - I'm Branch Manager.

117
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,320
The one who manages your activities in South Korea.

118
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,120
Not "manages" in the present tense.

119
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,460
It's still only a potential future.

120
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,640
I haven't finished discussing with Chris yet.

121
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,790
You're asking me to buy more tickets?

122
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,390
Yes. Not too many,

123
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,830
just three per person.

124
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,040
- So— 
 - Unni.

125
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,180
Yes?

126
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,840
Buying three more tickets is fine, I can do it.

127
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,060
But is the professor doing this chamber orchestra saying "Shall we pursue the study of music together?"

128
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,110
or "Shall we all feel the joy of playing?"

129
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,930
You know it's not the case, don't you?

130
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,760
As a member myself, I'm in no position to say anything to you,

131
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,240
but doing this chamber orchestra isn't anything I'm proud of, honestly.

132
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,720
But you're taking from the students just to get in the professor's good favors.

133
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,200
It's a bit embarrassing to see.

134
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,910
Even though I know you're in a hurry to get into graduate school.

135
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,000
I'll deposit the money for the tickets later.

136
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,060
Oh, this must be new?

137
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,820
Yes.

138
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,250
Look. Do you think this would suit Professor Choi Woo Hyeon?

139
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,490
- Yes, it looks nice. 
 - Alright.

140
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,770
- We'll take this. 
 - Thank you.

141
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,650
Do you have anything to buy?

142
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,960
No, I'm alright.

143
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,110
- While we're here, you should buy an outfit. 
 - Sorry?

144
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,640
I wanted to tell you this, actually.

145
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,250
You're at such a nice age and you're so pretty,

146
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,560
why don't you pay attention to what you wear?

147
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,260
When you were young, your mother would take so much care to dress you.

148
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,490
- Please recommend a few outfits for her. 
 - Yes.

149
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,900
No, I'm all right.

150
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,300
Today, let's wear something bright and cheerful. Okay?

151
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,120
Even if just for me.

152
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,030
   

153
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,040
Oh, it's your friend, Unni.

154
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,110
Hello.

155
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Just a minute. Hold this for me please?

156
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,230
You guys can go in first.

157
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,990
Why are you here?

158
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,430
Min Seong...

159
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,850
Song Ah.

160
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,430
You know, I...

161
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,300
I can't do anything about Yoon Dong Yoon's feelings.

162
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:38,330
I'm not saying it's your fault that he liked you.

163
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:44,050
But... if I were you, I...

164
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,400
I wouldn't have liked Yoon Dong Yoon.

165
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,060
No. I think I couldn't have liked him.

166
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,070
Isn't that what friends do?

167
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,010
Min Seong, I'm really sorry.

168
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,770
- I also— 
 - Forget it, leave.

169
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,110
 Jung Kyung. 

170
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,920
 I'm dating Song Ah. 

171
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,770
Why are you like that?

172
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,570
Oh, it suits you so well!

173
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,190
It's not that easy to look good in this dress.

174
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,040
That's right, it's suits you well.

175
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,500
Have you decided what to wear for your recital?

176
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,310
Not yet.

177
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:06,640
Be it a new outfit or something you've worn before, show it to me beforehand. Okay?

178
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,740
Yes.

179
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,200
- What about your accompanist? 
 - I've decided on someone.

180
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,220
Really? Who?

181
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,770
Park Joon Young.

182
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:19,420
Oh, yes, Park Joon Young. Good.

183
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,640
How much does he charge as an accompanist?

184
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,260
Pardon?

185
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,710
Ah...

186
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,190
I think I haven't fought with a friend since elementary school.

187
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,630
Although it's not really a fight this time, with Min Seong.

188
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,470
For now, what about waiting before contacting her again?

189
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,630
I think Min Seong might need some time too.

190
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,470
Yes.

191
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,150
Don't worry too much, and cheer up.

192
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:08,480
Once time passes, Min Seong will also understand your feelings.

193
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,260
Will she?

194
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,080
Of course.

195
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,390
Oh, Soo Kyung, it's been a while!

196
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,080
You're here?

197
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,620
Soo Kyung! You came?

198
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,040
Yes, I came.

199
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,420
Oh, you came with someone?

200
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,530
Ah, she'll be my teaching assistant next year.

201
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,590
Oh, Madam the Dean...

202
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,860
I heard you're becoming the dean?

203
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,900
- Congrats. 
 - Thanks.

204
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,870
You're so competent in this.

205
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,670
No no, it's just the normal sequence for a professor.

206
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,370
Oh my. Jung Hee Unni!

207
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,000
- Jung Hee Unni! 
 - Oh my!

208
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,130
Unni, this place is so great.

209
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,920
I'm glad.

210
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,220
I was concerned about making you come this far.

211
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,730
No, not at all!

212
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,390
Ah right. This is Lee Jung Kyung,

213
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,990
my student.

214
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,620
- Hello. 
 - She's so pretty.

215
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,370
Right?

216
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,760
Jung Kyung just came back after her doctorate at the Julliard School.

217
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,800
She'll take my place at Seoryeong University when I retire.

218
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,480
Bravo! Bravo!

219
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,000
You did very well. Very well.

220
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,030
Thank you.

221
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,150
From what I've seen, Jung Hee,

222
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,290
you've raised many good pupils.

223
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:46,070
No matter how far this child will go,

224
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,190
the fact that she received the teachings of Professor Song Jung Hee

225
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,870
will follow her all her life.

226
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,300
Keep in mind that the Professor's name gets elevated together with the pupil's.

227
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,070
Yes.

228
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,750
I am so aware of this that it's a problem.

229
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,960
The kids are doing so well,

230
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,680
that it holds my head high, without me realizing.

231
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,230
Noona.

232
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,300
Oh, Joon Young!

233
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,940
You came to practice?

234
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,370
Sorry. I smell of cigarettes, right?

235
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,330
It's all right.

236
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,880
But didn't you say you were quitting smoking?

237
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,690
You failed?

238
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,880
Totally failed.

239
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,400
Habits are scary like that.

240
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,940
After I stopped doing something I used to do all the time,

241
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,190
I couldn't do anything else, either.

242
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,040
I know.

243
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,540
How do you know?

244
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,250
What habit did you get rid of?

245
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,910
 When I sat in front of the piano,  

246
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,500
 there was a piece I would always play 

247
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,650
 before practicing any other piece. 

248
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,210
I did that for around fifteen years.

249
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,760
Oh, I heard that musicians have a practice routine.

250
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,850
So you had one as well? I didn't know.

251
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,010
Yes. But...

252
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,840
I don't play it anymore.

253
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,630
Why?

254
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,000
I want to fix that habit.

255
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,560
I haven't played that piece in quite a long time.

256
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,020
What piece was it?

257
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,260
What's this? Making me curious.

258
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:52,710
But I wonder if we really need to force ourselves

259
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,730
to fix old habits.

260
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,760
Why do you think habits exist?

261
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,790
That's something I'm used to, and it's become natural. And in a way,

262
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,490
it has become part of myself.

263
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,820
If you try to forcefully fix an old habit

264
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,140
and end up ruining everything else,

265
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,800
then isn't it better to just leave it be?

266
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,010
Be safe on your way back.

267
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,820
I will call you soon.

268
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,400
Goodbye.

269
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,610
It's late, so we'll get going too.

270
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,760
- I'll be going, too. 
 - Bye.

271
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,750
Song Ah. Find another person to take you back, okay?

272
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,460
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

273
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,160
- I'll get in touch. 
 - Yes. Have a good trip back.

274
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,730
Bye.

275
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,370
You worked hard today, Professor.

276
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,580
Yes, thanks.

277
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,190
- Be safe on your way back. 
 - Yes.

278
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,020
You too.

279
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,400
Yes, goodbye...

280
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,900
I was thankful for the master class

281
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,300
last time.

282
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,850
I'm glad.

283
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,400
 Is it over? 

284
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,080
You're uncomfortable now, aren't you?

285
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,800
No.

286
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,820
You will keep being uncomfortable

287
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,040
from now on.

288
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,470
I'm not saying that I'll try anything.

289
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,840
I'll just stay in my position

290
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,200
and do what I have to,

291
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,680
and Joon Young will, too.

292
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:25,320
However, I am just waiting.

293
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,820
Just like Joon Young waited for me

294
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,230
during all this time.

295
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,610
 If you try to forcefully fix an old habit and end up ruining everything else,  

296
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,380
 then isn't it better to just leave it be? 

297
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,960
Song Ah.

298
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,430
Song Ah.

299
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,890
Yes?

300
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,540
Did something happen there today?

301
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,840
Ah... It's just, well...

302
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,820
Over there...

303
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:57,410
This is where you live, right?

304
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,660
Yes. How did you know?

305
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,280
Can...

306
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,890
Can I go there?

307
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,390
To your place?

308
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:31,350
♫   Though I'm alone, I long   ♫

309
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:37,130
Wait just a second. 
 ♫  for your warm smile   ♫

310
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,990
♫   The sky is like your big embrace   ♫

311
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,940
♫   Those clouds resemble your face   ♫

312
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,660
♫   I want to run into your arms   ♫

313
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,240
♫   I miss you so much    ♫

314
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,380
♫   Can you wait for me a little longer?   ♫

315
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,480
Welcome.

316
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,490
Hello. 
 ♫   I won't take too long   ♫

317
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,860
♫  Though I'm alone, I long   ♫

318
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:23,200
♫  for your warm smile  ♫

319
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,870
♫   Even the sunlight reminds me   ♫

320
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,470
♫   of your bright eyes   ♫

321
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,690
- Wow...
 ♫   Everything looks like you  ♫

322
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:37,940
Your place is so clean. Is it always this tidy? 
 ♫   my love   ♫

323
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,160
Please think so. Take a seat.

324
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,300
Ah, yes.

325
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,360
Would you like some tea? I don't have any coffee.

326
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,020
Yes, tea is good.

327
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,650
Ah but... I don't have ice either.

328
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,260
Is it alright even if it's hot?

329
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,970
Yes, it's fine.

330
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,380
Woah, the view is nice. Oh?

331
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,700
You even see the company.

332
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,600
I see it too well, yes.

333
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,860
That's true.

334
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,970
It must be blinding at night.

335
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:40,020
There isn't much in my home, right?

336
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,000
Ah, no.

337
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,210
It's just...

338
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:52,460
I wanted to come and see it just once.

339
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:57,050
Because I wanted to know more about you.

340
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,650
Then what did you learn?

341
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,890
That you're someone who doesn't have much in their home,

342
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:18,580
and you are good at cleaning your place. That sort of thing?

343
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,420
Joon Young, are you alright?

344
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,680
- You didn't get hurt? 
 - Ah, no.

345
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,590
Don't touch it, you'll hurt your hands.

346
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,750
Do you have something like wet wipes?

347
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,350
Yes, it's in the desk's drawer.

348
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,590
The drawer? Don't move.

349
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,690
Joon Young, stay behind.

350
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,590
Please leave it, I'll do it.

351
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,670
Don't do it, you play the piano.

352
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,750
And you don't play the violin?

353
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,170
Leave it, I'll clean it up.

354
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,820
You're tired, right?

355
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:58,320
It's late, so I'll go now.

356
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,800
It's raining.

357
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,570
 You'll keep being uncomfortable 

358
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:25,930
 from now on.  

359
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:29,220
 I'm not saying that I'll try anything.  

360
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,920
 However, I am just waiting. 

361
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:41,590
♫   The radiant memories of our past days  ♫

362
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:48,660
♫   come visit me again  ♫

363
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:56,660
♫   In the end, I wasn't able to forget anything about you   ♫

364
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:02,270
♫   I must have loved you too much   ♫

365
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:10,240
♫   Because I miss you, I cry out your name   ♫

366
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,520
♫   Even if it's just a lingering attachment, I'll have no regrets   ♫

367
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,450
 The drawer? Don't move. 

368
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:26,140
♫   Can you hear my heartfelt story?  ♫

369
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:32,630
♫   Without you, I'm nothing   ♫

370
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,190
   

371
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:00,960
    

372
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,750
You did very well.

373
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,300
I'll tell you a few things.

374
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,130
First of all, in this part here, it would be better if the line was longer.

375
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,260
It felt a bit short.

376
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,680
And for this part, here...

377
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,380
- It's easy to understand when he explains, right? 
 - Yes.

378
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,370
He teaches well.

379
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:52,290
- It's unexpected, but he's quite good. 
  - Right?

380
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,960
So you were here.

381
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,190
I greeted you inside earlier, though.

382
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,990
Did you? Sorry.

383
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:12,360
Han Hyeon Ho... What do you think about him?

384
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,440
He's good.

385
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,330
He's a member of my chamber orchestra, after all.

386
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,700
Oh, really?

387
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,240
Goodness. Wow.

388
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,970
Why are you laughing?

389
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:32,940
Sometimes I find you admirable.

390
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,950
You're actually quite unbiased.

391
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:41,270
Since Han Hyeon Ho was Jung Kyung's long-time lover, I thought you'd think he wouldn't do.

392
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,530
But you just look at skills, don't you?

393
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:47,160
You're impressive, Lee Soo Kyung.

394
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,560
Why did you come here?

395
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,000
Good job.

396
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,810
If you aren't busy, then go practice the accompaniment for Jung Kyung.

397
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,850
Hyeon Ho.

398
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,150
I'm sorry.

399
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,470
About what?

400
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:14,710
I... used to like Jung Kyung.

401
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,160
But not anymore.

402
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,590
That's also why I can be her accompanist.

403
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,320
Not anymore?

404
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,690
No, not anymore.

405
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,760
Shouldn't it have been like that from the start?

406
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:37,190
Even if you started to have feelings for her, you should have put an end to them.

407
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:43,020
If you couldn't do that, you shouldn't have let them be discovered.

408
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,750
And if you couldn't do either of the two,

409
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,570
you should at least have told me.

410
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,160
Had you told me even just once...

411
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:04,240
Then I wouldn't have let Jung Kyung waver. I would have done something.

412
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,240
At the very least, I wouldn't have continued to play friends with you.

413
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,370
I'm sorry.

414
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,550
Whatever the reason,

415
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:30,170
I'm really sorry toward you. But Hyeon Ho,

416
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,200
I didn't want to lose you.

417
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,140
- Hyeon Ho.
- Park Joon Young.

418
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:52,200
You already lost me and you can't get me back.

419
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,000
Stop trying so hard.

420
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,790
Hello.

421
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:49,370
Welcome. How can I help you?

422
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:52,530
I would like to replace my bow hair.

423
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,370
Ah, your bow hairs?

424
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:56,020
Sir, the tools I borrowed—

425
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,190
Dong Yoon, wait a minute.

426
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,510
You want to replace your bow hair?

427
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,600
Wait a moment.

428
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,430
 You already lost me. And you can't get me back. 

429
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,190
   We have practice tomorrow, right? 

430
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,790
It's awkward.

431
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,640
Did you go there because you felt too awkward to see me?

432
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,800
Yes.

433
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,950
It's awkward.

434
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,720
I've been friends with Min Seong for ten years.

435
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,180
But things became like this now.

436
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,540
How can I

437
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,040
look at you comfortably as if nothing happened?

438
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,360
Haven't you been friends with me for ten years, too?

439
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:32,130
That's what I'm saying, you and I should have just been friends.

440
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,180
But we couldn't.

441
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,970
I'm not saying it's your fault.

442
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,010
I'm sorry.

443
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,020
I'll get going first.

444
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,190
   

445
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,100
   

446
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,160
   

447
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:41,680
   

448
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,720
Take a seat.

449
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,450
I'm back.

450
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:17,020
Did you have dinner?

451
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,220
I don't have an appetite.

452
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:26,590
For my recital for the appointment of professor at Seoryeong University, Joon Young agreed to be my accompanist.

453
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,040
I see.

454
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:37,310
How much did you give Joon Young for his accompanist fee at the house concert last time?

455
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,270
Twenty million.  (≈ $20,000) 

456
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,360
Twenty million?

457
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:50,380
Joon Young has been living all his life sending money to his family by playing the piano.

458
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:56,010
He took the courage to decide to rest for a year,

459
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:58,900
so of course I have to give him that much for such a request.

460
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,290
You ask him to be your accompanist without even thinking about that?

461
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,550
Are you done?

462
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:44,410
Okay, then...

463
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,190
The part at the end...

464
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,500
For the part at the end...

465
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,340
Let's stop here for today and schedule another time.

466
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:41,780
 Joon Young, is Professor Yoo Tae Jin in a good mood? 

467
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,790
 Pardon? 

468
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,930
 He released an album this summer. 

469
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:48,520
 I think he is a bit sensitive because of that lately. 

470
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,920
   

471
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:14,370
- One more glass here, please. 
 - Yes.

472
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,350
Thank you.

473
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,310
Give it to me.

474
00:47:54,950 --> 00:48:02,400
Joon Young, when you see people like Seung Ji Min,

475
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,910
what crosses your mind?

476
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,020
"He's a good junior." That sort of thing.

477
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:16,870
That's all?

478
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,750
Yes.

479
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,060
Hypocrite.

480
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:31,220
Do you think I'm asking about Seung Ji Min's character right now?

481
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:38,520
Then what should I be thinking?

482
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:43,620
Things like "You have to slip up for me to live."

483
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,780
and wishing that he doesn't succeed?

484
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:53,250
Should I pray that he messes up his performance,

485
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,820
or that his talent disappears?

486
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:59,360
Yes. You should.

487
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:04,400
That's... That's more human-like.

488
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:09,950
Why do you laugh?

489
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:15,490
Because it struck me how you and I are so different.

490
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:26,190
That's why. That's why you can't do it.

491
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:31,540
If you've been trampled on if you slipped,

492
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,450
you should blow a fuse and virulently want to obtain more.

493
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:45,190
If I want to obtain more, does it make everything work out?

494
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,770
And what if you don't covet more?

495
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:54,580
If you don't even covet anything,

496
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:58,940
then well, won't anything work at all?

497
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:08,830
That's why I came back to you, Professor.

498
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:15,410
Asking for private lessons,  to go to competitions.

499
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:27,360
Right. So get first place.

500
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:31,200
So that no one can look down on you.

501
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:41,330
   

502
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,970
I ask for your continued support.

503
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:48,710
We should be thanking you.

504
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:53,380
But... did you come all the way to Daejon just for this?

505
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,510
Obviously, I should come here first before introductions

506
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,810
You are my artist's parent.

507
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:06,340
We haven't done anything for Joon Young while he played the piano...

508
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:10,190
If it weren't for the foundation... gosh, I don't know how

509
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:14,000
we'd teach him the piano.

510
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,700
Oh! How forgetful of me! Joon Young's dad is inside, just a sec...

511
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,630
Oh, no no no! Just a moment.

512
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:25,620
I have something I need to tell you first.

513
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,150
- Me? 
 - Yes.

514
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,730
Then... enjoy practicing for the accompaniment.

515
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:38,970
Yes.

516
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:44,210
But if I'm practicing at Kyunghoo, I don't know if I can come back to school.

517
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,120
It's okay.

518
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:52,160
If I'm also practicing with my accompanist instructor, it'll already be evening.

519
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,270
Then once you're done, call me.

520
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:58,170
Okay.

521
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:24,130
   

522
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,590
What? Replacement Seoryeong University Professor?

523
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:43,970
She should just quietly retire.

524
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:47,690
She's trying to set up a 10,000-year dynasty.

525
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:53,950
 Sometimes, I find you so admirable. 

526
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:57,130
 You're unexpectedly unbiased. 

527
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:02,430
 Han Hyeon Ho is a long-time boyfriend of Jung Kyung, so I thought it'd be troublesome. 

528
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:05,720
 But you really only look at skills. 

529
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,600
 You're so cool, Lee Soo Kyeong. 

530
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,950
If he's going out with Jung Kyung, why is he asking to come into my chamber?

531
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:16,540
What is he planning, re-

532
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:19,160
Do I look that laughable?

533
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,790
No, no.

534
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:37,970
I feel too uncomfortable about this.

535
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,900
Yes, Professor.

536
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:53,230
Oh, Song Ah. Don't contact Han Hyeon Ho.

537
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,350
I'm sorry?

538
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:59,160
Han Hyeon Ho. Remove him from our chamber.

539
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:05,880
I already sent him an invite to dinner.

540
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,530
Already?

541
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:12,310
Regardless, you call him and get him out.

542
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:17,250
 Make up a reasonable excuse, don't blame it on me. Understand? 

543
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:23,150
That little... she sure works fast.

544
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,650
Hello.

545
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:35,430
Did you come prepared today?

546
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,280
Da Eun said it would work today.

547
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,750
Someone else reserved the rehearsal room first.

548
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,550
There must have been a mistake.

549
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:56,100
Did you already leave school?

550
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,990
Then... I'll come to school.

551
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:02,030
Huh? Oh, no the school is a little...

552
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:05,940
 Then where do you want it? You said you didn't like my home. 

553
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:09,940
 I'll be there in 30 minutes. See you at school. 

554
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,440
I mean, I told you repeatedly.

555
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,350
By yourself you're fine, but every time you're with the piano, you're shaky.

556
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:31,850
There's a tempo you have in your mind, right?

557
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:32,750
Yes...

558
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:36,840
Right. So you need to take that tempo and match it with me.

559
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,450
 But you're being dragged along by me.  
    

560
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:42,750
Do you not have confidence in your music?

561
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:47,560
I'm sorry...

562
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,250
Don't keep saying "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

563
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,150
Let's try this again.

564
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,570
Yes.

565
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,150
Are you participating in a competition?

566
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,830
Why?

567
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,860
Your sheet music looked like competition material.

568
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,200
Yeah, I'm going.

569
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:41,540
- Tchaikovsky?
 - Yeah.

570
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,800
Why?

571
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,960
What reason do I have for these competitions?

572
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:53,280
Joon Young...

573
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:09,340
Oh, Mom! I just got done. I'm so tired.

574
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,990
Okay! I'll be right there!

575
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:14,410
Song Ah, good luck!

576
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:16,960
Have a nice day.

577
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:21,760
It's over there! Let's go!

578
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,380
   

579
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,030
 He's on a different class! 

580
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:33,100
 As expected, a world class is something! 

581
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,800
 Who's the violin? 

582
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,570
 Isn't it Lee Jung Kyung? 

583
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:39,820
 - She's good! 
  - Right? Right? 

584
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,030
 He's so cool. 

585
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:20,540


586
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,090
 Between you and Jung Kyung... 

587
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:31,320
 that is... between the time you shared together... 

588
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:36,740
 is there room for me? 

589
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:44,330
♫   Like the winds that scatter,   ♫

590
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:48,990
♫   I hope my sadness will disappear   ♫

591
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:58,990

611
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:40,520
 How did you get here? 

612
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,800
 You always do what you want. 

613
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,620
 Do you want a drink? 

614
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:47,860
 I heard you were going out with Joon Young. I understand you like him, but I'm sorry to say... 

615
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:50,540
 What are you thinking about? You're not sick anywhere, are you? 

616
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:52,780
 I'm suddenly losing confidence. 

617
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:53,790
 Why did you go looking for her? 

618
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:55,480
 What's a manager supposed to do? 

619
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,390
 I didn't buy a ticket to Seoul. You didn't either, did you? 

620
01:00:58,390 --> 01:00:59,260
 I didn't. 

621
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:00,160
 But why are you smiling? 

622
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,620
 Aren't we going to Seoul? 

623
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:09,200
♫   There will be a path for you  ♫
