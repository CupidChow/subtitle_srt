1
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,050
 We will now conclude our 38th Violin Mentor's meeting. 

2
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,740
Thank you for coming!

3
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,680
You worked hard!

4
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,450
You'll eat with us, right?

5
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,700
Oh, I can't go today.

6
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,880
Why not?

7
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,800
I'm heading a chamber orchestra this year,

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,260
and today is our first dinner.

9
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,280
You must be busy with just your work at school, but a chamber too?

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,480
You're really amazing!

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,380
Come see us when we perform.

12
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,720
I'll get you tickets.

13
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,840
I commend your students for buying your tickets.

14
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,450
I'm sorry?

15
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,820
You see, for my chamber, we usually sell over 80% of the seats,

16
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,650
so I don't pressure my students to buy tickets for me.

17
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,800
So, since you've already started, work hard, okay?

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,820
Who knows, you may even have an audience some day.

19
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,100
Oh right, Professor. Remember the middle school student who got first in Seongjoo Ilbo?

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,280
She was your student, right?

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,620
Ah, yes. Ji Won?

22
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,430
At any rate, any student that gets to learn from you

23
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,690
should count themselves lucky!

24
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,290
Please share with us your professorial secrets too sometimes!

25
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,090
- What are you talking about? 
 - But you should, Unni.

26
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,530
Don't limit your teachings only to Jung Kyung because she's your student.

27
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,320
What?

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,170
Ji Won's supplemental teacher is Lee Jung Kyung, right?

29
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,840
You treated Jung Kyung like your own daughter,

30
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,050
you must have taught her your professorial techniques as well.

31
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,970
It looked so nice with them being so close together.

32
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,250
You did well!

33
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,030
Hah.

34
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,940
Miss Jung Kyung! I got first place!

35
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,210
Yes, I did it just like you taught me the other day.

36
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,760
How do you do, Professor?

37
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,910
Oh, I was late wasn't I? Did many people come?

38
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,880
Yes, almost everyone made it.

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,560
Oh right. You know the list of tickets for our performance?

40
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,330
I noticed that you also had purchased tickets of your own,

41
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,940
but you don't have to buy any.

42
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry?

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,330
You've been working hard as a secretary. Why would you need to buy ticket's on top of that?

44
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:55,340
It's fine if just the playing orchestra members buy them.

45
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,780
- Ah but, Professor? 
 - Hmm?

46
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,770
- Am I... not a member? 
 - Hmm?

47
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,470
Of course not! Only good players are invited here.

48
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,730
I've been thinking of making you work as my secretary from the start.

49
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,200
Wrap it up and come in.

50
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,900
 Oh you're all here? 

51
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,170
Sorry, just one sec.

52
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,460
Yes, professor?

53
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,120
Come again?

54
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,290
You must think you can tackle Seoryeong University by yourself, do you?

55
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,220
Seeing you stab me in the back like that.

56
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,250
What do you mean, Professor?

57
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,880
Professor, that's not what happened. You see...

58
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,640
What's wrong?

59
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,190
Why? Who was that? Was that Professor Song Jung Hee?

60
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,180
 What did she say? 

61
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,130
I gave Ji Won some lessons,

62
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,330
but it looks like she found out.

63
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,690
Ji Won? The middle schooler?

64
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,690
What do I do? I think I need to go see the Professor.

65
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,080
H-hey!

66
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,540
♫   I'm reminded again of you who drifted away   ♫

67
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,610
    
    

68
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,030
♫   though I loved you   ♫

69
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,870
♫   The radiant memories of our past days  ♫

70
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,960
♫   The radiant memories of our past days  ♫

71
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:22,140
♫   come visit me again.   ♫

72
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,850
♫   In the end, I wasn't able to forget anything about you   ♫

73
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,980
♫   In the end, I wasn't able to forget anything about you   ♫

74
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:35,720
♫   I must have loved you too much   ♫

75
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,050
♫   Because I miss you, I cry out your name   ♫

76
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,480
♫   Because I miss you, I cry out your name   ♫

77
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,610
♫   Even if it's just a lingering attachment, I'll have no regrets   ♫

78
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,590
♫   Even if it's just a lingering attachment, I'll have no regrets   ♫

79
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,920
♫   Even if it's just a lingering attachment, I'll have no regrets   ♫

80
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,610
♫   Can you hear my heartfelt story?  ♫

81
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,520
♫   Can you hear my heartfelt story?  ♫

82
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,090
♫   Without you, I'm nothing   ♫

83
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,250
 Because I've seen you grow up as a child, 

84
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,260
I must've only seen you as a child.

85
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,600
I always thought you'd depend on me

86
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,060
and I thought I would always need to look after you.

87
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,150
But it looks like you can do without me just fine.

88
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,420
How could you think of stealing my student from me?

89
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:42,390
That's not it, Professor. I had no such intentions!

90
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,460
I was just...

91
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,700
I was just... reminded of my childhood.

92
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,260
So I wanted to help her.

93
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,350
Because life was so hard for me, back then.

94
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,700
Thoughts of your childhood?

95
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,620
Ji Won is different from you.

96
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,730
Do you think Ji Won will fail like you did?

97
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,570
You're home?

98
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,140
- Where's Jung Kyung? 
 - Jung Kyung is...

99
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,460
She was practicing, but she suddenly left in a hurry.

100
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,450
Suddenly?

101
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,180
Let's go home first.

102
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,070
Go upstairs and have some rest.

103
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,610
I'll put away the instrument for you.

104
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,790
I thought of my mother.

105
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,470
I saw Ji Won,

106
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,280
but I thought of my mother.

107
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,070
No... I did it because I remembered

108
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,770
how I suffered because of my mother.

109
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,240
Even so, I shouldn't have done that.

110
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,280
It was all because I was too impulsive.

111
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,070
Just go upstairs and rest first.

112
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,550
I shouldn't have done that to you in New York either.

113
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:00,210
Joon Young, do you really...

114
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,310
have no feelings for me anymore?

115
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,770
Then, what am I to you now?

116
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,170
Do you pity me?

117
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,250
Why? Because I don't have a mother?

118
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,520
Or...because I've lost my talents and become an ordinary girl?

119
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,270
- Jung Kyung.
 - You're the one who's pitiful.

120
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,590
You couldn't express your true feelings

121
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:38,180
and could only send a recording of your playing on my birthday every year.

122
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,580
You probably thought you were holding back because of your friend,

123
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,110
but was it really...really because of Hyeon Ho?

124
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,990
Okay.

125
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,710
I'll be honest.

126
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:04,240
All the things I received from your family...

127
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,330
Money, piano...

128
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,140
Because of all that, I never dared to think about having you.

129
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,790
I received a lot from your family,

130
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,270
so even when I didn't want to see you, I...

131
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,400
So...just let me go.

132
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,210
Please just let me go.

133
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,460
From now on,

134
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,520
I don't want to receive anything from you.

135
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,490
Your father called me just now.

136
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,160
Why did he... call you?

137
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,310
Did you... send him money?

138
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,180
- Did you do that?
 - Yeah.

139
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,810
I did.

140
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,950
Joon Young, no matter what you say,

141
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,910
you need me.

142
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,180
I also need you.

143
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,840
What are you doing right now?

144
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,630
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here.

145
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,790
Have you been helping Joon Young so that this would happen?

146
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,720
Then, why did you help him, Grandma?

147
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,040
What were you hoping for?

148
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,940
I wasn't hoping for anything.

149
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,300
I just wanted Joon Young to happily play the piano which he loves so much.

150
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,060
Then, you've failed.

151
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:19,400
Joon Young has never once been happy playing the piano.

152
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,670
Because he was burdened by the money we gave him,

153
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,630
he only played because he had to. For me, you,

154
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,840
and the foundation.

155
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,550
But I got too used to it...

156
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,000
To Joon Young's piano playing.

157
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:48,870
The thing that comforted me wasn't you or Father.

158
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,980
It was Joon Young, who played this piano.

159
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,880
I don't have any talents anymore,

160
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,220
and I even gave Hyeon Ho up.

161
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,840
I can't lose Joon Young too.

162
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,100
 Joon Young, I can't reach you on the phone. 

163
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,930
 We got the money! 

164
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,160
 Your dad has it all solved, so don't worry. 

165
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
 I'm coming to Seoul. 

166
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,330
 Let's talk when I'm there. 

167
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,650
Joon Young, you're back.

168
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,610
Mom, what are you doing?

169
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,770
Oh, nothing...

170
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:18,120
I was just waiting for you and there was nothing to do...

171
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,200
You saw my message, right?

172
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,570
I got a call from your father when I was on the bus,

173
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,240
so I just came anyway.

174
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,320
I wanted to see where you lived, too.

175
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,540
Where did Dad get the money?

176
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,130
What?

177
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,560
- That...
 - From Jung Kyung.

178
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,810
Joon Young...

179
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,910
I... I really didn't know.

180
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,660
Joon Young, no...

181
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,820
Your dad probably...

182
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,250
He probably called her because he had no other way...

183
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,870
Why did we take Jung Kyung's money again?

184
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,850
Why?

185
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,900
I begged you guys.

186
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:16,220
Please... please stop making me look so pathetic.

187
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,280
I begged you.

188
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,760
But... once again, Jung Kyung...

189
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,370
No... Joon Young...

190
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,040
If Dad didn't keep doing that...

191
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,240
If he didn't take the money...

192
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,480
I might have...

193
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,050
At the very least, I may have

194
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,620
become a lot happier than I am now.

195
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,340
Mom, right now, I...

196
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,290
I'm not happy

197
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,660
playing the piano at all.

198
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,510
 Jung Kyung Seon 

199
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:34,560
 ♪ Congratulations on your admission  ♪ 

200
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,120
 ♪ Congratulations to our dear Song Ah  ♪ 

201

202
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,350
 Congratulations! 

203
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,750
 - Song Ah.
 - Yeah? 

204
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,650
 Are you happy? 

205
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,670
 I'm happy. 

206
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,260
Song Ah.

207
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,600
 Were you practicing? 

208
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:35,000
I have to go to my lesson soon too, so I dropped by for a bit.

209
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,210
I see.

210
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,750
How was your gathering yesterday? A lot of seniors must have been there.

211
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,200
Yes.

212
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:56,430
Sorry I didn't contact you yesterday. My phone died.

213
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,800
That's okay.

214
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
No.

215
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,460
I don't think I'm okay.

216
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,590
I saw you and Jung Kyung yesterday.

217
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,330
You guys left in a taxi.

218
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,060
Where did you go?

219
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:45,780
I was Jung Kyung's accompanist yesterday, and then we had to go to Professor Song Jung Hee's house for something.

220
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,710
Why did you go there with her?

221
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,550
We had something to do.

222
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,740
And...

223
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,050
 Did you... send him money? 

224
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,940
 Yeah. 

225
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,650
 I did. 

226
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:35,220
Then, I went home and my mom came. That's all.

227
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:43,220
Sorry. I didn't think it was significant enough for me to tell you...

228
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,750
It keeps bothering me.

229
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,120
That fact that you're Jung Kyung's accompanist bothers me.

230
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:59,250
I told myself I'm worried about nothing, and I wanted to trust you and not think about it...

231
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,570
I thought everything would turn out fine...

232
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,920
but it's not fine.

233
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,820
I'm sorry.

234
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:21,670
And... you don't have to worry about it anymore.

235
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,760
I'm not going to be Jung Kyung's accompanist anymore.

236
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,210
I shouldn't have done it from the start,

237
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,020
but I guess I didn't think it through properly.

238
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,470
You're here.

239
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,070
Oh, how have you been?

240
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,020
Thanks for making the time to come here today.

241
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,830
I'm the one who should thank you for inviting me.

242
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,500
But where's the Chairwoman?

243
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,860
She said she's just arrived.

244
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,630
Let me know if you need anything.

245
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,260
- Hi! 
 - Unni, you're here.

246
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,720
Unni, was the gathering fun yesterday?

247
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,580
Thank you for helping out with our event.

248
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:25,190
I didn't do much. Team Leader Cha did everything. I just came to say a few words.

249
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:31,270
But... you heard from Jung Kyung already, right?

250
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:36,810
Yeah, I did. She gave Ji Won a lesson.

251
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,100
Yes.

252
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:45,370
Excuse me for saying this, but Jung Kyung has acted greatly inappropriately, against me.

253
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,960
I suppose you still don't know Jung Kyung very well.

254
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,550
She's a child that's used to doing what she wants.

255
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,580
All right then. I still have a lesson, so I'll head off now.

256
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,530
Good luck with the guest lecture and take care.

257
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,560
Yes. Thanks for leading the way.

258
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,900
Unni!

259
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,970
The guest lecture today is from the Kyunghoo Foundation, right?

260
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,200
Oh, right. It's today, isn't it?

261
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,830
Do you think it's worth going?

262
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:54,020
It just started not long ago...

263
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,630
But Unni, you were a intern with Kyunghoo before, weren't you?

264
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,050
I'm also kind of curious.

265
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,670
Let's go.

266
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,670
Sorry, I'm late.

267
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:16,830
Oh, right... I heard you said something to the teaching assistant about the piano in the practice room.

268
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,790
The pianos at the school are pretty lousy, aren't they?

269
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,880
If there's nowhere for you to practice, you can practice here if you want.

270
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,290
All right!

271
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:36,300
   

272
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:44,150
To summarize what I talked about,

273
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,950
the performance ability of a classical performer is essential.

274
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,070
As well as the ability to self-market and plan

275
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:54,350
is not merely needed, but mandatory.

276
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:58,170
I'll end my talk here today.

277
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,330
Thank you for listening.

278
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:04,470
All right, so far, we've heard great words

279
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,930
from Kyunghoo Foundation's Chairman Na Moon Sook

280
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,000
and Marketing Team Leader Cha Young In.

281
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,030
Are you going to continue being like this?

282
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,270
How many times have I told you this isn't correct?

283
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,630
Are you going to continue playing however you want to like this?

284
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,720
Is that wrong?

285
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,680
What did you say?

286
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:34,580
Am I not even allowed to play the piano however I want?

287
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,890
You said you wanted to get first place.

288
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,830
If you want to play how you want and win first place too,

289
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,580
you must first have such overwhelming talent

290
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,610
so no one can touch you like Seung Ji Min or Kim Gyu Hee!

291
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,370
But you're not them.

292
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,520
Don't you get what I'm saying?

293
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,690
Let's stop here today.

294
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,570
Rest for a day.

295
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,990
I'm a flute major. I'm also interested in performance planning.

296
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:31,170
But looking at the people around me who graduated from music school and worked in performance,

297
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,220
oddly, a lot of people quit really quickly.

298
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,230
Is there some particular reason for that?

299
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,430
For those who start playing music and transition to planning,

300
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,590
and I'm being careful to say this,

301
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:50,720
they weren't able to handle their own emotions,

302
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,890
and in many cases give up.

303
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,270
They wear dark clothes to not stand out, and they wait behind a darkened stage.

304
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,910
and for the sake of those colleagues who studied music with them,

305
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:06,610
they now quietly watch them receive the spotlight and play music.

306
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,750
I think that thought is what's hard for them.

307
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,900
To give up such a fervent dream,

308
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,750
is easier said than done.

309
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,550
Team Leader!

310
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,890
Oh, you're here!

311
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,270
Of course, I had to come! I really enjoyed the talk today!

312
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,650
Song Ah! Come over here.

313
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,540
Song Ah, you're here.

314
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,570
How have you been?

315
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,200
Song Ah!

316
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:41,350
- Our summer interns, right?
 - Yes.

317
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:49,000
Oh right! I remembered last time you complimented how hard a worker Song Ah was

318
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,300
so while I was getting my chamber together I had her do my secretarial work.

319
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,940
Ah, I see...

320
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,150
 She's such a hard and diligent worker! 

321
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,410
Not just you, but Joon Young also is such a good judge of character!

322
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:09,180
You couldn't ask for a better wife for a performer.

323
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,920
- I'm sorry? 
 - Well, nowadays women all have their own job keeping them busy,

324
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,910
but honestly, for musicians like Joon Young who go on tour,

325
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:21,960
they need a wife who packs their bags and manages their schedule, after all.

326
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,050
That's not a bad thing.

327
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,150
That's how they can focus on their music only, without having to worry

328
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,050
about bothersome things like managing their money.

329
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,890
- Excuse me— 
 - Joon Young

330
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,910
isn't one to date someone over that kind of thing.

331
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,670
Ah, yes. Of course, Director Na.

332
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:46,620
I was just saying it because I find it so adorable that they are dating.

333
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,950
Yes, of course, you were.

334
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,450
- Yes. 
 - That's right.

335
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,110
- Well then, be safe on your way. 
 - Yes.

336
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,240
- I'll see you some other time. 
 - Goodbye.

337
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,380
- Thank you for your work. 
 - Yes.

338
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,970
Joon Young!

339
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,360
Oh, Master Park Joon Young!

340
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,040
- You're here? 
 - Hello, Oppa.

341
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,220
Hello.

342
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:38,260
All this time... I've been hurting many people.

343
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:42,730
The closer they were, the more they have been hurt.

344
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:53,110
Joon Young. Chairman Lee, Jung Kyung's Dad.

345
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,850
Even keeping his own position is too much for him.

346
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,760
He is too soft.

347
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:09,610
I thought I needed someone to protect the foundation after my passing.

348
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:16,500
That's why when it came to who would be next to Jung Kyung, rather than picking who she wanted,

349
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,830
I preferred someone who would want to be the son-in-law for Kyunghoo Group,

350
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:28,110
someone who would want to be the board director of the foundation. That's what I thought.

351
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:33,450
I was only worried about myself,

352
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:38,490
I couldn't see into your heart.

353
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,150
I am sorry.

354
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,110
Please don't be.

355
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:59,400
I realized too late what you meant to Jung Kyung.

356
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:09,860
Joon Young, could you stay by Jung Kyung's side?

357
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,190
My apologies.

358
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:28,550
I have... no such feelings anymore.

359
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,380
I see.

360
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,440
I realized that too late as well.

361
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,050
I'm sorry.

362
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:01,760
People really... say whatever they please.

363
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:07,470
Not everybody is an adult just because they are older.

364
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,030
But still, I'm envious.

365
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,680
What? Of what?

366
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,860
People who say everything they want.

367
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,130
I envy them.

368
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:31,620
Even though they hurt other people by doing that?

369
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:41,910
Still, at least they can protect themselves.

370
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,450
So that other people can't hurt them however they please.

371
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,890
You don't have to walk me out, it's fine.

372
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,960
Still, I can accompany you to where your driver—

373
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,120
No, I'm really fine.

374
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,870
Brahms. I think I can listen to you playing Brahms now, no?

375
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:27,370
I really want to hear it one day. Can you grant me that favor?

376
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,020
Yes.

377
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,730
Thank you, Joon Young.

378
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,310
Be well. Take care.

379
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:26,150
Did your meeting with Director Na go well?

380
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,320
Yes.

381
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:37,490
What about you? Did it go well with Young In Noona?

382
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,270
Yes.

383
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,660
I'll go see Jung Kyung.

384
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,860
To return the sheet music of the accompaniment to her.

385
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:03,870
Today will be the last time. Seeing Jung Kyung, that is.

386
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,710
It's really great.

387
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,990
The sound seems firmer and the reverberation is good.

388
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,430
You did something to the sound post, didn't you?

389
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:32,530
Yes. I'm glad you like it.

390
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,920
Woah, instruments are fascinating.

391
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,670
They're sensitive and expensive.

392
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,450
The front part of this one is cracked.

393
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,400
Yes, the bridge fell.

394
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,020
I have only ever heard of that happening, it's the first time I actually see it.

395
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,370
It happens sometimes.

396
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:56,290
It can also fall when the instrument receives a strong impact.

397
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:05,860
By the way... I heard you aren't joining Professor Lee Soo Kyung's chamber orchestra anymore.

398
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,250
Yes, it ended up that way.

399
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:13,090
How did you know? Rumors travel really fast.

400
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,240
This field is so small.

401
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,990
By sitting here, I hear all kind of stories I don't even want to hear.

402
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,000
Nothing interesting?

403
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,890
Nothing. People don't talk about other's success, you know.

404
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,180
They only talk about their failures.

405
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:35,600
What the? So you're saying all those stories of failures included my story?

406
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:44,350
Don't be like that. Tell me. Is there nothing about someone in a worse situation than me?

407
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:53,250
What's this? There really is?

408
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,620
No, just...

409
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,850
Jung Kyung.

410
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,170
What about her?

411
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,460
She...

412
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:12,130
She's been disowned by Professor Song Jung Hee.

413
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,290
   

414
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:25,790
I don't think I can be your accompanist. I'm sorry.

415
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:30,170
I'm about to fail being appointed anyway, so there's no need for you to be my accompanist?

416
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,970
Is that what this is?

417
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,970
That's not it.

418
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,380
Then why can't you do it?

419
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,720
I understand.

420
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,450
You're done, right?

421
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:58,720
About the money... I'll repay you.

422
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,840
And...

423
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:12,460
Let's... not see each other anymore.

424
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,830
Ever again.

425
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:44,090
   

426
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,760
 If you don't have a place to practice, you can just come here.  

427
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,430
I'll go now, so practice at ease.

428
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:29,020
Am I maybe stopping you from practicing?

429
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,210
I was going to go home.

430
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,720
Work hard.

431
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,650
Thank you.

432
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,430
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

433
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,700
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

434
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,760
Let's enjoy the meal.

435
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,160
- Enjoy. 
 - Yes.

436
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,770
It's delicious.

437
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,330
Yes, it is.

438
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:36,480
You were taken aback when I suddenly asked you to eat tteokbokki, weren't you?

439
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,950
No, I also like tteokbokki.

440
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,230
Really?

441
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,790
I like instant tteokbokki the most, actually.

442
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,680
I see.

443
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:53,710
I couldn't have any since coming back to Korea, actually.

444
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,160
 Welcome. 

445
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,880
 Have you been well? 

446
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,800
 What's the occasion? 

447
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,240
 Instant tteokbokki. 

448
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,040
Song Ah.

449
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:22,100
I'm really glad that a good person like you is by Joon Young's side.

450
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,270
I sincerely think so.

451
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:33,050
Well... somehow it turned out this way.

452
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,890
When I came to Korea after graduating, I had many dreams.

453
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,050
What were they?

454
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,510
To earn a living while playing the cello I like,

455
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:53,450
and start a family with the person I love.

456
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:56,630
But it turned out to be quite a difficult thing to achieve.

457
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:05,730
Until now, both for the cello and in love, I was getting back from it as much as the amount of effort I put in.

458
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:11,030
But now it feels too unfamiliar. Everything does.

459
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:48,220
 Until now, there were only two times when I summoned the courage to do something.  

460
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:52,500
  - Song Ah, you're not finding a job, but majoring in something else? 
 - Yeah.  

461
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,480
 Fighting for me too? 

462
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,390
 You've gone mad, right. 

463
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:57,860
 I'm not mad. 

464
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:01,460
 You're applying to the College of Music instead of getting a job? 

465
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:09,900
 Song Ah. Do you have a talent for the violin? 

466
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,680
 For the violin...  

467
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,500
 I like you, Joon Young. 

468
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,460
 ... and for love.  

469
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,690
 Since I love it so much... 

470
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:49,190
 Am I... not a member? 

471
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:53,300
 Of course not. I only gathered the talented ones here. 

472
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,000
 Then even though I get hurt  

473
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,670
 Song Ah. Our secretary. 

474
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:00,150
 and hurt over and over,  

475
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:07,650
 I thought I could continue to love.  

476
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:14,630
 Perhaps, that might have been  

477
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,800
 my... 

478
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,130
 own vanity.  

479
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,810
Ah, Unni?

480
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:54,080
What is it?

481
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:58,870
I heard you sent Jung Kyung away.

482
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:03,670
But I saw she hasn't withdrawn her application to the Professor position, yet.

483
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,090
Do you think she's in the state of mind to think about that, now?

484
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,770
Right...

485
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:15,080
But...

486
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:25,830
I do kind of think it would be nice if Jung Kyung became a Professor... now.

487
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,890
What?

488
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:34,240
I'm thinking of backing her up. Nothing says I can't, after all.

489
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,230
What is it about?

490
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:54,190
I'm sure you didn't call me just to see me.

491
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:57,820
Uhm, perhaps...

492
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:04,900
Would it be possible to schedule a performance or an event?

493
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,100
Of course. Yes, of course.

494
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,990
I'll look into it.

495
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,050
- Thank you. 
 - No, well.

496
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:22,490
Then about the payment, will something around what was expected from the event at Kyunghoo Cards work?

497
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:29,500
Would maybe a little more be possible?

498
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,660
   

499
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:52,930
Yes?

500
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,330
Song Ah. What do you need?

501
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,310
Hello, Professor.

502
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,150
I came to tell you something.

503
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:13,160
Yes, go ahead. By the way,

504
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:18,100
it's better if I wear it on the side without the pocket, right?

505
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,000
How is it?

506
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,330
Here. Is it nice?

507
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:29,390
Ah right! Are you scheduling with Joon Young your lessons together?

508
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:35,410
Since you're dating him, you should adapt to his mood.

509
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:38,490
Musicians are always sensitive and fussy.

510
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:42,920
They aren't ordinary people, so you can't date them like you would anyone else.

511
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,960
Right?

512
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,540
Anyway, talk to him and bring him over here.

513
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:52,420
I'm thinking of asking him to be a collaborator in our chamber orchestra's new year performance.

514
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,420
Okay? Ah!

515
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,900
What is it? What did you want to say?

516
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,090
- Professor. 
 - Yes?

517
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:13,870
I will... quit my work for the chamber orchestra.

518
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:24,610
What?

519
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:32,390
Wait, I didn't hear that wrong, did I?

520
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:35,980
You will quit working for the chamber orchestra?

521
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,730
Yes.

522
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,550
Wait, it's not like I asked you to play the violin.

523
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:51,570
Your job as a secretary is only to do some stuff on the computer or over the phone. Was that too difficult,

524
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,820
that you're saying you won't do it?

525
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,720
Or is it because I talked about Joon Young?

526
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,700
No, it's not.

527
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:09,450
You're making a very wrong decision right now.

528
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:12,540
Think it over again, and let's talk later.

529
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,900
No, Professor.

530
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:19,600
I thought a lot about it.

531
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:24,490
I will quit my work for the chamber orchestra.

532
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:39,800
Looks like you don't want to attend school.

533
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:11,420
 Did something happen today? 

534
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:15,590
 I don't know why I think of you during difficult days. 

535
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:18,870
 You should also call me during hard days too. 

536
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:24,470
 For me... I think I'll call you when I'm feeling good. 

537
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:27,690
 That's even better. Don't forget! 

538
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,260
 Okay. 

539
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,310
 Joon Young,  

540
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:51,350
 I want to see you today. 

541
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,810
 Do you have time? 

542
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:59,450
 I have something to do outside. 

543
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,060
 I'll wait for you at the cafe in front of the school this evening. 

544
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:15,270
With this much, it would be a hundred million won and five hundred thousand won  (≈ $80,000 and $400) .

545
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:21,360
Why? Is it over your budget?

546
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:30,640
   

547
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,330
 Song Ah, could we meet briefly? 

548
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:11,710
 Joon Young. It looks like my lecture will finish a bit late today.  

549
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,500
 It's alright, I'll wait. 

550
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,220
   

551
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:48,420
   

552
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:59,210
 Joon Young, I know you don't want to be in touch with me, but I thought I had to tell you this.  

553
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:03,090
 Listen to this. It sounds like you playing. 

554
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:12,890
 So why is it presented as Professor Yoo Tae Jin's? 

555
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,470
   

556
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,570
♫   My feelings towards you  ♫

557
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:30,960
♫   Have always been the same, I've always stood behind you   ♫

558
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,620
♫  Like this   ♫

559
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:38,700
♫   I pray again today   ♫

560
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:43,470
 Song Ah, something suddenly came up and I had to go home. 

561
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:46,270
 I'm sorry. 

562
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:54,450
♫   Because you're my everything   ♫

563
00:57:55,310 --> 00:58:00,130
♫   I confess now   ♫

564
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:09,620
♫   A melody for you   ♫ 
♫   A melody directed towards you   ♫

565
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:15,930
♫   My beautiful, unwavering feelings   ♫

566
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:24,090
  No matter who asks, my answer is you   ♫

567
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:28,390
♫   I love you with my whole heart   ♫

568
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:33,660
♫   I'll give you my heart   ♫

569
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:52,050
   

570
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:12,220
Jung Kyung,

571
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:19,830
you're going to cause misunderstandings if you visit at this hour.

572
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,670
Even if you're friends.

573
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:34,130
I'd like it... if you don't come here anymore.

574
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:42,290


575
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:51,090
♫  I can't stop remembering all the moments of when we first met  ♫

576
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:53,850
   

577
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:59,270
♫  The memories come pouring out  ♫

578
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:03,650
♫  Like the stars in the night skies  ♫

579
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:09,300
♫  The quiet hours I now have  ♫

580
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:14,360
♫  Are spent staying up and longing for you  ♫

581
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:19,430
♫  The rain makes me feel particularly lonely  ♫

582
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:26,280
♫  Since you're no longer here, where we used to stay together   ♫

583
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:35,690
♫  I can't stop remembering all the moments of when we first met  ♫

584
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:39,070
 If we say a teacher stole his pupil's performance, how sexy is that? 

585
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:41,060
 I wish they would just take down this piece as soon as possible. 

586
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,950
 Because I think Song Ah will feel concerned about it. 

587
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:45,420
 Do you know why you hid this incident from Song Ah? 

588
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:48,210
 It's because I like Song Ah. Not because I can't get over you. 

589
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:50,500
 Do you know what it means that he played it again? 

590
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,970
 No matter what others say, you just have to make a decision that will make you happy. 

591
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:56,390
 Because I wanted to see you and feel at ease. 

592
01:00:56,390 --> 01:01:00,110
 I'm going through a hard time. I wanted to lean on you, Joon Young. 

593
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:02,650
 It's all my fault, so lean on me. 

594
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:04,770
 Lean on me. 

595
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:08,800
 I wouldn't be able to fully portray its depth  ♫
