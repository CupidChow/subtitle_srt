1
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:50,110


2
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,410
 It's almost time. Shall we begin? 

3
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,960
Yes.

4
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,360
We will now begin the master class for Lee Jung Kyung,

5
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,230
a graduate and candidate professor of Seoryeong University School of Music.

6
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,710
   

7
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,210
Isn't the fingering on this part difficult?

8
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,430
Yes.

9
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:47,880
I think for the vibrato, rather than your 4th finger, with your 3rd finger will be easier.

10
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,460
Then shall we try it after switching?

11
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,450
   

12
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,300
 Next up is 4th year Kim Hae Na 

13
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,990
Oh, Hae Na had something come up so another student will take her place.

14
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,700
 Here she is. 

15
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,360
I see it's Franck's Sonata.

16
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes.

17
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,030
If you're ready, let's begin.

18
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,320
 Let me check. 

19
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,950
Franck's Sonata is quite a difficult song. You did really well.

20
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,310
The sound was good, and you were on pitch.

21
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,020
It looks like you practiced hard for this.

22
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:33,520
But... I sense some hesitation in your music.

23
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,190
This song does conjure up romantic thoughts of walking through a dream.

24
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,800
But for the musician, they can't drift aimlessly within that song.

25
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,030
It's not anyone else's song but mine.

26
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,150
Not that I am being dragged along by the music, but rather with the idea that I am leading the music.

27
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,570
Play each note confidently with this in mind.

28
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,060
Then... shall we try again from the start?

29
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,720
Yes.

30
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,920
Let's try this part like this and like this, okay?

31
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,880
Yes.

32
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,150
 Teacher! Our time is up. 

33
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,040
We've exceeded our time, so I think we'll have to end here. I'm sorry.

34
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,700
Not at all. Thank you very much.

35
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,220
Just a moment.

36
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,880
 We'll have a ten-minute break. 

37
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,400
Thank you very much.

38
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,520
Uh...

39
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,020
Yes?

40
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,350
How do I... gain confidence?

41
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,860
That's a tough question.

42
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,290
Even though I said that... truthfully, I still don't know yet.

43
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,020
If you find the answer, could you share it with me too?

44
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,390
Yes. I'll make sure.

45
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,100
Did you do well?

46
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,530
I learned a lot.

47
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,670
I waited for you.

48
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,520
It concerns me too...

49
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,920
Every word you say... every choice you make.

50
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,700
♫   Think about you, your everything   ♫

51
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:33,040
I won't... make you wait too long.

52
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,320
So could you wait for just a little... just a little while longer?

53
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,950
♫   My lips call for you again   ♫

54
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,910
♫   I thought you'd know even if I tried to hide my feelings   ♫

55
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,850
♫   I thought if you saw my eyes, you'd feel my gaze   ♫

56
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes.

57
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,940
I'll do that.

58
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,130
♫   Tomorrow, I'll confess   ♫

59
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:17,080
    
    

60
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:23,310
I understand. I'm saddened by this, but given your resolve, I won't stop you.

61
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,250
Thank you for today as well.

62
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,030
I've also learned much too.

63
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,980
Can I ask you about your future plans after you resign?

64
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,560
It looks like I will open a Korean division in Park Joon Young's agency.

65
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,070
I am in the middle of positive negotiations with Joon Young's manager, Chris.

66
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,970
If I make it through, you'll be the first person I'll contact.

67
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,850
I can expect your support, right? Team Leader?

68
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,870
The person who brought up the talk concert at Korea Arts Middle School with Chris...

69
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,400
was you, Section Chief Park?

70
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,880
All this time, Kyunghoo had been dealing business too meekly...

71
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,580
with a superb talent like Park Joon Young.

72
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,160
- Section Chief... 
 - Joon Young is on a downward trajectory.

73
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,060
I'm simply telling you, you're also responsible.

74
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:36,610
Deputy Yoo Jin, when your maternity leave ends next month, you'll come back to us, right?

75
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,100
This is delicious.

76
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,800
When you think about it, Soo Kyung looks like she has manners but doesn't really.

77
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,350
The kid that did Franck's Sonata earlier...

78
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,160
I don't understand why Soo Kyung would put a kid like that on the stage.

79
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,800
Oh my... Just look at your expression.

80
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,770
Are you already concerned?

81
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,780
Don't you worry! When you're a professor, you won't have kids like that.

82
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,900
Is our school the kind where any person can enter?

83
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,020
I also learned a lot today.

84
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,400
Oh, my word!

85
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,240
Oh, honey, you're going to be such a great teacher!

86
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,160
 Let's do this part like this and like this, okay? 

87
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,770
Okay.

88
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,370
   

89
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,090
Oh, you're done? Again from the beginning.

90
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,740
Hey, Chris. I'm doing fine. How are you?

91
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,360
Wait.

92
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:35,240
So, are you saying that we're no longer working with Kyunghoo Foundation?

93
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,720
And Simon from Kyunghoo is going to be head of the Korean branch?

94
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,800
It just doesn't feel right.

95
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,260
Chris, I have to go. Talk to you later.

96
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,040
Okay, bye.

97
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,160
Yes?

98
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,900
Noona.

99
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,280
I really didn't know.

100
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:18,600
First, I'll try talking with Chris again.

101
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,410
Yes, thank you.

102
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,780
 Yes? 

103
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,170
 - You're here? 
- Oh, Joon Young.

104
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,500
Hello.

105
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,950
What are you doing at the door?

106
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,380
This is reporter Lee Doo Ri. You know her, right?

107
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,830
- "Help"? 
- Yes.

108
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:04,060
I want to know what the professor taught you that was the biggest help in making you the "competition killer".

109
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:12,640
Professor Yoo knows the subject of piano competitions better than anyone else.

110
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,220
As expected...

111
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,170
You've certainly earned your nickname the "animal tamer".

112
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:26,820
Among Seoryeong University professors, you're uniquely not an alumnus.

113
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,590
You must have run into many difficulties because of it,

114
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:35,060
but through Joon Young, many of your apprentices have shown amazing work in competitions as a result.

115
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,400
It's not like the professor's name is credited in music, so why does it matter?

116
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,290
Now, wouldn't they be accredited?

117
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,620
It's written in length with every profile.

118
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,370
Which school and under which professor they studied.

119
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,590
This is the common thread of music schools.

120
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,480
But... after asking, I realized it was a dumb question.

121
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,860
With Joon Young, we can clearly call this the beginning of Yoo Tae Jin's line, yes?

122
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,520
Oh, don't be silly. There's no "line".

123
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,520
But following the Chopin Competition,

124
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,070
I heard that the relationship between you two soured.

125
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,640
Oh you people, really...

126
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,290
People are spreading so many rumors just because they're jealous of Joon Young's success.

127
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:24,160
Right? I mean, this is a community filled with envy.

128
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,550
People speak so childishly of your relationship to Joon Young.

129
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,260
That you lucked into him.

130
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,180
Ugh, really...

131
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,020
Now... shall we slowly wrap things up?

132
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,570
Shall we?

133
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,850
Oh my, how the time flies.

134
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,590
Then, let me ask one more question.

135
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,060
The Tchaikovsky competition will be held in a few months, right?

136
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,490
Who do you think will win?

137
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,910
 Seung Ji Min won Chopin's 

138
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,840
 Which is why the rest of the decent competitors 

139
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,750
are all preparing for next year's Tchaikovsky's.

140
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,030
Because Tchaikovsky's never had a Korean winner.

141
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,260
Getting the first title is important, right?

142
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:15,000
So. Who is the person Park Joon Young expects to clinch the title?

143
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:25,690
Won't the person who's able to score highest amongst all judges win?

144
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:31,360
 That's true. Another dumb question. Sorry! 

145
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,530
 Let's finish here. 

146
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,920
Professor, thank you for setting aside time for me today.

147
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,370
Oh, nothing at all. I should thank you.

148
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,880
Joon Young, let's meet again.

149
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:51,340
Your... interviewing skills have grown a lot.

150
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,890
But why didn't you tell her you were participating in the Tchaikovsky competition?

151
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,080
What...

152
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,880
are you afraid that you couldn't break even?

153
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,960
What are you doing?

154
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,780
What are you looking at so intently?

155
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,760
Oh, just the... class announcements.

156
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,390
You look a little tired today.

157
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,810
No, I'm fine.

158
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,780
Are you done with your classes?

159
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,150
I just finished my lessons.

160
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,230
Oh, you must have been hard at work.

161
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,120
What about lunch?

162
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,920
If you haven't had it yet, let's have it together.

163
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,210
What to do? I have another appointment outside so I need to go now.

164
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,010
Ah. Are you seeing someone?

165
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,600
Just... someone I know.

166
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,600
I see.

167
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,070
Then... I'll get going.

168
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,900
Enjoy your lunch.

169
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,430
I will. You too.

170
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,120
Yes.

171
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,510
   

172
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,940
   

173
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,900
So the agency intends to tightly regulate

174
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,230
the domestic career that you raised in Korea.

175
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,830
So I need your cooperation in another matter

176
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,520
What is that?

177
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,110
Lee Jung Kyung and Han Hyeon Ho.

178
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,080
Let's stop performing as a piano trio with these two.

179
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,770
I beg your pardon?

180
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,440
Just play with these two as a hobby.

181
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,690
This is a team set up that holds no benefit for you.

182
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,350
Why's that?

183
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:58,640
If I'm frank, they don't match your level.

184
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,960
That's offensive to hear.

185
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,230
Oh, really? But you realize this is a fact, right?

186
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,940
Right?

187
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,030
It's not just between you and them,

188
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,960
there's a large gap between Jung Kyung and Hyeon Ho too.

189
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,740
- Please be more tactful with your wording. 
 - Which is why Park Joon Young...

190
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:29,210
Even if you play in a chamber orchestra, play it with people who match your level.

191
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,370
Those people I'll find for you.

192
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,090
Your career...

193
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,000
You need to course-correct before it falls any further.

194
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,710
Don't you think?

195
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,390
   

196
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,210
 - Chae Song Ah.  
- Yes.

197
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,300
You can't be so shaky just because you're playing along with a piano.

198
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,830
You have to maintain your own tempo as you play with the piano.

199
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,640
Ah, forgive me.

200
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,140
I had high expectations because you were a Seoryeong University student, but what's this?

201
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,690
I'm sorry.

202
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,260
Let's go together tomorrow morning. I'll call you.

203
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,070
Thank you very much.

204
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,890
I came here to buy some sheet music.

205
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,640
Me too.

206
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,020
I'll stop by next time.

207
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,450
It's a small world.

208
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,120
We're going to keep running into each other. Are you going to avoid me every time?

209
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,510
Just come in and buy your sheet music.

210
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,710
Do you by chance have any violin concerto songs?

211
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,430
 Yes. 

212
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,200
Just a moment.

213
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,600
Here it is.

214
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,160
Thank you.

215
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,800
Could you ring me up?

216
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,950
Thank you.

217
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,620
 I kept thinking to myself "What did I do wrong?" 

218
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,380
 What did I miss that you left me? 

219
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,780
 No matter what I think I... 

220
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,760
 I haven't done a thing for 10 years besides chasing you. 

221
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,170
 Was that wrong? 

222
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:36,550
♫   I guess you can't express everything with love    ♫
    

223
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:41,290
♫   Those words of yours make me sad   ♫

224
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,670
 - Give me what she has. 
 - Of course. 

225
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:48,710
♫   You're leaving like this, but   ♫

226
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,940
♫   if you can be happy, that's enough for me  ♫

227
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,490
 Take care! 

228
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,900
  - See you tomorrow. 
 - See you. 

229
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,300
♫   While watching your shrinking figure,  ♫

230
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:12,200
♫   I can't bring myself to ask you to wait for me   ♫

231
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,690
♫   These tears that have gotten cold   ♫

232
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,350
♫   cannot be considered part of our farewell.    ♫

233
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:26,550
♫   Come back to me a bit less late.   ♫

234
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:31,150
♫   Even these tears that are falling  ♫

235
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:35,200
♫   will become   ♫

236
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:43,680
♫   part of my last farewell to you, take care.    ♫

237
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,810
♫   I can't get used to farewells    ♫

238
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,710
 Have I hidden anything from you?! 
♫   I can't get used to farewells    ♫

239
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,940
 I told you. I'm losing my resolve! 

240
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,010
 I'm telling you to hold me. 

241
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,900
 But you didn't do anything. 

242
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,960
 I'm losing my resolve... 

243
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,730
 Would you hold me? 

244
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,860
♫   Come back to me a bit less late.   ♫

245
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:28,410
♫   Even these tears that are falling  ♫

246
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,560
♫   will become   ♫

247
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:40,520
♫   part of my last farewell to you, take care.    ♫

248
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,560
 Jung Kyung... 

249
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,760
 I think we've been apart for too long... 

250
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,660
 Is it really because of that? 

251
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,500
 If we were always together... 

252
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,590
 would I still not have had these cruel thoughts? 

253
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,900
 I'm sorry for leaving you alone for so long. 

254
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,490
 It's okay. 

255
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,140
 It'll all be okay. 

256
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,060
    

257
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,830
   

258
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:06,440
   

259
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,180
Dong Yoon canceled his blind date?

260
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,970
Yeah.

261
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,990
Do you think... it's because of me?

262
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,270
Because he's thinking of me?

263
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:26,340
 I'm sorry. But lately, I've been really busy. 

264
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,500
 Then, let's just have tea. 

265
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,930
Is something wrong?

266
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,270
 I'll tell you when I see you. 

267
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:46,210
Never mind. Let's stop talking about Yoon Dong Yoon.

268
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,600
How are things going with you?

269
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,980
What do you mean?

270
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,310
Park Joon Young!

271
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,900
I don't know. I'm busy lately too.

272
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,530
Because of the upcoming exams, I have to also get used to a new accompaniment.

273
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,250
Accompaniment?

274
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,750
Yeah, the professor introduced me to a new pianist to play with.

275
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:14,010
- Why don't you... ask Park Joon Young to be your accompaniment?
 - Hmm?

276
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,830
I mean, you're exploring your feelings with Joon Young, why are you looking for a pianist elsewhere?

277
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,710
What?!

278
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:24,660
No! No... that's a little too... um...

279
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,050
A little too what?

280
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:32,240
Well, that is... how would say, it's a little too...

281
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,440
There's too much of a difference.

282
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,200
For someone at his level to play an accompaniment for someone like me is just...

283
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,440
But also Joon Young is on his sabbatical.

284
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,130
- Chae Song Ah...
- Yeah?

285
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:51,940
If he had feelings for you, do you think he'd bring up things like level differences or sabbaticals?

286
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:57,160
If a woman he liked asked him for it, he'd even play "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star".

287
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,270
With an accompaniment like that, I'd even dance for it.

288
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,550
What are you doing?

289
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,080
Huh?

290
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,500
Oh, how have you been?

291
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,090
 Yes. 

292
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,940
 Ah yes, yes. 

293
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,410
Oh, but unfortunately, I don't think I can make my schedule work for that day.

294
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,480
Yes, I'm sorry.

295
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,540
Yes, that's fine. Let's try to meet next time.

296
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,940
Yes, thank you. Have a nice day.

297
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,860
Just because I played an accompaniment for a student once. They think I'm some children's pianist.

298
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,230
 Unbelievable. 

299
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,490
You too. Just because a girl you're seeing or any such person

300
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,550
asks you for an accompaniment, don't even think about it.

301
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,990
When you play with lower-class players, you will lose your skill with them.

302
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,570
It doesn't matter to me.

303
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,710
It may not matter to you, but it probably matters to her.

304
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,690
She could practice all her life, but will never amount to more than your accompaniment.

305
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,840
What, you didn't think that far?

306
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,190
Even with romance, think about your class.

307
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,840
Ruin comes in a moment.

308
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,880
Now let's try again with up-tempo.

309
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,000
Did you enjoy your lessons?

310
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,440
Ah, yes... well...

311
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,760
What did you do today?

312
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:35,140
I tried matching with an accompaniment for my grad school entrance exams.

313
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,320
How was it?

314
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,330
She was a little scary.

315
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,490
 If he has feelings for you, do you think he'll bring up level differences or sabbaticals? 

316
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,960
The accompaniment is always important, but since this is the entrance exams...

317
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,650
The professor recommended I find an outstanding pianist.

318
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,660
I don't know if I can do well with this piano teacher...

319
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,870
I'm... not entirely confident.

320
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:31,470
 Even if she practiced her whole life she'll never amount to more than your accompaniment. 

321
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:37,090
It's probably because it's your first time matching with her.

322
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,730
Don't worry too much about it.

323
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,500
Are you going home?

324
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,030
Yes. What about you?

325
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,050
I'm  going to practice at school.

326
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,740
There's a performance at Kyunghoo today.

327
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:08,780
Then safe travels.

328
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,530
Yes.

329
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,260
When do you have classes tomorrow?

330
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,720
I'm sorry?

331
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,120
Do you have time tomorrow at lunch?

332
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,690
I'm not sure about lunch tomorrow.

333
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,880
Oh, really?

334
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,080
Then call me tomorrow when you know.

335
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:41,000
Yes. I'll do that.

336
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,810
♫   I'm reminded again of you who drifted away   ♫

337
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:53,050
♫   though I loved you   ♫

338
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:01,010
♫   The radiant memories of our past days  ♫

339
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:08,300
♫   come visit me again   ♫

340
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:16,130
♫   In the end, I wasn't able to forget anything about you   ♫

341
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:21,460
♫   I must have loved you too much   ♫

342
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:29,360
♫   Because I miss you, I cry out your name   ♫

343
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,100
Why is this so hard?

344
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,900
♫   Without you, I'm nothing   ♫

345
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,200
Yes, hello?

346
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,340
Yes, how have you been?

347
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,970
You've been doing well?

348
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,380
I had completely forgotten. I'm sorry.

349
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,840
In order to process your judge fees, I need your ID and the last four numbers of your account.

350
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,430
Yes, I'll send it right away.

351
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,370
I'm sorry.

352
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,330
Me? I'm doing well.

353
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,470
It's still busy over there, right?

354
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,310
Chairman Na?

355
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:45,850
She suddenly fainted so we were similarly surprised.

356
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,210
Thankfully I'm told she's gotten a lot better.

357
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,880
I heard they're discharging her either today or tomorrow...

358
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,970
Yes, yes.

359
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:59,330
Then, email me your ID and the last 4 of your account.

360
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,520
Yes, thank you!

361
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,120
Deputy!

362
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,610
Ah, Deputy, how have you been!

363
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,610
I missed you so much I thought I'd die.

364
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,810
   

365
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,210
   

366
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,700
  - What the? 
 - Incredible!  

367
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,640
 Really? Song Ah Noona and Park Joon Young Hyung are dating? 

368
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,150
- Unni. 
- Hmm?

369
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,300
Are you going out with Park Joon  Young?

370
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,080
What?

371
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,240
There are rumors that you two are dating.

372
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,210
I wondered... that last time when we ate, he was so...

373
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,400
No.

374
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,620
It's not true?

375
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,880
It isn't.

376
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,360
See? Would a world-class musician meet with an ordinary music student?

377
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,410
 Did she have to word it like that? 

378
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,100
What is it?

379
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,080
What are you looking at so intently?

380
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,050
Ah, it's just the class announcements.

381
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,560
   

382
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,600
Song Ah!

383
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,680
Joon Young.

384
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,700
I thought I wouldn't be able to see you because you were busy.

385
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,410
Are you now all through with classes?

386
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,620
Yes.

387
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,270
Then... do you want to have dinner with me?

388
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:03,880
A world-class artist playing with the last seat in the school orchestra...

389
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:11,800
would their levels never match in any circumstance?

390
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:23,240
For some weird reason, there are a lot of people bringing up levels lately.

391
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,990
I don't think about things like that.

392
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,580
Then why did you tear it off?

393
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,720
The orchestra seating list?

394
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,280
I didn't want you to fret over it.

395
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:48,400
It's really... really a meaningless thing.

396
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,780
It looked like you would grow too attached and be hurt by it. And I didn't want that.

397
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,860
The orchestra seats...

398
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,850
are not meaningless.

399
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,840
It's way too meaningful to me.

400
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,080
That's why I'm attached to it.

401
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:26,320
If I was just one seat over. Just one row higher.

402
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:31,310
I spent the last four years like that.

403
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,630
You can't understand, can you?

404
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,610
You will probably never understand.

405
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,210
Which is why I—

406
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:59,440
Perhaps I... might never get a chance...

407
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:05,450
to stand by your side.

408
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:13,200
I'm losing confidence.

409
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:24,170
Then... why did you say you'd wait for me?

410
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:31,620
Is that why you've pushed me away lately?

411
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:41,060
Then why did you say things like "I like you" and "I'll wait for you?"

412
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:48,880
When I ask to eat with you, if you respond with, "Aren't our levels too different?,"

413
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,470
with answers like that...

414
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,990
I can't come to you.

415
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:02,530
I'm so sick and tired of hearing things like this.

416
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:07,900
I don't want to hear that from you.

417
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,720
I'm really sorry, but...

418
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,050
I'll leave first.

419
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:57,870
   

420
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:25,060
   

421
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,160
Hello?

422
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,010
 Song Ah, where are you?  

423
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,060
 You're on your way, right? 

424
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:37,220
Huh? Where...

425
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,080
 Is Friday okay? 

426
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,510
 Around 7:30? 

427
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,950
Ah, Dong Yoon. I'm really sorry, but...

428
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:25,580
 Director Na has been discharged.  

429
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,350
Yes, Joon Young?

430
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:47,610
 Hello Director. I heard you have been discharged. 

431
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,540
So you heard from Team Leader Cha.

432
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,380
Yes.

433
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,820
How are you feeling?

434
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,320
I'm alright.

435
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,480
That's a relief.

436
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:06,260
It's truly a relief.

437
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,790
Then please get some rest.

438
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:22,060
Okay. Thank you for calling.

439
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,180
What is it?

440
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,480
That is...

441
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,330
Listen, Dong Yoon.

442
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,880
Many things have been happening to me today,

443
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,740
so I'm sorry, but could we talk next time?

444
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:29,220
- Song Ah.  
 - Yeah.

445
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,260
I like you.

446
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,850
What?

447
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:45,310
I... like you.

448
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:58,260
When I first saw you in the club room, and then became friends with you...

449
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:02,160
I thought you were just a friend with whom I got along great.

450
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:09,440
But... at some point,

451
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,670
I started to think of you all the time.

452
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:23,050
This sounds cliche, but if I hastily confessed my feelings,

453
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,880
we might not have been able to be friends anymore.

454
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,800
I think that's what made me scared.

455
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,970
Can you say some—

456
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:57,490
What's wrong, Song Ah?

457
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,910
Joon Young still looks the same, doesn't he?

458
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:39,570
Oh, give that to me.

459
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:43,180
I wanted to come near you and treat you to something tasty.

460
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:47,240
No, it's fine. I wanted to come here, it's been so long.

461
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,450
Thanks to that, I'm also here after a while.

462
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:55,350
When the Director isn't here, we meet the important guests in this room.

463
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,560
- Song Ah.  
 - Yes.

464
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:07,250
For this semester, do you think you could help us while you attend university?

465
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,600
Joon Young.

466
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:40,420
What are you doing here?

467
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:46,970
It's because you haven't come to practice yet.

468
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,200
Let's talk for a bit.

469
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,810
What else do you want to say?

470
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,090
Please be my accompanist.

471
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:09,080
I told you I won't do it. I don't want to.

472
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,780
It's all my fault.

473
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,680
What did you do wrong? Huh?

474
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,390
Do you even know what you did wrong? How can you come to me about this again?

475
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:24,280
I shouldn't have done that to you in New York.

476
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,520
Do you know why I did it, that day?

477
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,350
I thought I was going mad, I felt so jealous.

478
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,380
You were standing on that stage,

479
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:40,150
so why did I have to be below it?

480
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:43,020
while you were standing in the light...

481
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,790
That's why I did that.

482
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:56,860
I'm so childish, aren't I?

483
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:03,290
But I really want to become a Seoryeong University professor.

484
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,100
When people say to me...

485
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,340
Like, "She's been surpassed."

486
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:14,540
She was an unlucky prodigy.

487
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,050
I really hate hearing that from other people.

488
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:24,110
That's why I want to be at Seoryeong University. Since it's a place that everyone recognizes.

489
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,870
Joon Young, I...

490
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:42,260
think about it every day... If I hadn't told you go to do the Chopin competition

491
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:46,300
where would we be now?

492
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:55,810
If I hadn't... wouldn't I be in a similar place to you, right now?

493
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:00,770
If that was true, wouldn't it have been different?

494
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:06,890
Wouldn't I be less miserable?

495
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:18,250
So please help me. I'm begging you.

496
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:34,790
   

497
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,110
Hello?

498
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:44,800
 Song Ah, have you been doing well? 

499
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:49,790
Yes.

500
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:51,840
 Are you at home? 

501
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,760
No. I'm at the Kyunghoo building.

502
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,100
 At Kyunghoo? Why are you there? 

503
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:03,070
I came by to have lunch with Team Leader Cha

504
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:06,380
and well... now I'm outside.

505
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:10,400
 Then, Song Ah, please wait there for just one second. 

506
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,990
Excuse me?

507
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:15,790
Why?

508
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:16,950
 There's something I want to tell you. 

509
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:20,010
 Just wait there for one second. Just one second. 

510
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:35,590
I told him I would wait and...

511
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:40,660
I got all frustrated by myself and I think I spoiled everything.

512
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:48,460
I didn't know that I lacked so much endurance...

513
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,650
You're not.

514
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:54,720
People who play instruments practice for hours daily for years

515
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,500
so diligently every single day.

516
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,430
I believe in the strength of that time.

517
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:05,800
So Song Ah, you're someone who knows how to endure.

518
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,990
Believe in yourself.

519
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:18,400
And Joon Young... just wait for him for a little bit.

520
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:25,170
Joon Young always puts himself last.

521
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:28,120
So he doesn't say much about how he feels.

522
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:33,720
So there are times when it's frustrating but once he gives you his heart,

523
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,280
he isn't someone who will take it back first.

524
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:42,730
Trust me in that.

525
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:04,030
♫  Think about you, your everything  ♫

526
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:10,140
♫   I wanna stay, always by your side   ♫

527
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:15,870
♫   I watch a transparent you   ♫

528
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:21,980
♫   My lips call for you again   ♫

529
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:25,040
♫   I thought you'd know   ♫

530
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,050
- Song Ah, you're still here. 
♫   even if I tried to hide my feelings  ♫

531
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:31,810
♫   I thought if you saw my eyes  ♫

532
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:34,010
What's going on? 
♫  you'd feel my gaze   ♫

533
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:36,710
♫   Though I always linger a few paces behind you   ♫

534
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:41,560
I have something to tell you. 
♫  like a fool  ♫

535
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,520
I...

536
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:48,810
think I'm going to have to be Jung Kyung's accompanist.

537
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,310
Jung Kyung really wants to become a Seoryeong University professor.

538
00:55:55,310 --> 00:56:01,260
She wants it so desperately so the accompanist is important.

539
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:06,880
A lot has happened between me and Jung Kyung

540
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,300
but this time, I want to help her as a friend.

541
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:14,860
I hope you can understand.

542
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,300
I didn't even imagine that it would be...

543
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,970
this is kind of news.

544
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,410
I wondered what you'd have to tell me

545
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:48,060
by myself, wondering about this and waiting...

546
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:54,260
But you asked me to wait

547
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:59,990
so that you could tell me that you're going to be Jung Kyung's accompanist?

548
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,980
- I thought you might misunderstand so I wanted to tell you myself-- 
 - Misunderstand?

549
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,830
What kind of misunderstanding?

550
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:16,250
This kind of misunderstanding.

551
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:23,970
I'm trying to approach you, but you keep trying to push me away

552
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:27,960
so I came to explain everything from the beginning to end.

553
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:33,620
Okay. I understand.

554
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,480
So I've listened to it.

555
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:41,240
So that's it, right?

556
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:48,110
I like you.

557
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:03,360


558
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:08,840
I said I like you.

559
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,700
I like you.

560
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,840
I like you.

561
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:26,790
♫  Your fair face...  ♫

562
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:28,900
That's what I came to tell you.

563
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,410
♫  your pure eyes...  ♫

564
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:39,120
♫  make my heart beat again  ♫

565
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:46,850
♫  Your warm hands, your voice calling for me  ♫

566
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:58,810
♫  Please remember this one thing  ♫

567
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:04,460
♫  the way I sincerely look at you  ♫

568
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:10,950
♫  My beautiful love  ♫

569
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:17,380
♫  My one love that makes my heart flutter  ♫

570
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:20,790
♫  That kind of love for me  ♫

571
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:25,000
♫  When the rain falls again  ♫

572
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,730
♫  the one who'll fair it with me  ♫

573
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:32,500
♫  That one of a kind love  ♫

574
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,810
♫  is you  ♫

575
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:39,330
♫  At times when you're sad  ♫

576
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:43,870
♫  I wish the person who'd stay by your side  ♫

577
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:49,050
♫  could be me  ♫

578
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:58,170
♫  Can you hear my heart? Can you see my heart?  ♫

579
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:04,850
♫  If you feel the same, please stay by my side.  ♫

580
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:09,210
♫  Do you still not know?  ♫

581
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,810
♫  It's only you  ♫

582
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:20,980
♫  Even if the seasons change, I will never change  ♫

583
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,300
♫  My beautiful love  ♫

584
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,800
   

585
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,970
 I was going to play Brahms but since you don't play Brahms, I changed it. 

586
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:30,870
 I don't care. I'm dating Song Ah. 

587
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:34,060
 Since you're always together, there are all these fake rumors that you're dating. 

588
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,530
 It's not a fake rumor. 

589
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:36,910
 It just happened, with Song Ah 

590
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:39,040
 I'd like it if you were different to Song Ah. 

591
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,070
 When you're struggling, you never say anything. 

592
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:43,570
 Don't think about anything else and play the piano. 

593
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:48,210
 - The way I tell you to. 
- I don't like it when the people I love get hurt and struggle because of me. 

594
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:53,660
 I'd like it if you always thought I was doing well. 

595
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:58,190
♫  I wish the person who'd stay by your side  ♫

596
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:02,430
♫  could be me.  ♫
