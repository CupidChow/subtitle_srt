1
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,330
   

2
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,180
 - I’m going to major in violin. 
 - I’m going to quit playing violin. 

3
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,360


4
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,010
  I’m going to quit… the violin.  

5
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,380
  I’m going to major… in violin.  

6
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,960
  What kind of situation is this?  

7
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,580
  So you’re saying as soon as you’re discharged, you’re giving up the violin  

8
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,290
  - to become an instrument maker? 
 - Yeah.  

9
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,390
  Okay. Fighting for now.  

10
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,250
  - And Song Ah, you're not finding a job, but majoring in something else? 
 - Yeah.  

11
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,470
  Fighting for me too?  

12
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:26,040
  No, no fighting for you. Are you crazy? No!  

13
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,260
  Aww, why not? Wish me good luck too!  

14
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,420
  I want to go to music school and major in violin.  

15
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,110
  I’m telling you no. Just ask anyone about this!  

16
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,620
  “Excuse me, I graduated from Seoryeong School of Business,  

17
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,560
  but I’m thinking about majoring in violin.” Who would cheer you on for that?  

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,960
  What kind of dumb idiot would support that?  

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
  I don’t know about this.  

20
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,960
  Shall we go now?  

21
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,210
  I support it.  

22
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,370
  Like a dumb idiot?  

23
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,970
  Don’t say empty things so you won’t hurt my feelings.  

24
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,150
  It’s your choice.  

25
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,700
  Not anyone else’s, but Chae Song Ah’s.  

26
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,180
  I know whenever you make a decision, how much you fret and deliberate on it, so  

27
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,590
  I’m always on your side.  

28
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:34,140
  Whether you’re going into music school, the school life, or after graduation,  

29
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,970
  it won’t be easy but, I’ll cheer you on.  

30
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,690
  Thanks.  

31
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,890
  What about a violin teacher? Do you have one?  

32
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,250
  Oh no, not yet.  

33
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,920
  The lesson fees are too much. I haven’t even  

34
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,420
  talked about it with my mom and dad yet.  

35
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,130
  - How about me? 
 - Hmm?  

36
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,340
  How about me?  

37
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,830
  I mean, I don’t know if I’m that dependable but still.  

38
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,070
  I’ll do my best to teach you.  

39
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:21,000
  As long as you're okay with a former music school dropout.  

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,760
  I believe you!  

41
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,340
  Yes, I’ll leave myself in your hands, Teacher.  

42
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:40,970
   
   

43
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,710
Go ahead, I’ll catch up separately.

44
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,500
Why? I’ll give you a ride.

45
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,610
Nah, I’m more comfortable on the bus.

46
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,280
Just walk me to the bus stop and you can go ahead.

47
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,340
Fine then.

48
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,190
I’m leaving.

49
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,140
Have a safe trip! I’ll call you.

50
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,850
I better get on the subway.

51
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,300
I’ll call you. It was good to see you, Joon Young.

52
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,280
Yeah, see you, Dong Yoon.

53
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,990
- Let’s go. 
 - Yeah.

54
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,380
Well, then. I’ll see you all again.

55
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,980
Wow, Park Joon Young…

56
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,400
How long has it been?

57
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,330
Why did you call me all the way out here?

58
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,630
I knew you’d come.

59
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,320
You waited a long time, didn’t you? My luggage came late.

60
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,710
No, it’s fine.

61
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,830
If you were going to fix it here, why have me come all the way to the airport?

62
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,620
I guess you're right.

63
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,020
Let’s… have some food first.

64
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,890
- Sure. 
 - Should we grab a quick bite downstairs?

65
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,090
Yeah, Min Seong.

66
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,680
Huh? You're where?

67
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,810
 Congrats! 

68
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,460
Oh! Daebak!

69
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,960
Thank you very much!

70
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,020
The beer too!

71
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,450
Hey Song Ah!

72
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,590
It's Song Ah!

73
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,520
Chae Song Ah is last!

74
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,620
Why are you so hard to reach? I kept calling you.

75
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,610
Ah, sorry, sorry.

76
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,860
Boss Yoon, congrats!

77
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,430
Oh, thanks.

78
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,940
Song Ah, scold Yoon Dong Yoon for me.

79
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,830
Did you know he ghosted all of my texts and only responded after landing at Incheon Airport?

80
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,330
I’m sorry. Okay? It was chaotic.

81
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:49,650
But I knew you’d come here straight from the airport, so I gathered everyone here.

82
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,690
 As expected from the ex-girlfriend. Are you two getting back together again? 

83
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,260
 Yeah, you two are great together! 

84
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,120
- Are you trying to jinx me? 
 - Hey, hey.

85
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,360
- I live right upstairs. Where else am I supposed to go?
   - That’s true.  

86
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:04,990
 That’s true. 

87
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,820
Did you eat?

88
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,770
Not yet.

89
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,560
This is a new menu item, super good.

90
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,400
Ah! I’ve missed this! Han River and Seoul and Korea!

91
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,540
Are you happy to be back?

92
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,770
Of course, I’m happy.

93
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:27,030
I’m now done with studying, Jung Kyung came together with me. And you’re in Korea too.

94
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,950
Has it been 7 years since you were last here?

95
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,460
Outside of performances, yeah.

96
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,440
Did you sell your place in Berlin?

97
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,290
No. I’m going to go back anyway, so I put it up for rent.

98
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,200
No luggage either.

99
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,090
What about your piano?

100
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,370
Oh, that’s right, when you were in Berlin, you returned your piano to Jung Kyung.

101
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,880
Still, isn’t it weird? Someone living in your place?

102
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,000
It's not even my home, I'm renting the place.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,850
So what even is home to you?

104
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:03,860
You lived alone in Seoul since middle school, so even your parents' place won't feel like home to you.

105
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:12,330
Who knows? Back then I'd sleep in a new place almost every day.

106
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,960
You’ve really been through a lot.

107
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,280
Just take the next year off and get some rest. Really.

108
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,000
Have fun going to school, and…

109
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,760
go out on some dates!

110
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,620
For a returning student, don’t study so much, man.

111
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:38,080
 A professor at Seoryeong University? How many do they select? 

112
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,590
One for the string instrument major.

113
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,750
Just one?

114
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:48,730
So instead of violin, they could pick a viola or cello instead?

115
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,700
That’s right.

116
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,380
And none of your applications in America were accepted?

117
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,630
That’s right.

118
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,360
I like it so much better, now that you’re back in Korea.

119
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,590
You’ve studied enough, so help around with the foundation.

120
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,480
I’ll take my leave first.

121
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,740
Have a good night, Mother.

122
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,150
Go in and rest.

123
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,230
Good night.

124
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,460
When you get settled, let’s talk more about foundation work, hmm?

125
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,100
Jung Kyung is going to apply to be a professor at Seoryeong University.

126
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,020
Why? Not a professor in the States?

127
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,250
Not that she won’t do it… she failed to qualify for any in the last rounds.

128
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,970
I thought she’d get at least one.

129
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,830
Well, Seoryeong won’t be easy either…

130
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,830
At any rate, I’m just grateful I got to come back with Jung Kyung.

131
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,990
How many years has it been since we shared the same sky?

132
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,300
Isn’t it the same sky in the States?

133
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,950
You mean between New York and Indiana?

134
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,030
It’s 1,100 km away. It’s like Seoul and Tokyo.

135
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,260
I guess you’re right.

136
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,030
- Have a safe trip home! 
 - I’m going!

137
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,040
Bye!

138
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,900
- But Song Ah. 
 - Hmm?

139
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:35,280
Back when you announced you were going to music school, we all tried to dissuade you.

140
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,000
But right now, you’re the best.

141
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,100
You live doing what you want to do. I envy you.

142
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:51,890
Every morning when I clock in for work, there are things I wish I could do instead.

143
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,620
Or don’t I?

144
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:02,140
Is that something a civil servant who's guaranteed employment until retirement should be saying to a self-employed, long-term student?

145
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,760
There’s the taxi! Let’s catch it!

146
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,620
Have a safe trip!

147
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,700
Oh, wait, Song Ah, how are you getting home?

148
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,710
Don’t worry about me.

149
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,810
Let’s go. Let's go.

150
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,750
You’re so cool, Chae Song Ah! My friend is the best!

151
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,650
  - Careful! See you! 
 - Yeah!  

152
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,030
You have no idea what it’s like.

153
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,900
What’s so cool about this?

154
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,960
Shall we go in? We need to look at your instrument.

155
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,650
Sure.

156
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,730
Oh right, your performance in New York last month. Sorry I couldn’t make it.

157
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,550
The flight got delayed, of all things. Even Jung Kyung couldn’t make it either.

158
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,480
You’re not upset both of us missed it, are you?

159
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,250
Jung Kyung was sick that day, so give her a pass.

160
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,170
Come to think of it, this is the first time you saw Jung Kyung in a long while, isn’t it?

161
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,470
That day, as soon as your performance finished, I went to Jung Kyung’s place.

162
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,220
She was in a really bad condition. You know she gets migraines.

163
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,920
She was all dressed up too. I guess she didn’t go.

164
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,980
I was busy all night and went back at dawn. I had an audition in LA.

165
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,990
You went straight to the airport after the performance, right?

166
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah. If you were even an hour or two earlier, I probably would've caught you at the airport.

167
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,310
Right? It's a pity we were off by a little.

168
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,500
Yeah, we just missed each other.

169
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,110
You were really surprised, weren’t you?

170
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,840
You couldn’t have expected us to come together in your wildest imaginations.

171
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,700
Jung Kyung didn’t know either that you’d be at the airport.

172
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,000
This is what we call a double surprise!

173
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,630
Man, I feel so happy!

174
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,730
What’s wrong?

175
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,380
Are you nervous? Because I’m here?

176
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,640
My being here is why you shouldn’t be nervous.

177
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,280
When you said you’d go to music school, I hope you didn’t forget

178
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,280
that the only person who supported and cheered you on was me.

179
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,430
Yeah, how could I forget?

180
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,460
So what are you embarrassed for?

181
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,340
Just play comfortably.

182
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,560
It’s open.

183
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,630
- Hmm? 
 - I think the instrument is open.

184
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,450
Give it here.

185
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,490
Ah, it’s busted here.

186
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:45,100
That’s why the instrument's sound couldn't fill the violin's inside and it’s leaking through here.

187
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:50,330
Even if you've been out of practice, if you can't tell your instrument is busted, don't you feel sorry for it?

188
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,980
Good point.

189
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,900
It’s your instrument. If you don’t notice it, who will?

190
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:01,440
Even these guys have souls too. They've lived over a couple of hundred years.

191
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,560
- You can’t let them think they met the wrong owner. 
 - Yeah.

192
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,370
Sorry.

193
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,940
I love you.

194
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,070
Say it thrice. That you love them.

195
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,390
To your violin.

196
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,800
Hurry and say it three times.

197
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:40,520
Say it directly into the f-hole. So it hears you from every crevice.

198
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,460
♫   Stay with me, close to me   ♫

199
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,730
♫   Stay with me, lean on me   ♫

200
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,010
♫   You've always been my side   ♫

201
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:08,860
♫   You comforted me   ♫

202
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,600
I love you. 
 ♫   I can't believe   ♫

203
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,800
I love you.

204
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,630
♫   I don't believe   ♫

205
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:23,340
♫   Stay by my side forever   ♫

206
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:29,180
I love you. 
 ♫   Even if it's for just a day   ♫

207
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,170
♫   I can't bear   ♫

208
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,190
♫  not being with you, it's you  ♫

209
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:48,560
♫   Stay with me, close to me   ♫

210
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,770
♫   Stay with me, lean on me   ♫

211
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:04,200
♫   I promise I'll stay by your side   ♫

212
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:10,070
♫   I have no reason to leave you   ♫

213
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,970
♫   I can't believe   ♫

214
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,550
♫   I don't believe    ♫

215
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,610
 Song Ah, congratulations on getting accepted into music school. 

216
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,880
 I’ll look forward to seeing you as an amazing violinist in 4 years. 

217
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,310
 P.S. Poco a poco! Let’s go slowly, bit by bit. 

218
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,230
 Fighting! 

219
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,430
 Let’s start the meeting. 

220
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,280
Okay.

221
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,790
I don't want to...

222
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,420
Song Ah. Let’s go to the meeting.

223
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,300
Ah, yes.

224
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,900
Do you keep in touch with Joon Young? About the rehearsal room.

225
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,110
Oh, he hasn’t contacted me.

226
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,500
Oh really? He must be taking time off.

227
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,880
Regardless, later this afternoon…

228
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,930
Omo! Oh, Deputy!

229
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,730
Ah! Just a second. Ah!

230
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,690
Deputy! What to do! Oh!

231
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,380
- Just a sec! Hold on! 
 - Ah! Help me!

232
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,960
- Team leader!
- Oh, sit, sit. 

233
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,850
I talked with Deputy Yoo Jin, and told her to not worry about this project.

234
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:22,490
She’s expecting at the end of this month anyway, so she’s taking time off immediately.

235
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,180
She won’t have any other problems, right?

236
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,600
What about the acquisition?

237
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,640
The doctor said there’s nothing to worry about.

238
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,170
About the acquisition, let’s see this work through and revisit it later.

239
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:35,300
- Okay? 
 - Yes.

240
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,530
Hey, Hae Na.

241
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,310
Yes?

242
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,440
I heard the Chairman's granddaughter played the violin. Do you know her?

243
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,370
Yes. Lee Jung Kyung Unni.

244
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,750
When she was younger, they called her the next Sarah Chang. She played with the New York Philharmonic.

245
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,390
When she came back to Korea in middle school, I was briefly an apprentice under the same teacher as hers.

246
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,400
She was pretty and bright, so she was quite popular.

247
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,820
But why?

248
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,640
No, it’s just— So, she’s really good, huh?

249
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:23,560
She was back then. Now it's... very questionable, you could say?

250
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,800
During middle school, after she lost her mom to an accident, she returned to work.

251
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,690
After that… she was still good for her age, but…

252
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,310
it wasn’t at all what people expected out of her.

253
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,660
There aren’t that many prodigies that stay popular into adulthood anyway, so…

254
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,000
Plenty of people like Jung Kyung Unni become average.

255
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,360
And even for an average person, she’s really good.

256
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,960
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

257
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,530
 You got here early. 

258
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,200
Thank you very much.

259
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,770
I am Na Moon Sook from the Kyunghoo Cultural Foundation.

260
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,840
   

261
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,360
 It's a pleasure to meet you. 

262
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,440
 

263
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,670
  Heol!  

264
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:23,880
Seung Ji Min’s debut album sold over 200 thousand copies in Korea.

265
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,610
Daebak!

266
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,020
It’s a little sad.

267
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:34,600
When Teacher Park Joon Young got 2nd place in his Chopin Piano Competition, everyone went wild for being Korea’s first.

268
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,890
Then a couple of years ago Seung Ji Min got 1st for the same competition so it feels just…

269
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,140
It feels just what?

270
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,310
He was completely outperformed. That’s why they say ranking is so important.

271
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:49,220
No matter how you argue that 1st and 2nd are tied for skill. 2nd place is still 2nd place.

272
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,030
I know too.

273
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,040
That’s why I think Teacher Park Joon Young...

274
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,220
needs to try one more piano competition before he’s too old to qualify.

275
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,990
Maybe next year’s Tchaikovsky competition or…

276
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,810
Tchaikovsky Competition?

277
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,440
Unless you’re crazy, why would you gamble on that?

278
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,080
I mean, what if he goes and it's not 2nd, but 3rd place or

279
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,060
maybe he even fails to qualify? What then?

280
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,390
I’m just saying that’s how I feel! As a fan!

281
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:22,370
Rather than waiting for him to get 1st in Tchaikovsky’s, I recommend jumping ship to Seung Ji Min.

282
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,810
What?

283
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,400
I’m leaving now. Enjoy your coffee.

284
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,530
Please buy us some.

285
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,690
 Next time. 

286
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,050
I’m also busy.

287
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,280
Let me buy you coffee.

288
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,160
 I don't drink coffee. 

289
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,920
Why is everyone leaving mid-conversation?

290
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,710
 I started working as a secretary in my father's business. 

291
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:48,120
After my father passed away, I inherited his business, and well, I worked all my life.

292
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,190
I don't know much about music.

293
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,700
15 years ago, I stepped down,

294
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:00,540
started the Cultural Foundation, and tried to study a little in order to work as the chairman, but wow...

295
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,860
How would I know as much as you all?

296
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:09,330
I'm just someone who buys you meals, like today.

297
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,700
I'll treat those who make good music with their instruments,

298
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,910
and those who work hard behind the stage

299
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,850
with many delicious meals.

300
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,700
And so... whenever we get new family members in the foundation,

301
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,450
I always insist that I pull them aside to share a meal with them,

302
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,600
so I can request that they take good care of our foundation.

303
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:40,170
I leave our Kyunghoo Cultural Foundation in your capable hands.

304
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,390
   

305
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,490
   

306
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,000
   

307
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,120
Team Leader, we're back.

308
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,350
Did you enjoy your meeting? Come sit for a minute.

309
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,170
I wanted to talk about your responsibilities.

310
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,600
My bangs are always so stubborn.

311
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,870
Then Hae Na is with me...

312
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,930
Will Miss "I'm sorry" do well? 
  (T/N: "Chae Song Ah" sounds similar to "I'm sorry" in Korean.) 

313
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,830
  She has to communicate with Joon Young's piano trio.  

314
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,990
Should I give you a hand?

315
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:25,160
Don't you worry about a thing, Chief! Did you forget who I am?

316
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,820
Hey, I spent 10 minutes on that!

317
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,850
What do you do all day?

318
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:21,920
Well, I go on walks and read books.

319
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,770
And your practice? I heard you do them at the foundation.

320
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,530
Yeah, occasionally.

321
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,180
About that night...

322
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:43,920
That night... when I performed in New York...

323
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:49,580
Yeah, what about it?

324
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,070
Come sit next to me.

325
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,430
The sun's directly on you. Come sit in the shade.

326
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:07,890
It's hot, so I'll just order 3 Iced Americanos.

327
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:14,130
Should I... get married?

328
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,470
What?

329
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:24,410
I've been with Hyeon Ho for a long time. Should I get married?

330
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,810
Are you serious?

331
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,040
No, I'm joking.

332
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,690
Lee Jung Kyung...

333
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:43,370
But when I asked if I should marry Hyeon Oh, I expected you to say "Congratulations"

334
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,820
like that.

335
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,520
Why is your expression like that?

336
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,790
That night... why did you do that?

337
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,190
No particular reason.

338
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,700
I was happy to see you. That's all.

339
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,250
I lived in America for so long, I must've gone overboard.

340
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,230
Okay then.

341
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,060
But... don't ever pull a prank like that again.

342
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,820
It's not at all funny.

343
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,000
It spilled over.

344
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,030
I should've closed it properly.

345
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,560
 Thank you very much. 

346
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,410
 Should I... get married? 

347
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,080
  Are you serious?  

348
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:35,470
♫  I can't express everything with the phrase "I love you"   ♫

349
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,200
♫   The words you speak  ♫

350
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,090
 Oh sure. 

351
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,460
♫   make me sad    ♫

352
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,660
 - What's your name?
- Carlene. 

353
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,220
 Carlene? 

354
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,370
 - Thank you.
- Thank you. 

355
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,670
 She's Ana, from Moscow. 

356
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:55,810
 Oh, Ana. 

357
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,670
 Thank you, thank you. 

358
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,380
 Thank you. 

359
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,930
 Are you a fan of his? 

360
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,890
 If you want it, I can get you his autograph. 

361
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,820
  - Please, please sign for us! 
 - Thank you.  

362
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,170
 Yeah. 

363
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,610
 I can sign for you. 

364
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,010
 Jung Kyung! 

365
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,890
 Jung Kyung. 

366
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:01,050
♫   These tears that have gotten cold cannot be considered part of our farewell   ♫

367
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:05,850
 Later, she confessed 

368
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,540
 she was jealous 

369
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,090
 of him, who was in a place she could no longer reach. 

370
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,590
 She hated him for it. 

371
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,810
 So she wanted to see for herself. 

372
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,360
 Am I still... 

373
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,390
 an important person to you? 

374
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,680
Hey, Jung Kyung!

375
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,400
You're here too, Joon Young.

376
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,680
- Did you get home safely last night? 
 - Yeah.

377
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,000
Have you eaten?

378
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,810
No.

379
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,990
This is killing me.

380
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,420
The hospital?

381
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,550
- Is she okay now? 
 - Yeah.

382
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:59,430
Thankfully, so that's why the person to take over communication will be...

383
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,140
Sorry for being late!

384
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,290
Perfect timing! Ms. Chae Song Ah here will take over for her.

385
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,370
 How have you been? 

386
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,860
 Yes, how are you? 

387
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,660
I heard you all ran into each other over the weekend. It must be fate.

388
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,040
Looking forward to working with you.

389
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,370
Same to you.

390
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,670
Okay then, enjoy your meeting.

391
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:22,260
Oh right. You guys can stay for dinner, right? I already got reservations.

392
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,260
It's been so long that I wanted to get you all dinner, but something came up.

393
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,050
So, I thought maybe I'd do it next time, but since everyone is here,

394
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,870
enjoy a meal with the three of you and Song Ah.

395
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,950
Yes, that will work. Thank you.

396
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,070
 I'll join you guys next time. 

397
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,590
 Then enjoy your meeting! 

398
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,580
- Have a safe trip! 
 - Okay.

399
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,870
Have some coffee.

400
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:56,500
I didn't know what you'd like so I got everyone iced coffee.

401
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,570
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

402
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,700
Song Ah, your coffee...

403
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,370
I spilled some on the way here. It's fine.

404
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,990
Take mine.

405
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:14,010
O-Oh, no! It's fine!

406
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,650
 I thought you couldn't drink coffee. You said it made your heart run too fast? 

407
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,030
You can't drink coffee? Well we have Solomon's seal tea too...

408
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,830
No need. Lately, I've started drinking it, occasionally.

409
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,800
 Oh really? 

410
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,020
 This guy used to even avoid chocolate just because of the caffeine. 

411
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,090
It's fine.

412
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,940
He's so sensitive.

413
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,270
Song Ah.

414
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:50,200
The first time the three of us played together was in our second year of middle school.

415
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,720
At that time, Jung Kyung had just transferred from the US.

416
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,080
I fell for her at first sight, and I was so nervous

417
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,960
that I couldn't bring myself to talk to her. So I brought him in, though he wasn't interested.

418
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,460
I coaxed him with music and asked her to join us for the school's chamber music competition.

419
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,450
But she refused flatly.

420
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,930
She was so mean.

421
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:14,340
- I mean, she said I was annoying and should stop bothering her! 
 - Oh, I see.

422
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,370
My first love is really full of scratches.

423
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:28,360
But in the end, we did it.

424
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,180
The chamber music.

425
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,480
So, how did you persuade her to do it?

426
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,400
Good question. Why did you suddenly change your mind back then?

427
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,150
I don't know, I don't remember.

428
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,060
Ah, really?

429
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,060
Hey, do you remember?

430
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,370
No. I don't remember either.

431
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,960
What's all this? We sound stupid, the three of us.

432
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,770
Done. Let's start now.

433
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,000
What's this, am I Han Seok Bong?

434
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,820
Only if you play well.

435
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,420
Mr. Park Joon Young, do you accept song requests?

436
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,760
I will accept some.

437
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,660
Song Ah, request a piece you'd like to hear.

438
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,090
Me? No, I'm all right.

439
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:32,790
It's fine, go ahead. It's to celebrate you joining our group.

440
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:37,880
You don't know when you'll get another opportunity like this one. Come on, request a piece.

441
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,770
Schumann's Träumerei.

442
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:05,050
I heard you playing it by coincidence, the other day.

443
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:09,120
The song from Schumann's "Scenes from Childhood"  (Kinderszenen) ?

444
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,850
Right, Jung Kyung. Didn't you say your name comes from that piece? 
  (T/N: Jung Kyung means "scene" in Korean.) 

445
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:18,550
Did your mother like that piece?

446
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:22,190
No. My name comes from my mom's name.

447
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,230
Right. Sorry.

448
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,800
Anyway, Joon Young has liked Schumann since long ago.

449
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,960
But I don't think I've ever heard him play Träumerei.

450
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:39,570
Anyway! Mr. Park Joon Young, please play Träumerei from Schumann's "Scenes from Childhood."

451
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,070
Another piece is fine, too.

452
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,890
I'll play it.

453
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,360
Listen carefully.

454
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,600
Since I won't play it ever again.

455
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:48,210
♫  You, who I have always watched from afar,  ♫

456
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:56,680
♫  I have now seen from so close  ♫  

457
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,470
♫  In every moment,  ♫

458
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,020
 Listen carefully.   
 ♫  I've hoped for this  ♫

459
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,190
 Since I won't play it ever again.  

460
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:09,520
♫  My heart is overwhelmed  ♫

461
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:19,030
♫   I'm a bit afraid   ♫

462
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:21,840
♫  Even if you don't say anything,  ♫

463
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,510
I love you.

464
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,500
I know. I know very well.

465
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,900
Sleep properly.

466
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,560
Jung Kyung.

467
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,310
I love you.

468
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,330
I love you so much.

469
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:46,440
♫  I want to hold onto this love  ♫

470
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,470
♫  Though it'll be painful at times, I'll wait for you  ♫

471
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,790
Section Chief Park and the conductor are at the hotel,

472
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:59,230
so Hae Na, you can go wait for them there and come back together, since there might be errands to run.

473
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,310
Yes.

474
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:04,490
And Joon Young said he'll come to Hannam-dong on his own. Ah!

475
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,450
- Song Ah. 
 - Yes?

476
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:10,610
I wanted to give Joon Young's album to the conductor, but we don't have any in stock.

477
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,630
Could you buy one?

478
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,330
Yes.

479
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,400
- Unni. Look over there. 
 - What?

480
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,880
Now it's all about Seung Ji Min wherever you go.

481
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,680
Park Joon Yeong is completely pushed out.

482
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:35,660
Don't you think Park Joon Young came back because he wasn't selling well abroad?

483
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,980
And the sabbatical year is just an excuse.

484
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:43,240
Honestly, he isn't bad at playing the piano, but he's popular because of his good looks.

485
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,470
If he was only a bit less handsome, things would be different.

486
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,640
It's the section chief.

487
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,790
Yes, Section Chief? Yes.

488
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,400
W-Wait.

489
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,150
Wait.

490
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,420
But why is it ringing? I have to hurry.

491
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,590
Ma'am, you need to pay for this.

492
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,550
I'm sorry. Oh, oops.

493
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,920
 There comes a time when you suddenly become aware of something. 

494
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:03,940
 I've never once enjoyed participating in piano competitions. 

495
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,760
 Every day I would travel 3-4 km and be racked with insomnia. 

496
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:20,170
 But there were two reasons why I continued participating in piano competitions. 

497
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,450
 Firstly, I needed the reward money to pay for my living expenses. 

498
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:31,160
 Joon Young, your father really tried not to use the deposit money, but... 

499
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,680
 When I moved up to Seoul alone to attend the fine arts middle school, 

500
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,980
 I needed to fend for myself. 

501
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,660
 And my other reason... 

502
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:48,580
   
 Just as I was about to give up, someone offered a hand. 

503
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,320
 It was for that person. 

504
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,760
 The scholarship money that came in my name 

505
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,510
 was the price of another child's sadness. 

506
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,110
 I hated that my fortune 

507
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,360
 was that child's tragedy, 

508
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:16,100
 but I wanted to continue playing the piano 

509
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:20,410
 and I didn't want to return home. 

510
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:28,360
 That is why I... decided to become her friend. 

511
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,730
 That is how... I hoped to ease my mind. 

512
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:41,320
 Let's do chamber music... together. 

513
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:46,840
 And then... I began to ceaselessly enter piano competitions. 

514
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:53,730
 So that the person who helped me... would feel her investment was worthwhile. 

515
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:00,590
 However... after I finished second in that last competition, 

516
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:06,770
 the time I spent away from Korea, sleeping in a different country's hotel room every night, 

517
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:10,220
 I never realized how difficult it was to fall asleep. 

518
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:15,760
 I would spill everything onto the stage thinking of that girl every night, 

519
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,150
 and I thought of my other friend. 

520
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,730
 Is the name of this emotion friendship? 

521
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,330
  Joon Young!  

522
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,010
 Was it compassion? 

523
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,340
 Did I feel indebted to her? 

524
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:54,400
 The more I think about it, the more afraid I became, so I tried to ignore it. 

525
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,830
 But in that moment I realized. 

526
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,440
 I had fallen... 

527
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,480
 in love with that girl. 

528
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:22,090
 But in truth, I had always known. Only that... 

529
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,260
 I first knew that this feeling must never come to light. 

530
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,490
 That sabbatical that I looked forward to for so many years... 

531
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:38,450
 was all a mess from start to finish. 

532
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,790
 Don't you think Park Joon Young came back because he wasn't selling well abroad? 

533
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,570
 And the sabbatical year is just an excuse. 

534
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,880
 He's popular because of his good looks. 

535
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,130
 If he was only a bit less handsome, 

536
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,000
 things would be different. 

537
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:08,460
W-Wait!

538
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,850
 The realities I wanted to ignore because I couldn't bear facing them, despite knowing they were true,  

539
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,280
 one at a time began to rear their heads. 

540
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,870
 What's after this? 

541
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:02,590
I'm curious about the years when Young In Noona was smaller and really skilled.

542
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,790
When Unni used to play?

543
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:06,180
Yeah, I heard she was really good.

544
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,800
Ah, I heard that kid was also Professor Song Jung Hee's student.

545
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,920
As expected of Professor Song. He knows how to pick out the best students.

546
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,120
She needs to be a much better player than me.

547
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:20,260
I don't know about that, but...

548
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,940
it'll be hard for her to be prettier.

549
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,650
Who asked you?

550
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:36,550
   

551
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,930
   

552
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,420
 Oh, you're here, Joon Young? 

553
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,050
 Yes. 

554
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,350
Did you eat?

555
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,430
Yes, sort of.

556
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:54,720
I told you to not skimp on your meals.

557
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,510
You haven't seen Ji Won yet, have you?

558
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:10,090
- Oh, no. 
 - Let's go meet her.

559
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,100
Ah... why is this so hard?

560
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,370
Are your migraines any better?

561
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:30,530
You had a really bad one in New York, remember? I was so worried.

562
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:34,320
How bad it must have been to miss even Joon Young's...

563
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,140
Success!

564
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:41,940
Did Joon Young say that?

565
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,540
That I didn't attend his concert?

566
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:57,020
The only person here who can read sheet music is... Song Ah.

567
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,780
Song Ah.

568
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,580
Yes?

569
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,310
Could you turn the pages for my sheet music?

570
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,410
   
    

571
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,680
Have you ever done "page-turning" before?

572
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,510
No, this is my first time.

573
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:37,210
It's fine. Even if you mess up, I have most of this memorized.

574
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:39,250
 Teach her some specific techniques. 

575
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:42,260
You must have done this yourself when you were in school.

576
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,110
Well... it's nothing like a technique, but...

577
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,710
You just need to feel the pianist's breathing.

578
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,970
 Hey, that's too hard! 

579
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:55,710
Well, this... is kind of difficult to explain with words, but

580
00:46:55,710 --> 00:47:00,010
Song Ah, you know what I mean, right?

581
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:04,250
Yes, I'll try.

582
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,760
Is this a little "something" only musicians know?

583
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,810
Then have fun matching up together!

584
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:15,790
Let's see...

585
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,290
Did he say I didn't attend his concert?

586
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,800
Was I wrong? Did you go?

587
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,720
No, I didn't go.

588
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,720
I didn't see Joon Young.

589
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:50,320
Don't those two look good together?

590
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,710
 You just need to feel the pianist's breathing. 

591
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,770
Thank you for your hard work, Song Ah.

592
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,530
Joon Young, I'm going to go now.

593
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:03,620
You're not going to see the performance?

594
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,950
 There's another rehearsal that I need to attend. 

595
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:08,850
Ah, that's right. Travel safely then.

596
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:10,570
- I won't see you out. 
 - Yeah, that's fine.

597
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:13,190
- Song Ah, I'll see you next time.
- Ah yes, next time.

598
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,530
- I'm going. 
 - Work hard!

599
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:18,150
Jung Kyung! Let me borrow some black clothes from you.

600
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,610
- Clothes? 
 - Yeah.

601
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:22,280
Song Ah suddenly became our page-turner,

602
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,490
but her clothes are a little bright.

603
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,780
- Sure. 
   - Can't you do it properly?  

604
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,360
 Your right hand's pizzicato is too weak. 

605
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,160
My... blisters hurt too much.

606
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,540
 They haven't burst yet? 

607
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:46,580
If you had only practiced, they would have been callouses by now.

608
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,680
Then they wouldn't hurt.

609
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,880
Oh Song Ah! Do they fit?

610
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,780
Ah, yes.

611
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,850
They look good on you.

612
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,650
Oh, thank you.

613
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,290
Turning the pages is tiring, isn't it?

614
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:30,390
Not at all.

615
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,340
Was this what I gave you? When you did your Chopin Piano Competition?

616
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,560
You sure use it for a long time.

617
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:46,510
You haven't played this piano in a while either, have you?

618
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:48,450
Of course.

619
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,830
Don't you want something to eat?

620
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:54,100
No, it's fine.

621
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,390
Or at least have something to drink.

622
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,800
   

623
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:28,050
   

624
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,180
Welcome, Maestro.

625
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,190
Let's go in.

626
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:27,830
Today was just... Bravo!

627
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,070
Thank you very much.

628
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:34,070
When I listened to today's performance...

629
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:38,230
Schumann would certainly be good,

630
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:41,550
but I think you'd also play Brahms well too.

631
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,090
That's a couple's ring, right?

632
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:51,830
Ah, yes.

633
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:56,750
I think it's funny to see string musicians wear rings on their right hand because of their instruments.

634
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,390
By chance, were you two music school campus couples?

635
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:01,560
- Yes, he was cello, the same year. 
 - Oh...

636
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,830
I'm so jealous.

637
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:08,560
Do you plan to stay here after graduating instead of studying abroad?

638
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,070
Yes. Well, there are a few schools that have accepted me, but

639
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:15,700
I'm also interested in planning performances as well.

640
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,970
What about you, Song Ah?

641
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:23,060
Have you decided what to do after graduation?

642
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:29,210
You also have interests in performance work after graduation, right?

643
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:36,320
For now, my only goal is to graduate safely.

644
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,860
Then there's the graduation performance second semester.

645
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:50,510
The wind feels nice.

646
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:58,700
Don't try so hard to perform

647
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,800
in a way that pleases everyone.

648
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:05,630
If you get scored an 8 from all of the judges in a piano competition,

649
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:10,340
sure, you could get first place.

650
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:14,730
But at times, getting a 10 from 1-2 judges

651
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:19,750
and getting a 6 or 7 from the rest could be better.

652
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:25,180
Then, to those one or two people,

653
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:30,600
it could be an unforgettable performance.

654
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:34,850
Don't be afraid of anything,

655
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:39,020
and try following your heart.

656
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,610
I'm riding this one!

657
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:48,410
Thank you for your hard work. I'll see you tomorrow, Song Ah!

658
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,720
The taxi isn't coming.

659
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,040
Right?

660
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,820
What direction is your home?

661
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,820
Oh, it's in Seocho-dong.

662
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:10,410
- Ah, it's in the direction of the cultural foundation then? 
 - Yes.

663
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:13,700
I guess it's not very far if you took a taxi.

664
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:17,540
Well, it's also similar with the subway too.

665
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:26,060
Song Ah, by chance, were you waiting on my taxi?

666
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,500
Me? Yes.

667
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:36,350
I was actually waiting for your taxi.

668
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:42,090
And I was waiting for your— Omo!

669
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:51,370
Well... then have a safe trip home.

670
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:56,560
I'm going to grab something to eat.

671
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,250
Didn't you eat earlier?

672
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:08,360
The thing is, I can't eat much right before or after a performance.

673
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:15,120
Well then, have a safe trip home.

674
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:23,380
Oh right, what did you think of today's performance?

675
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,230
I'm sorry?

676
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:27,590
The performance. Did you like it?

677
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:30,910
It was good.

678
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:33,630
That's a relief.

679
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:35,920
What about you?

680
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:40,850
I, too, was satisfied, because everyone else liked it.

681
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:43,340
Not everyone else,

682
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:46,800
did you like the performance yourself?

683
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:53,320
Personally, I liked the previous performance better.

684
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,650
The previous... performance?

685
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:59,470
What you played in the rehearsal room, Träumerei.

686
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:13,800
I liked today's too but strangely, I keep thinking about that night's performance.

687
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:20,050
When I think of it, it moves me here somehow.

688
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:27,740
Well, I better get going.

689
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,660
Ah, yes. Have a safe trip home.

690
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,650
 I, too, was satisfied, because everyone else liked it. 

691
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:55,540
 Not everyone else, 

692
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:58,570
 did you like your performance yourself? 

693
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,540
Song Ah!

694
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,390
Is it okay if I sit here?

695
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:15,200
O-Of course. Absolutely.

696
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:21,610


697
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:27,770
♫  At the end of this road I've traveled multiple times,   ♫

698
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:35,980
♫   your presence brings me joy. Even now, I'm happy   ♫

699
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:41,580
♫  This road that has grown familiar to us  ♫

700
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:47,410
♫  I hope it'll remain the same  ♫

701
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,630
♫  Please stay   ♫

702
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:56,120
♫   for me, by my side, love  ♫

703
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:03,200
♫  I see your deep moonlight in my dreams   ♫

704
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:09,070
♫   Even though I've seen your sky so many times  ♫

705
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:12,520
♫   it still makes me happy   ♫

706
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:20,100
      
 ♫  You're always like a dream to me  ♫

707
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:24,440
♫  You're already enough  ♫

708
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,630
♫   Another long time passes   ♫

709
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,150
 Do  you have someone you like? 

710
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:30,390
 - Jung Kyung went to that concert, to see Joon Young. 
 - Really? 

711
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:31,000
 Jung Kyung? 

712
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,960
 Don't tell Song Ah, about you and me. 

713
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,840
 Song Ah, Yoon Dong Yoon and I... 

714
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,080
 I like him too. 

715
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,700
 It's a song that I like, so I don't want to hear it right now. 

716
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,470
 I'm sorry. 

717
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,250
 This is a song that Joon Young has never performed before. 

718
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:45,600
 So that was Brahms' way of providing comfort and consolidation. Through music, rather than words.  

719
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,080
 Do you... want to be friends? 

720
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:55,370
♫   The painful days of the past   ♫
