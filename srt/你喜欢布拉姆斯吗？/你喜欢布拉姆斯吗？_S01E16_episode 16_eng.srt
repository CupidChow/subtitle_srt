1
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:51,980
 While I was playing the piano... I wasn't always happy. 

2
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,940
 Perhaps there were more times... 

3
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,430
 when I thought I was unhappy. 

4
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:09,630
 But when we were together, 

5
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,220
 I was really happy. 

6
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,480
 I only now realized this. 

7
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,610
 So... I want to be happy again. 

8
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,190
 Sorry for being so selfish. 

9
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,960
 But... if I don't express my feelings like this... 

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,350
 It'll be too difficult for me to bear. 

11
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:01,190


12
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,340
 I think... I'll need some time. 

13
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:22,320
 I hurt myself too many times. 

14
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:33,190
 Even more than the scars you gave me are scars that I gave myself. 

15
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,790
 I think I will need time. 

16
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,960
 But still... 

17
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,150
 Could you wait... for me? 

18
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,810
 Yes. 

19
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,620
 I will wait for you. 

20
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,320
 I will wait for you. 

21
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:13,780
   
   

22
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,540
   

23
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,490
It's so good...

24
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,040
Isn't it?

25
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:03,220
If this was the 15th anniversary concert as planned, Chairman Na would've seen and liked this too.

26
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,630
Oh? Isn't that Song Ah over there?

27
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,510
- Yeah. It's her. 
 - Huh?

28
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,800
Didn't you say just yesterday that she wouldn't be able to make this?

29
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,970
Thanks for your hard work.

30
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,840
You worked hard today.

31
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,060
I... didn't know you'd come today.

32
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,540
Sorry I was late.

33
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,200
You weren't late.

34
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,630
Thank you for coming.

35
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,180
Ah, this.

36
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,960
   

37
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:56,230
This sheet music... I'll return it today.

38
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,720
   
   

39
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,290
You gave me this a long time ago.

40
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,880
Thanks for it.

41
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,150
I'll go now.

42
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,870
Hyeon Ho!

43
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,140
When... when are you coming back?

44
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,950
I don't know.

45
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,350
Jung Kyung,

46
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,990
stay well.

47
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,860
Don't get sick.

48
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,810
Be happy.

49
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,860
  - Lee Jung Kyung did what?  
   - Yeah. 

50
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,600
 She was caught giving lessons secretly to Professor Song Jung Hee's student. 

51
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,870
 So what's happening to her? 

52
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,570
 She's no longer under the professor's tutelage, 

53
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,740
 so obviously her ship has sailed when it comes to becoming a professor at our school. 

54
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,190
 And I guess other places would be hard too, right? 

55
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:25,830
Occasionally, whenever I came here, my heart was troubled.

56
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,430
After my Mother passed away...

57
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,730
I don't think I grew up at all.

58
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,220
I pretended to be strong,

59
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,390
but I couldn't overcome anything by myself.

60
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,810
I was just always weak. I think.

61
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,530
You're not.

62
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:09,340
I don't think... you're a weak person.

63
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,750
"Because it's my music...

64
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,710
I need to lead it by my strength"

65
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,080
was something you said to me.

66
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:41,030
   
   

67
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,590
♫   Like the winds that scatter,   ♫

68
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:57,020
♫   I hope my sadness will disappear   ♫

69
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:04,450
♫   Like the flowers in the fields,   ♫

70
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,170
   

71
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,630
 "Because it's my music, 

72
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,470
 I have to lead it by my strength." 

73
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,650
 was what you said to me. 

74
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:20,460
♫   My loved ones, here   ♫

75
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:25,960
♫   Let's all dream   ♫

76
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:34,230
♫   Even in this world that is often difficult and hard  ♫

77
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:40,140
♫   There will be a path for you  ♫

78
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:47,650
♫   There will be a path for you  ♫

79
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,280
   

80
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,890
   

81
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:34,720
I... got accepted... into grad school.

82
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,340
Oh... congratulations.

83
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,570
Thank you.

84
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,090
But I'm not going to register for classes.

85
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,770
Song Ah. This...

86
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,360
   

87
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,320
I'm not trying to pressure you.

88
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,290
Yes. I know.

89
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,700
I decided not to compete in the Tchaikovsky Competition.

90
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,540
I've learned a lot... thanks to you.

91
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,930
I decided to try playing my music freely.

92
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,880
Thank you.

93
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,600
Hello, Assistant Manager.

94
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,750
Oh, Song Ah! You're here.

95
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:05,790
Umm... you used to play an instrument really well, right?

96
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,050
You even got first place in the Daehan Ilbo Competition.

97
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,590
Why did you choose to do this work?

98
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,580
In my case,

99
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,410
rather than struggling in the practice room by myself,

100
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,770
I preferred making trouble with people outside the practice room.

101
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,830
As they say nowadays, I'm an "insider."

102
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,520
But Song Ah,

103
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,650
don't be so quick to give up practicing music.

104
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,280
Even if you haven't practiced music for long compared to the other guys,

105
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,570
you mustn't cut it off so suddenly.

106
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:51,750
Decrease your practice time slowly, bit by bit.

107
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,970
Take your time in saying goodbye.

108
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:03,050
Oh, Song Ah! Sorry! Traffic was murder.

109
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,560
All of us want to work with you.

110
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,030
Except, as I mentioned earlier, we don't have many part-time positions,

111
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:16,000
and I'm not certain when we'll have

112
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,270
full-time positions again.

113
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:23,850
Since we have these real-life issues, will you think carefully about this before getting back to me?

114
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:29,290
But do you think I'd do a good job?

115
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,180
Song Ah. On the day of Cho Soo Han's performance,

116
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,920
when you didn't hesitate to give her your shoes,

117
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,460
and when you realized since she was just about to perform, you bore her mean insults,

118
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,220
you did all that because you thought of the musician first, right?

119
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,700
The reason why I'm inviting you to work with me

120
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,130
is because you always consider others first, take care of them, and look after them.

121
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,030
I think that makes you a good fit for this job.

122
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,030
But isn't that something anyone could do?

123
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,350
- For me— 
 - No.

124
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:22,260
If it were something anyone could do... wouldn't everyone do it?

125
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,610
In musical terms, they call it a "crescendo."

126
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,960
It means "to increase in intensity," right?

127
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,790
Yes.

128
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,670
If we take "to increase in intensity" and reverse it,

129
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:44,040
it means this place is where it's the quietest.

130
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,460
It's because this place is the quietest, that later it can grow in intensity.

131
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:59,530
15 years ago, when I was interviewed to work at this foundation,

132
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:05,870
I had given up on figure skating, and both my self-confidence and self-esteem hit rock bottom.

133
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,810
Chairman Na said this to me,

134
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:14,010
"If we took your smallest moment, and reworded it...

135
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:18,150
wouldn't it be the beginning of your crescendo?"

136
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:28,920
Would you carefully consider today's offer and get back to me?

137
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,100
Okay. I'll do that.

138
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,480
None of today's songs have accompaniments.

139
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,940
You're right.

140
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,490
Wow, playing by yourself with no accompanist for 90 minutes must be brutal, right?

141
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,590
Yeah.

142
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,490
But is this all there is?

143
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,640
   

144
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,030
   

145
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,270
   

146
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,140
Yes?

147
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:06,060
I really enjoyed your performance today.

148
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:11,750
Thank you. I didn't know you would come.

149
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,220
I wanted to come.

150
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,920
During the master class last time...

151
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,370
 How do I... 

152
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,420
 gain confidence? 

153
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,890
 That's a tough question. 

154
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,900
 If you find the answer, could you share it with me too? 

155
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,070
Hearing your performance today,

156
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:46,100
I think you've found the answer already.

157
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:55,860
Thank you, Song Ah.

158
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,810
Today, thanks to you,

159
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:08,470
I thought of why I loved the violin again.

160
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,540
Because the violin...

161
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,880
is an instrument you play by standing on both your feet.

162
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,630
It's an instrument that required me

163
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,010
to play it while maintaining my stance without wavering.

164
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,150
I think that's what I liked about it.

165
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,910
Unni!

166
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,290
Our chamber orchestra is holding a foundation concert.

167
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,140
Please come if you have time.

168
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,360
Is that so?

169
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,830
By the way,

170
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,250
I heard the student who worked for you quit.

171
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,740
Yes, I fired her.

172
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,430
She was polite and seemed to be a good worker.

173
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:17,620
That's true. Not everyone is popular with people.

174
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,430
I said I fired her.

175
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,650
Oh, really?

176
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,800
 Song Ah, have you been well? 

177
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,740
   

178
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,280
Why are you barely eating? Do you not have an appetite?

179
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,360
No, that's not it.

180
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,820
When is your boyfriend's graduation performance?

181
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,720
What?

182
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,700
Your boyfriend is going to have a graduation performance, isn't he?

183
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:08,820
Mom, we broke up.

184
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,000
Why?

185
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,450
It... just ended up that way.

186
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,670
How could it have "just" happened?

187
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,380
You're right.

188
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,550
He was also your accompanist for your graduation performance, wasn't he?

189
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,210
We were already broken up then.

190
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:38,650
He just did it for me as a friend.

191
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,390
I was really grateful to him then.

192
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:53,290
Though I didn't particularly support you studying music,

193
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:57,830
the day of your graduation performance, I actually felt a bit uneasy.

194
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,530
It was something you wanted to do so badly,

195
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:06,160
and I couldn't do it in place of you.

196
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,070
But that day, seeing him beside you,

197
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,380
I was grateful.

198
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:23,400
I was thinking you probably felt a bit better because of him.

199
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,580
Yeah.

200
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,950
That's why...

201
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,350
   

202
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,840
 I felt comforted. 

203
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:55,070
   

204
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,000
Entering the venue now.

205
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,420
It's the last piece.

206
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:25,020
Excuse me, a performance is going on, so you can't enter.

207
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,990
Oh.

208
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:11,120
   

209
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,790
 On the day before his wedding to Clara,  

210
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:40,900
 Schumann gifted Clara with a collection of pieces 

211
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:46,420
 filled with love and happiness. 

212
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,920
 The first song in this collection, "Dedication,"  
     
  (T/N: "Widmung.") 

213
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:57,440
 was later arranged by pianist and composer Liszt  
    

214
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,540
 into a piano piece without lyrics. 

215
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:09,130
 The person who reached out to me through music  

216
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:12,360
 before using words 

217
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:18,750
 was now using wordless music 

218
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,720
 to give his heart to me. 

219
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,680
You didn't have to bring all these.

220
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:25,640
I wanted to buy the prettiest flowers in the flower shop, but now that I look at it, they do seem not so great.

221
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,090
No, they're pretty.

222
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:38,190
Then, go back safely.

223
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,900
Yes, sure.

224
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,170
I'll go with your mother to the bus terminal, so don't worry.

225
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,680
Yes, thank you.

226
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,970
Get some rest.

227
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,070
Mother, let's go.

228
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,160
Take care.

229
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,020
Joon Young.

230
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:06,370
In the latter part, I teared up.

231
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:18,450
I don't know anything about the piano, but strangely, I cried.

232
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,310
I'll go now.

233
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,350
Take care.

234
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,560
Be happy.

235
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,530
   

236
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,950
Yes?

237
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,910
Excuse me, we have to close the venue soon.

238
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,400
I'm sorry, I'll come out right away.

239
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,010
Yes?

240
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,810
When did you come?

241
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,480
I was a bit late.

242
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,580
So I only heard Brahms and "Dedication."

243
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:39,040
Do you remember when we met at the airport?

244
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,990
The performance program tonight

245
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:52,220
Schumann, Clara, Brahms.

246
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,490
I played it thinking of what you had told me.

247
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:07,680
Now... I want to play Brahms often.

248
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,880
You asked me before

249
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:35,600
to be friends, didn't you?

250
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,210
I received so much comfort from you.

251
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,890
Comfort I received as a friend.

252
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:07,020
So today, I also came here... as a friend.

253
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,620
But now I think

254
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:24,480
I can't be that kind of friend with you.

255
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:39,080
I love you.

256
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,860
I love you.

257
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:11,250
♫   Your fair face, your pure eyes  ♫

258
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,840
♫   make my heart beat again   ♫

259
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:17,930
I love you.

260
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:24,210
♫   Your warm hands, your voice calling me...  ♫

261
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,760
I love you.

262
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,170
♫  Feels like an embrace  ♫

263
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,790
♫  My beautiful love   ♫

264
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:42,050
♫   My one love that makes my heart flutter   ♫

265
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:45,630
♫   That kind of person to me   ♫

266
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:53,490
♫   When the rain falls again, the one who'll fair it with me   ♫

267
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,510
♫   That one of a kind person...  ♫

268
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:00,690
 Compared to the pain incurred from loving this person, 

269
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,140
♫   Can you hear my heart?   ♫

270
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,640
I love you.

271
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:11,160
 I get much more happiness and comfort from this love. 

272
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,010
♫   Please stay by my side   ♫

273
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:15,730
 I... 

274
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:19,140
 finally realized that. 

275
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,790
♫   It's only you   ♫

276
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:32,640
♫   Even if the seasons change, I will never change    ♫

277
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,290
   

278
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,740
Song Ah.

279
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,600
Joon Young.

280
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,530
- I looked all over for you. You were here this whole time? 
 - Yes.

281
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:22,040
   

282
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,500
- It tastes so good! 
 - This is delicious!

283
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,340
Attention!

284
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,800
I'm moving.

285
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,390
When?

286
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:34,540
Next month. About 20 minutes away from here.

287
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,680
You're moving? Why so suddenly?

288
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,970
They're demolishing the place and putting up a new building.

289
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:50,350
So, I think today will be the last gathering we'll have at Intermission.

290
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:54,370
This place is one thing, but having to move my workshop feels a bit weird actually.

291
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,380
Of course.

292
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,800
It must feel weird.

293
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,620
That's true.

294
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:01,580
Let's end the sadness and clink glasses!

295
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,920
- Let's drink! 
 - Let's congratulate

296
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,630
Min Sung and Song Ah's graduation and...

297
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:07,090
Let's also drink to Yoon String's new beginning.

298
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:10,170
Congratulations!

299
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,140
Mom.

300
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:32,860
What is it?

301
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,220
Get a divorce.

302
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,220
You and Dad.

303
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,270
It's not because I've suffered because of Dad.

304
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,860
Mom, I...

305
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,600
really hope you could...

306
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:20,430
live your own life.

307
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,460
Bye!

308
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,160
Go home safely!

309
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:42,690
Even though you already got a doctorate's degree, you're going to study in the US again?

310
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,160
Do you love chemistry that much?

311
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,310
Yeah. I like it.

312
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,370
I love it.

313
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,910
Before you leave, bring your cello and come find me.

314
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:05,810
It should be strong and healthy even in the States.

315
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,550
Okay, I'll do that.

316
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:10,390
Thank you.

317
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,290
Will you really be okay?

318
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,780
- If you leave Professor Song Jung Hee... 
 - I'm prepared for it already.

319
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:35,150
But I think it's more important that Ji Won can play the violin happily.

320
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:41,080
Please teach Ji Won. Please help her.

321
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:48,360
All right.

322
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,090
Then, I look forward to teaching her.

323
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:55,270
Thank you, Teacher. Thank you so much.

324
00:46:55,270 --> 00:47:00,390
Starting March, I'll be starting work at Ji Won's school as a technique instructor.

325
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:06,500
Once school starts, you can just change her appointed instructor to me.

326
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,550
All right.

327
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:10,960
And... Madam,

328
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,530
there's something I wanted to tell you.

329
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:17,370
What is it?

330
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,520
 I want to lend my violin to Ji Won. 

331
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,710
Joon Young, can you eat spicy food well?

332
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:33,090
- Yeah. 
 - Really?

333
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:36,970
Then, there's even a third level of spiciness here. Can we get that?

334
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:39,630
Sure. Let's eat what you want.

335
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:42,260
Okay! It seems so good!

336
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,520
Joon Young, do you like spicy food?

337
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,910
Yeah, I do.

338
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:56,480
Really?

339
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,260
Yeah, I like it. Really.

340
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,760
A lot.

341
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:07,210
It's really true, right? You truly like it, right?

342
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:15,500
Actually... I can't really tolerate spicy food.

343
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,180
Right? That's what I thought.

344
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:22,450
The mild spicy flavor is good here too, so let's eat that.

345
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:28,160
No... the third level— Let's go with what you want. I'm really fine.

346
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:38,580
Then... let's not get the third level and choose another...

347
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,400
spicy level...

348
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,090
Boss, Level Two spiciness, please!

349
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,160
   

350
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,200
Thank you.

351
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,700
It's good, isn't it?

352
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,420
Yeah.

353
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:09,690
   

354
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:13,090
But is it really all right?

355
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,860
You selling your violin.

356
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:35,880
When I started working at the office,

357
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,890
I said I would practice every day during lunchtime for two months.

358
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:46,340
Before I completely quit music, I was told to take time to slowly part with it.

359
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:52,790
But as time passed, I kept forgetting to practice.

360
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:57,400
I'd say it's because I've got unfinished work, I have to eat lunch with my colleagues,

361
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,430
or that I have to eat with Joon Young.

362
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:10,000
I kept finding all sorts of excuses to push back practicing, then I started forgetting my violin sometimes.

363
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,350
There were even days when I left it at home.

364
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:24,150
A lot of my calluses have disappeared.

365
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:30,000
The marks here will probably slowly disappear.

366
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,120
Then, I'll eventually be okay too.

367
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,180
Like you said, instruments also have souls.

368
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:46,520
Now, I want to send it off to someone

369
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,480
who will treasure and love it more than I do.

370
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,340
All right.

371
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:09,230
Come to think of it, this instrument is a lot like its owner.

372
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,450
How?

373
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:16,750
Even when the bridge fell, it managed to withstand it with strength.

374
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:24,560
This violin received a lot more love and became a lot happier

375
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:29,430
after meeting you.

376
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:41,350
Wait a moment.

377
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,270
Song Ah, sorry, but I'm going to go out to the front for a bit.

378
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,990
Okay, go ahead.

379
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:50,900
I'll be back soon.

380
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:43,690
Thank you...

381
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,400
for all these years.

382
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,680
Farewell.

383
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,660
Good luck.

384
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,290
Be well.

385
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,600
Goodbye.

 For Joon Young's piano selection, we'd like to request his usual three pianos. 

398
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,140
Sure.

399
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:42,110
 So, he'll be flying in from Shanghai directly, and then return to Berlin from Seoul. 

400
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:43,420
Sounds good.

401
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,330
 Sorry that we can't give you a few extra days in Seoul. 

402
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:49,490
It's okay. I totally understand.

403
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:54,340
 ...from Shanghai directly, and then return to Berlin from Seoul.

 ...from Shanghai directly, and then return to Berlin from Seoul. 

405
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,920
 Manager, I'm hungry. 

406
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,400
 Let's go eat lunch. 

407
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,820
Joon Young, shall we go now?

408
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,690
Song Ah.

409
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,340
What?

410
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,620
I'll put it on for you.

I'm telling you the important thing first.

Hi.

00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,800
Hi.

431
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:51,680
Joon Young!

432
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,170
You're here.

436
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:19,730
 That day... I don't remember what wish I made. 

437
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:29,490
 But at that time, I already knew. 

438
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:39,750
 Thanks to this person, even if I keep getting hurt again and again, 

439
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:47,770
 I'll continue loving.

 I'll continue dreaming.
