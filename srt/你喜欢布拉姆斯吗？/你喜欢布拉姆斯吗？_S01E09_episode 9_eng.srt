1
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,020
Okay, I understand.

2
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,970
That's why I listened to you just now.

3
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,080
So that's it, right?

4
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,480
 I like you. 

5
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:09,010
♫   Your fair face, your pure eyes  ♫

6
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:14,840
♫   make my heart beat again   ♫

7
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,850
 Don't misunderstand. 

8
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,160
 I'm being your accompanist as pianist Park Joon Young. 

9
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,380
 I... 

10
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,610
 like Song Ah. 

11
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,640
♫  My beautiful love   ♫

12
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,880
♫   My one love that makes my heart flutter   ♫

13
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,390
♫   That kind of person to me.  ♫

14
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,850
♫   When the rain falls again  ♫

15
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:07,030
So I was thinking if you liked me,

16
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,910
you might offer to be my accompanist first.

17
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,420
But you didn't say anything.

18
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,970
I couldn't bring myself to ask you first either.

19
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,690
So, I got upset on my own for nothing.

20
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,420
It's not so much about you being my accompanist,

21
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,260
but that I thought you didn't like me.

22
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,180
I didn't know what you would think,

23
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,430
so I was afraid I'd burden you.

24
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,600
I see.

25
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,610
But you suddenly came and told me you'd be Jung Kyung's accompanist.

26
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,470
Do you think my feelings would be hurt or not?

27
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,790
Don't laugh. I was really hurt.

28
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,100
Sorry.

29
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,680
Though in Korean, you have to listen to the end,

30
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,010
next time, mention the important things first, okay?

31
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,590
Okay.

32
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,390
You have to promise.

33
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,490
All right, I'll do that for sure.

34
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:52,060


35
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,040
I'll be your accompanist.

36
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:06,560
No, I mean, please let me be your entrance exam accompanist.

37
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:12,550
I'm telling you the important thing first right now.

38
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,790
No.

39
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,040
You don't need to be my accompanist.

40
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,430
The grad school admission exam is really important to me,

41
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:43,630
so I want to do it on my own.

42
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,900
Thank you for offering.

43
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,230
All right.

44
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,580
But if you end up having a hard time, tell me anytime.

45
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,490
Okay, I'll do that.

46
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,940
Thank you.

47
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,150
 I like you. 

48
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,880
 I like you. 

49
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,990
 I like you. 

50
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,600
 I came to tell you this. 

51
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:56,180
    
     

52
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,930
You and Park Joon Young have decided to start dating?

53
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,870
That's great! Congratulations, Song Ah!

54
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,020
- Congratulations, Song Ah! 
 - Thank you!

55
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,640
This is awesome.

56
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,650
But... what will happen to me now?

57
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,290
What?

58
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,480
You're going to be eating with Park Joon Young every day now, aren't you?

59
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,200
Park Joon Young! You're taking Chae Song Ah away from me!

60
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,170
- Sorry. 
 - Ah!

61
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,650
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

62
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,270
You found us.

63
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:37,150
Yeah, thanks to someone who yelled my name really loudly.

64
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,380
Hello, I'm Song Ah's friend, Kang Min Seong.

65
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,400
Hello, I'm Park Joon Young.

66
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,970
- Have you had lunch? 
 - Not yet.

67
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,940
If you haven't had lunch yet, let's go together.

68
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,270
No, no, it's okay.

69
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,150
No, let's go together.

70
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,710
I know how to read the room, okay?

71
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,750
You two can go have a happy and fun date.

72
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,390
No, eat with us!

73
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,630
See you next time!

74
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,050
She's not usually like this.

75
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,620
When does your class end today?

76
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,870
Song Ah Unni!

77
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,130
Hi! It's okay if we sit here, right?

78
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,700
But you two...

79
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,000
It's because you two are always together that there are false rumors about you dating.

80
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,050
Oh...

81
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,110
It's not a false rumor.

82
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,760
What?

83
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,830
You haven't told them we're dating yet?

84
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,380
Oh my god. Unni!

85
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,270
Unni, is it true?

86
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,370
Yeah.

87
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,950
Oh my god. What a shocker.

88
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,700
 You guys look so good together! 

89
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,630
 - But seriously, I can't believe this!  
  - Seriously incredible! 

90
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,890
What are you doing after class today?

91
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,320
I'm going to the Kyunghoo office later.

92
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,260
Why Kyunghoo?

93
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,140
Professor Lee Soo Kyung is organizing a chamber orchestra,

94
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,430
I've just been helping her out.

95
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,060
We're planning on doing the event at the Kyunghoo Auditorium.

96
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,240
- Expect a survey from me soon. 
 - Ah.

97
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,360
Do you want to come with me? Your house is in that area anyway.

98
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,020
- I actually have to practice at school today. 
 - Ah.

99
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,390
- What time are you going? 
 - At 4:00 p.m.

100
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:48,050
But I'm also planning to take some time to practice before going.

101
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,720
I still have two classes left though.

102
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,410
I see. That's too bad.

103
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,090
- Thank you. 
 - All right.

104
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,080
 Apparently, Song Ah Unni and Park Joon Young are really dating! 

105
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,530
  - Didn't they deny it last time? 
 - I asked Unni just now. 

106
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,190
 Park Joon Young is beside me right now! 

107
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,170
 That would make them the ultimate campus couple of music school! 

108
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,320
 It's the worst if you break up after being a campus couple in music school. 

109
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,010
 What? What did you say? 

110
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,090
Oh, nothing.

111
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,520
Oh, Unni!

112
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,100
Oh, the chamber!

113
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,440
Oh?

114
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,350
Oh my! Didn't you have classes?

115
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,300
I have a break.

116
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,060
Can I stay here until my next class?

117
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,820
Yes! Of course!

118
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,430
Sit here.

119
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,300
Thanks.

120
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,920
I'm really just going to sit here. You can practice freely.

121
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,770
Could... you give me that?

122
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,330
The... violin?

123
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,820
No, the handkerchief.

124
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,490
O-okay.

125
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,470
But let me give it to you next time. I'll wash it.

126
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:04,620
No... I want it now.

127
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,210
Thank you. I'll buy you a new one.

128
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,250
No, it's okay, I have more at home.

129
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,960
Me too. I have many.

130
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,170
But, this is different, isn't it?

131
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,800
I also want to gift you something.

132
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,140
Okay, then.

133
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,910
Then, please buy one for me.

134
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,710
Oh, sorry. Th-this is the alarm I set to remind me to go to Kyunghoo later.

135
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,240
   

136
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,140
Sorry, sorry! The call took longer than I expected.

137
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,790
- Team Leader, your coffee. 
 - Oh thanks.

138
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,630
Oh this! The survey application.

139
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,180
Yes.

140
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,200
I thought you wouldn't be able to help us because you said you'd be too busy with grad school prep.

141
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,900
Did you have free time to help with the professor's chamber work?

142
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,080
I'm sorry!

143
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,860
But isn't there a lot of work in the chamber orchestra?

144
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,570
It's okay. It's doable.

145
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,410
But there should be a lot that you have to keep track of.

146
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,990
But wait!

147
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,790
If you're doing this in our hall, then that must mean you're also playing as a musician!

148
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,910
- Yes! 
  - Oh! I'll bring a bouquet! 

149
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,190
How's work?

150
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,270
I might not be here for long.

151
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:12,610
Why? I heard Kyunghoo Card wasn't doing too well but was it that bad?

152
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,100
- Did I order something too pricey? Thi- 
 - No, no, no.

153
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,370
I'm using the company card, company card!

154
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,580
And this? Is my business card. Business card.

155
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,120
Wait, your company isn't even established yet, but you already get your own card?

156
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,250
Well... everything is easier if I do it in advance.

157
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,110
 Wow... CEO  
    

158
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,140
You're so cool.

159
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,560
You came all the way here. I'm sad you couldn't stay for the performance.

160
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,110
I'm sorry.

161
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,540
I have to practice for grad school, so I'm in a bit of a hurry.

162
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,320
Nothing to be sorry about. Whenever you want to see a performance, come find us anytime.

163
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,120
Yes.

164
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:01,500
So... um... Team Leader, the thing is...

165
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,710
It's Joon Young...

166
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,720
You're together now, right?

167
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,780
Yes!

168
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,300
I'm so glad. You suit each other well.

169
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,170
Thank you very much, Team Leader!

170
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,540
- Is there a lot left? 
 - Oh, no.

171
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:30,150
Team Leader, I... don't feel great about Song Ah.

172
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,580
Why?

173
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,610
Professor Lee Soo Kyung's chamber.

174
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:39,840
Of course, there are great chambers that perform smoothly.

175
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,660
But with Professor Lee's chambers, they're practically professorial cartels.

176
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,560
Then again, trying to find a job anywhere without any connections is difficult,

177
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,190
so I understand that people put their lives on the line to get in.

178
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,150
But the professors taking advantage of desperate students

179
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,150
and establishing their legacy that way.

180
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,130
Song Ah should also be aware of such things.

181
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,660
I didn't expect her to take the lead on this.

182
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,800
It means she's just that desperate. As you pointed out.

183
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,440
Yes...

184
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,350
Of course, I'm only able to say this because it's not my business.

185
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,930
   

186
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,970
   

187
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,720
    
  I'll give you your accompaniment sheet music. Let's meet. 

188
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,800
 I'll give you your accompaniment sheet music. Let's meet. 

189
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,930
 Okay. 

190
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,320
   

191
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,870
   

192
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,430
Hey, this is still a reunion of the men's music majors of our high school.

193
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:38,400
How is it that only 5 of the 26 are here?

194
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,650
The guys are all overseas that's why.

195
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,930
It's their vacation but they're still not flying in.

196
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,460
But still, out of the guys who are in Korea, besides Yoon Dong Yoon and Park Joon Young, everyone's here.

197
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,440
- You mean the only two who are making money aren't here? 
 - I guess so.

198
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,520
But let's say that Owner Yoon is busy because it's business hours.

199
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,730
Han Hyeon Ho? Why is Park Joon Young not here?

200
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,110
Who knows?

201
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,290
Hey, is Joon Young getting paid some high schooler's wages?

202
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,900
At best, Joon Young is his parents' personal ATM machine.

203
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,500
The actual winner in this picture? Mr. Han Hyeon Ho.

204
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,860
- Yes! Thank you for this meal
 - This looks so good!

205
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,180
Hey, there's no fish, right?

206
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,980
 - Enjoy your meal! 
 - Yes!

207
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,790
What are your feelings attending your first meeting?

208
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,830
I was only sitting in the back, but I was drained of all my energy.

209
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,910
Yes. It definitely looked like it.

210
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,170
If Master Han Hyeon Ho marries Director Lee Jung Kyung,

211
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,870
he's marrying into their family then, right?

212
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:47,270
Just thinking about it... I feel suffocated!

213
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,460
Ah, lately with only a few weeks of experience, I can't even submit an application!

214
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,320
Yeah, that's why if there's an opening for an orchestra anywhere, there's no place I wouldn't go.

215
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,000
I should have tried to look good for the professors before studying abroad.

216
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,180
Do you think it's that easy?

217
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,740
If you come from a wealthy family, the professors take you in before you say a word.

218
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,180
 Right?! That's what I'm saying! 

219
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:15,360
 Oh right. One of my cousins got into Seoryreong University Professor Lee Soo Kyung's chamber this year. 

220
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,930
She's completely filled violin with her apprentices, but it looks like they still need the other instruments.

221
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:25,380
 So I'm thinking about asking her for recommendations, do you guys want in? 

222
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,460
 - Let's have a drink first  
 - Hey, let me get some networking in too.

223
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,140
Put your hand down.

224
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,400
Hey, me, me too.

225
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,700
What are you talking about? You can't!

226
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,900
Why? I also need work experience and connections.

227
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,080
Yeah, I understand, but your girlfriend is a walking billboard for Professor Song Jung Hee.

228
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,690
Do you think Professor Lee would accept you?

229
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:46,920
 Ah... good point. You should look at Professor Song Jung Hee's chamber instead. 

230
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,450
You're so shameless.

231
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,020
- I broke up with Jung Kyu... 
 - This punk.

232
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,010
You should just discreetly ask her if you could play cello after marriage!

233
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,770
I said we broke up!

234
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,410
Huh?

235
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,870
So you can recommend me now, right?

236
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,290
Ah, it's spicy.

237
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,120
Oh, this was here...

238
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,440
How is your mother's health?

239
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,540
She had an important surgery last year.

240
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,210
She is doing all right.

241
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,170
Is she still living alone in Cheorwon?

242
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,200
How does she take care of her farm work?

243
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,350
My fourth younger brother is helping her out since last year.

244
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,150
I see.

245
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,490
I haven't been paying enough attention.

246
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,380
No, don't say that.

247
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,660
This is where Kyung Seon introduced you to me for the first time, right?

248
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,800
Back then, it was the first time I came to such place.

249
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,010
She used to make me worry so much,

250
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:16,450
but now that she's gone, that is all forgotten,

251
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,810
and I only miss her.

252
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,470
I hope you are the same.

253
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,770
She had such a rash personality.

254
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,320
She used to say her personality was just like yours.

255
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,200
Me?

256
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,940
She did?

257
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:53,470
I am thinking of leaving the foundation to Jung Kyung.

258
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,290
Everyone has their own place, after all.

259
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:07,290
What about you? Was it very tough to live in a place

260
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,790
that wasn't yours?

261
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,240
I sent your number to my cousin.

262
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,200
Thank you.

263
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,880
- Let's eat. 
 - But still,

264
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,150
you two dated longer than I expected, so I thought you might even get all the way to marriage.

265
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:37,030
Wait and see. There'll be an article saying that Jung Kyung is getting married soon to a guy with a similar background.

266
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,010
So don't have useless lingering feelings and send her texts like "Are you asleep?",

267
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,960
"I miss you.", "I've been drinking." Don't you dare send that, seriously!

268
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,830
- You'll be kicking your blanket in embarrassment. 
 - Right, right.

269
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,980
But Lee Jung Kyung is really too much. How can she hold onto him for ten years?

270
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,030
- You pretty much could ask for alimony at this point, no? 
  - Right?

271
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,950
- Stop it. 
 - Why?

272
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,980
I got it, so stop it now.

273
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,450
Oh my, we've really known each other for quite long!

274
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,250
We get to see Han Hyeon Ho becoming single, and Park Joon Young dating someone.

275
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,220
Park Joon Young? He is dating?

276
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,650
Yeah. I heard he is dating Professor Lee Soo Kyung's pupil.

277
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,510
Unbelievable. Which class?

278
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,670
Isn't there a huge age difference then?

279
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,710
No, she's from the class of 2017

280
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,760
but she used to attend Seoryeong Business School or something before, so she's the same age as us.

281
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,890
Are you done?

282
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,370
Yes.

283
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,110
You're good.

284
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,910
I see you have worked hard and improved a lot, Song Ah.

285
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,900
Thank you.

286
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,390
It's hard work with the chamber orchestra, isn't it?

287
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:20,100
Do you know how envious everyone is since you do such perfect work?

288
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,860
No, no, I'm not.

289
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,280
Almost all the members have been decided now,

290
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,480
so let's schedule a meal with everyone, so I can meet them.

291
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,740
Yes.

292
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,280
There's a restaurant in Hannam-dong that does very good nanjianwanzi  (meat balls) .

293
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,700
Oh, I know that place.

294
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,120
- You do? It's delicious, right? 
 - Yes.

295
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,460
Ah, but it's a bit expensive there...

296
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,320
Our party will have over thirty people, will that be alright?

297
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,080
It's fine, it's fine.

298
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,210
We should eat something delicious for our first gathering.

299
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,040
Ah, yes.

300
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,030
Collect the fee in advance, the kids these days don't carry cash around.

301
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,260
Ah, each is to pay their fee...

302
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,120
Yes, I understand.

303
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,800
See you next week, then.

304
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,400
Yes.

305
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,510
Song Ah?

306
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,550
You did very good today.

307
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,780
Thank you.

308
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,830
Ah right, Song Ah!

309
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,490
I was just recommended a few more people.

310
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,320
I'll send you their numbers. Tell them to come as well.

311
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,900
Yes.

312
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,570
Here. The scores for the accompaniment.

313
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,280
   

314
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,140
- The theme of the recital is France romanticism? 
 - Yeah.

315
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,440
I had prepared Brahms,

316
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,380
but you don't play it so I changed it.

317
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,840
If that's what you want to do, do it. It doesn't matter to me.

318
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,870
That's a relief.

319
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,990
But I don't want to. I'm the one who can't play Brahms now.

320
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,290
Anyway, I think it's good that I changed it.

321
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:19,520
The piano is particularly important in Franck's sonata.

322
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,810
I want to take advantage of you playing.

323
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,480
It looks like there's nothing I can do by myself.

324
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,030
When I think about it, that was always the case.

325
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,880
I always had the talent, however.

326
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,890
Though I don't know where it's gone to now.

327
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,090
It's the same for my instrument. A Stradivarius?

328
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,600
It's more than I deserve.

329
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,940
And you being my accompanist is also more than I deserve.

330
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,250
No.

331
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,190
It's not.

332
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,170
What about lunch? Did you eat?

333
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,360
I'm dating Song Ah.

334
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,620
   

335
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,000
   

336
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,860
 I'm said  I'm dating Song Ah. 

337
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,810
Yeah, okay.

338
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:06,070
So let's practice for your accompaniment at the foundation's rehearsal room.

339
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,080
Not at your house.

340
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,630
Got it.

341
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,270
About the order of the performance—

342
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,000
And...

343
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,930
Please solve the misunderstanding with Hyeon Ho.

344
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,990
About last time.

345
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,810
I'll take care of my own business myself.

346
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,990
It's also my business.

347
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,890
Please.

348
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,610
Ah, that's why you called.

349
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,120
Thank you anyway, for accepting me.

350
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,340
Ah, well, I didn't do anything.

351
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,790
We decided to have a meal together with all the members soon.

352
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,770
 I'll contact you again with the day and the place.  

353
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,360
Excuse me, Song Ah.

354
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,890
Yes?

355
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,440
Perhaps, are you dating Joon Young?

356
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,830
Ah, uhm.

357
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,730
Well then, I'm off.

358
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,370
Yes.

359
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,230
That's g—

360
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,240
That's good.

361
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,200
Thank you.

362
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,070
I'll contact you again later. Yes.

363
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,000
- Hyeon Ho. 
 - Hey.

364
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,360
Come inside for a second, let's talk.

365
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,350
What are you doing?

366
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,300
Don't come in, you.

367
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,870
Go now.

368
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,450
I heard you're dating Song Ah.

369
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,260
Yes.

370
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,460
So what are you doing right now? Why are you with Jung Kyung?

371
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:40,790
I agreed to be her accompanist at her recital for Seoryeong University professor's appointment.

372
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,330
So I came to get the music scores. That's why we met.

373
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,070
- Hyeon Ho, last time— 
 - Jung Kyung's accompanist?

374
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,490
Do you think that makes sense?

375
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,520
I told Song Ah, and Jung Kyung knows as well.

376
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,120
Knows what?

377
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,910
That I'm dating Song Ah.

378
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,680
I told her.

379
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,000
Really...

380
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,690
Really, how can you do that?

381
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,550
How can you do that to Jung Kyung?

382
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:40,010
I... I was afraid Jung Kyung would know that you're dating Song Ah.

383
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,660
I was afraid she'd get hurt if she knew,

384
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:49,210
so... So that's why I brought you aside to talk about it.

385
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,580
But you told her that easily?

386
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,520
The friends from our Arts high school are upstairs.

387
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,030
They know we broke up,

388
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,480
so go before you run into them.

389
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:41,230
So if there's anything you are curious about regarding Park Joon Young,

390
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:45,470
or anything else, you can contact me.

391
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,150
Yes, well.

392
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:54,350
But wouldn't you have been in a much more secure position at Kyunghoo?

393
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:59,690
Well, as for that... We'll have to wait and see.

394
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,220
If I'm lucky, I might also be able to expect

395
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,700
to turn my life around thanks to Park Joon Young, don't you think?

396
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,470
Yes, Professor? Oh my.

397
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,660
I mean, Producing Director? I'm back from meeting Professor Yoo Tae Jin.

398
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:26,880
Contrary to the rumors, it doesn't look like his relationship with Joon Young is that bad.

399
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:47,460
 So, do you think you can try to teach Joon Young? 

400
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,450
 Yes.  

401
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,540
 But... I'm curious as to why you left aside  

402
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:02,120
 all the other good teachers and insisted on contacting me instead. 

403
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,460
 What is wrong with you? 

404
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:11,580
 You may already know, but neither the school I graduated from, my experience,  

405
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,910
 nor my family background is anything to show-off. 

406
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:21,990
 And I'm not even a graduate from Seoryeong University, so there isn't anyone to back me up in South Korea. 

407
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:25,320
 So why me, of all people... 

408
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,390
 While trying to find a good teacher for Joon Young,  

409
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:33,160
 I met a lot of different people.  

410
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:39,210
 But the only one who showed interest in Joon Young's potential rather than in our foundation 

411
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,940
 was you, Teacher.  

412
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,530
 Does that answer your question? 

413
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,650
 Yes.  

414
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:58,840
 I... I must be very fortunate.  

415
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:04,890
 It looks like it's now our turn to bet Joon Young's fortune on you. 

416
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:25,350
   

417
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,220
 Teacher Yoo Tae Jin really became a professor. Hasn't he been a lecturer for a few years only?  

418
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,630
 Park Joon Young won an award at the Chopin competition this time. 

419
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,860
 He turned his life around thanks to Park Joon Young.  

420
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,210
 Isn't that just 100% luck?  

421
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:52,650
 If I'm lucky, I might also be able to expect to turn my life around thanks to Park Joon Young, don't you think? 

422
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,200
Luck?

423
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,900
It's all skills.

424
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,760
- Joon Young! 
 - Noona.

425
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,000
- Did you come to practice? 
 - Yes.

426
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,590
- Are you going home? 
 - Yes.

427
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,960
It's a bit late, right?

428
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,000
Regarding the contract, I'm still talking to Chris about it.

429
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,580
I'll try to solve things well.

430
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,660
Alright. Thank you.

431
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,710
Then go and practice. Don't finish up too late.

432
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,390
- Ah, Noona. 
 - Yes?

433
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,060
Things turned out that way, with Song Ah.

434
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:49,150
Noona, why aren't you saying anything? I'm so embarrassed.

435
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,350
It makes me happy, Joon Young.

436
00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:01,020
I'm happy you're dating someone nice, and happy that it's Song Ah.

437
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,850
And...

438
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:07,200
I'm also happy you talk to me about that kind of thing.

439
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,240
I thought it was, unfortunately, at times.

440
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:19,550
I wanted to say things like "Don't worry", "It will get better", "Everything will work out well",

441
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:25,990
when you were going through hard times, but you would never say anything.

442
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,920
I don't want the people I like

443
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,000
to be tormented or troubled because of me.

444
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,530
They can't resolve my problems just because I tell them,

445
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:49,920
and it's my own business anyway, so it's fine with just me enduring it.

446
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,600
I wish you would just think

447
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,940
that I'm always doing well.

448
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:06,590
Still, I wish you would be different with Song Ah.

449
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,560
Don't try to always show each other the pretty things,

450
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,960
and also show your pain, your flaws, and your less attractive sides.

451
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,930
I wish it could become a relationship where you can rely on and comfort each other like that.

452
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,450
Right! I got complimented during my private lesson today.

453
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,540
Really?

454
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,690
So is our Song Ah going to graduate school?

455
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:38,400
- I don't know yet. But I got complimented so I feel great. 
 - Hey.

456
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,720
But don't do a doctorate.

457
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,960
What? From someone whose dream is being a Ph.D.?

458
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,730
It feels so nice.

459
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:58,790
Because I feel like you're reaping the fruits of your hard work.

460
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,130
Thank you.

461
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,720
Sorry.

462
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,770
What is it? Is it your Professor?

463
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,590
No, it's Eun Ji.

464
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,740
Eun Ji? Why?

465
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,090
She said she would arrange a blind date for me.

466
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:24,550
But I can't bring myself to say I'll do it.

467
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:32,720
What should I do? Do I go on a blind date, or not?

468
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,060
Go.

469
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,120
Go?

470
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,560
Yeah. Go.

471
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,650
Go, and meet someone nice.

472
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,780
Will I ever meet someone I like as much as Yoon Dong Yoon?

473
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:03,560
Yes. You will.

474
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,420
Okay! Then with Chae Song Ah's encouragement,

475
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:14,790
I will go on a blind date and see.

476
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,090
- I'm contacting her right away. 
 - Yes.

477
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,670
Yes, Song Ah?

478
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,670
Does it not taste good?

479
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,810
No, that's not it.

480
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,390
Then why aren't you eating it?

481
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:54,280
Actually, I don't really eat ice cream.

482
00:41:55,750 --> 00:42:00,400
But last time, you asked me to go and eat ice cream with you at school.

483
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:08,480
That...was just an excuse I suddenly came up with...

484
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,270
to meet up with you.

485
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,770
Really?

486
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:19,820
I thought you liked ice cream,

487
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,870
so that's why I suggested getting some together.

488
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,710
I do like it.

489
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:27,590
You just said you didn't like it.

490
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:31,210
I really like you.

491
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:39,030
♫   Though I'm alone, I long   ♫

492
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:43,800
♫  for your warm smile   ♫

493
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,060
You really don't like ice cream.

494
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,580
Give it to me. I'll eat it.

495
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,590
I'm going to eat it.

496
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:53,850
If you don't like it, don't eat it.

497
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:57,310
♫   Everything looks like you  ♫

498
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,550
♫   The sky is like your big embrace   ♫

499
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,510
♫   Those clouds resemble your face   ♫

500
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,420
♫   I want to run into your arms   ♫

501
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,880
♫   I miss you so much    ♫

502
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,100
♫   Can you wait for me a little longer?   ♫

503
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:33,430
♫   I won't take too long   ♫

504
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:38,390
♫   Though I'm alone, I long   ♫

505
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:43,250
♫   for your warm smile   ♫

506
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:49,810
♫   I remember everything single part of you   ♫

507
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:57,500
♫   Again, I long for you   ♫

508
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:47,780
You're here.

509
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,490
Yeah.

510
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:54,800
I actually came a little while ago, but I was admiring your playing from outside.

511
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,780
You should've just come in.

512
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,470
What song are you playing?

513
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,660
Just some random songs.

514
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,040
Have a seat.

515
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,750
What did you think when you were listening outside?

516
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,710
You were great.

517
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,740
You should give some more concrete compliments.

518
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,950
What? Concrete?

519
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:33,710
I don't really know how to express it...

520
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:37,280
I just...just...

521
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:43,800
I just felt like it was the playing of someone who would win first place in a competition.

522
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,540
That kind of feeling?

523
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,100
That's a compliment, right?

524
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,890
Yes! Of course.

525
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:56,130
Why doesn't it sound like one?

526
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:59,160
Was I too obvious?

527
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,820
Oh, right. I saw Professor Yoo Tae Jin just now.

528
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,710
- Professor Yoo? 
 - Yeah.

529
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:15,530
How are Professor Yoo's lessons?

530
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:18,760
He seems to be somewhat different than other professors.

531
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,940
That's why his students are probably so outstanding, right?

532
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,040
I'm not sure.

533
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:31,480
I don't really know. I've actually only taken lessons from Professor Yoo since 8th grade.

534
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,060
I'm not really sure what's different...

535
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,310
They're pretty good. He's a nice person.

536
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,900
Darn, that didn't fool you.

537
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,490
If you bad-mouthed Professor Yoo,

538
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:52,530
I was going to bad-mouth Professor Lee Soo Kyung too.

539
00:46:54,670 --> 00:47:00,460
Now that I think about it, Dong Yoon was a good teacher too.

540
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:05,220
He was probably really frustrated teaching me, but he never got annoyed at me.

541
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,850
You're praising another man so openly like that.

542
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:17,650
And you're being so outright jealous?

543
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:24,400
Oh, I don't think I can eat dinner with you tonight.

544
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,520
Why not?

545
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,670
It's my school club friend's birthday.

546
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:36,300
Teacher Yoon Dong Yoon is on a business trip, so he won't be coming.

547
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,080
Don't be jealous.

548
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,930
All right. Have fun.

549
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,490
Okay.

550
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:51,150
Then, I'm going to class now.

551
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:53,190
Let's talk tonight.

552
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,000
Bye.

553
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:06,540
 How are Professor Yoo's lessons? 

554
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,850
 He seems to be somewhat different than other professors. 

555
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:13,510
 That's why his students are probably so outstanding, right? 

556
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,440
 Why are you here? 

557
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:24,720
 Didn't you run away and refuse lessons because you wanted to prepare for the Chopin competition yourself? 

558
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:31,600
 What? Did you finally come back to your senses because you got eliminated from the competition in Australia? 

559
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:41,500
 But it seems like Young In doesn't know about this. 

560
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:45,800
 Are you not even able to trust Young In because she's close with me? 

561
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,760
 Or are you afraid  

562
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,500
 that Chairman Na will find out? 

563
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:58,670
 Joon Young. 

564
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,540
 You wouldn't have been able to accomplish anything without me. 

565
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:06,850
 And you won't be able to do anything in the future without me either. 

566
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:13,960
 You need to pay your debts to Chairman Na's, but you desperately don't want to take lessons from me anymore. 

567
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,060
 All right. Then there's only one way. 

568
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:23,760
 Get first place in the Chopin competition. Then, you can stop competing. 

569
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,480
 You don't have to see me if you don't want to either. 

570
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,970
 I'll let you go this time. 

571
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:40,530
 Don't think about anything else, and just focus on playing. Just as I tell you. 

572
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:43,440
 Got it? 

573
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,210
-  This is Reporter Bae Yu Ri from Piano Monthly.   
 -  This is Reporter Kim Hong Ju from Daesong daily. 

574
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:24,180
-  Congratulations.   
 -  Let's have a phone interview.  
 -  When are you available for a call? 

575
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,700
   

576
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,860
 Congratulations, Joon Young! To say you've gotten a second place at the Chopin competition! 

577
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:32,440
 You worked hard.  

578
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,390
   

579
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:39,510
   

580
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,420
 Win the first place at the Chopin competition. 

581
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,120
 Then you won't have to go to any more competition, and you won't need to see me again either. 

582
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:56,190
 Joon Young.  

583
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:00,730
 You still have a lot of concerts booked as a winner of the Chopin competition. 

584
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:02,670
-  Right?  
  - Yes. 

585
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:10,320
 As you perform at those concerts, you might get contacted by even better agencies.  

586
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,990
 Well, I'm not saying the proposition that came from Germany is bad,  

587
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:16,310
 but since it's the first company that contacted you,  

588
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:19,550
 let's be a bit cautious with signing a contract. Okay? 

589
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:22,720
 You can wait for other companies to reach out while you perform some more, and— 

590
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,460
 No.  

591
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,560
 I want to sign the contract with this one.  

592
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,530
 I want to leave quickly. 

593
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:58,290
Cheers!

594
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:00,810
Congrats.

595
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:03,110
Congrats.

596
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:06,160
- It's so fresh! 
 - It's delicious.

597
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,480
I had no idea Dong Yoon even went to business trips to other provinces.

598
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,190
- Why? His business is doing so well. 
 - Really?

599
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,020
You knew I was coming, that's why you're praising me?

600
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,280
- What? 
 - What the?

601
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,910
- It feels awkward. 
 - What the?

602
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:19,520
You said you couldn't come today?

603
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,310
It ended early.

604
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:22,930
Min Su, happy birthday!

605
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,670
Thank you.

606
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:27,350
You're really successful, you even go on business trips?

607
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:29,610
What success?

608
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:30,650
Even just paying my rent is tight.

609
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:33,260
- Song Ah, eat some. 
 - Thanks.

610
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:36,920
By the way, you remember the cake Dong Yoon brought on your birthday?

611
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,240
It was so delicious that I wanted to buy one for my boyfriend, but I gave up.

612
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,250
Eun Ji.

613
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:44,220
You have to place an order something like one week in advance,

614
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,980
and what's worse, you need to go all the way to Jamsil to get the cake.

615
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:50,070
I couldn't, nope.

616
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:56,620
Yeah, Min Seong?

617
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,640
It's Min Seong? Put her on speaker phone.

618
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,110
- Go ahead. 
 - Yeah.

619
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:02,370
Come on.

620
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,120
   

621
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,130
Min Seong—

622
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:08,920
 Chae Song Ah! Why don't you answer your phone? 

623
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,850
Ah, sorry. I put it on silent. You're on speak—

624
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:15,090
 How come someone who's dating puts her phone on silent? 

625
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,460
 You don't get calls from Park Joon Young? 

626
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:24,620
- Park Joon Young? 
  - Uhm, M-Min Seong, y-you were on speaker...

627
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,270
 Oh? On speaker? 

628
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:28,990
 I'm sorry. I'll get there as soon as possible. 

629
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:31,970
 That's why I called. Sorry! 

630
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:34,460
Okay, be safe on your way.

631
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,930
Was she talking about that Park Joon Young?

632
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:41,600
Wait, guys, that is—

633
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,520
- Since when? 
 - Song Ah,

634
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,300
Are you really dating Park Joon Young?

635
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,980
- Yes. It ended up like that. 
 - Incredible!

636
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,160
Amazing!

637
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,890
- How long have you been together? 
 - Why didn't you tell us?

638
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:56,090
It's Min Su's birthday today, guys.

639
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:57,890
- That's not important right now. 
 - How long has it been?

640
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:02,070
   

641
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:09,490
Is Kang Min Seong coming or not? I wanted to see her before leaving.

642
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,120
Yes, Driver?

643
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,680
I'll come out now.

644
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,340
- My taxi is here. I'll get going first. 
 - Okay.

645
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,590
- Bye! 
 - Bye!

646
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:40,290
Let's have a drink.

647
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,110
Okay.

648
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:12,650
Do you know that we haven't drunk together in a really long time?

649
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:18,470
That's right. It's been a really long time.

650
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,120
I can't hold my alcohol well.

651
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:33,040
But still, back in the day, after we were done with our weekly practice,

652
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:39,290
we would chat with the others and have one or two beers.

653
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:44,900
Those times were really nice.

654
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:52,350
But at some point,

655
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:01,860
I started harboring an inner secret I couldn't tell anyone.

656
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:09,630
So out of fear that I might get drunk

657
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:14,020
and reveal my inner feelings,

658
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:19,560
I couldn't drink alcohol with others around.

659
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,580
You know, Dong Yoon.

660
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:40,490
I...

661
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:46,560
I like Joon Young a lot.

662
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:04,970
Is that... your answer?

663
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:12,090
Your answer to my confession...

664
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:18,170
Is it that?

665
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,670
I also...

666
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:32,730
liked you,

667
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,910
For a very long time.

668
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,180
Very much.

669
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:57,200
This was the inner secret that I didn't want to be discovered.

670
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:01,090
But...

671
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:08,660


672
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:22,990
♫  I can't stop remembering all the moments   ♫

673
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,420
M-Min Seong.

674
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:28,600
♫  of when we first met  ♫

675
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:34,000
♫  The memories come pouring out  ♫

676
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,480
♫  Like the stars in the night skies  ♫

677
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,820
   

678
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:44,100
♫  The quiet hours I now have  ♫

679
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:49,200
♫  Are spent staying up and longing for you  ♫

680
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:54,230
♫  The rain makes me feel particularly lonely  ♫

681
00:59:54,230 --> 01:00:01,120
♫  Since you're no longer here, where we used to stay together   ♫

682
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:09,720
♫  I can't stop remembering all the moments  ♫

683
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:14,070
♫   of when we first met  ♫

684
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:19,520
♫  The memories come pouring out  ♫

685
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,000
♫  Like the stars in the night skies  ♫

686
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,400
 You're taking from the students just to get in the professor's good favors. 

687
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,890
 It's a bit disconcerting sight to see.  

688
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:31,770
 I don't want to talk publicly about my family on TV. 

689
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:34,540
 Do you want to live your life living off dust and playing piano alone in some corner? 

690
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:37,020
 - Why did you come? 
 - Min Seong, I'm really sorry. 

691
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,180
 I didn't want to lose you. 

692
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:41,570
 If you aren't busy, just go and practice the accompaniment for Jung Kyung. 

693
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:45,190
 You're uncomfortable right now, aren't you? You will keep being uncomfortable in the future. 

694
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:48,140
 Can I go there? To your place? 

695
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,720
 Because I want to know more about you. 

696
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,510
♫  I wouldn't be able to fully portray its depth  ♫

697
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:56,500
♫  Because you didn't love me  ♫
