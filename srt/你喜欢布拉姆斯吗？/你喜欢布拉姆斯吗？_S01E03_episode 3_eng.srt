1
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:47,010
   
   

2
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,760
   

3
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,210
 I'll pay for these two separately. 

4
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,140


5
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,360
 I, too, was satisfied, because everyone else liked it. 

6
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,310
 Not everyone else... did you like the performance yourself? 

7
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,140
Song Ah!

8
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,400
   

9
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,110
You want a signature?

10
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,500
My signature?

11
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,690
I'm a fan.

12
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,380
Oh come on, you said you didn't like today's performance.

13
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,230
I never said I didn't like it.

14
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,710
I liked today's too, but I just liked yesterday's

15
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,880
just a little, just a tiny bit more is all.

16
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,210
Still, I liked today's performance too. Really.

17
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,740
So after hearing today's performance, you became a fan... and bought this?

18
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,940
Well, that...

19
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,200
Yes, that's right. So please sign this for me. I'm a fan.

20
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,670
Yes. Anything for a fan.

21
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,100
Do you have a pen I could borrow, by chance?

22
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,400
Oh, just one moment.

23
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,500
   

24
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,180
   

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,860
 Song Ah, are you home? 

26
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,260
 I want to drink! 

27
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,980
Song Ah, they don't have a pen. Could I take this with me and give back it to you another time?

28
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,710
Is it okay if I sit here?

29
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,330
O-Of course. Absolutely.

30
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,440
So, during the days I'd go to the bookstore, then seep in some sun walking around the palace.

31
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,310
The palace?

32
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,850
Why not? Gyeonghui Palace is so nice.

33
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,270
You're such an old soul.

34
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,070
I won't deny that.

35
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,310
But, when I occasionally visit Seoul, everything's changed.

36
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,020
Maybe it's because the palace never changes.

37
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,350
I keep thinking of it.

38
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:06,810
I play modern music too, but Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven...

39
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,940
I'm more attracted to this type of music.

40
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,990
Things that don't change and are still alive and well.

41
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,570
It's because people like you keep loving it through the ages

42
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,820
that those things are still alive today.

43
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,440
People like me?

44
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,940
Is that so?

45
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,090
This might sound random, but...

46
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:52,390
do you know what comes to my mind first when I hear "piano competition"?

47
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,140
I wonder...

48
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,930
The pieces you practiced? Or is it the awards ceremonies?

49
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,930
Stillness.

50
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,440
Serenity, like a few moments ago.

51
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,170
When I hear "piano competitions", that's the first thing that comes to mind.

52
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:21,580
This was long ago... when I had my first piano competition overseas.

53
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,040
 All of the competitors stayed in the same hotel. 

54
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,060
 On my first night after arrival, I tried to sleep. 

55
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,930
 But at dawn, the sound of the pianos was so loud it woke me up. 

56
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,570
 They placed a piano in the rooms of all thirty-some competitors, 

57
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,660
 but everyone started practicing at the break of dawn. 

58
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,700
 At first, it was hard to get adjusted. 

59
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:51,490
 But after the first round, the sound of the pianos shrank. 

60
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,760
 The eliminated contestants went home. 

61
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,790
 From that point, I only heard some ten-odd pianos. 

62
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:08,920
 Then a few days later, after the second round concluded, that number shrunk to 6. 

63
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,010
 And on the last day after I finished my finalist performance, 

64
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:17,150
 because I had won first place and attended a congratulations party, I returned to the hotel late at night. 

65
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,970
   

66
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,720
 It was silent. 

67
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,300
 Even until that morning, I'd heard the piano from every room. 

68
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,640
 The night's silence... 

69
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,990
where I could no longer hear any sounds...

70
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,310
was so powerful I can't forget it.

71
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,570
 Are you safely home? 

72
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,330
 I'm in front of my home. Was eating with Song Ah. 

73
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,620
 Come with me to watch the philharmonic orchestra on Saturday. 

74
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,520
 Hyeon Ho is a guest performer there. 

75
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,040
 Okay. 

76
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,320
   

77
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,720
   

78
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,520
 Min Seong, sorry about yesterday. 

79
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,250
  Did you eat with Owner Yoon? 

80
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,850
 Do you want to go see it today? 

81
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,810
 Should I go to your school? 

82
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,710
 Yes... She fainted?! 

83
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,140
The pianist in the philharmonic?

84
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,920
Yes...

85
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,790
So you want to put Joon Young in that place, is that right?

86
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,530
 Ah, yes... 

87
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,160
What should I do?

88
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,830
 Why don't you ask him? 

89
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,950
If I asked him, he'd feel too pressured about it, wouldn't he?

90
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,780
Yes, I understand.

91
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,540
 I can't believe it's from overexertion. It's too sad... 

92
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,510
I heard that pianist does around 120 performances a year.

93
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,660
I heard Master Park Joon Young was at least that good.

94
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,800
 Joon Young is probably closer to 80-90 performances nowadays. 

95
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,060
Even if it's 80-90, that's still a performance every 3-4 days.

96
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,360
In between, you have flights, rehearsals right when you arrive,

97
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,490
then the performance, then VIP reception, album signings, then after going to bed you're awake and back on the road

98
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,810
but peppered in between are interviews and practices for new pieces-

99
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,610
How could anyone not faint after that?

100
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,990
But still, to a rookie who has just made a name for himself with a competition, overwork and exhaustion are a luxury.

101
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,510
 Taking care of yourself should be your own responsibility. 

102
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,980
 But isn't Park Joon Young on his sabbatical? 

103
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,150
I heard he wasn't doing any performances for a year...

104
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,530
Hmm... that's true, but if President Lee requested it, he'd do it.

105
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,800
Even though he's on sabbatical, he promised to perform at the end of the year for our 15th anniversary.

106
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,630
 Did you talk to him? 

107
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,040
Joon Young isn't answering his phone... Ah,

108
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,330
Is Joon Young coming in for practice today?

109
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,100
N-no...

110
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,210
Where did he go?

111
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,530
What to do? There's no time...

112
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,160
 Song Ah 

113
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,910
Yes!

114
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,890
 So... during the day I visit the bookstore 

115
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,180
 then seep in some sun walking around the palace... 

116
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,970
 Why not? Gyeonghui is so nice. 

117
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,220
Yes...

118
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,050
I'm sorry for making you go through that trouble because of me.

119
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,550
I left my phone at home.

120
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,730
It's okay.

121
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,960
 Seung Ji Min is doing it instead? 

122
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,920
 Yeah, he's in the middle of his Japanese Tour... 

123
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,340
 but he's going to make time to do the performance for a day before returning. 

124
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,450
 Holy crap! I better get the tickets first! 

125
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,890
 That's a relief. 

126
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,880
 There were a few tickets left, but  as soon as the report hits, I bet it'll be sold out! 

127
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,060
 Huh... it's sold out. 

128
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,990
- Lies. 
 - It's true!

129
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,120
I guess the rumors have already spread.

130
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,640
 As expected of Seung Ji Min... 

131
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,280
At first, I was disappointed because Joon Young wasn't going to do it... but this is better!

132
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,900
Even if it was Joon Young, the tickets would have sold out just as fast.

133
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,140
Master Park Joon Young... would have done this if it weren't for his sabbatical, right?

134
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:59,040
 - Oh it's not that. This piece is one Joon Young has never played before.   
 - Hmm?

135
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,620
What was that?

136
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,390
Brahms First Concerto.

137
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,090
 Traumerei, please. 

138
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:26,040
 Well, I just overheard you playing this song the other day. 

139
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:36,630
 There comes a moment when one suddenly realizes something. 

140
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:41,940
 Brahms and Clara... 

141
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,660
 Do you like...Brahms? 

142
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,480
 No... I don't like Brahms. 

143
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:04,680
 I guess the theme was unrequited love? 

144
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,310
 No... 

145
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,340
 It's about the friendship among the three. 

146
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,850
I'm back.

147
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,980
You're home?

148
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,730
What's this?

149
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,100
Oh, my mom's friend got me two tickets to the philharmonic orchestra performance tomorrow.

150
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,970
Do you have time for it?

151
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,400
You're going to the lab tomorrow too?

152
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,840
 I don't think it'll work. Hey, let's talk later. 

153
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,060
Hey, Min Seong, are you sick?

154
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,700
Your voice is a little...

155
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,310
 Sorry. 

156
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,330
Uh...

157
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,900
 Owner Yoon, do you want to go to the philharmonic orchestra with me tomorrow? 

158
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,000
 It's at the cultural foundation. 

159
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,740
   

160
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,220
 I saw Park Joon Young earlier in the parking lot. 

161
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,510
 - Park Joon Young? 
 - Yeah. 

162
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,110
 He's in Korea? 

163
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:41,180
 Then, if Seung Ji Min couldn't make it, I guess Park Joon Young would've been here instead? 

164
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,440
 I guess you're right. 

165
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,950
Joon Young, why did you turn down the offer to play today?

166
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,790
Jung Kyung...

167
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,540
 Oh, hello... 

168
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,900
Don't do that.

169
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,880
Why not?

170
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,490
That's discourteous to Ji Min.

171
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,250
Are you okay with people comparing you to Seung Ji Min?

172
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,680
Yeah, it's fine.

173
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,200
- I'm not okay with it. 
 - I said I'm fine.

174
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,780
Is he busy? Won't even pick up the phone...

175
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,500
Pardon me. I'm just passing through here.

176
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,570
Pardon me.

177
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,590
Hello.

178
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,790
Song Ah!

179
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,260
Yes.

180
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,580
   

181
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,000
Thank you very much.

182
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,200
This person... must be late.

183
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,270
Ah... I guess so.

184
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,880
Jung Kyung!

185
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,270
Oh, Song Ah!

186
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,140
- Hello. 
 - Yes, hello.

187
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,330
I'll see you again.

188
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,300
Joon Young, let's go.

189
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,440
- Hey Ji Min. 
 - Joon Young Hyung!

190
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,630
 How long has this been, Hyung? 

191
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,810
 Have you been doing all right? 

192
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,980
 Yes, you two. 

193
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,190
 You two don't need to play today, so go home. 

194
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,860
Wow, I can't believe Dong Yoon's repair shop is the second floor here.

195
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,990
- Owner Yoon eats and sleeps in the workshop upstairs. 
 - Uh huh...

196
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,460
Where did that punk Yoon Dong Yoon go? He even left his lights on.

197
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,270
I wanted to see his face.

198
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,470
Let me try calling him one more time.

199
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,140
Okay.

200
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,830
 I'm so hungry. 

201
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,210
He's not picking up, Owner Yoon. 
    

202
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,450
But why do you call him "Owner Yoon"?

203
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,760
I'm sorry?

204
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,480
Oh, instead of calling him Dong Yoon, you keep calling him "Owner Yoon".

205
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,430
Does everyone else call him that?

206
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,950
She must not be that close to him.

207
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,860
 N-no no! We're close! 

208
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,580
But he is an owner, Dong Yoon.

209
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,380
Yeah of course!

210
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,100
 It's just if everyone else called him that, I thought I'd do it too. 

211
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,800
I'm going to wash my hands.

212
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,550
 - Let me see you out to the front. 
 - No, no no, don't come out. 

213
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,310
 - Min Seong!   
 - Yeah?

214
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,770
 What we did the other night... 

215
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,170
When you and I slept together...

216
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,240
 Hey, don't you know how to control your volume? 

217
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,640
 At any rate, yeah, what about that? 

218
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,400
 Don't tell Song Ah about it. 

219
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,080
 Why would I tell Song Ah that? 

220
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,560
 She keeps scolding us for drinking every day, anyway. 

221
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,610
 I guess you're right? 

222
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,580
 Friend. A guy friend. 

223
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,190
 That is, he's just a friend who's a guy. 

224
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,410
 You call him "Owner Yoon"? 

225
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,740
 I'm sorry? 

226
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,290
 Well, instead of calling him Dong Yoon, you keep calling him "Owner Yoon". 

227
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,810
Anyway, don't tell Song Ah that—

228
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,310
I got it. I'm off.

229
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,710
Ah, Joon Young.

230
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,130
The door wouldn't open...

231
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,430
Ah, that is... I'm sorry, I think I actually

232
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,340
tried to open the door the wrong way.

233
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,700
Ah, I see.

234
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,710
I was going to go upstairs for a bit.

235
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,370
Ah, Song Ah, upstairs...

236
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,070
Dong Yoon has a customer, actually.

237
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,530
I went upstairs just now,

238
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,710
but there was a customer there so I came back down.

239
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,840
A customer?

240
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,850
So that's why he isn't answering his phone.

241
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,210
Ah, thank you.

242
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,390
Thank you.

243
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,840
- You ordered? 
 - Yes.

244
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,490
- Ah, Song Ah. 
 - Yes?

245
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,260
I got a call earlier.

246
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,330
Yoon Dong Yoon!

247
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,870
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

248
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,320
Hi, you're here?

249
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,480
Hey, why didn't you answer Song Ah's calls?

250
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,210
I had a customer.

251
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,090
But wait, Song Ah went upstairs to check if you were there though?

252
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,880
You came upstairs?

253
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,310
Yes. But—

254
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,080
I went to the bathroom,

255
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,440
and then went upstairs to see if you were there, but it looked like you had a customer.

256
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,410
So I just came back down.

257
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,280
You came up?

258
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,860
Yes.

259
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,000
Thank you.

260
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,950
Thank you.

261
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,370
Try it. 
    

262
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,730
What are you thinking about?

263
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,720
What? Nothing,

264
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,430
I was just listening to the music.

265
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:53,690
I like this piece. Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata.

266
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,710
This one is my favorite piece.

267
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,190
I also like it.

268
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,830
What is it? What do you like?

269
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,960
Sorry? Ah, the song that is on right now.

270
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,990
Brahms' Violin Sonata No. 1.

271
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,450
It seems like all violinists like this piece.

272
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,470
You also do, right, Jung Kyung?

273
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,940
I don't exactly like the piece in itself.

274
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,840
It's more because of the background story behind it.

275
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,060
Why? What is the background story?

276
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,050
After Schumann died, Clara raised their children on her own.

277
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:42,670
But the youngest son was very ill and ended up dying.

278
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,720
After hearing the news,

279
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,970
Brahms wrote a short melody for Clara

280
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,840
and sent it to her in a letter.

281
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,290
That's how Brahms' Violin Sonata No. 1 came to be.

282
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,270
So that was Brahms' way of providing comfort and consolidation.

283
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,530
Through music, rather than words.

284
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,500
But wouldn't it have been better

285
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,700
for him to go comfort her in person?

286
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,480
If Brahms were one to take actions like that, he would have been with Clara from the beginning.

287
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,010
That's true.

288
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:15,110
For Brahms, music must have been more comfortable than words.

289
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,110
Like Joon Young.

290
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,780
Me?

291
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,130
What about me?

292
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,530
But...

293
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,890
Do you think music can really bring comfort?

294
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,190
Like Hyeon Ho said,

295
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,420
when you are really sad and having a hard time,

296
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,640
I think even just one word might feel more supportive.

297
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,910
But still,

298
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,260
shouldn't we believe it?

299
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,380
That music can be a source of comfort.

300
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,040
Because...

301
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,820
We have chosen to do music, after all.

302
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,940
- You'll ride in the back? 
 - Yes. Because of the cello.

303
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,330
See you next time, Song Ah.

304
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,280
Ah, yes. Be safe on your way back.

305
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,690
Song Ah, you need to come get your violin.

306
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,220
Ah right! Yes.

307
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,730
I'm off. Song Ah, I'll see you next time.

308
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,790
Yes, be safe on your way back.

309
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,150
Why don't you call a taxi?

310
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,020
I want to walk back.

311
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,660
Go in.

312
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,940
- Should we get going? 
 - Sure.

313
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,130
- Here. 
 - Ooh.

314
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,550
I'll clean it for you.

315
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,150
Okay.

316
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,520
Ah right! Did you meet Min Seong the other day?

317
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,070
Min Seong?

318
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,150
Yeah.

319
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:40,250
She called me at night to go out for drinks.

320
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:45,090
But I was working overtime so I told her to call you instead.

321
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,190
Ah.

322
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,950
That night?

323
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,040
Yeah.

324
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,850
I knew it.

325
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,760
But by the way, Min Seong seems to be a bit ill.

326
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,970
Does she?

327
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,060
You two drank a lot that night, didn't you?

328
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,130
So Min Seong got a hangover, is that it?

329
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,760
No, we didn't drink much then.

330
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,310
Clean it and give it back, hurry up.

331
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,030
What? Ah.

332
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,480
Yeah.

333
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,350
Thank you.

334
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,980
Are you doing well?

335
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,480
I'm well, thanks to your attentiveness.

336
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,800
Thank you.

337
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,750
Goodness, that "Thank you" again.

338
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,070
Do you have any particular plan while you rest?

339
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:53,680
No, for now, I'm just planning on going back to university to graduate.

340
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,540
Are you seeing anyone?

341
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,410
No, I'm not.

342
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,920
And do you have someone in your heart?

343
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,030
No.

344
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,160
 Tomorrow is Song Ah's birthday! Let's meet up in the afternoon! 

345
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,990
 Good, good. Song Ah, Happy Birthday in advance. 

346
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,100
Oh, hello.

347
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,650
- Are you on your way somewhere? 
 - Yes.

348
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,910
- Are you back from somewhere? 
 - Yes.

349
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,220
I'm sorry, just a minute.

350
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,090
  Let's meet when Song Ah gets off work.   
  Where? At Dong Yoon's, first floor?  

351
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,430
I'm sorry, my friend was asking something.

352
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,270
Ah, Dong Yoon?

353
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,700
Sorry?

354
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,580
No. Why the sudden mention of Dong Yoon?

355
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,700
It's because he's the only friend of yours I know of.

356
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,760
I have many other friends besides Owner Yoon.

357
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,480
But it's true that I'm closest to him.

358
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,280
When I was preparing the College of Music examination, he gave me violin lessons.

359
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,820
Have you eaten?

360
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,680
Yes. What about you?

361
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,350
Ah well, here...

362
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,310
Then I'll see you next time.

363
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,160
Yes, see you next time.

364
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,780
So Kyunghoo Cards wants to hold a talk concert

365
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,110
with Joon Young?

366
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,760
At Korea Fine Arts Middle School?

367
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,190
Yes.

368
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,880
It'd be better if they just asked him to come and play the piano.

369
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,460
Why a talk concert?

370
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:16,200
Well the thing is... the audience feedback is that most have already seen Park Joon Young's performances many times

371
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,160
and to be frank, his tickets have gotten a lot easier to get compared to a few years ago,

372
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,960
so even if you were to host a private concert,

373
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:31,720
the merit of it would be tiny. At any rate, Seung Ji Min is more mainstream nowadays.

374
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,590
 That is true... 

375
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,280
 Honestly, Joon Young used to not even own a piano, 

376
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,850
so Director Lee send him her daughter's piano.

377
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,090
There's a lot to talk about.

378
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,060
 Oh, you mean the piano in the living room? 

379
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,020
 Yeah that one! Park Joon Young's competitive edge is just that. 

380
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:56,750
The reality is... that he's just outperformed by Seung Ji Min... in everything else.

381
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,750
Others wish they had something to sell.

382
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,790
He needs only to sell his life story, how great is that!

383
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,260
You have his father who keeps running into trouble with money.

384
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,260
Trying to pay off his family debt with the reward money from the piano competitions.

385
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,120
- Overcoming that past... 
 - That past...

386
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:23,650
didn't end in the past, but is a continuation of the present story. That's the problem.

387
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,460
Just accept this as an unfortunate fact of the present.

388
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,840
- But we're just talking about th- 
 - Park Joon Young, as a result of his sabbatical...

389
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,550
will not perform in any concerts with exception to the end of the year 15th-anniversary concert for the foundation.

390
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,470
Here's the list of the judges.

391
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:47,380
Would I understand it if I saw it? I trust that you curated it well enough.

392
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,170
But keep Jung Kyung out of it.

393
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:56,840
She has too little experience to be one of our judges.

394
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,380
She might have been extremely skillful when she was young, but that is in the past.

395
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:07,550
Though I may know nothing else, I at least know that. You should know this as well.

396
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:17,100
But seeing how you gave me that list with her name included,

397
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,270
must be because you hoped I'd simplify this for you.

398
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:29,170
Jung Kyung is returning to work now, so the foundation will have to determine how to treat her.

399
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,930
Did you want my input on that?

400
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,920
Forgive me.

401
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,790
Team Leader Cha.

402
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,520
You've worked with me for 15 years, yet do you still not know me?

403
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,800
If you want to know my thoughts, then ask me directly, not in this roundabout fashion.

404
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,650
I'm sorry.

405
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,300
So... about Masters Han Hyeon Ho and Lee Jung Kyung...

406
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:12,150
Not Master Lee Jung Kyung but Director Lee Jung Kyung. She's the director of our foundation.

407
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:16,880
Of course. Director Lee Jung Kyung. The director of our foundation, Director Lee!

408
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,140
That's better.

409
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,350
Those two have been together for a while. Do you think they'll get married?

410
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,720
Well...?

411
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:28,050
At the longest, they'll conclude what'll happen within this year.

412
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:32,800
 What was that? Conclude? Or Marriage? 

413
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:38,250
 Con-clude...conclude. 

414
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,300
Marriage is an undeniable reality.

415
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,310
They were students up until now

416
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,810
so it's easy to like each other. But they're done studying now.

417
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,180
Of course, they'll break up.

418
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:57,060
At any rate, as long as they break up after the end of the year performance, I don't care.

419
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,850
Wow, you're such a jerk, Section Chief!

420
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:08,840
What the...now, look here. If they break up before our performance, what'll happen?

421
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,060
Even if so, it'll be fine if Master Han Hyeon Ho doesn't play.

422
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:18,040
N...no. Now let's look at this again.

423
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,790
Joon Young has to perform then.

424
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,190
But if the three are best friends, and two of them break up...

425
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,630
Joon Young has to perform with at least one of them... why isn't my finger moving?

426
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,610
He has to perform with at least one of the two...

427
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:35,330
Do you think he'd feel at ease about that? So all three are in an awkward situation.

428
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:39,180
That's why you can't date colleagues in a work setting.

429
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,970
 And do you have anyone you like? 

430
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:09,370
Of course, we're well aware that you're on your sabbatical.

431
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,270
Still you're playing for my found...I mean

432
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,450
our foundation, aren't you?

433
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:20,080
That's why we're hoping you'd consider this

434
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,380
just another exemption to that rule... Hmm?

435
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:30,140
Sorry if that complicates this. I feel bad about making this request.

436
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,200
I won't mince words. President Lee...

437
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,380
if you said you'd do it, she wouldn't express it, but she'd surely be overjoyed.

438
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:47,920
Even though she is the former Group's former Chairwoman, and her son-in-law is the current Chairman...

439
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,250
Honestly at the end of every fiscal year, when you have to go around visiting the chairman, all the directors of the board

440
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:56,280
apologetically getting the budget proposals from everyone...

441
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:02,430
It isn't easy in the end...truly.

442
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:12,640
So...what happens if you qualify for an orchestra in the States and Jung Kyung becomes a professor at Seoryeong?

443
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,550
Well for me...

444
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,420
I'd have to fly over every chance I could get to see her.

445
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,980
What are you talking about?

446
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,140
Since your girlfriend is rich, as long as you get a monthly stipend, you'd what, scatter the money in the skies?

447
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,010
That's not true.

448
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,900
I know, I know.

449
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:34,490
Noona, you know that my family spent all of their money to support my playing the cello, right?

450
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:39,800
I have to make a lot of money...the pay for the American orchestra is pretty good!

451
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,760
All right!

452
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,100
I will pray that you get accepted so you can spray your money to the planes!

453
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:57,940
American domestic flights always get delayed. It drove me nuts when I was trying out for auditions!

454
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,600
I mean even Joon Young's New York performance last month...I missed it because of that reason!

455
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,350
- Yeah, I heard about that. At least Jung Kyung got to see it. 
 - That's what I'm saying...

456
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,470
- Jung Kyung? 
 - Yeah.

457
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,260
Jung Kyung went to see it, didn't she? Joon Young's performance.

458
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:24,730
It's me. If we can get him to sign on for this...

459
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,890
don't forget your promise, okay? You mustn't.

460
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,340
Jung Kyung saw Joon Young in New York. She said so.

461
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:39,530
 Ah, come to think of it, it's been a long time since you last saw Jung Kyung, right? 

462
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,990
 Did Joon Young say that? 

463
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,630
 That I didn't go to his performance? 

464
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,940
Ah, yeah you're right...

465
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,490
Excuse me? Could we get the dessert menu, please?

466
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,230
 Our final song, composed to comfort Clara... 

467
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:20,060
 is Brahms Violin Sonata No. 1 

468
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,720
 Please enjoy a peaceful rest of the evening. 

469
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,280
   

470
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:53,770
   

471
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,530
 Could music truly be... 

472
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,870
 a source of comfort? 

473
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:14,400
  For me... 
 ♫ Stay with me, close to me  ♫ 

474
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,300
 I always thought I had to believe this. 

475
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:24,470
♫   Stay with me, lean on me   ♫

476
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,120
  However...  

477
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,460
♫   You've always been my side   ♫

478
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,250
 I can't actually recall a moment...  
 ♫   You've always been my side   ♫

479
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,450
♫   You comforted me   ♫

480
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,920
  when music has comforted me.  
♫   You comforted me   ♫

481
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,680
♫   I can't believe   ♫

482
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,100
  All I can remember...  
♫   I can't believe   ♫

483
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,130
   

484
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,830
  are the moments when...  
    

485
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:49,510
  my one-sided love was hurt. 

486
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:53,870
♫   Stay by my side forever   ♫

487
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:58,260
    
 ♫   Even if it's for just a day   ♫

488
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:03,190
♫   Even if it's for just a day   ♫

489
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:10,170
♫   I can't bear not being with you, it's you   ♫

490
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:14,560
    
 ♫  I'll wait for you  ♫

491
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,840
♫   My only reason is you    ♫

492
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:25,060
♫   Even if it's just   ♫

493
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,390
♫  for a day   ♫

494
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,310
   

495
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:36,790
♫   I can't spend it without you. Still, it's you.   ♫

496
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,360
 The Chairman left it here. 

497
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,020
 I took care of it as best as I could, but... 

498
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,850
Yes. Be it flowers or people,

499
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:51,530
it's natural for both to wilt and fade over time.

500
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:54,760
How could anyone stop that?

501
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:03,580
He always schedules a business trip around this time.

502
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:08,080
A young man brought that this morning.

503
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,050
 I asked him his name, but he wouldn't answer. 

504
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,680
 Did Joon Young tell you that he would come here?  

505
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,940
No.

506
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,020
He isn't the type to tell others about things like this.

507
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,650
Then what type is he?

508
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:48,000
He's someone who is more comfortable with music than words.

509
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:56,870
   

510
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,340
 I'll come this evening.  

511
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,820
 Wow! Then see you later!  

512
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,570
Song Ah, could you help me out for a bit?

513
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,570
Yes.

514
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:19,830
One, two, three, four!

515
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,800
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

516
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,800

517

519
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,580
Thank you!

520
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,770
How did you know?

521
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,440
What do you think?

522
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,730
Happy birthday, Song Ah.

523
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:41,020
Thank you.

524
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,500
Thank you.

525
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:51,730
   

526
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,990
 I was going to send the piano to Berlin, but they declined.  

527
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:37,320
 So I brought it home.  

528
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:46,890
 Jung Kyung was attending The Julliard School in the USA, and recently transferred schools to South Korea.  

529
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,490
 Her specialty is the violin.  

530
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:52,150
 She has been living in the USA since she was six, so she probably doesn't know much about the customs here.  

531
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,020
 Please help her, all of you.  

532
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,220
 It's Brahms.  

533
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:50,220
 Could you play another piece?  

534
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,540
 Which one?  

535
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:59,630
 Anything.  

536
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:07,980
   

537
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,560
 Why this piece?  

538
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:10,540
 My name comes from a moment in this piece, "Scenes from Childhood". 

539
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:15,630
 Because my mom liked this piece the most.  

540
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,640
 She used to play it often for me.  

541
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,970
 Next time,  

542
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:33,570
 I'll play it for you again.  

543
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,790
 So don't cry.  

544
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,450
   

545
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,960
   

546
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:02,210
 Listen carefully. 

547
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,690
 Since I won't play it ever again. 

548
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,740
    

549
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,240
Happy Birthday, Song Ah!

550
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,640
Thank you.

551
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,730
You aren't leaving, Song Ah? I thought you said you had something planned tonight.

552
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:30,360
I still have some time.

553
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,630
Then I'll take my leave first.

554
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:36,530
Team Leader, can I use the rehearsal room to practice for a bit, then?

555
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,070
Of course.

556
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,500
Thank you, see you tomorrow.

557
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,690
Have fun!

558
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:43,150
Yes, goodbye!

559
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:48,600
I'll just practice for ten minutes and go.

560
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:56,590
Yes, Min Seong. Where are you?

561
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,470
Now?

562
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:07,820
- Min Seong! 
 - Song Ah!

563
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,060
You came early.

564
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,980
Happy Birthday, Song Ah.

565
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,970
Thank you. But why did you come this early?

566
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,480
- Uhm, that is... 
 - Yes?

567
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,600
I don't think I'll be able to come to your birthday party.

568
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,050
Really?

569
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:29,210
Why, suddenly? Owner Yoon said he would come, too.

570
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,830
I know, right? Sorry.

571
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:38,340
But I still came to give you your present. Tada.

572
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,730
Thank you, Min Seong.

573
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:01,500
Min Seong. Are you crying?

574
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,910
I know, why am I crying?

575
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:09,990
What's going on? Is something the matter?

576
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,570
- Song Ah. 
 - Yes.

577
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:22,190
Actually... Yoon Dong Yoon and I...

578
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,030
We spent the night together. We were drunk.

579
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:35,970
It was accidental. Just a mishap.

580
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,760
There's nothing we can do about an accident.

581
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,100
I'm not saying we should do something. But Yoon Dong Yoon called me a past he is ashamed of.

582
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:49,370
Both dating me back then, and sleeping with me this time, all of it.

583
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:09,300
It must have been the alcohol speaking. Don't take it to heart.

584
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,000
No.

585
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,880
We hadn't drunk on the day he said that.

586
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,500
On the night we slept together, we were so muddled that we just parted.

587
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,610
So on that day, the day you asked to go to the Philharmonic Orchestra's concert together,

588
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:25,930
I went to his workshop in the evening,

589
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:29,090
and I was planning on sorting things out with him.

590
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:31,210
I knew you'd be at the Arts Center,

591
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:35,150
so I was going to see you and tell you everything.

592
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:39,910
But then Yoon Dong Yoon said we should pretend nothing happened,

593
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:42,620
and I was suddenly unable to think properly.

594
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:46,150
So I couldn't even bring myself to tell you.

595
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,100
Yoon Dong Yoon, you mean jerk!

596
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:54,800
How can you be so clueless about someone's feelings?

597
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,590
Right? Yoon Dong Yoon is mean, right?

598
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,650
He is, isn't he?

599
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:12,840
Dong Yoon is mean. He doesn't know people's feelings.

600
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:12,520
   

601
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:16,610
   

602
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,470
 So on that day, the day you asked to go to the Philharmonic Orchestra's concert together, 

603
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:22,950
 I went to his workshop in the evening... 

604
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,890
 I'll go check upstairs.  

605
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:28,560
 He isn't answering his phone at all.  

606
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,830
♫  If you can be happy, that's enough.  ♫

607
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:39,470
♫  While watching your shrinking figure,  ♫

608
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:41,690
♫   I can't bring myself   ♫

609
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,870
-  Ah, Song Ah, uhm... 
 - Yes?  

610
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:48,490
 Upstairs... Dong Yoon has a guest, actually.  

611
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:56,810
♫   These tears that have gotten cold cannot be considered part of our farewell  ♫

612
00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:02,710
♫   Come back to me a bit less late.   ♫

613
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:11,460
♫   Even these tears that are falling will become   ♫

614
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,360
♫   part of my last farewell to you, be well.    ♫

615
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:19,030
Yes?

616
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:32,950
 I left my instrument here. 

617
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:36,020
I see.

618
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:49,360
The string snapped. I didn't touch the violin, though.

619
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,960
I see. I know.

620
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:20,580
I'll just ask you one thing.

621
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:28,710
On that day, the day we went to Intermission after the Philharmonic Orchestra's concert.

622
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:35,630
You prevented me from coming out of the room on purpose. Am I right?

623
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:46,040
Who was the guest who was in Dong Yoon's workshop that day?

624
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,890
Song Ah...

625
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:52,850
You don't have to answer that.

626
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:01,790
It's just that... I feel so much like a fool, that's why.

627
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:08,210
I acted foolishly all by myself in front of you.

628
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,560
I'm sorry.

629
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,430
What happened that day isn't something you should be sorry for.

630
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:29,630
However... Please don't do that next time.

631
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:35,360
I never asked you to cover my eyes for me.

632
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:43,210
Even more than getting hurt... I hate it when I feel like a fool.

633
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:49,350
So if something like that happens again,

634
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:52,830
please let things be.

635
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,850
I'll clean things up and get out right away.

636
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,650
Can you please...

637
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:28,680
not play Moonlight Sonata?

638
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:42,350
It's a piece I like a lot.

639
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,010
So I don't want to listen to it right now.

640
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,750
Can you please...

641
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:43,200
 I said that music can comfort us,  

642
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:48,750
 but I couldn't recall a time when I received comfort 

643
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:51,630
 from music.  
    

644
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,560
 But... 

645
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:00,750
 on that day, I knew.  

646
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,170
 Because of this person who reached out through music 

647
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:12,000
  before using words. 

648
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:20,540
Would you like to be friends?

649
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:29,180


650
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:32,950
No.

651
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,350
We have to be friends.

652
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:43,080
Because...
♫   At the end of this road I've traveled multiple times   ♫

653
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:51,390
♫   your presence brings me joy. Even now, I'm happy.  ♫

654
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:52,240
♫   This road that has grown familiar to us   ♫

655
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:58,880
I'm doing this as a friend.
♫   So this road that has grown familiar to us   ♫

656
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,650
  If one day,  
♫   won't change,   ♫

657
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:07,700
  comes a time when I need to be comforted again,  
♫   please stay for me   ♫

658
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,580
♫   By my side, love   ♫

659
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:15,470
♫   I see your deep moonlight in my dreams   ♫

660
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:18,700
 then I will be reminded  
♫   I see your deep moonlight in my dreams   ♫

661
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,450
♫   Even though I've seen your sky so many times, it still makes me happy   ♫

662
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:26,360
 of this very moment. 
♫   Even though I've seen your sky so many times,  ♫

663
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,540
♫   it still makes me happy   ♫

664
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:33,250
 On that night,  
♫   You're always like a dream to me   ♫

665
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,860
  I realized that even though I'll keep 

666
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:40,620
♫   You're already enough   ♫

667
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:44,060
  on getting hurt over and over,  

668
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,130
♫   My deep emotions move towards you   ♫​

669
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:48,200
 I will still continue to love.  

670
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:55,470
♫   Even though I've seen your sky so many times,    ♫

671
01:00:55,470 --> 01:01:04,550
♫  it still makes me happy. You're always like a dream to me.  ♫

672
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:08,910
♫   You're already enough   ♫

673
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:11,480
♫   After another long time passes   ♫

674
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,370
   

675
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:18,110
♫   I hope the person holding my hand is you   ♫​

676
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:24,290
♫   If we may be together   ♫​

677
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:24,930
 I'll take you there.  

678
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:26,200
 Do you know Song Ah?  

679
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,050
 That is... 

680
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,490
 We are friends.  

681
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,040
 Amazing, you're friends with such a well-known person?  

682
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,160
 Think only of yourself. Don't be concerned about others.  

683
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,730
 Joon Young, I'm thinking of getting married.  

684
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:37,810
 But isn't it that you can't play Brahms, rather than just not wanting to?  

685
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,130
 Brahms is so similar to you.  

686
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:40,680
 What's going on with you and Jung Kyung?  

687
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,330
 Let's talk.  

688
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,230
 I don't like you very much these days.  

689
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:45,740
 Song Ah. Do you want to eat together today?  

690
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,780
 This thought suddenly came to mind.  

691
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:53,100
 That I should see you. That if I see you, I'll feel better.  

692
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:57,610
 Song Ah, should we... 

693
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:59,810
♫   You're already enough   ♫
