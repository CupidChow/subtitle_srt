1
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,670
 Now, shall we take some questions from our underclassmen? 

2
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,290
Yes?

3
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,500
What do you do when you don't want to practice?

4
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,220
  (Laughing)  

5
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,790
I also hate it.

6
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,830
Yes, for me...

7
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,160
I put in a lot of effort,

8
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,110
but I feel that I can't keep up with those who are naturally gifted.

9
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,110
  Do you believe that working hard... 

10
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,020
will be enough to beat

11
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,690
even those who are born with talent?

12
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,290
Unfortunately, music...

13
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,800
is a study that definitely favors those born with talent.

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,690
However...

15
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:43,050
I believe the ability to dream is the greatest talent of all.

16
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,940
If you add effort on top of that talent, I believe you will definitely achieve your dreams.

17
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,390
 Now, unfortunately we've come to the point 

18
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,010
where we must conclude our talk concert.

19
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,260
 - No! 
  - Don't go! 

20
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,210
 I'm also sad. 

21
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,690
 But looking forward to our next meeting, 

22
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,910
 Park Joon Young has agreed 

23
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,910
to play one piece for you all.

24
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,190
What  is the name of that piece?

25
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,300
 What should I play that day? 

26
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,730
 Is there anything you want to hear? 

27
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,710
 Träumerei. 

28
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,760
 I think 

29
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,730
 that music belongs to the listeners. 

30
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,370
 Even the same song means different things to different people. 

31
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,730
 When I listen to your Träumerei  

32
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,310
 I think of my dreams. 

33
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,870
 That's why I want to hear it again. 

34
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,490
 Your Träumerei. 

35
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,880
 Schumann's piano song. "Scenes from Childhood: Träumerei." 

36
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,760
I'll play Chopin's Ballade No. 3.

37
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,910
   

38
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,590
All right, here we go...1, 2, 3!

39
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,120
 Yes! Looks good! 

40
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,800
- Thank you for... the piano. 
 - Ah.

41
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,700
Not a problem.

42
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,720
How did you know about this?

43
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,770
Was this something I shouldn't know about?

44
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,390
 Ah! Miss Chae Song Ah? 

45
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,210
Could you help with cleaning up outside?

46
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,740
Ah, yes, yes.

47
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,850
Just a moment.

48
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,020
That goes in the basement, okay?

49
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,700
 Why did you come here? 

50
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,330
 This event... 

51
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,930
was supposed to be for a good cause.

52
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,400
Everyone is feeling pressured because of your involvement.

53
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,040
I did it on purpose.

54
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,780
It felt like they were looking down on you.

55
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,390
I wanted them to be uncomfortable around you.

56
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,220
Who am I that anyone would feel that way?

57
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,780
They're all uncomfortable because it's you.

58
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,470
Let's go.

59
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,870
I wanted to hear it.

60
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,470
Träumerei.

61
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,470
When you said you'd never play it again...

62
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,980
those words hurt so much.

63
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,540
Träumerei is...

64
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,210
merely one piano song among countless others.

65
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,050
And that is all.

66
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,380
There's no pain from not playing it.

67
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,150
And nothing would change from playing it.

68
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,150
So it has no meaning?

69
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,820
To you?

70
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,690
Not anymore.

71
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,830
Why not?

72
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,440
Why does it have no meaning anymore?

73
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,080
Because there can't be.

74
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,200
There can't be meaning...

75
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,640
in the relationship between you and me.

76
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,240
For the longest time

77
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,830
that song—

78
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,790
no, you...

79
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,580
held a lot of meaning to me.

80
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,450
When I said those words, I imagined and reimagined...

81
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,900
what your expression would be,

82
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,650
what you would say...

83
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,170
hundreds of times

84
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,330
by myself.

85
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,170
But Jung Kyung...

86
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,980
I love you.

87
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,340
No.

88
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,840
I already asked you.

89
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,520
I requested this of you, didn't I?

90
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,020
I will break up with him.

91
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,610
- What? 
 - I know you can't hurt anyone.

92
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,090
I'll do it.

93
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,680
I will hurt

94
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,580
and I will cry.

95
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,490
You love me too.

96
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,260
Don't go.

97
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,290
- I said don't leave!
- Don't follow me.

98
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,270
Bear it.

99
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,400
Because I also bore it.

100
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,350
So you bear it too.

101
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,940
Song Ah!

102
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,110
If you're done, you should leave.

103
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,580
Yes.

104
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:54,290
   
   

105
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,050
Thank you for your hard work.

106
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,490
Oh it's no problem at all.

107
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,780
Have a safe trip!

108
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,640
Thank you for your hard work.

109
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,860
You really worked hard today.

110
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,810
You too.

111
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:46,180
To be honest, I lost some self-confidence coming to this school.

112
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,330
They're just barely teenage middle schoolers,

113
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,840
but they looked so cool.

114
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,770
Everyone running relentlessly towards their dreams.

115
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,550
At any rate, I think it's a blessing...

116
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,510
to have talents.

117
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,790
I'm quite... envious.

118
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,950
To not have talents...

119
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,200
is the actual blessing.

120
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,370
I'm sorry?

121
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,980
If I also had no talent...

122
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,000
if that were true...

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,350
I get the thought...

124
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,180
that everything would be better, quite often.

125
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,680
Joon Young...

126
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,010
Didn't you hear what the students said before?

127
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,670
Even if you love it and try hard, do you know

128
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,790
how many people struggle because they lack or simply don't have any talent?

129
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,580
Not everyone has talent like you.

130
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,390
Were you saying all that about dreaming being the biggest talent,

131
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,020
saying that dreaming and trying hard

132
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,590
would help you achieve your dreams,

133
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,900
when you don't even know what it means to have no talent?

134
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:21,310
Do you know how it feels to not have talent?

135
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:05,950
 What? You're applying to a music school instead of getting a job? 

136
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,400
 She's crazy... 

137
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,520
 I'm not crazy. 

138
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,400
 I thought about really sincerely. 

139
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:20,500
 Song Ah, I'm asking you this because I don't know a lot about this but...  

140
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,500
 Are you talented at playing the violin? 

141
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,200
 Are you talented at playing the violin? 

142
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,800
 Then, you shouldn't have been in last place! 

143
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,260
 It's a blessing to not have talent. 

144
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,080
 I didn't even dare  

145
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,140
 to wish or dream for that much talent... 

146
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,670
 I have this thought once in a while. 

147
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,540
 What did I do so wrong in my past life 

148
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,660
 that I'm living like this... 

149
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,640
 But why 

150
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:21,410
 do you, who achieved my dream with that talent, look so unhappy? 

151
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:27,160
 Is is that you've never  

152
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,280
 loved your own talent? 

153
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:37,520
♫   I guess you can't express everything with love    ♫

154
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:44,530
♫   Those words of yours make me sad   ♫

155
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,610
♫   You're leaving like this, but   ♫

156
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,530
♫   if you can be happy,  ♫

157
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,610
♫  that's enough for me.  ♫

158
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,840
   

159
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,170
♫   While watching your shrinking figure,  ♫

160
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,990
♫   I can't bring myself   ♫

161
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:13,150
♫  to ask you to wait for me   ♫

162
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:17,840
♫   Even these tears that are falling  ♫

163
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,850
♫   will become   ♫

164
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:30,570
♫   part of my last farewell to you, take care.    ♫

165
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,750
   

166
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,550
   

167
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,820
I heard Jo Su An's dad is the CEO of Jo and Jung law firm.

168
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,370
It must be nice to be born with a silver spoon in your mouth.

169
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:47,280
She's a college student and a Seoryeong University professor is her accompaniest.

170
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,010
They have their silver spoons and they're smart too.

171
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,710
It's a good thing to get acquainted with Professer Yoo.

172
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:58,200
Look how well Park Joon Young ended up. Professor Yoo is super talented.

173
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,940
Our Master Park Joon Young is born to be a genius

174
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,070
but Professor Yoons skill is a little less, isn't it?

175
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,960
When Joon Young was admitted to the Arts Middle School, he took a piano test.

176
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,090
He ranked in the 10s among 50-60 applicants.

177
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,460
He was normal.

178
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,970
No way...

179
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,430
 Because you're a freelancer, a loan on credit won't be possible. 

180
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,020
   

181
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,850
Hey, Joon Young!

182
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,750
It is you, isn't it?

183
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,340
Wow... how long has it been? How have you been doing?

184
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,620
This is our intern Kim Hae Na, who is going to help us with  the performance today.

185
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,730
You know her well, don't you?

186
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,510
Yes. Oh my. You're interning here?

187
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,330
What? Oh... yeah.

188
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,750
Oh...

189
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,170
In an Arts middle school, it's not easy to be noticed when you're from a poor family.

190
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:56,280
Plus, Joon Young isn't the type to make himself stand out just to survive on his own.

191
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,420
But Professor Yoo saw Joon Young's talent from the start.

192
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,210
Well, the first time they met was coincidentally through our foundation

193
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:09,420
but from then on he swept all competitions and even won second place at the Chopin contest in the end.

194
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:14,050
That's why your teacher is important.

195
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,140
Joon Young's teacher since middle school has been Professor Yoo Tae Jin alone.

196
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,230
They must be really close.

197
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,950
 You've been doing well, yourself, haven't you? 

198
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,750
I mean... yeah of course.

199
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,620
I did an accompaniment in LA and I just got back.

200
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,580
I heard you're taking a break for a year.

201
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,520
Oh, yes.

202
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,860
Oh, I'm performing at Kyunghoo today.

203
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,840
- I'm the accompaniment for attorney Jo Jin Cheol's daughter's recital. 
 - I see.

204
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,150
You know attorney Jo well, don't you? He did you a huge favor back in the day.

205
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,180
Then you should come by to give him your regards, right?

206
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm going to get going. I'll see you later.

207
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,040
At least try to maintain a poker face... you jerk.

208
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,370
I heard Jung Kyung applied to Seoryeong University.

209
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,530
Of course... Lee Jung Kyung is on a different level.

210
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,860
How can you know everything when you don't even play?

211
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,680
You know how quickly word travels in this industry.

212
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:19,200
You and Jung Kyung's relationship is like a fairy tale.

213
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,850
Is the ending ... a male Cinderella?

214
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,480
I don't want to be a Cinderella.

215
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,650
It's a joke, a joke.

216
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,090
- What's the matter? 
 - What?

217
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,290
Your cello. What's wrong with it?

218
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,210
Do you have another customer after me?

219
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,870
   

220
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,380
   

221
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,790
   

222
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,680
Yeah, Jung Kyung?

223
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,240
What?

224
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,590
Yes, so I'll come to the performance alone today.

225
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,820
Please don't worry too much. She'll be fine after she gets some rest.

226
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,890
Oh... okay. Got it.

227
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,190
I'll see you later. Thanks.

228
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,940
Yeah, Joon Young?

229
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,630
Today?

230
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,660
There aren't any tickets anyway. Mr. Jo bought all the leftover tickets.

231
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,580
Oh... Never mind.

232
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,860
But why did you stop playing? You were good.

233
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,050
You were the one who was good, man. Are you making fun of me?

234
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,620
It's a qualification to be in Seoryeong University.

235
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:51,140
During middle school and high school , I was busy with competitions , performance tests and exams.

236
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,060
Since I was there, I just kept doing it.

237
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,940
But once I got to college, I didn't want to practice anymore.

238
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,680
 I think I was like that for about two or three months? 

239
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,310
 Suddenly, I could hear someone playing the violin somewhere. 

240
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,180
   

241
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,130
   

242
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:16,680
 She wasn't good, but she was trying so hard. 

243
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,000
 She said she did it since elementary school as a hobby. 

244
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,210
I asked her later

245
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,720
why she worked so hard.

246
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,120
And?

247
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,130
She said she likes it, the violin.

248
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,460
 Because I like it. 

249
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:43,950
 I keep wanting to do it and I want to do well. 

250
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,400
 She wanted to keep doing it and do it well. 

251
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,020
 That's when I knew 

252
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,240
 that I just  

253
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,140
 liked the violin moderately. 

254
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,540
I tried to love it like she did

255
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,750
but it didn't work.

256
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,890
That's why I quit the violin.

257
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,100
But still, quitting is pretty hard.

258
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,220
You were pretty courageous.

259
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,280
This work

260
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,500
is fun.

261
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,480
As I do it, I want to do well

262
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,880
and I want to be the best.

263
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,050
And I want to do it forever.

264
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:49,010
Do you know the feeling of your heart thumping even at the thought of something?

265
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,420
I do...

266
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,090
Yeah, it's that!

267
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,880
What?

268
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,670
I'm not especially courageous.

269
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,240
It's just...

270
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,720
that's all there is.

271
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,750
My heart reacts, so what can I do? I just have to go for it.

272
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,930
Hello.

273
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,820
 What is your name? 

274
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,190
Here is a program book for you. Enjoy the show.

275
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,320
 Yes, thank you very much. 

276
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,270
Here's a program boo--

277
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,070
Hello.

278
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,980
Hello.

279
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,250
The tickets are here...

280
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,250
I have one.

281
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,410
Have you been doing well?

282
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,330
Yes...

283
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,840
Oh, here...

284
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,350
Joon Young, you're here! Come here for a second.

285
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,130
Here's a program book for you.

286
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,990
You reviewed Joon Young's management contract for him.

287
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,630
Can you believe that was seven years ago?

288
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,560
Since he moved to Berlin right after that.

289
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,700
Wow... time flies.

290
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,620
Our Soo Wan went to every performance Joon Young had in New York.

291
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,330
Oh my!

292
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,370
You should give her your regards and take a photo with her.

293
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,440
Of course.

294
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,070
Let's also have a meal together.

295
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,800
Team Leader!

296
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,820
Team Leader... Soo Wan...

297
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,740
said she didn't bring her performance heels.

298
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,390
Oh my. What are we going to do? She wore slippers here.

299
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,700
What can we do? Is there a place in the area that sells heels?

300
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,250
There aren't any...

301
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,230
What's her shoe size?

302
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,490
230.

303
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,810
I wear a 230!

304
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,150
You can't see them when I'm standing so...

305
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,370
I think these will work.

306
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,550
That's a relief.

307
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,850
But ... I feel like I've seen you somewhere before.

308
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,700
- Oh... the thing is... 
 - Song Ah is a violin major at Seoryeong University.

309
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,130
- She's in the same class as Hae Na. 
 - Oh!

310
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,770
I think we've taken a few classes together.

311
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,030
Right? The unni who took the admission test 3 or 4 times?

312
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,270
Ah...yes...

313
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,500
Oh, so you're still playing...

314
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,030
Team Leader, let's step outside.

315
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,840
That unni's constantly last place.

316
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,470
Majoring in violin at Seoryeong doesn't make you a violinist.

317
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,100
Jo Soo Wan, stop worrying about other people and warm up.

318
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,260
Song Ah.

319
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,080
It's not always good to hold back.

320
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,670
Even if Jo Soo Wan is someone's daughter...

321
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,250
what's wrong is wrong.

322
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,830
Soo Wan has to perform soon.

323
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,840
The performer is the most important.

324
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,870
Joon Young.

325
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,750
Did you figure everything out?

326
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,990
Yeah... if not for Song Ah, we would've been in trouble.

327
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,190
Yeah...

328
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,430
Oh, I have to give you your ticket.

329
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,680
- Thank you. 
- For what?

330
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,540
Hurry up and go inside.

331
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,450
You're not going in?

332
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:01,350
Oh, this isn't mine... Oh there she is.

333
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,500
Hurry up, the performance is starting soon.

334
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,350
I didn't know you were coming.

335
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,230
Min Seong.

336
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,920
I'm going to leave first.

337
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,330
Thank you so much for coming.

338
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,100
Of course! You're so pretty.

339
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,270
Did you lock the waiting room well? Your violin is in there.

340
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,990
It'll be fine. There's someone watching the room.

341
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,000
Congratulations.

342
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,570
Thank you so much.

343
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,560
I should have painted them at least...

344
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,520
 That unni's constantly last place. 

345
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,990
 Majoring in violin at Seoryeong University doesn't make you a violinist. 

346
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,250
 Where are you right now? 

347
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,620
 The rehearsal room. 

348
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,160
Congrats, you looked great up there.

349
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,410
Thanks, Unni.

350
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,860
Oh, this is Lee Jung Kyung.

351
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,120
She just finished her Ph.D at Julliard.

352
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,920
Nice to meet you. I heard a lot about you from Director Na.

353
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,890
Nice to meet you.

354
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,120
I wanted to meet you one day.

355
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,490
Oh yeah! I saw you in New York not too long ago.

356
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,140
- Me? 
 - Yes.

357
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,470
On the day of Park Joon Young's performance, you were in the audience, weren't you?

358
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,020
After the performance ended, I followed after you to say hi,

359
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:15,270
but you headed toward Park Joon Young's waiting room so I couldn't follow you.

360
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,360
Oh, that day...

361
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,300
Oh... where is Joon Young?

362
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,540
He was in the audience with you before.

363
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,220
President!

364
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,750
Congratulations.

365
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,450
Congratulations.

366
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:40,080
Good job.

367
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,080
Yes?

368
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,150
Song Ah.

369
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,500
Why are you here....

370
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,830
This.

371
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,080
I'm sorry it's late.

372
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,000
♫   I see your deep moonlight in my dreams   ♫

373
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,430
   

374
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:25,270
♫   Even though I've seen your sky so many times,    ♫

375
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,860
♫  it still makes me happy  ♫

376
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:35,480
♫   You're always like a dream to me   ♫

377
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:41,410
♫   You're already enough   ♫

378
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,490
I...

379
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,900
like you.

380
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,570
Why aren't you saying anything?

381
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,910
You heard it all.

382
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,710
You heard me correctly. That night...

383
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,330
Isn't it your first time at a place like this?

384
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,390
How is it?

385
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,890
Didn't you say you wanted to try coming here, since you were curious?

386
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,460
It's not much, is it?

387
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,390
Maybe that's what it is?

388
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,890
You're just curious.

389
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,770
You and I...

390
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,640
Both you and I

391
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:35,100
have only had each other for a long time.

392
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,700
So you're just curious.

393
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,950
That can happen.

394
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,190
Hyeon Ho...

395
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,380
But it's all the same.

396
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:06,330
Once you make that choice, you'll find it's not for you.

397
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,890
It will make you more uncomfortable.

398
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,020
It doesn't suit you.

399
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,510
If you really are so curious,

400
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,000
you can go for a little while.

401
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,040
You can go get some fresh air.

402
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,230
But...

403
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,490
Please just don't leave me.

404
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,310
Hyeon Ho,

405
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,720
Let's stop now.

406
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,290
Sorry.

407
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,370
I'll just pretend I never heard that.

408
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,000
What?

409
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,870
Huh?

410
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,310
Must be nice.

411
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,600
You can pretend you didn't hear what you heard,

412
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:55,780
and pretend things that happened, didn't.

413
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,590
Must be nice that you can control that as you please.

414
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,670
Min Seong.

415
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,350
If you're going to act like this, why don't you just pretend I don't exist?

416
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,180
Min Seong.

417
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,690
I don't understand why I liked a person like you.

418
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,970
Can you let me go?

419
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:25,850
♫   Please don't leave  ♫

420
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:32,760
♫   from my side   ♫

421
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:39,720
♫   Please don't cry   ♫

422
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:47,420
♫   Just stay by my side  ♫

423
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:54,290
♫   This thing called a farewell   ♫

424
00:37:55,350 --> 00:38:00,970
♫   is not beautiful   ♫

425
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:10,000
♫   I'm not prepared yet, so for me   ♫

426
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,100
♫   can you stay by my side?   ♫

427
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:22,440
♫   Please don't leave me, stay with me, my love   ♫

428
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:29,620
♫   Stay by my side. Please don't leave me, stay with me, my love  ♫

429
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:35,290
♫   Tears must have filled    ♫

430
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,770
♫   my two eyes   ♫

431
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:45,980
♫   Please just remember one thing,   ♫

432
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,350
♫   remember me   ♫

433
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,770
With this, the 37th regular meeting of the Korean Violin Masters Society

434
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:03,750
comes to an end.

435
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,230
Oh, yes.

436
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:21,930
I thought you wouldn't come today, but I see you are working hard until the very last moment.

437
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,530
Do I stop being a teacher just because I leave the school?

438
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:29,360
Everyone told me there was never a teacher as good as me, and there wouldn't be in the future.

439
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,110
Thank you for the food.

440
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:36,380
- We'll have three ox bone soups.  
 - Yes.

441
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,690
Seriously.

442
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,800
I don't get why they do these, seriously.

443
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,010
It's J Chamber, right?

444
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:45,610
I received an invitation too. They send it out to everyone.

445
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,890
Professor Song Jeong Hee's chamber orchestra, from my school?

446
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,800
Right, you are a student at Seoryeong University too.

447
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,350
Then revolt against your school and ask them to please stop doing this.

448
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:59,800
Professor Song's students put their lives on the line to get into that orchestra.

449
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,050
Because once you become a member there, you can be scouted here and there.

450
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,860
I heard their concerts aren't even that great, so why do they keep on doing this?

451
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:11,300
- You don't know why Professor Song runs J Chamber? 
 - No.

452
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,800
- Okay, look. 
 - Here he goes again.

453
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,460
Professors in the School of Music need to be assessed on their performance skills each year, instead of writing papers.

454
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,800
But most professors don't practice at all.

455
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,430
That's true! Our professors' skills are really...

456
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,140
How can they have a ninety minutes long solo recital when they never play?

457
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,290
No orchestras would invite them, so being accompanied by one is a stretch too.

458
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,850
So in the end, they go for chamber music. But the problem is,

459
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:38,920
that when you get to Professor Song Jeong Hee's stage, let's see... She became a professor...

460
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,800
around thirty years ago,

461
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,970
so she probably didn't practice for around thirty years.

462
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:47,050
So even a small scale chamber music like a trio or a string quartet

463
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,650
will put her under pressure. Then what option does she have?

464
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,090
- The chamber orchestra. 
 - The chamber orchestra. Jinx!

465
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,620
With a chamber orchestra, she has twenty or thirty students playing together with her.

466
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,370
So she gets buried among all the other players.

467
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,400
What the? So that was why?

468
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,250
But do they really sell any ticket at all?

469
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,910
Tickets?

470
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:07,320
The tickets are sold to the former students' own students, of course.

471
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,980
Anyway, it's a long string of deep-rooted scheming.

472
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,060
Do you want this?

473
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:34,550
If you're free, come watch our chamber orchestra performance.

474
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:40,090
Do you think you'll be able to retire, being so concerned with your chamber orchestra?

475
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:44,680
The chamber orchestra will continue to be successful, since all my students are such avid supporters of it.

476
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,550
Their families are all lined up wanting to sponsor us.

477
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,310
On top of that, my assistant is so good at her work.

478
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,870
I'm telling you, I'm to blessed to have so many wonderful people by my side.

479
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:04,390
Oh, right. I heard your assistant is going abroad for her doctorate after this term.

480
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:07,420
She must be leaving to get another mentor.

481
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:12,100
Yes, I actually strongly recommended she do so.

482
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,380
If I kept her talent in this small country,

483
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,230
that's wouldn't be right as a teacher.

484
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,040
Among my students there is a girl named Lee Jung Kyung,

485
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,540
the daughter of Kyunghoo Group.

486
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,670
She's applying for my position this year.

487
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:38,360
- So? 
 - You should get along with her, even after I'm gone.

488
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,040
Well, you wouldn't ever need to get sponsored since you don't have a chamber orchestra,

489
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,630
It'll be beneficial for you as well, to keep ties with that kind of family.

490
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,470
If you aren't surrounded by great people, you should at least try to make great connections.

491
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,750
Oh gosh , Professor

492
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,420
It's been a long time.

493
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,390
- It's so nice to run into you here. 
 - Sure is.

494
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,660
Oh, you look as young as ever!

495
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,320
Stop flattering me. You look great too.

496
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,550
- Thank you
- Thank you

497
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,150
This is so pretty!

498
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,480
The weekend is for treats like this.

499
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,130
I'm so sick of school meals.

500
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,900
Let's eat. This is on me.

501
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,630
I got dumped.

502
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,940
What?

503
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,930
I confessed but got rejected

504
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,000
by Yoon Dong Yoon

505
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,180
What's the problem with it?

506
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:41,840
Do you see this stick standing upright in there?

507
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,020
This is called a sound post.

508
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,640
I'll adjust this to match the balance of the instrument.

509
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,110
Okay.

510
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:51,740
If it sounded weird, you should've let me know earlier.

511
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,540
The audition is tomorrow. Why the fuss today?

512
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,930
Instruments are hard to predict.

513
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,450
What audition is it?

514
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,020
It's the Kyunghoo Young Artists Audition.

515
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,640
Oh, really?

516
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,730
One of my close friends works at Kyunghoo.

517
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,250
Oh, really?

518
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,250
What's her name?

519
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,310
Chae Song Ah.

520
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,120
I'm not sure who that is...

521
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,850
Do you know who that is?

522
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,110
She's a super pretty Unni.

523
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,100
How could you not know her?

524
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,750
What do you think is the worst response to a confession of love?

525
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,150
"I don't like you."

526
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,240
"I'm sorry."

527
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,640
"I'm actually married." There are multiple possibilities, I guess.

528
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,190
But forget all those options.

529
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:44,800
Yoon Dong Yoon's answer was the worst of the worst.

530
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,220
"I'll pretend I didn't hear that."

531
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,710
How can you say you'll forget what you've heard?

532
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,660
How is that possible?

533
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:58,010
I knew I had an unrequited crush on him.

534
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:02,040
Yes. I know too well now.

535
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:06,950
But when I said I liked him...

536
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:11,060
to think he wished I never said it.

537
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,270
Was it that meaningless?

538
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,300
It hurts, Song Ah.

539
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,510
It hurts a lot.

540
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,040
The Board of Directors meeting for the Foundation is coming up.

541
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,020
You should attend.

542
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:00,430
You're a director as well. You need to do you duties at minimum.

543
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:02,450
Okay.

544
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,410
If you really don't want to,

545
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:10,570
at least find someone who'll take your place.

546
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,790
They can also help your father.

547
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:18,630
I broke up with him.

548
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:20,400
Hyeon Ho.

549
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:24,160
Is that so?

550
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,640
Is that all you're going to say?

551
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,790
Are you upset?

552
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:37,610
Fine, I'll ask. Why did you break up?

553
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:40,060
I wasn't asking you to ask that.

554
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,550
Maybe it's my opinion that you need?

555
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,600
I want to applaud you.

556
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,040
He isn't your pair.

557
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,490
Not only does he have nothing,

558
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:59,350
but he also has neither guts nor courage.

559
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,980
He was just too naïve, like a little puppy.

560
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:08,180
Goodness, this isn't a spot for someone so carefree.

561
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,890
I said I broke up with him.

562
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,630
Is there a need to be so harsh?

563
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:18,140
Do you think I'm only talking about Hyeon Ho right now?

564
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,180
   

565
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,070
Welcome in.

566
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,860
Hello.

567
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,580
Has it been 10 years now since your parents opened this convenience store?

568
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,130
Yes.

569
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,940
Then, when your father left our construction company,

570
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,170
I thought you'd ask Jung Kyung

571
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,880
to help your father out.

572
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,860
My father's business is his own to take care of.

573
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:16,360
You must be one to not ask for favors often.

574
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,040
Wise people know to make requests of others,

575
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,640
to the right person in the right place.

576
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:26,320
I, too, must have become wiser with age.

577
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,320
I'm thinking of asking for a favor.

578
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:35,690
There's an opening for a position of professor

579
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:38,500
at the department of string music at Seoryeong University.

580
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,690
Why don't you try applying?

581
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:48,270
It's an opening created because a violin professor retired, but there's no reason another violinist has to fill that position.

582
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:51,930
But that position, Jung Kyung-

583
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,710
Ah, Jung Kyung does want

584
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,730
to be a professor at Seoryeong University.

585
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:00,220
She's being stubborn, saying she'll do as she pleases.

586
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:08,600
But people each have a particular place that suits them.

587
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,810
Her place is the director of our foundation.

588
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:14,090
Not a professor.

589
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,910
I still don't think...

590
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:29,720
Maybe you believe you're not good enough to be a professor at Seoryeong University?

591
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,280
Yes, well, that's true.

592
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,250
Level doesn't have anything to do with skill.

593
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,560
It's about who trusts you and supports you.

594
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,100
That could be even more important.

595
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,630
And after all, it could be considered luck

596
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:55,110
and also a skill.

597
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:00,440
On this matter, I am not on Jung Kyung's side.

598
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,150
I'm on your side.

599
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,380
Joon Young will probably be happy about it too.

600
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,280
After living all these years, I realized that be it for a friends or a siblings relationship,

601
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,110
it has to be balanced for each person to feel at ease.

602
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:24,400
If only one person is really successful or lags behind,

603
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,450
then some ugly emotions can arise.

604
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,620
 It could all look the same as a student. 

605
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,480
 But once you enter the professional world, 

606
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,580
Some may be the director of a foundation.

607
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:40,400
Others may be a world-renown musician.

608
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,780
Then someone...

609
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:46,310
must become a Seoryeong Professor to maintain balance.

610
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:03,170
Professor Lee Soo Kyung?

611
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:04,150
Oh, hello.

612
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:06,830
- You're here? 
 - Wow...

613
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:11,170
There are so many students of Kyunghoo and you're chasing after each one?

614
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,670
My job is merely to plant the seeds.

615
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:17,520
We have to watch and make sure those seeds grow.

616
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,690
But do they actually recognize your work?

617
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,910
Oh right, among your 4th-year students should be Chae Song Ah and Kim Hae Na...

618
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:27,150
Yes? What about them?

619
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:28,920
Are they also scholarship recipients?

620
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,640
No, they're not.

621
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,970
 Right? 

622
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:36,120
Hae Na's grades are middling and Song Ah is in last place...

623
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:41,580
Those two are currently interns in our performance planning team.

624
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,650
Oh really?

625
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:45,950
I didn't know... Ah.

626
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:51,930
Hae Na's father is the dean of our school.

627
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:52,620
Oh, I see...

628
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:56,050
 She takes after her father so she's smart and well rounded. 

629
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:58,390
Yes. So is Chae Song Ah.

630
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:03,580
Song Ah...that girl graduated from our school of business, right?

631
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,100
Yes.

632
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,510
She has a good head about her.

633
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:09,770
It's just that her violin performance is lacking.

634
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,320
At any rate, Chae Song Ah is a good worker.

635
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,100
She's quick on her feet and is very sensible.

636
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,740
Oh really?

637
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,920
I'm glad that she's at least good at working.

638
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,500
   

639
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:48,790
 Are you home, Song Ah? 

640
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:53,340
 Yes. You also got home okay, right? 

641
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,530
 Not yet. 

642
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,160
 Not yet? 

643
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,550
   

644
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,140
Hello?

645
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:19,540
By chance, I didn't wake you, did I?

646
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,730
 No, not at all. 

647
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:25,900
Why are you still outside?

648
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,440
 I'm just having a walk. 

649
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,200
It's not for any bad reason.

650
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,450
It's just...the weather was nice.

651
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:43,770
Where are you? Are you at the palace again?

652
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:45,510
How did you know?

653
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:49,670
I'm walking the Deoksu Palace stonewall walkway.

654
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:51,710
Oh really?

655
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:55,940
You mean to tell me you're walking there alone at this hour?

656
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:59,040
Well, of course, I'm walking here alone. Who else would I walk with?

657
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:12,980
Then, get home safely.

658
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,550
- Song Ah! 
 - Yes? 

659
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:23,850
By chance, do you have any plans after work tomorrow?

660
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,680
No.

661
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:28,630
 Oh that's good... 

662
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:33,710
Th-then...would you like to have dinner with me?

663
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:38,810
Yes. I'd like that.

664
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:42,630
Then...I'll see you tomorrow.

665
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,560
Yes.

666
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,710
Good night.

667
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:50,100
You too, Joon Young.

668
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,230
   

669
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:30,240
You've already borrowed the maximum amount so borrowing more will be difficult.

670
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,980
Ah, I see...

671
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:40,750
   

672
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:58,810
 It is with regret that, despite your wonderful audition and interview, 

673
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:02,720
 we have decided to move forward with a different candidate. 

674
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,430
Song Ah!

675
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,800
Did you wait long?

676
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,700
Oh, not at all.

677
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,840
Shall we get something to eat?

678
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,520
Yes.

679
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,160
Then you must have been busy all day.

680
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,330
It was fine because I didn't have to stay overtime.

681
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:58,080
What did you do today Joon Young?

682
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:02,880
Oh, I just had some personal business to take care of.

683
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:06,720
I see...

684
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:12,510
Should we walk some?

685
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:14,160
Yes!

686
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:18,730
I was right after all.

687
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,340
About what?

688
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:25,640
I thought if I saw you, I'd feel better.

689
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:29,440
Did something happen today?

690
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,720
I don't know why I think of you during difficult days.

691
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:40,150
You must be tired of me. I'm sorry.

692
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,450
It's okay.

693
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:47,910
But still...it would be better if you didn't have hard times.

694
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,970
You should also call me during hard days too.

695
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:59,110
For me... I think I'll call you when I'm feeling good.

696
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:01,700
That's even better. Don't forget!

697
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,300
Okay.

698
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:06,170
Promise...

699
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:11,040
Okay. Promise!

700
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:19,400


701
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,500
Shall we get going?

702
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:32,520
♫   Think about you, your everything   ♫

703
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:37,770
♫   I wanna stay, always by your side   ♫

704
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:43,270
♫   I watch a transparent you  ♫

705
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:49,470
♫   My lips call for you again   ♫

706
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:55,530
♫   I thought you'd know even if I tried to hide my feelings   ♫

707
00:59:55,530 --> 01:00:01,490
♫   I thought if you saw my eyes, you'd feel my gaze   ♫

708
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:09,190
♫   Though I always linger a few paces behind you like a fool  ♫

709
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:15,740
♫   I'll be on your side   ♫

710
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,080
   

711
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,080
 Graduate school? 

712
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,760
 Let's have two more years of fun performances, okay? 

713
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,530
 Why are you still wearing that? We're through. 

714
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:29,170
 Did you really intend to marry me? Where is your confidence coming from? 

715
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:30,840
I've folded my expectations of you.

716
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,760
The keys were too heavy every time I played the piano.

717
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,270
Is that something to be so shameful of?

718
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:38,000
Song Ah, it's been 15 years for Joon Young and I.

719
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,510
Song Ah wants dating advice!

720
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,620
Oh, not me. My friend. My friend.

721
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:45,840
 Because you have feelings for them, you're reminded of them. Then you keep contacting them. 

722
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,160
 If you really liked sometime, you wouldn't confuse them about your intentions. 

723
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,300
I don't think I want to be your friend.

724
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:56,610
I don't want to.

725
01:00:56,610 --> 01:01:00,590
♫  But you don't know my sincerity   ♫
