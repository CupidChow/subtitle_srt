1
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,960
Yes, Mom?

2
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,880
The part-timer didn't come?

3
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,930
No, it's fine. I got it, I'll be there right away.

4
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,400
Okay.

5
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:08,010


6
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,600
♫   Stay with me, close to me   ♫

7
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,870
♫   Stay with me   ♫

8
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,160
 The visitor has just left. 

9
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,590
So Mr. Park Joon Young is upstairs alone at the moment.

10
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,760
Excuse my question, but may I ask what it is about?

11
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,010
♫   You've always been   ♫

12
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,190
It's nothing. 
 ♫  by my side   ♫

13
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,990
Thank you. 
 ♫   You comforted me   ♫

14
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,160
   

15
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,660
♫   I can't believe   ♫

16
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,450
    
     
    

17
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,290
 Yoon Dong Yoon and I...   
 ♫   Stay by my side forever    ♫

18
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,530
 We spent the night together. We were drunk. 

19
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,050
♫   Even if it's just   ♫

20
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,360
♫  for a day   ♫

21
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,650
♫   I can't bear not being with you, it's you   ♫

22
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,400
Will you go to dinner?

23
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:37,620
They all made time to come for my birthday. How can I not go?

24
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,330
I'll take you there.

25
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,460
It's raining outside.

26
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,460
I can't bring myself to go.

27
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:31,770
Would it be alright for me not to go?

28
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,560
Yes. It's alright.

29
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,640
Think only about yourself.

30
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,100
Don't be concerned about others.

31
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,410
Yes.

32
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,650
Then, please just take me to the bus stop.

33
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,650
 Song Ah! Chae Song Ah! 

34
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,620
- Song Ah. 
 - Song Ah.

35
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,230
- Joon Young. 
 - Hi, Dong Yoon.

36
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,270
Mr. Park Joon Young? Oh my!

37
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,290
- Hello. 
 - Hello!

38
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:20,110
Yoon Dong Yoon, you've got good eyes. How did you recognize Song Ah at once, in this rain?

39
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,050
I could tell right away.

40
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,600
Do you know Song Ah?

41
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,440
- That is... 
 - We are friends.

42
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,910
Incredible! You are friends with such a well-known person?

43
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,440
- That's not it... 
 - Hey.

44
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,630
I'm also friends with Park Joon Young, you know?

45
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,540
We'll get going first because we're late.

46
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,820
Song Ah, don't you have an umbrella? Come here, we'll use mine.

47
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,500
Let's go together.

48
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,320
Mr. Joon Young, you should come together with us. You know it's Song Ah's birthday today, right?

49
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,370
Come with us.

50
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,630
No, he—

51
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,390
Yes. I'll come with you.

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,810
   
   

53
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,900
It's tasty.

54
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,740
This is like in manhwas, you know what I'm talking about, right? 
  (T/N 'manhwas' are Korean cartoons) 

55
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,480
Doesn't it look like it?

56
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,530
Right?

57
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,110
Dong Yoon... Exchange with me.

58
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,980
What for? Are you drunk?

59
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,150
I'm not.

60
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,350
Goodness.

61
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,230
- Shall we clink our glasses? 
 - Ah, yes.

62
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,880
Be wary of her, Joon Young.

63
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,610
Happy birthday.

64
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,200
Thank you.

65
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,990
Were you at work together with Joon Young?

66
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,350
Yeah, we met on our way out.

67
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,950
I'm going to Paris soon, please recommend some good restaurants.

68
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,460
Do you think he goes around Europe as a tourist?

69
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,090
Actually, I just perform for the concerts and don't go sightseeing at all.

70
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,740
- That's right. 
 - As expected.

71
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,130
Now that we've finished eating, let's have cake.

72
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,830
- Of course! 
 - We should have some cake!

73
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,260
Chocolate, yum!

74
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,770
Looks so good.

75
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,920
It's chocolate inside, the type you like.

76
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,790
Aren't you touched?

77
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,810
- Why would I be? 
 - Wait, wait!

78
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,330
Let's video call Min Seong!

79
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,640
Oh, that's a good idea!

80
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,990
Why didn't she come, though?

81
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,290
- I was wondering the same, why didn't she come? 
 - I don't know. Is she answering?

82
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,550
She's not answering, is she?

83
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,690
- I feel like she won't answer. 
 - Maybe she's drinking.

84
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,670
She's not answering.

85
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,910
Okay. One, two, three, four!

86
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,160
♪ Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you ♪

87
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,080
♪ Our beloved Song Ah, happy birthday to you ♪

88
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,500
Thank you.

89
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,260
- Happy birthday! 
 - Happy birthday!

90
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,600
I'll cut it now.

91
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,200
- Let's just dig in the cake. 
 - Should we?

92
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,920
Should we just eat it like that?

93
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,950
 Thank you.  

94
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,480
- Song Ah, get in. 
 - What?

95
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,150
Driver, we're going toward Seocho-dong.

96
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,600
- One will get off at Seocho station, and the other one at the Arts Center. 
  - All right.

97
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,240
Aren't you getting in?

98
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,380
You go first.

99
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,120
Aren't you going home?

100
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:02,020
I'll go after I finish a work discussion we started earlier.

101
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,940
Let us talk for a bit if that's alright.

102
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,360
Sure.

103
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,610
Hey, why work, at this hour?

104
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,920
If you aren't going to get on, hurry up and let me go!

105
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,160
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,870
I'll go ahead.

107
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,340
Be safe on your way back.

108
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,040
Bye.

109
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,060
Don't finish up too late.

110
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,310
- Do you want to get some fresh air? 
 - Do you want to get some fresh air?

111
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:04,150
When I said I wanted to major in music just as I was going to graduate from the Faculty of Business Management,

112
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:09,060
the only person who supported me was Dong Yoon.

113
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,150
I think that's when it started.

114
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:24,980
During the four years, I tried to get accepted into the School of Music, Dong Yoon gave me lessons once or twice a week.

115
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,010
He was both my teacher and friend.

116
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:37,440
Nevertheless, I wasn't thinking of doing anything about it.

117
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:45,250
Because Min Seong is a precious friend to me, just as much as Dong Yoon is.

118
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,970
So...

119
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:59,020
In some way, I already knew how it would end.

120
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:07,420
But... Now that I'm facing that end,

121
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,080
some thoughts come to mind.

122
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,480
Those times that are resting in here,

123
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,820
where will they go now?

124
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,130
They've filled up this space here, in a neat pile.

125
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,300
Where should this go now?

126
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,040
There's the phrase "too much".

127
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,750
It's used when something has gone far beyond a certain limit.

128
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:07,280
I think that could be why some types of love can feel difficult.

129
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,420
We should love within reason,

130
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,240
but we end up loving too much.

131
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,410
 So next time... 

132
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,710
 instead of too much, 

133
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,220
 give in appropriate and sufficient amounts. 

134
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,430
 Don't be excessive with it, love. 

135
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,030
   

136
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,150
 If you don't... 

137
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,070
 it becomes too difficult. 

138
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:24,040
 The card company has already accepted our President's reports then? 

139
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,620
Yes.

140
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,160
I incidentally met up with Joon Young and asked him

141
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,240
and he graciously accepted.

142
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,260
I thought he already reported it to you, but...

143
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,180
Forgive me.

144
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,790
I bet you incidentally... forgot that too, right?

145
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,580
At any rate, we secured a name at the card company.

146
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,590
 Joon Young has agreed to perform at the Korea Arts Middle School. 

147
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,060
Oh, that's great!

148
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,060
Could Song Ah do a follow-up?

149
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,590
He'll just be sharing his story. No performances.

150
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,450
There will be a separate host.

151
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,480
Since you and Joon Young have been communicating with each other until now,

152
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,820
I want you to try tackling this assignment.

153
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,940
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

154
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:25,010
Then Section Chief Park will be getting all of the necessary contact info from the card company to Song Ah.

155
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,860
Hae Na...

156
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,410
You said you used to be in the same class as Jo Soo Ahn during high school?

157
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,440
Yes...we also started college together, but Soo Ahn left to study abroad.

158
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,190
That's good. Then for this event...

159
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,190
you will be our main.

160
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,410
We've already completed the preparations, so just make sure the event proceeds smoothly.

161
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,060
Yes.

162
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:55,610
Yes, hello. I am Chae Song Ah from the Kyunghoo Cultural Foundation speaking on behalf of Park Joon Young.

163
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,480
O-oh no, my name is...

164
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,340
It's not Choi, it's Chae...as in the vegetable "Chae"...

165
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,900
Yes...

166
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,140
Yes, then I'll respond via email. Yes...

167
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,380
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

168
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,870
 So my name isn't Choi, but Chae as in the vegetable... 

169
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,600
 Yes, I know. Chae Song Ah. 

170
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:36,000
A certain someone understood what I meant on the first try...

171
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,980
I'm leaving.

172
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,990
Are you not going to do foundation work?

173
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,820
The foundation work doesn't suit me.

174
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,080
 You haven't even tried yet. 

175
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,300
I'm going to live as a performer.

176
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,580
And being a performer suits you?

177
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,610
 Instead of doing what you want, do what you're capable of doing. 

178
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,510
If you start working at the Foundation after failing to get that position at Seoryeong...

179
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,900
I guess they'll say I failed and came over then.

180
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,340
 Everyone likes to talk about other people's failures. 

181
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,370
But... even if I fail, I won't come here.

182
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,010
So find someone else. Maybe Young In Unni.

183
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,370
 Think of your mother as well. 

184
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:38,930
If she was alive, you and I wouldn't be having this conversation.

185
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,610
The foundation wouldn't have existed either.

186
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,480
You're just like your mother, unable to speak without venom.

187
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,000
Your words occasionally make a person's heart go numb.

188
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,780
You're right. I take after my mom.

189
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,900
Then you should also know...

190
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,770
Mom did whatever she wanted.

191
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:06,370
 When she taught me how to play an instrument. Also when she took me to America by herself. 

192
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,630
So that is why I want to do... what I want.

193
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,360
It looks like you've forgotten who your mother takes after.

194
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,480
But in the end, Mom won over you, didn't she?

195
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,360
Because she ultimately married Dad.

196
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,330
That is why her end wasn't good.

197
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,280
 Nobody knows... 

198
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,570
what her end could have been.

199
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,480
I am going to continue...playing an instrument.

200
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,060
 I'll be back. 

201
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,610
Welcome home.

202
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,170
I'm back from my trip.

203
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,340
 Let's talk later. 

204
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,700
Yes?

205
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,200
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

206
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,890
Happy Birthday, even though it's a day late.

207
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,420
Want me to put it on for you?

208
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,750
It's just a birthday present.

209
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,670
You can wear it.

210
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,950
Give me your hand.

211
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,960
- What kind of violinist gives me her left hand? 
 - Ah...

212
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,040
Sorry.

213
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,400
I'm sorry.

214
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,960
Put mine on for me, too.

215
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,700
Shall we get going?

216
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,750
We're going to be late.

217
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,110
It's the day before the school break, only music majors will attend, and...

218
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,980
you won't be performing on that day.

219
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,830
Oh...yes.

220
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,900
Yes?

221
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,440
Oh, Song Ah. How have you been?

222
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,560
Yes, how are you?

223
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,810
Song Ah, then I'll contact you later.

224
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,310
You must be busy so I'll let you go.

225
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,600
Oh yes...well, then...

226
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,590
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

227
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,990
Oh, excuse me!

228
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,980
Oh... I... was wondering if you

229
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,410
left this. I saw it on the bathroom sink.

230
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,990
Is it not yours?

231
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,500
It is.

232
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,610
That's a relief.

233
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,610
Need an A?

234
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,300
Is Jung Kyung running late?

235
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,280
Joon Young.

236
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,330
I'm going to get married.

237
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,480
Did she say she would, Jung Kyung?

238
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,590
Yes, it's fine. Yes, yes. I understand.

239
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,330
I'll call you back later. Yes.

240
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,630
Hae Na, they're replacing the accompanist.

241
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,150
Why?

242
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,370
The accompanist was her boyfriend but they broke up.

243
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,600
This is why you shouldn't date in the workplace!

244
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,950
 It's always the same thing every day. 

245
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,850
You know you're acting really strange right now, right?

246
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,380
Sorry, I'm late.

247
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,530
Can you play an A for me?

248
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,820
Okay, let's try it.

249
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,600
Sorry, but let's try again from the beginning.

250
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,060
Oh, okay.

251
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,930
Wait, stop for a second.

252
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,970
I don't think this is it.

253
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,880
What's wrong?

254
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,580
I don't know.

255
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,920
I just don't think it's right.

256
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,360
Really?

257
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,900
Tell us specifically what isn't right.

258
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,390
Then, let's just start again from the beginning.

259
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,100
If we don't know the reason, it won't matter if we start again.

260
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,750
Jung Kyung.

261
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,020
What don't you like?

262
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,940
You guys should just decide the tempo and everything else. I'll just match whatever you decide.

263
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,820
Of course...

264
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,090
Because you never have an opinion.

265
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:10,300
Have you ever done anything the way you wanted?

266
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,480
Even once?

267
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,530
Where are you going?

268
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,340
Aren't you going to practice?

269
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,510
Joon Young.

270
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:47,610
Park Joon Young! Let's talk.

271
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,560
About what?

272
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,280
Give me my birthday present.

273
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,110
What?

274
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
My birthday present.

275
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,940
It hasn't arrived.

276
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,100
Because I didn't send it.

277
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,100
Why not?

278
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,810
Why didn't you send it?

279
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,060
I told you already.

280
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,920
I'll never play Traumerei again...

281
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,870
Joon Young--

282
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,970
Excuse me...

283
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,290
Song Ah.

284
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,900
Yes?

285
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,100
Let's have our meeting now.

286
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,250
Our meeting? Right now?

287
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,510
Yes, to finish up what we started talking about.

288
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,790
Sure.

289
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,980
Then... please come to our office for a moment.

290
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,250
Are you all done practicing?

291
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,350
Yes...

292
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,020
Song Ah, you can go now.

293
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,420
Excuse me?

294
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:09,980
I... didn't really want to talk about work. I just

295
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,710
wanted to get out of that situation, so I grabbed you.

296
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:18,180
I'll leave after staying here for a moment.

297
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,510
In case I run into her as I'm going out.

298
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,130
Thanks for your help.

299
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,260
It's nothing.

300
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,360
I did the same thing before.

301
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,160
Oh, that's right.

302
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,050
I guess we're the same now.

303
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,260
Bye.

304
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:08,030

Hey.

318
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,910
- Are you clocking out? 
 - Yeah.

319
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,420
- Um...I have somewhere I need to be right now. 
 - Oh...

00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,690
♫   Even these tears that are falling  ♫

327
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:31,300
Yeah, it's fine.

328
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:39,750
♫   part of my last farewell to you, be well.    ♫

329
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,490
What are you doing?

330
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,470
You're finally home?

331
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,680
You've had too much to drink.

332
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,610
Spend the night.

333
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,190
You...

334
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,950
What's going on between you and Jung Kyung?

335
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,500
What are you two doing together?

336
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,700
I'm sorry... again.

337
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,860
How long are you in Korea?

338
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,990
Well...

339
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,150
Until next summer?

340
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,880
Why? Are you tired of me? Want me to leave?

341
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Go.

342
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,620
Please leave.

343
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,020
I said spend the night.

344
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,030
I said forget it!

345
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,380
Hey.

346
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,020
What are you doing?

347
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:11,660
Well, they say it's not good for you to keep the fan fixed while sleeping.

348
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:19,610
I set up the timer for you, so sleep well. I'm leaving.

349
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,540
The wind stings my eyes...

350
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,210
 Go. 

351
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,910
 Please leave. 

352
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,060
 Song Ah, have you ever been to Korea Fine Arts Middle School? 

353
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,450
No, I just graduated out of a normal middle school.

354
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,900
What about you?

355
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,060
A few times long ago. For parent-teacher conferences.

356
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:14,630
 Joon Young went to school alone in Seoul, so whenever he got his report cards, I'd nag him about it a lot. 

357
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:20,620
Anyway, later on, if you have any questions, even if I'm not there, you can... huh?

358
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,960
It's Joon Young's mother.

359
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:47,230
   

360
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,130
 Hello. 

361
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,990
 Hello. 

362
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,530
I am Joo Sang Woo from Kyunghoo Card Company.

363
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,980
- Yes, nice to meet you. I am Chae Song Ah. 
 - Ah!

364
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,740
Y-you're the person I talked with over the phone!

365
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,020
Yes, how do you do?

366
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,760
Yes, how do you do?

367
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,890
- Could I also get a business card...? 
 - Ah.

368
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,720
I'm...

369
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,480
Ms. Song Ah is an intern.

370
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,210
Intern?

371
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,220
So you were an intern...

372
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:34,750
When our Section Chief Park Seong Jae was in GyeongKukHwa University, I heard he was your superior.

373
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,890
Oh, Y-yes yes. He was so much higher than me.

374
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:42,700
When Section Chief Park first came to our foundation, he was just... like you.

375
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,800
It reminds me of those days.

376
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,430
What do you mean that he was like me?

377
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:52,000
When they're deputies like you, they're so cute, aren't they?

378
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,510
Of course, they worked hard. Without question.

379
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,430
Yes...

380
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,990
As for me, I, unfortunately, have external meetings I have to attend, so I must take my leave first.

381
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,400
Any details you need to iron out concerning the event, you can direct here

382
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,860
to Ms. Chae Song Ah.

383
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,830
Oh, yes. I understand.

384
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,930
   

385
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,130
Joon Young!

386
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,110
You're here?

387
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,790
You said Father had changed these days.

388
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,380
I'm sorry.

389
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,960
When do you need it by?

390
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,620
This is where the students practice their music.

391
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,070
Oh yes.

392
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:17,190
- So you must have cleared away the piano here, right? 
 - Ah...

393
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,340
It's not that we put it away, we never had one.

394
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,740
The new piano comes in next month.

395
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,960
Ah yes.

396
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:28,380
- Just a moment. 
 - Ah yes.

397
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,380
Yes, teacher?

398
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,620
Ah, miss... intern?

399
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,630
Intern person?

400
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,600
- Excuse me? 
 - Oh it's just...

401
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,530
When you called me.

402
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:47,340
That is... I picked up the phone,

403
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,270
you just randomly said "I'm sorry!" 
 (T/N he drops formal speech)

404
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,970
So I was surprised.

405
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,150
I mean, who could this be...

406
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,120
that they would call me to say "I'm sorry"?

407
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,420
That's what I thought.

408
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:08,980
I'm just saying... the foundation would've struggled to stay afloat if it weren't for Kyunghoo Card's funds.

409
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,430
So that must be why she was sorry.

410
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,730
Mr. Park Joon Young!

411
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:27,020
How... I was told you had other business to take care of today...

412
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,110
This event by itself is insufficient, isn't it?

413
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:35,030
If you need to get your money's worth, tell that to me.

414
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,550
I'll do whatever you ask.

415
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:41,300
However... is that under the condition...

416
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:45,030
that you speak so flippantly to an employee of the foundation?

417
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,080
It was so nice to see you again, Joon Young.

418
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:02,140
Right, Hyeon Ho visited some time ago. I heard that Jung Kyung finished her studies as well and was back?

419
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,790
All three of you should visit together next time.

420
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,410
Yes.

421
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:21,170
That person... from the card company from earlier...

422
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,490
He was flaunting the money that the company was giving the foundation, right?

423
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:28,780
That is why I lost my temper.

424
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,440
"Is money everything?" I thought.

425
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:38,540
But...I don't think I'm qualified to criticize others.

426
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,750
I'm just the same.

427
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,780
Just because I make some money.

428
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:55,340
I got it. Can you ask Joon Young if that's alright with him?

429
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,340
He won't say no, but...

430
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,110
I'm in a meeting, so I'll call you again later.

431
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,000
Yes.

432
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,380
Who was it? Joon Young?

433
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,900
What is it? Did his father cause trouble again?

434
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:20,230
Is he in Europe right now?

435
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,760
   

436
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,060
Joon Young is back in Korea.

437
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,010
Why aren't you wearing the ring?

438
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:03,650
Hyeon Ho seemed concerned about it.

439
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,480
Aren't you the one who is concerned?

440
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:19,560
These days... you're a bit much.

441
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,820
Huh?

442
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,540
Not "a bit much", I actually don't like you.

443
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,370
Park Joon Young!

444
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,810
Hurry up and get married.

445
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,100
I wanted to see you to say this.

446
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:54,160
Are you really serious?

447
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,370
It's a request.

448
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,140
I reported this to Team Leader.

449
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:20,650
So she is currently finalizing the arrangements now.

450
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:30,920
Ah... I'm sorry.

451
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,730
Will you really be alright with performing?

452
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:36,500
You're on your sabbatical year.

453
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,550
It's alright.

454
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,020
Then treat me to a meal next time.

455
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:47,960
Yes, I will.

456
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:00,420
You know what you talked about earlier?

457
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:07,720
How you don't like it when people flaunt about giving money or helping someone, to get credit for it.

458
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,720
But I think...

459
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,900
Everyone has that kind of desire in some way if you're human.

460
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,800
When we choose a gift,

461
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,340
we look forward to the other person liking what we picked.

462
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,100
It's the same when we help someone.

463
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,410
Even if we aren't actually expecting anything from it,

464
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:35,960
we hope for it to also be worthwhile

465
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,370
at the same time.

466
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:42,600
But the Director...

467
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:47,050
When she gave me the scholarship, she wasn't expecting anything from me.

468
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:56,400
I don't know if I'm in any place to say this,

469
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,000
but the Director

470
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,510
must have wanted you to live happily while playing the piano.

471
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,370
She probably did it because she wanted to see that.

472
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,340
Happiness...

473
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:23,020
Song Ah.

474
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,520
Yes?

475
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,200
Should we have that meal today?

476
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:58,950
Come to think of it, we've met twice today.

477
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,810
That's true.

478
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:07,470
I went to the school earlier

479
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,690
because I finished my business early

480
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,570
and I knew you'd still be there,

481
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:16,880
so I thought I should see the venue of the event as well.

482
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,590
But I suddenly realized something.

483
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:22,370
"I should go see Song Ah."

484
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:27,670
"If I see her, I'll feel better."

485
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:41,730
So, are you feeling better now?

486
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,360
Yes.

487
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,050
So thanks to you, I realized it.

488
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:50,690
I was wrong.

489
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:59,140
The reason why I went to the school earlier today,

490
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:04,350
was actually because I wanted to smile.

491
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,490
Because when I'm with you, I have a good time and always smile.

492
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:16,920
I guess I wanted to see you.

493
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:28,210
♫  Oh   ♫

494
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:31,430
♫  Oh  ♫

495
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:37,450
♫  Think about you, your everything  ♫

496
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:43,540
♫  I wanna stay, always by your side  ♫

497
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:49,230
♫  Watching a transparent you,  ♫

498
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:55,410
♫  my lips call for you again  ♫

499
00:48:55,410 --> 00:49:01,400
♫  I thought you'd know even if I tried to hide my feelings  ♫

500
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:07,610
♫   I thought if you saw my eyes, you'd feel my gaze   ♫

501
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:15,230
♫  Though I always linger a few paces behind you like a fool  ♫

502
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:21,160
♫  I'll be on your side  ♫

503
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:27,990
♫  The more I look at you  ♫

504
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:31,260
♫  Ooh  ♫

505
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:39,170
♫  Tell my honestly, if you feel the same way  ♫

506
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:42,730
♫  Tomorrow  ♫

507
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:46,490
Whenever you perform, the audience likes it, don't they?

508
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:48,410
I'm envious.

509
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:51,060
That's not true.

510
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:56,400
There are days when I'm not in the best condition, or days when I strangely can't really focus.

511
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,020
Or days when the piano from the venue isn't in a good state.

512
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:03,360
But, "There is no bad piano in this world,"

513
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,960
"only bad pianists."

514
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,800
There is such a saying.

515
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:14,840
So this is something I should cope with.

516
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:19,500
No matter my mood, or what piano I'm given,

517
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:24,390
I need to always do my utmost to give the best performance.

518
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:33,340
So it's the fate of a pianist, I guess.

519
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,270
Fate... Yes.

520
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:43,600
In any case, there are various reason as to why one might ruin a performance,

521
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,250
but the audience or the critics

522
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,780
have no reason to know the pianist's personal circumstances.

523
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:55,220
They will only appraise the performance that's being given on stage at that moment.

524
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,630
As they should.

525
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:06,970
That's why every performance is burdensome for me, truthfully.

526
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:12,400
Then how did you manage to stand on stage every two or three days?

527
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,370
To make a living.

528
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,090
Welcome.

529
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,320
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

530
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,690
Please come this way.

531
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:55,000
The piano company said they only had a baby grand...

532
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,680
I guess they had a larger size.

533
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,990
The Chairman sent it in.

534
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,620
I heard you were in the same graduating class as the chairman's daughter.

535
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:18,470
Yes.

536
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:22,220
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

537
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:29,030
I got scolded by the secretary team that I need to create the best performance environment possible.

538
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:34,900
But...why isn't he playing?

539
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,940
 Hello everyone from Korea Arts Middle School! 

540
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:49,230
I sincerely welcome you to the passionate talk concert sponsored by Kyunghoo Card.

541
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:53,820
I am today's host, Announcer Yoon Soo Mi. Nice to meet you.

542
00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:00,630
 Your sunbae is waiting in the back, ready to give an address as passionately hot 

543
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:02,930
 as your enthusiasm for him. 

544
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,190
 Now shall we all shout for him? 

545
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:08,580
 "Sunbae-nim! Please come out!" 

546
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:13,290
 Happy birthday to you 

547
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:16,720
 Happy birthday to you 

548
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,190
 To our beloved Professor Song Jung Hee 

549
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:23,790
 Happy birthday to you 

550
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,910
Congratulations!

551
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,190
 This is too pretty! 

552
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:35,480
Professor, we pooled our money for this.

553
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,580
You didn't need to buy all of this! Just having you here is enough.

554
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,510
Professor, shall we take some photos?

555
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,040
Oh, yes, yes! Let's do that!

556
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,420
 Come over here! 

557
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,980
 Jung Kyung! What are you doing? Come over here! 

558
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,540
Yes.

559
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,170
You, move over a bit. Come here.

560
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:54,450
Jung Kyung, come here.

561
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:56,780
Let's take a picture now!

562
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:02,590
For every piano competition you enter, it's said that you have to practice for several long and torturous months in advance.

563
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:09,080
 I'm curious how you were able to ceaselessly string back-to-back competitions for the past 6 to 7 years. 

564
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,510
 Were you simply built for competitions? 

565
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:15,990
Built for it? Surely, not. Um...

566
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:22,030
 Piano competitions... were something I really hated. 

567
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:27,180
 First place? Of course it's nice. 

568
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,270
 At first I was happy. I'd even get reward money. 

569
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:34,930
 But... after winning a few more awards... 

570
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:38,430
I had to keep participating...

571
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:41,750
 and I had to keep winning. 

572
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:47,730
After a while...I hated the competitions more than death itself.

573
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,920
Did you write this down?

574
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,300
 Don't write it down. 

575
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,030
How could I tell the kids that?

576
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,370
 Tell me. 

577
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:16,270
I'll listen to you. Your story.

578
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:21,060
I think I learned a lot from the preparations for these piano competitions.

579
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:25,460
To do music... is to find one's own answers

580
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:29,660
from within the sheet music.

581
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,470
After 7 years, you've concluded the Chopin Piano Competition as your last.

582
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:36,040
And now you are a traveling pianist.

583
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,230
What is the life of the musician like,

584
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:42,480
performing a couple of times a week on stage at every corner of the globe?

585
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,150
The classical musician...is always alone.

586
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:54,050
Of course, now I'm greeted by the performance team whenever I get off the airport or train station...

587
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,340
but it wasn't like this at the beginning.

588
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,880
What happens if you're sick alone?

589
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:06,790
Even if I'm sick...I can't be sick.

590
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:13,210
I'm the only one who can fill my role, and it's a huge loss for my team.

591
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,780
 So what can I do? 

592
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:21,750
Digestive aids, sleeping aids, and for severe days, anxiety medicine.

593
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,250
I survived through drugs.

594
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:30,360
Sometimes I think this...

595
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,650
What horrible deed must I have done in a previous life...

596
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,930
to live like this?

597
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:50,090
 Isn't it such a great blessing... to live as a musician? 

598
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:52,200
That's what I think.

599
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:58,110
 During tough times when you had to give up the piano... 

600
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:01,280
 You were granted a scholarship through the Kyunghoo Cultural Foundation... 

601
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,430
 thus allowing you to continue playing the piano. 

602
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:06,130
 If you had not met the Kyunghoo Cultural Center... 

603
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:08,870
What kind of life would you be living now?

604
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:12,700
Uh...

605
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:17,040
It's a little hard...to imagine.

606
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,410
 I suppose I would be doing...something, right? 

607
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:24,190
Although it wouldn't be the piano.

608
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:31,000
 I think...I would be a little freer. 

609
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:45,580
Ahjussi! Move over!

610
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:08,220
Now at this point, we'll pause.

611
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:12,980
We've acquired a photo of Park Joon Young when he was in Korea Arts Middle School!

612
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,630
How did you get your hands on this? Even I don't have this.

613
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:22,560
 It looks like you're familiar with the place of this photo. Do you remember it? 

614
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:27,300
At this time...we were a piano trio performing for a chamber music competition.

615
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,360
This friend is still my closest friend today...

616
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,080
and this friend...transferred from America.

617
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,440
 Is she your girlfriend?! 

618
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:40,060
She's my friend.

619
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:43,060
 A friend...who's a girl. 

620
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:46,190
 At that time, did you not have any girlfriends? 

621
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:49,450
 Even now, I don't have one. 

622
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:52,500
 Then you must have had crushes, yes? 

623
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,410
Yes.

624
00:58:56,630 --> 00:59:01,550
 - But why did they end as crushes? You should've played the piano for her. 
- Uh...

625
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:05,750
I did play the piano for her, but I guess she didn't like it.

626
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:11,290
 Could I ask which song you played...? 

627
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:13,570
I won't comment on that.

628
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:17,210
 Now, what to do? We've unfortunately come... 

629
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:20,750
 to the end of our talk concert. 

630
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:23,080
 - No! 
 - Don't go! 

631
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,580
 For the last item on our list, Park Joon Young has prepared... 

632
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:29,830
 one final song to play for all of you. 

633
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:32,420
 - And what will this final number be? 
-Hmm...

634
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:46,790
 What piece should I play that day? Is there anything you want to hear? 

635
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,610
 A piano song from Schumann 

636
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:58,630
 This is "Scenes from Childhood: Traumerei". 

637
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:25,630


638
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:28,720
♫   At the end of this road I've traveled multiple times   ♫

639
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,970
   

640
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:40,110
♫   your presence brings me joy. Even now, I'm happy.  ♫

641
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:46,520
♫   So this road that has grown familiar to us   ♫

642
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:56,560
♫   won't change, stay for me   ♫

643
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:00,200
♫   By my side, love   ♫

644
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:07,860
♫   I see your deep moonlight in my dreams   ♫

645
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:12,390
 Traumerei...  
 ♫   Even though I've seen your sky so many times, it still makes me happy   ♫

646
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:14,060
 Was this something I wasn't supposed to know? 

647
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:17,330
 This was merely one of many piano songs, and playing it wouldn't change anything. 

648
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:18,690
 It had no meaning, huh? 

649
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:21,300
 There can't be meaning between your relationship and mine. 

650
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,760
 You can go get some fresh air. Please just don't leave. 

651
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,490
 You've been recommended for a position as the professor of Soryeong U. School of Music. 

652
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:27,910
 That position is Jung Kyung's... 

653
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:29,870
 I tried to love you like I did her. 

654
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:31,280
 I couldn't do it. I'm sorry. 

655
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,320
 I have something planned after work tomorrow. 

656
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,380
 Song Ah! 

657
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,940
 I don't know why I keep thinking of you during hard days. 

658
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:39,670
 - Song Ah...by chance... 
 - Yes. 

659
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:40,890
♫  If we're together.  ♫

660
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:43,850
 I'd like that. 

661
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:48,390
♫  My deep emotions...  ♫
