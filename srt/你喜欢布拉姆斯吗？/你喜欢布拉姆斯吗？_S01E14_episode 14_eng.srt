1
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,980


2
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,250
Oh hey, Hyung.

3
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,890
Yeah, could you send me that address?

4
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,420
Yes, now. Hurry.

5
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:33,170
    
     
    

6
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,050
Ah yes,  Mr. Producer. What's this on Youtube right now?

7
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,230
- What happened to the song I submi— 
  - Ah, Professor! 

8
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,580
 I liked the song so much, I submitted it to that place. 

9
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,980
 I heard you recorded it casually. 

10
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,740
 My word, I was really surprised! 

11
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,180
Still, how could you do this without ever once consulting—

12
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,110
 Would it be rude to say it's much better than the actual album you were planning on publishing? 

13
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,820
 I told you I'd help you where I could! 

14
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,150
 Anyway, I'm in the middle of driving, so I'll talk to you later! 

15
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,270
I... wait... Pr—

16
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,970
    
    

17
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,450
    
    

18
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,110
     

19
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,900
- Professor... 
 - Why are you here at this late hour?

20
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,400
What do you mean?

21
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,550
That "Träumerei".

22
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,730
The "Träumerei" that you posted as your own, that was my playing!

23
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,910
But why is it posted as yours?

24
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,020
Did you install a recorder here?

25
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,330
Did you... really think that was you playing?

26
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,560
Well, should I be grateful for that?

27
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,640
There's no mistaking it. I recognize when I'm playing.

28
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,940
Well, then you should complain to the person who uploaded the song before you make a ruckus here.

29
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,320
At any rate, can you prove that it was your performance?

30
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,750
I'm sorry for coming here.

31
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,770
I was worried. You didn't pick up.

32
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,460
Have you listened to it?

33
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,760
It was you playing, right?

34
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,460
What happened?

35
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,190
Why is your performance under Professor Yoo Tae Jin's—

36
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,270
It's not my performance.

37
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,900
But it is you playing. Why do you lie?

38
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,340
It's nothing like that.

39
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,710
- Just... 
 - Do you realize what's happening?

40
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,500
This isn't something to gloss over.

41
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,180
Your music is getting plagiarized right now.

42
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,800
- Don't you need to take care of that? 
 - Jung Kyung...

43
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,250
I'll take care of it by myself.

44
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,930
Whether it's right or not is my business.

45
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,790
Thanks for worrying...

46
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,860
I'd like it if you don't come here anymore.

47
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,620
   

48
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,200
   

49
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,630
Jung Kyung,

50
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,610
I'd like it...

51
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,310
if you don't come here anymore.

52
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,440
You're going to cause misunderstandings if you visit at this hour.

53
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,760
Even if you're friends.

54
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:12,740
I think you should worry more about Joon Young than me.

55
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:37,800
    
    

56
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:52,020
 The sensors make a faithful recreation of the pianist's touch, down to the pedal steps. 

57
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,030
 If you're using it for lessons, don't you need the copying function too? 

58
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,300
- This copied what you just played, right? 
 - Yes.

59
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,570
I've heard about this kind of piano before, but... it's so fascinating!

60
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,540
I can write about this for my next interview, right?

61
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,050
   

62
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,820
   

63
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,630
 Could I practice at your office right now? 

64
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,540
Yeah, you go ahead and practice.

65
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,070
 Come in. 

66
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,930
 I'm about to leave, so practice comfortably. 

67
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,780
- Work hard 
 - Thank you.

68
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,360
   

69
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,900
Hello.

70
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,500
     

71
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:25,610
Yes, Mr. Producer. I just emailed it to you so have a casual listen to it.

72
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,050
Yes.

73
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:32,520
I mean, I just casually played it so no pressure.

74
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,730
   

75
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,490
   

76
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,640
   

77
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,170
 Hey, Kang Min Seong. We're just barely 20 now. 

78
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,820
 You can meet guys way better than Dong Yoon. 

79
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,010
 How do you know that? 

80
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,390
 Because you're my friend! 

81
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,460
 Song Ah... Song Ah! 

82
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,740
 Yeah... 

83
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,630
 Still, your hugging helps me. 

84
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,780
 - Really? 
 - Yeah. 

85
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,350
 That's a relief. 

86
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,250
 Song Ah, you too... 

87
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,180
 if you ever have a reason to cry, don't hesitate to call me. 

88
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,810
 Then I'll run to you right away. 

89
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,840
   

90
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,030
- You're home?
 - Yeah...

91
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,460
What's wrong? Did you fight with your boyfriend?

92
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,460
Huh? What's with her?

93
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,070
Did they really fight?

94
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,490
   

95
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,750
   

96
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,870
 Today is the last day... that I'll see Jung Kyung. 

97
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,490
 I'd like it... if you don't come here anymore. 

98
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,470
 I think you need to worry more about Joon Young than me. 

99
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,320
Want a drink?

100
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,510
Not really.

101
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,500
Why not?

102
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,160
Then I'll drink by myself here for a sec.

103
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,770
Drink in your own room.

104
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,970
I don't want to drink alone. I'll only be here for a sec.

105
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,680
What are you going to do?

106
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,810
Hmm?

107
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,690
Are you going to keep doing it?

108
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,920
What?

109
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,280
Your love!

110
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,340
Oh...

111
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,810
I don't know.

112
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,780
You don't know?

113
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,720
Why? You're always telling me to give up.

114
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,080
I was just saying that.

115
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,130
But I've always thought you were amazing.

116
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,460
It's not easy, right?

117
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,980
You started late and tried four times before getting into music school.

118
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,430
It's rare for someone to trust purely in their passions and do all of that.

119
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:02,470
But Unni... lately for me...

120
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,090
no matter how much I like it...

121
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:12,600
there are things I can't do with passion alone.

122
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,270
I've started thinking that.

123
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,000
Things you can't do?

124
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,050
Besides the violin, do you have anything else?

125
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,300
Hey if it isn't working out, it's okay to quit.

126
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,600
Who cares what others say?

127
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,500
You just need to choose the path of happiness.

128
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:55,360
Violin or otherwise. Didn't you choose it for your happiness?

129
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,430
I had a bunch of chores to do but ended up drinking beer instead.

130
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,770
Next time drink with me, okay?

131
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,690
Well, I'm going to head out now.

132
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,200
Sleep well.

133
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,320
You too, Unni.

134
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,970
     

135
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,050
Have you talked with Joon Young about this?

136
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,120
Yeah. He said he'd take care of it, but...

137
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,170
Of course, he'd say that.

138
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,740
There's something I wanted to ask you.

139
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,730
Truthfully, it's why I asked you out here.

140
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,280
What's the relationship like between Joon Young and Professor Yoo Tae Jin?

141
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,190
Thinking back, I don't think I've heard about the professor much from Joon Young...

142
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,680
much at all.

143
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,710
I don't know much, either.

144
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,050
But Professor Yoo and Joon Young never really got along to begin with.

145
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:29,120
What do you mean? Like how did they not get along?

146
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,340
You know the professors who mentally torment their students? He's one of those guys.

147
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:41,110
Even back when he was preparing for the Chopin competition, Joon Young suffered a lot of hardships.

148
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,190
If it was so hard for him, he should've spoken up and changed teachers.

149
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,350
When it comes to teachers, either the foundation or I could've found someone for him.

150
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,160
Who'd accept Joon Young?

151
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:58,780
Anyone who plays music in our country knows too well he's Professor Yoo's apprentice.

152
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,080
There are things even you can't do, Jung Kyung.

153
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,320
Still, I should've done something.

154
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,530
At the very least, we're still friends.

155
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,830
Jung Kyung to me...

156
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,250
you were never once my friend.

157
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,760
Regardless, we saw each other as man and woman for 10 years.

158
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,680
This is why after getting your call...

159
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,770
I had all sorts of thoughts while coming here.

160
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,900
Because the call wasn't from a friend...

161
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,680
but from you.

162
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,010
But now you come to me so casually as a friend?

163
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:27,170
Because I'd always be by your side no matter what,

164
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:36,460
I guess you never knew how much those words hurt me.

165
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,520
That's not it.

166
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,080
About Joon Young...

167
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,920
I don't know what to do either.

168
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,330
And I heard you had some major troubles too?

169
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,510
I'm going to leave first, okay?

170
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,660
     

171
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,530
Oh my God... what exactly is going on here?

172
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:27,320
I couldn't figure out any way to contact the channel moderator.

173
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,830
I'm sorry for bothering you like this.

174
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,250
No, no... just give me a sec.

175
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,800
Let me think for a moment.

176
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:40,580
First off, we can file a copyright claim.

177
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:46,520
But... I don't think it'll be easy to prove this was your performance.

178
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,030
But I'll at least do this. And I'll look up the channel moderator too.

179
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,770
Thanks, Noona.

180
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,910
- And on the legal side... 
 - No.

181
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,600
I don't want to go that far.

182
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,990
For now, don't even contact the professor either.

183
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,580
Why not?

184
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,950
For me, I just... want this music taken down quickly.

185
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,860
That's what's most urgent. That's all.

186
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,710
Why?

187
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,650
It's because of Song Ah.

188
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,810
I don't want her to know about it. That I played this song.

189
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,090
I feel like this would upset her.

190
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,570
I understand.

191
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,830
But... you have to tell Section Chief Park Song Jae.

192
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,920
Whether you like it or not, that man is your manager now.

193
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,860
Our foundation can't officially handle your business.

194
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,790
So you have to let him know.

195
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:58,880
Okay.

196
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,430
Did he secretly install a recording device or something?

197
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,590
It's incredible.

198
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,620
But Joon Young,

199
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,930
I'm sure you don't feel too exhilarated by this, but actually,

200
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,880
this could also become a good opportunity.

201
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,870
An opportunity?

202
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,070
Look.

203
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,450
That channel has many subscribers

204
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,390
and the reaction to the audio recording was good too.

205
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,370
But in truth, that recording was stolen.

206
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,830
It's Park Joon Young's.

207
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,570
If we say the teacher stole his pupil's piece...

208
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,840
how sexy is that?

209
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,280
Do you find this funny right now, Section Chief?

210
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,260
I'm not a section chief, I'm a representative.

211
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,000
And listen to me to the end.

212
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,030
This matter can be brought up on that reality program we talked about—

213
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:57,220
I told you I wouldn't go on that broadcast.

214
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,650
Then what on earth do you want to do, Park Joon Young?

215
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,100
You told me to schedule a concert or an event.

216
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,230
Don't you need money?

217
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,850
- What is it that you want? 
 - The deletion of the Träumerei recording.

218
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,540
Sorry?

219
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,950
That's all I want.

220
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,100
Just that?

221
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,910
Wait, Park Joon Young, that is something

222
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,520
I can do with just a phone call to the account's owner.

223
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,480
It's someone close to me. But right now— Ah, really.

224
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,270
This is seriously frustrating.

225
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,570
Your career is on the downslope and heaven is helping you to save it, but what are you trying to do here?

226
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,940
Okay. For Träumerei,

227
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,890
it's really a pity,

228
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,600
but if you want it so much, I'll see to it that it's taken down. So don't worry about it.

229
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,330
But please think again

230
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,980
about that reality program.

231
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,500
Okay?

232
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,950
Hello?

233
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,420
Ah, you're the person I called last time?

234
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,100
 Yes. Back then I told you I wasn't available to be your accompanist, 

235
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,710
 but I have some time now. 

236
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,860
 Have you found someone? 

237
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,870
 Joon Young, where are you? 

238
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,570
Yes, hello?

239
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,690
Song Ah, it's me.

240
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,580
 Yes. 

241
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,660
Did you eat?

242
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,630
Are you at school?

243
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,760
Yes, I'm in the practice room.

244
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,200
Are you also in school?

245
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,680
No, I had something to do outside.

246
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,090
Then when are you coming back?

247
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,680
Ah, for today...

248
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:48,170
Are you not coming to school today?

249
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,760
No, I am.

250
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,150
Then let's meet up later this evening.

251
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,690
I'll contact you when my class is over.

252
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,690
 It's because of Song Ah. 

253
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,220
 I don't want her to know that I played this piece. 

254
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,480
 I feel this would upset her. 

255
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,620
 I heard about the audio recording. Are you okay? 

256
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,290
Oh. Hey.

257
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,670
You— Is that the only sound you can get out?

258
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,520
Can't you bring something that's a little deeper?

259
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,820
Seriously.

260
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:12,250
Ji Won's mom. Is there anything you can do about her instrument?

261
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,230
Professor Choi Yeong Ho criticized her instrument last time,

262
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,040
I lost face then.

263
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,510
That is, Kyunghoo Cultural Foundation has some good instruments

264
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:26,100
that they lend to their scholarship students.

265
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,830
I'll make sure to apply for one next... time.

266
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,730
Ah, Kyunghoo Foundation?

267
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,130
Well, you're close to Jung Kyung after all.

268
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,560
So I guess you can do that.

269
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,980
No. No, Professor, we aren't close.

270
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,030
I don't even know her phone number.

271
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,220
Yes, sure.

272
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,290
Try again.

273
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,740
I see.

274
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,620
So this happened to Jung Kyung.

275
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,890
With Joon Young, and even Professor Song Jung Hee.

276
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:17,670
What can we do? I do feel bad for her,

277
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,860
but I can only hope she can get over it well.

278
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,350
Yes.

279
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:30,350
Has it been around fifteen years since we last talked about Jung Kyung for this long?

280
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:41,190
She's grown all of a sudden since then, and I became old.

281
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,860
And you're also a bit old now, aren't you?

282
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,380
Only Kyung Seon is still the same.

283
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:58,690
But you were by Jung Kyung's side all this time,

284
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,930
which was quite fortunate.

285
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,580
Is that so?

286
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,860
I also thought so,

287
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,510
but Jung Kyung said

288
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,210
that what gave her comfort wasn't me nor you.

289
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,610
She said it was

290
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,650
Joon Young playing that piano over there.

291
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:13,000
 I can't get in touch with the one operating that channel. 

292
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,680
 Anyway, I'll try to do something as soon as possible. 

293
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,320
 Alright, thank you. 

294
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,430
 Please do so. 

295
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,910
I'm here.

296
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,940
Hi, you've arrived?

297
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,220
Yesterday evening...

298
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,770
I went to the cafe to see you.

299
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,590
I'm sorry.

300
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,880
For not staying until you arrived.

301
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,240
So...

302
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,990
I went to your house that night.

303
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,180
But...

304
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,690
I saw Jung Kyung in front of your building.

305
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,820
Why did she come

306
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:52,680
to your house last night?

307
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,780
She came without telling me.

308
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:13,830
It looks like Jung Kyung... hasn't completely gotten over her feelings yet.

309
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,310
I'm sorry.

310
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,990
Why do you keep on apologizing?

311
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:51,900
You said you would wait, but you didn't. You said you wouldn't see her again, but you keep seeing her.

312
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,730
Why do you keep on doing things that need apologizing?

313
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,320
I don't understand why

314
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:07,320
I have to keep feeling uneasy all on my own while dating you.

315
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,820
Right now, I already have other difficulties on my shoulders.

316
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,590
Song Ah...

317
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,160
You keep on making excuses for Jung Kyung—

318
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,500
- They aren't excuses— 
 - If not, then?

319
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:32,690
Aren't you the one... who can't get over his feelings?

320
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,540
Song Ah!

321
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,520
I booked the room for 9 p.m.

322
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,090
I'm sorry.

323
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,300
We'll leave now.

324
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,690
Song Ah.

325
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,720
I'll get going.

326
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,430
   

327
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,190
Song Ah!

328
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,880
I'm sorry.

329
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,660
It's all my fault.

330
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:36,840
For not waiting for you until the end, for not contacting you,

331
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:44,430
for making you upset because of Jung Kyung all the time... I was wrong each time.

332
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,890
It's all my fault, so, please...

333
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,230
Please don't just leave like that.

334
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,550
Okay?

335
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:20,380
I heard a lot of good things about your master class.

336
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,230
Go ahead and do well till the end this time.

337
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,420
Why do you make that face?

338
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:44,430
Do you feel uncomfortable about becoming a professor after what happened to Jung Kyung?

339
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,470
Dong Yoon.

340
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,630
When I came back to Korea,

341
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,690
I was so excited.

342
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,160
Because I was finally living under the same sky as Jung Kyung.

343
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,580
But...

344
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,930
it's so difficult exactly because of that.

345
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:17,580
Seoul is too small, and the music world is even smaller,

346
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,090
so I keep on running into her and hearing rumors about her.

347
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,720
That's why it's tormenting me so much.

348
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:49,380
   

349
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,390
    

350
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,530
Welcome.

351
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,400
Mom.

352
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,500
Are you back from your private lesson?

353
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,990
It's late, why didn't you go home directly?

354
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,360
I wanted to see you.

355
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,080
I'm glad I have someone who comes to tell me they miss me,

356
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,740
and that my son is in Korea. That's nice.

357
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,340
Mom.

358
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,980
Yes?

359
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:09,560
   

360
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,160

388
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,530
Good morning.

389
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,730
- Ah, Hae Na. 
 - Yes?

390
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:59,340
If you aren't going to study abroad, do you want to work for my chamber orchestra?

391
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,970
Pardon? What about Song Ah Unni?

392
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,090
She says she won't do it. That she can't do it anymore.

393
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,830
I mean, she isn't even a member, how can a secretary behave this way?

394
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:13,500
I'm so dumbfounded.

395
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,160
Anyway, think about it and tell me. Okay?

396
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,000
Yes.

397
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,030
- Is your father well? 
 - Yes.

398
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,300
I'll call him.

399
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,160
Goodbye.

400
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,820
- Be sure to practice well for next time. 
 - Yes.

401
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,170
Professor.

402
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,160
Who—

403
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,860
You're Kyunghoo's...

404
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,520
Sorry?

405
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,680
 I had a phone call with that YouTuber.  

406
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,430
 He said he'll take down the audio recording within the next two hours.  

407
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,420
Thank you.

408
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,160
Yes.

409
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,450
 I'm sorry 

410
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,580
 for not staying until you arrived.  

411
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:34,500
 It looks like Jung Kyung... hasn't completely gotten over her feelings yet. 

412
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,360
 Aren't you the one...  

413
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,960
 who can't get over his feelings? 

414
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,810
Do I need to explain any further?

415
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:21,240
I knew as soon as I heard that recording.

416
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,890
That it was the same person playing it.

417
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,860
Take down the audio recording, and apologize to Joon Young.

418
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,950
Jung Kyung...

419
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:51,110
I told you.

420
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,300
I said I'd take care of it.

421
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:57,100
I'm sorry.

422
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,910
I got it.

423
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,850
Thanks anyway.

424
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,350
Go.

425
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:25,370
Träumerei... why did you play it?

426
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,780
You said you wouldn't play it again.

427
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,750
So why did you?

428
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,390
For fifteen years, I played Träumerei

429
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:56,260
every day before any other piece when sitting in front of the piano.

430
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:00,410
I wanted to give a farewell to that time.

431
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:07,030
That's why I played it. For the last time.

432
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,130
The last time?

433
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:15,450
Does Song Ah know about this matter?

434
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,370
So you hid it from her.

435
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:29,540
Joon Young, do you know why you hid this from her?

436
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,370
It's because the piece you played was Träumerei.

437
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,180
That's why you hoped Song Ah wouldn't know about it.

438
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,280
You still can't forget me.

439
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,850
That's also why you wanted that piece to be taken down as soon as possible before Song Ah knows.

440
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,670
No.

441
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:58,870
It's not because I can't forget you. It's because I like Song Ah.

442
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:04,710
Because I like her, I wished she wouldn't know.

443
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:12,020
Because I hoped she wouldn't get hurt over this for anything.

444
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,190
Song Ah.

445
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:59,390
Yes?

446
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:03,940
He started playing Träumerei again. Joon Young did.

447
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,580
Joon Young is playing Träumerei again.

448
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:16,690
If you're curious, you can listen to it. It was put on Youtube.

449
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,300
Sorry?

450
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,680
So you really don't know anything about this.

451
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:27,020
What was uploaded as Professor Yoo Tae Jin's piece is actually Joon Young's.

452
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,410
The piece he played again recently.

453
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:36,080
You know what Träumerei means to Joon Young, don't you?

454
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,360
Yes. But—

455
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:49,470
Joon Young... sent me a recording of him playing Träumerei on each of my birthdays.

456
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:55,530
But he played that piece again a few days ago.

457
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:58,160
Do you understand what it means?

458
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:50,050
♫  Like the winds that scatter  ♫

459
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:51,630
♫   I hope my sadness will disappear   ♫

460
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:54,530
 Shouldn't we believe it? 

461
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,640
 That music can be a source of comfort.  
 ♫  Like the flowers in the fields  ♫

462
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:04,390
 Because...  
 ♫  That had to endure many seasons before their bloom   ♫

463
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:09,770
 we have chosen to do music, after all. 

464
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:15,130
 I...  
 ♫   I sing so you can hear me   ♫

465
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:16,380
♫   My loved ones, here   ♫

466
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:20,060
 believed that from the bottom of my heart. 

467
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,390
♫   Let's all dream   ♫

468
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:25,500
 That's why... 

469
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,940
♫   Even in this world   ♫

470
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,190
 at this very moment,  

471
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:31,160
♫  that is often difficult and hard  ♫

472
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,800
 I wanted to receive just a little bit...  

473
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,120
♫   There will be a path for you  ♫

474
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,630
 just a tiny little bit,  

475
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:41,330
  of comfort.  

476
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:43,860
♫   Even about the uncertain future    ♫

477
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,640
 From what I loved,  

478
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,840
 and chose to love... 

479
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,990
♫   Let's no worry anymore   ♫

480
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:58,300
 music.  
 ♫   Wherever you may be  ♫

481
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:02,390
♫  Remember this   ♫

482
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:06,300
 But...  
 ♫   There will be a path for you  ♫

483
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,880
 that wish 

484
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,930
 was not granted.  

485
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:16,490
♫   There will be a path for you  ♫

486
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:24,650
The bridge fell? How?

487
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:27,900
Bridges don't fall easily.

488
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:33,430
It's a relief if it's only that the bridge fell. It'd be really bad if it caused a fracture to the body of the violin.

489
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,680
It could be irreparable then.

490
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,900
Chae Song Ah.

491
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,910
Yes?

492
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,310
Is something wrong?

493
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,920
No.

494
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,810
Look at me. Look here.

495
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,870
Why?

496
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,160
What's wrong?

497
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,300
Nothing, nothing at all.

498
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:47,540
I'm going to go out for a bit.

499
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,610
Where are you going?

500
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,390
To the supermarket.

501
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:52,330
Min Seong...

502
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,520
 Joon Young, 

503
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:34,640
let's... end this.

504
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,800
What?

505
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:46,750
Let's... stop dating.

506
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:53,710
I... can't do this anymore.

507
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:55,500
Song Ah.

508
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,400
This is hard for me, Joon Young.

509
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:07,530
I feel anxious, hurt, and shaken.

510
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:15,920
I wanted to do everything well.

511
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,980
The violin... and with you too.

512
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:30,130
But... there are things I can't do well no matter what.

513
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:34,200
I understand that now.

514
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,420
Because of you...

515
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:50,850
No... because of my feelings that are swayed by you...

516
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:54,300
it feels like everything is ruined.

517
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,770
I no longer want that.

518
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:10,110
There was a time... when I felt less anxious than now.

519
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,750
Even when things were difficult and I hurt,

520
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:18,010
I still walked my path fine on my own.

521
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:26,490
At the very least, I knew where I was going.

522
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:30,100
I want to go back to that time.

523
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,870
I'm sorry.

524
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:46,160
I'm sorry, Song Ah, for making you anxious.

525
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:52,820
This... this was all my fault, so please—

526
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:56,550
I wanted to lean on you.

527
00:54:56,550 --> 00:55:00,480
Lean on me. You can lean on me, whatever is hard for you, you can—

528
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,780
How can I lean on you?

529
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:10,340
How could I lean on you when you're less sure of yourself than I am?

530
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,590
I heard it. Träumerei.

531
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:25,540
Song Ah, that... was the last time I played it.

532
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:26,400
It was really the last time.

533
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,150
I tried to understand your feelings for Jung Kyung.

534
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:38,690
Even though you said you no longer loved her, I wanted to understand those complicated feelings you couldn't get rid of.

535
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,410
Maybe you were suffering more

536
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:49,440
than me who was watching you like this.

537
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:54,030
That's what I tried to convince myself of.

538
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:59,220
But... you also said this, didn't you?

539
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:05,470
 Is it okay for me to not go? 

540
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,970
 Yes. It's okay. 

541
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:14,820
 Think only about yourself. Don't think about others. 

542
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:23,530
That's why... I'm going to think about myself now.

543
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:32,520
While I was trying to understand you, I've hurt my own feelings too much.

544
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,220
I no longer want that.

545
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:44,810
I just... want to think about myself.

546
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:57,830
It's... too difficult...

547
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,800
for me to love you.

548
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,410
I'm not happy.

549
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:54,000
   

550
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:33,240
Please take this.
