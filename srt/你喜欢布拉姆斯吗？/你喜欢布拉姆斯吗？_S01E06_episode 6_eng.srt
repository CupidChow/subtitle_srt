1
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,590
   

2
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,290
 Yes, then I'll see you soon. 

3
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,060
Yes.

4
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,070
I'm sorry? You can't make it?

5
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,920
Professor, that's why...

6
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,290
I see...

7
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,430
Yes, yes. I understand.

8
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,290
Will someone not be able to make it?

9
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:08,000
It was Celloist Professor Jung Sae Hoon. Something came up so he said he couldn't attend.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,370
I mean, the audition's about to start and now he tells us?

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,440
It's Professor Lee Bo Ram. Just a sec.

12
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,970
Oh, I also just got a message, one moment, please.

13
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,620
What? Violinist Professor Lee Bo Ram said she also couldn't make it.

14
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,390
What? What are they trying to do?

15
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,360
Give me the phone so I can talk to them.

16
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,970
No, no, wait just a second.

17
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,690
Someone else can't come?

18
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,550
I think it's better you don't call.

19
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,690
- Why?
- Why?

20
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,980
Both Jung Sae Hoon and Lee Bo Ram work at Ojun U, right?

21
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,650
Right now their social media page is on fire.

22
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,540
What's wrong?

23
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,210
They're involved in a scandal.

24
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:55,130


25
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,620
I need to throw this away.

26
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,110
   

27
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,280
 My assistant Hyung Jung is so good at her work. 

28
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,030
 If you don't have any connections, you need to make them. 

29
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,690
 At any rate, Chae Song Ah is good at her work. 

30
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,820
 She's fast on her feet and is very sensible. 

31
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,220
Graduate school?

32
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,840
Yes, our school's graduate program. Come and apply for our master's program.

33
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,910
I've watched you for 4 years, so know you're smart and have good comprehension.

34
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,520
It's just that you started music so late.

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Honestly, school life has been a little overwhelming hasn't it?

36
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,670
Why? Do you not like it?

37
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,910
N-no, no. Of course not!

38
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,870
Then what?

39
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:19,420
Well, it's just...you would tell other students

40
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:26,070
which country, which school, and even which professor to meet.

41
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,420
- You've only been silent around me.
- Ah...

42
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,400
So it must have been hard for you!

43
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,070
That was on purpose!

44
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,170
I selfishly wanted to keep you to myself for a little longer.

45
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,100
Come to our graduate program

46
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,160
and let's enjoy playing music for two more years with me, okay?

47
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,460
Yes!

48
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:02,760
    
   

49
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,570
If you standardized the scoring to 100 points as the max score,

50
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,920
after removing the top and lowest scores, we'll determine the average scoring.

51
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,230
 For today's audition, we won't distinguish between majors but will have them all together. 

52
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,750
We've divided the applicants into groups of four.

53
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:22,010
When they arrive on time for the audition, the plan is to determine the order by lottery.

54
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,460
Between each audition will be a 20-minute break.

55
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,940
 I wanted to thank you again for making time out of your busy schedule to judge these young artist auditions. 

56
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,460
Then, I will leave this in your hands!

57
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,870
 Shall we begin? 

58
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,150
 Group A will now enter. 

59
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,560
   

60
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,830
   

61
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,290
 Thank you for your hard work today. 

62
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,330
 Thank you. 

63
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,870
Yes. You did well.

64
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,880
I didn't know you'd be here.

65
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,240
I didn't know either.

66
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,060
That...why are you still wearing it?

67
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,520
You and I are through, aren't we?

68
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,090
Jung Kyung...

69
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,640
So why are you wearing it?

70
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,090
Let's talk for a second.

71
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,260
I have nothing else to say.

72
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,710
- Goodbye.
- Have a safe trip home!

73
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,760
I'm so tired!

74
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,480
   

75
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,130
Do you want to leave first?

76
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,770
Young In Unni probably called us without knowing about us.

77
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:45,310
So I intend to tell her about us now. Then it's going to be very inconvenient for you.

78
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,840
So you should leave now.

79
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,230
I clearly warned you. From here on, it's your fault.

80
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,330
I called you on short notice, so I'm very thankful for you two.

81
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,190
Judging was hard wasn't it?

82
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,210
- Not at all.
- It was fine.

83
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,260
Do you have any plans? Cleaning up should be quick.

84
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,720
Have a bite to eat before you leave. I'll buy you something nice.

85
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,320
Ah...A date?

86
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,350
 Let me join you guys for just today! 

87
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,980
- Unni...
- Hmm?

88
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,640
We broke up.

89
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,070
I said we broke up.

90
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,180
I...see...

91
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:53,580
So...I think you'll have to change the program for the Foundation's Anniversary Concert.

92
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,240
The piano trio will no longer work out.

93
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,130
I see. All right.

94
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,260
Then I'll take my leave first.

95
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,200
Lee Jung Kyung...

96
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,990
Han Hyeon Ho...did you really intend to marry me?

97
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,780
Where does that confidence come from?

98
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,910
Do you have even a single thing to offer me?

99
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,280
I'm sick of you now.

100
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,030
Lee Jung Kyung is so harsh, isn't she?

101
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:50,360
♫   I'm reminded again of you who drifted away,  ♫

102
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,700
♫   though I loved you   ♫

103
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:02,620
♫  The radiant memories of our past days   ♫  

104
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,050
♫   come visit me again  ♫

105
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,100
It's done!

106
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,190
See? Jung Kyung I told you I could do it.

107
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,360
If it breaks again next time, I'll fix it again for you.

108
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,630
Just believe me.

109
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:23,280
♫   I must have loved you too much  ♫

110
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:31,360
♫   Because I miss you, I cry out your name   ♫

111
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:38,630
♫   Even if it's just a lingering attachment, I'll have no regrets   ♫

112
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:47,160
♫   Can you hear my heartfelt story?   ♫

113
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,790
♫   Without you, I'm nothing   ♫

114
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,680
   

115
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,450
   

116
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,820
   

117
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,950
Hello?

118
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,200
Joon Young.

119
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,030
 Yes. 

120
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,860
I was just wondering...

121
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,300
I'm looking around.

122
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,260
Yes, yes...thank you.

123
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,540
 Um...but by chance... 

124
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,000
Is there... any way to hurry it up?

125
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,950
How long are you going to keep this up?

126
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,950
 I thought Father wasn't doing that anymore. 

127
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,920
Before you use the money, please tell the people around you.

128
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,500
Your son isn't a wealthy pianist, but a penniless nobody.

129
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,370
 Is 20 million won child's play? 

130
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,470
I'll send you everything I have. It's not much.

131
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,930
Okay, thank you.

132
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:01,830
 It's all I have, so take care of the rest on your own. 

133
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,790
   
   

134
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Thank you very much.

135
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,190
I'm sorry for coming here so suddenly.

136
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,340
I mean, I live here so...

137
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,530
Would you like a cloth to clean your instrument with?

138
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,670
- Sure. 
- Okay. Just a sec.

139
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,860
Does Song Ah come here frequently?

140
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,300
Song Ah? Occasionally?

141
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,150
Why?

142
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,760
Oh, it's just...you two look close.

143
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,210
How close are you?

144
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,440
What kind of question is that?

145
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,580
Well...we're close. We've known each other for a while.

146
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,780
Like you and Park Joon Young?

147
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,490
Here.

148
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,090
Thanks.

149
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,390
Nowadays it's Hyeon Ho that I see more often than Song Ah.

150
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,120
Is his girlfriend not meeting him?

151
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,060
I'm leaving. I've taken up too much of your time.

152
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,830
Jung Kyung.

153
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,790
Hyeon Ho...

154
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,730
don't burn him out too much.

155
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,470
Does he have no feelings just because he's nice?

156
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,980
Of those two... give one to Hyeon Ho.

157
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,470
Next time come together.

158
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,650
We...broke up.

159
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,370
   
   

160
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,890
   

161
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,060
- Hello?
- Yeah.

162
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,950
Joon Young.

163
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,140
Ah, yes, Director Na.

164
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,530
 You've been doing well right? I saw you texted me. 

165
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,930
Ah...yes.

166
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,900
 Why? Is something wrong? 

167
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:06,930
That is... I contacted you because I think there's been a mistake.

168
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,740
A mistake?

169
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,350
I checked a few minutes ago and noticed you deposited money into my account yesterday.

170
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,640
I can't help but think you sent it by mistake.

171
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,710
It's a performance fee. You came over to perform for us last time.

172
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,680
I'm sorry?

173
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,250
 You and I...are foundation administrator to musician. 

174
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,980
It's a give and take relationship.

175
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:38,360
 That way...we can avoid any sort of misunderstanding. 

176
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,030
Ah...no, I just can't accept this.

177
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,470
Why? Was the amount too little?

178
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:48,270
No, it's not that...That day I was the one performing.

179
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,510
Please don't do this. I'll return the money.

180
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:57,850
Joon Young. Did you not understand that I do not want there to be any misunderstanding between us?

181
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,500
Director Na...

182
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,520
I do not want to be indebted to anyone.

183
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,610
I'm hanging up now.

184
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,930
Joon Young. What's the occasion?

185
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,830
Let's go in.

186
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,740
Jung Kyung isn't home.

187
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,000
I wonder what could bring you to me at this hour?

188
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:12,520
It's the money you sent me. I don't want to accept it.

189
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,840
You don't have the guts to accept a mere 20 million won?

190
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,910
Of the kids doing music, how many of them do you think have the chance to spend one-on-one time with me?

191
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:31,260
You've been by my side for 15 years, yet what have you gained from me?

192
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,800
From the moment I had to pester you because you couldn't handle that piano, I had already given up on you.

193
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,620
I didn't expect you to be like that this whole time.

194
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,130
Now go.

195
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,300
That piano...

196
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,170
every time I tried to play, the keys were too heavy.

197
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,070
Because of that piano... I've never once followed my heart.

198
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,200
The things I wanted and the things I envied.

199
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,560
I kept those feelings hidden and persevered, but...

200
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,810
is that something to be so ashamed about?

201
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,640
Joon Young, this is why you can't make it.

202
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,320
Director.

203
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,790
I'm oka...

204
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,900
Director Na!

205
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,280
He read it.

206
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,690
   

207
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,170
   

208
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,820
Good evening.

209
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,460
Good evening.

210
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,680
Well, then.

211
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,060
Song Ah.

212
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,770
Yes?

213
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:44,230
It's been fifteen years. Me and Joon Young.

214
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,890
Yes, I know.

215
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,220
Stay out of our business.

216
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,960
Yes, Joon Young?

217
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,690
What?

218
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,510
Okay, I got it.

219
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,490
Taxi!

220
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,470
Joon Young. What about Grandma?

221
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,870
She's in surgery right now.

222
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,190
Don't worry, the doctor said she'll be fine.

223
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:43,000
   

224
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,160
Stay here a second.

225
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,980
Please stay with me. I'm scared.

226
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:26,440
   

227
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,850
 Is something wrong?  

228
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,260
Be safe on your way back.

229
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,040
You did well, hurry up home and get some rest.

230
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:59,760
   

231
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,480
Mom.

232
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,520
Joon Young!

233
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,090
   

234
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,900
I just feel a little bit, a tiny little bit, under the weather.

235
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,230
I'm not asking about what you think it is. What did the doctor say?

236
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,190
Well, it's not cancer or anything...

237
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:04,630
I keep seeing objects in double, so I went to a clinic in the neighborhood,

238
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,060
but they told me to go to a bigger hospital.

239
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,980
So what did they say there?

240
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:18,110
They said there's something... slightly wrong with a blood vessel in my head.

241
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,460
Then what did they say to do?

242
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,870
To get surgery.

243
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,880
- Can you get better with surgery? Did they say you'll be fine? 
 - Yes.

244
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,730
They said so, but...

245
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,890
Then ask them to book you a surgery date as soon as possible.

246
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,840
But...

247
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,500
- They said it'll cost almost twenty million won  (≈ $20,000) . 
 - But—

248
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,090
 How long are you going to keep this up? 

249
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,130
 Is twenty million won child's play? 

250
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,460
Mom.

251
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:09,940
Mom, don't tell me... When you said you needed twenty million won, was that...

252
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,490
Was that for your surgery?

253
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,270
- Joon Young, the thing is— 
 - Mom!

254
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,110
Why didn't you tell me? I thought it was for Father again!

255
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:26,860
No, your father is still getting support from Director—

256
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,230
From Director Na?

257
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,170
No, that's not it, Joon Young—

258
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,930
"Still"?

259
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:43,110
Has Director Na been helping Father out all this time?

260
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,800
Dad.

261
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,750
Hi, Jung Kyung. What about Mother?

262
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,150
They said she'll be alright.

263
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,610
 Why on earth? 

264
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,020
Why do you keep accepting money from Director Na? Why?!

265
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,520
I didn't take it because I wanted to.

266
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,740
Jung Kyung interfered again, saying she would do it for us.

267
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,250
- Jung Kyung? 
 - Yes.

268
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,990
What could I do, then?

269
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:24,020
Jung Kyung knows our situation and wants to help you, that's why she does it.

270
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,230
So you're saying that Jung Kyung knows about this?

271
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,220
Of course she knows, how could she not?

272
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:36,720
I also felt uncomfortable asking her, that's why I contacted you this time.

273
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,030
Mom.

274
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,850
How much more pitiable must I become in front of Jung Kyung?

275
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,520
Do you know what I think whenever I see her?

276
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,350
Joon Young, I...

277
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:46,080
   

278
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,940
   

279
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:57,470
 I also decided to pretend like nothing happened, like you said.  

280
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,020
 So be at ease and come.  

281
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,950
The stress of graduate school is this scary.

282
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,560
What are you talking about?

283
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,970
These days are the best.

284
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,740
Owner Yoon! Here you are.

285
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,430
I'm telling you I'm only a small business owner.

286
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,340
- Beer? 
 - No, no.

287
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,530
I'll have water.

288
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,500
What about Song Ah?

289
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,430
She sent a message just now, saying she suddenly couldn't come.

290
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,000
Okay, here! Since we're all here, let's toast.

291
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,480
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers! Nice to see you!

292
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,400
Hey, Eun Ji. Dong Yoon is here, so you can ask him.

293
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,580
 Ask what? 

294
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,680
The newbie in our group says she doesn't have a boyfriend. Do you want me to introduce you to her?

295
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,770
Sorry, sorry. Did I go too far, in front of the ex-girlfriend?

296
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,480
Hey, no, not at all, don't worry.

297
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,710
- Do it for him! 
 - Right?

298
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,040
Go on blind dates. A hundred or a thousand times.

299
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,280
Don't you have any male newbie?

300
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,460
Male newbie...?

301
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,760
Song Ah.

302
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,750
I'm sorry for not replying to you yesterday.

303
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,440
I had something going on.

304
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,820
It's alright.

305
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,120
Was it about Jung Kyung?

306
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,820
I was with her yesterday evening.

307
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,950
When you called her.

308
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:18,290
Aren't you curious about the good thing that happened?

309
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:21,570
Ah, right. You said something nice happened.

310
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,510
What is it?

311
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:28,980
I decided to take the exam for graduate school, at Seoryeong University.

312
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,320
Ah, really?

313
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,480
You'll do well.

314
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,520
Thank you.

315
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,290
You...

316
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,250
said we should be friends, right?

317
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,890
But...

318
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:05,080
I'm sorry for going back on my words about how you can call me whenever you have a hard time,

319
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:12,890
but I don't think I want to be that kind of friend with you.

320
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:24,490
You say you want to see me when you're having a hard time. So you asked to meet,

321
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,840
but you don't say anything about what happened

322
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,650
or what is giving you a hard time.

323
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,370
That kind of thing...

324
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:46,570
That's not the kind of friend... I want to be.

325
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:53,000
♫   These tears that have gotten cold  cannot be considered part of our farewell   ♫

326
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,790
I'm sorry.

327
00:31:54,790 --> 00:32:00,430
♫   Come back to me a bit less late   ♫

328
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:05,390
  "I'm sorry" wasn't what I wanted to hear.   
 ♫   Even these tears that are falling  ♫

329
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,520
 "Something happened today."  
 ♫   will become   ♫

330
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,140
 "So I was glad."  
 ♫   part of my last farewell   ♫

331
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,210
 "I'm upset", "It's hard", "I feel like crying"...  
♫  to you, be well   ♫

332
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:24,900
♫   Only one, just one thing I hope you won't forget  ♫

333
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:30,350
 I wanted to be friends  

334
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,060
 who can talk about these things. 

335
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:37,550
♫   Even these tears that are falling  ♫

336
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:41,730
♫   will become   ♫

337
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:48,100
♫   part of my last farewell to you, be well.    ♫

338
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,930
   

339
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,940
Unbelievable, he's so crazy!

340
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,150
Hae Na, did your boyfriend send this to you?

341
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,180
Yes, because it's my last day of internship.

342
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:05,770
It's not like you're retiring. You're just finishing your internship, why send something that's as big as a person?

343
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:09,280
Section Chief, if you're envious, just be honest and say so.

344
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,520
No, no, I'm really not envious at all. You can't even eat this.

345
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,310
You worked hard all this time.

346
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,570
You as well, Song Ah.

347
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,100
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you.

348
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,400
It must be really expensive.

349
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,410
It's pretty, isn't it?

350
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,910
Ji Won's Mother, hello.

351
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,090
Why did my kid fail the audition?

352
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:32,650
- I wouldn't be acting this way if another kid played even nearly as well as Jiwon. 
 - Madam,

353
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:36,450
- please calm down— 
 - So show me the grading table.

354
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:47,120
But honestly, even if you go quibble about it to the one who gave fifty points, if they say they did so because that's what they felt,

355
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,730
then there's nothing you can say.

356
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,890
This is so immature, what is she doing?

357
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:58,430
Madam!

358
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:02,020
Alright. Let's ask all of you, since you're here.

359
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,330
Excuse me, madam...

360
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:07,270
You heard my Ji Won's performance at the director's house last time, didn't you?

361
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:11,830
Tell me how was my kid's performance that day.

362
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,920
Madam, listen...

363
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,910
You.

364
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:18,760
You were the page-turner that day, weren't you?

365
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,290
Excuse me?

366
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:25,560
It is you. Then tell me.

367
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,160
How was my kid's performance?

368
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:47,470
In my opinion, Ji Won...

369
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:54,900
She seems to have an impressive talent.

370
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,120
Look.

371
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,030
She said she has an impressive talent. So how could she fail the audition here?

372
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,500
That's why, madam...

373
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:08,020
I think whether she fails or passes an audition,

374
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,450
doesn't have much significance to her at the moment.

375
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,840
Sorry? What are you talking about?

376
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,820
Then are you telling me to say it's fine and move on, whenever she gets disqualified from an audition or a competition?

377
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:25,550
No. Competitions and auditions are important, of course.

378
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:29,160
However, I think that if Ji Won

379
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,770
doesn't get hung up on ranks or results,

380
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:37,210
and if you silently trust and watch over her,

381
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:41,820
she will definitely become an admirable violinist.

382
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:50,160
But why would I believe what you're telling me?

383
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,130
I am also majoring in violin.

384
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:59,830
I understand even better, because I'm playing the same instrument.

385
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:07,230
I know how great is Ji Won's talent.

386
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:15,770
She has such talent and is so good at this. It won't do if she grows to dislike it.

387
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:34,180
You're going through this much because of me. What should I do?

388
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,180
Your university is starting soon, right?

389
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,850
Yes.

390
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:48,210
Whenever you would get this or that rank at a competition,

391
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,900
everyone said you were impressive, so I thought "that must be so".

392
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:57,220
That used to feel so far from my reality. But you graduating from Seoryeong University,

393
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,220
is what I like the best.

394
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:07,200
I'm so grateful to Director Na.

395
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:12,400
But, uhm...

396
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,740
What happened to the money needed for the surgery?

397
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,240
I took care of it.

398
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,270
You had money?

399
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,160
I got some.

400
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,340
From where?

401
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:32,060
I'll come back tomorrow. Get some rest.

402
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,690
Alright.

403
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,970
Be careful on your way.

404
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,960
Goodbye.

405
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,000
You have such a filial son.

406
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,170
   

407
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:08,630
   

408
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,940
Thank you.

409
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,450
Which days do you want?

410
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,700
Sorry?

411
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:42,390
Don't act so surprised. I'm planning on taking time off for your lessons during the second semester.

412
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,630
Hurry up and submit your application form for academic tutor.

413
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,350
Don't go over the deadline and then bother my teaching assistant with it. Okay?

414
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,240
Yes.

415
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,890
So is it the last semester for the both of you?

416
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,350
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

417
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:06,490
So you spent your last holiday in our foundation. I hope you had a good time.

418
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,080
I really enjoyed it.

419
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,470
Me too!

420
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,920
Have you taken a decision yet, Hae Na? To study abroad?

421
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:20,230
I probably will. I'm not completely decided yet.

422
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:25,650
What about you, Song Ah? Have you decided what to do after you graduate?

423
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,460
Yes.

424
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:32,350
 Can I ask you what it is? 

425
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:36,950
I plan on going to graduate school at Seoryeong University.

426
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:42,600
Unni, you need to discuss these things with the professor first.

427
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,810
Yes. I discussed with her, and decided to take the exam.

428
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,990
Okay, shall we toast?

429
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,980
Let's toast for Song Ah to be accepted into graduate school.

430
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,550
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

431
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:10,000
 How much more pitiable must I become in front of Jung Kyung? 

432
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,230
 Do you know what I think whenever I see her? 

433
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,340
Welcome in.

434
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,950
Have you been well?

435
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,070
What's the occasion?

436
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,680
I bought instant tteokbokki.

437
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:07,600
Hey. What's the difference between instant tteokbokki and regular tteokbokki?

438
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,280
I'm just curious...

439
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:19,930
how you became obsessed with instant tteokbokki.

440
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:28,420
Instant tteokbokki is usually not sold in single-portions.I like it because they come in two servings or more.

441
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,430
It makes me feel I have someone to eat it with.

442
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,010
I guess so.

443
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,490
My mom was admitted to the hospital.

444
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,770
Why? Is she sick?

445
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:56,410
Something was wrong with a blood vessel in her brain, so she had surgery.

446
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,900
Is she okay now?

447
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,180
Well, that's what the doctor said.

448
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,960
But... I'm not okay.

449
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,620
Why not?

450
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:19,320
I had to borrow money for the surgery... from Director Na.

451
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:29,070
For almost 7 years...

452
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:34,540
I've played anywhere from 100-120 performances a year.

453
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,070
I had 3 million won in my bank account. (~$3,000)

454
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,230
And your father?

455
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,680
No money, of course.

456
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,410
Even though my mom is hospitalized, I guess he doesn't intend to visit.

457
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:59,360
Still, it's nice to be in Korea together.

458
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,290
I can come see your face whenever.

459
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:10,820
Even if you're busy because of school, come see our performances occasionally, okay?

460
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,910
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

461
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:16,000
If nothing else, I'll make sure to come to the foundation anniversary concert.

462
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,190
Joon Young, Lee Jung Kyeong, and Han Hyeon Ho.

463
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:24,390
It'll be my first time seeing their piano trio in person. I'm very excited for it.

464
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:26,620
Excuse me for a moment.

465
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,550
Team Leader,

466
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:35,260
Can you call Master Park Joon Young and ask him to come?

467
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,160
What is it?

468
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,100
I just want to use this position I have as a big fan of his.

469
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,850
You sure like to look for opportunities in the weirdest places.

470
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:46,750
I mean not only does he eat by himself,

471
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:50,100
but he also lives in the officetel just over there, too.

472
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,230
I can ask, but don't get your hopes up.

473
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,030
I love you, Team Leader!

474
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:04,410
I think I feel a little more alive after talking with you.

475
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,950
Is that so?

476
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:13,080
I feel like dying.

477
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,720
Huh?

478
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,100
 Excuse me. Can you ring me up for this? 

479
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,750
Sure thing.

480
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,290
Hey, Joon Young. Have you eaten dinner?

481
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:34,350
Not yet.

482
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,750
Are you out?

483
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,830
- Yes. I'm at Hyeon Ho's store. 
 - Oh.

484
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:42,440
I see.

485
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,850
I thought I'd ask you something before I forget.

486
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,210
 Yes, what is it? 

487
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,870
You remember our anniversary concert, right? The one where you're playing as a trio?

488
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,180
Yes.

489
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,630
 Did you talk it over with the others? 

490
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:00,750
 It'd be a bit awkward to just perform as planned, right? 

491
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,300
Noona, uh...

492
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,590
I don't quite understand...

493
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,590
So the others haven't told you yet?

494
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:19,580
 I'll just share with you the facts. 

495
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,610
 Traumerei is just one of countless other songs. 

496
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,820
That is all.

497
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:52,470
There's no pain from not playing it, and there's nothing that'll change from playing it.

498
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,410
Wow, this is like...

499
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,130
The bouquet is as big as a person.

500
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:12,090
Your boyfriend must like you tons.

501
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:15,500
Of course! I knew from the very beginning...

502
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,420
that he liked me.

503
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,060
If you really liked someone, you wouldn't confuse them.

504
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:25,010
Is it not really liking someone if it's confusing?

505
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,090
I... Not me.

506
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:37,110
That is...my friend! Uh...

507
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:43,330
It feels like there's interest, but they can't tell if it's mutual or a one-way crush.

508
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:46,200
You must ask to be sure. "What are we doing?"

509
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,350
"Let's make it clear." Tell them to ask about it.

510
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:52,310
What if it wasn't anything? That's so embarrassing...

511
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,000
That's better!

512
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,440
Why waste your emotions on nothing? Everyone has their own thing to do.

513
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,050
 Drink up. Cheers. 

514
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:06,010
So...I also have a friend...

515
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,330
Never mind. I'm just...

516
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:17,290
I hate it the most when people back out like that.

517
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:18,810
What's your friend's problem?

518
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,860
Oh, no. It's...it's nothing at all.

519
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:26,240
Team Leader! Did Master Park Joon Young say he'll come?

520
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:31,800
I called him. But he said he's with someone right now.

521
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,020
He had plans...

522
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,490
What were you all discussing?

523
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:39,070
Giving Song Ah dating advice!

524
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:41,470
Oh! No, it's nothing like that!

525
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,330
Oh...Miss Song Ah!

526
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,640
It's not me. It's my friend, my friend.

527
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,700
Of course, of course. It's not you, but your friend. So what about that friend?

528
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,950
 Just say it. 

529
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:02,790
That is...there's this guy...

530
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,970
It seems like he only calls when he's lonely or going through a hard time.

531
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:09,890
Says he wants to see her and that he wants to meet her.

532
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:17,800
But when he finally does see her, I guess he doesn't tell her why he's struggling or what was wrong.

533
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,290
Things she really wants to hear about.

534
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,900
How horrible of him.

535
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:31,920
They're probably not at the "interested" phase or anything like that, right?

536
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,880
They're definitely not.

537
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,410
That means he likes her, for sure.

538
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,560
I mean, it's because he has feelings for her that he keeps thinking of her...

539
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,150
and so he keeps calling her.

540
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:52,180
He keeps wanting to lean on her.

541
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,370
That's what it is.

542
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:05,620
Did you...break up with Jung Kyung?

543
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,190
We just had a disagreement, nothing serious. You see,

544
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,050
Why am I making excuses to you?

545
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:21,390
What kind of disagreement makes me hear about it from someone else?

546
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:23,950
 Excuse me. Some cigarettes, please. 

547
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:25,550
Okay.

548
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,780
I'm busy. Leave.

549
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,840
 - Oh. Joon Young. 
- Lee Jung Kyung.

550
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,420
- Did you really break up with...?
-  Yeah. 

551
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:52,430
I told him to break up with me.

552
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,170
Lee Jung Kyung!

553
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:59,970
What goes through your mind every time you see me?

554
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,390
What are you thinking?

555
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,540
 I'm so sleepy. 

556
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:16,100
 Watch where you're going! 

557
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,470
Hello?

558
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:19,180
Your phone!

559
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,360
 Hello? Lee Jung Kyung! 

560
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,070
Yes. I'm still here.

561
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:31,370
Did you drink?

562
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,590
Where are you right now? Are you still out?

563
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,850
I'm in front of your home.

564
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:46,570
I'll be right there. Go in, don't wait outside.

565
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:50,680
I'll text you my PIN, so stay inside, okay?

566
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:26,140
   

567
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:34,820
My taxi is almost here.

568
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,860
What about yours?

569
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,510
They say they'll be here soon. Get in, Team Leader.

570
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:41,390
Goodbye.

571
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:44,480
Alright. Well, then.

572
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,210
- Ah, Song Ah. 
 - Yes?

573
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,910
It's nothing.

574
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:55,050
You worked hard all this time.

575
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:58,010
Let's keep seeing each other.

576
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:00,780
Yes. Thank you for everything.

577
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,200
I am the one who is thankful.

578
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,360
Be safe on your way back.

579
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,280
- Goodbye. 
 - Yes, bye.

580
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,110
     

581
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:04,400

614
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:13,150
- Unni, you must have practiced really hard during the school break. 
 - Huh?

615
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:16,150
Your scar here is more visible.

616
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:17,580
- Ah, is it? 
 - Yes.

617
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:21,510
But you said you were doing an internship. Did you have any time to practice?

618
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:26,390
Well, I just practiced on weekends and a little bit at work during lunch breaks.

619
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:29,020
At work during lunch breaks? Where?

620
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,520
There's a rehearsal room there.

621
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,510
There was such a thing.

622
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:37,260
Musicians would also come and practice there.

623
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,490
Which musicians?

624
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:42,020
Park Joon...

625
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:45,870
Park who?

626
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,690
Park Joon Young.

627
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:56,200
- Amazing! You met Park Joon Young then?  
 - Yes.

628
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,270
Soo Jeong, let's go for lunch.

629
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:59,770
Unni, lunch.

630
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,900
You guys can eat by yourselves.

631
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,430
Enjoy your lunch, then!

632
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:34,170
 I thought that once the calluses on my fingertips became firmer, 

633
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:38,600
 my heart would grow firmer calluses as well. 

634
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,340
 I told myself that, anyway, 

635
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,660
 there wasn't anything particular between us... 

636
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:57,970
 And that thus... I would be alright now. 

637
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:06,750
 I chanted that mantra to myself everyday, but... 

638
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:29,160
Song Ah!

639
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:35,550
Song Ah.

640
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,900
Song Ah.

641
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:47,670
Are you alright?

642
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:59,740
♫   Think about you, your everything   ♫

643
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,590
♫   I wanna stay   ♫

644
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:07,930
Yes, I'm fine. 
 ♫   Always by your side   ♫

645
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:11,700
 No.    
 ♫   I watch a transparent you   ♫

646
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,090
♫   My lips call   ♫

647
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:17,870
 I'm not fine.   
 ♫  For you again   ♫

648
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:23,830
 I...  
 ♫   I thought you'd know even if I tried to hide my feelings   ♫

649
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:26,410
♫   I thought if you saw my eyes   ♫

650
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:31,050
 like...  
 ♫  You'd feel my gaze  ♫

651
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:32,960
I like you.

652
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,990
♫   Though I always linger a few paces behind you like a fool  ♫

653
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:41,280
 To a point it's beyond my control. 

654
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,720
 Very much.  
 ♫   I'll be on your side   ♫

655
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,200
I like you, Joon Young.

656
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:50,580
♫   The more I look at you   ♫

657
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:59,090
 My ambitious plan   
 ♫   Tell me honestly, if you feel the same way   ♫

658
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:02,140
 to rely on the firmness of my heart, 

659
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:09,950
 has completely failed.   
 ♫  I'll confess tomorrow  ♫

660
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:13,760
    
 ♫   I'll be on your side   ♫

661
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:20,600
♫   The more I look at you   ♫

662
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:31,440
♫   Tell me honestly, if you feel the same way   ♫

663
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,210
♫  Come to my side  ♫

664
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:43,280
♫   The more I think about it, the more I remember you   ♫

665
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:49,150
♫   I grow certain this is love   ♫

666
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:55,320
♫   Even when I close my eyes for a moment, I miss you   ♫

667
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:59,200
♫   I want to be with you   ♫

668
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:04,330


669
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:07,780
♫   I want to know your heart   ♫
