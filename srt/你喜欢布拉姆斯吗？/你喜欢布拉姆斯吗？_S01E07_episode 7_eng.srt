1
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,370
   

2
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,320
   

3
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:05,020


4
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,020
   

5
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,290
It's just an autographed CD.

6
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,450
   

7
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,660
   

8
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:40,160
 It's probably... difficult to suddenly arrange a performance, right? 

9
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,040
 I thought it was your sabbatical year. 

10
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,920
 Yeah. 

11
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,630
 But I need money. 

12
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,440
 How much do you need? 

13
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,120
 Around 20 million won. (~$20,000) 

14
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,070
 Sorry for asking for such a favor. 

15
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:15,200
 I'll help you look into it, but it's best you don't hold any expectations. 

16
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,960
 Yeah, I know. 

17
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,270
 The live performance venues are probably all booked by now. 

18
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,520
 More than that... 

19
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,880
 Even if you get a venue, it would be hard to sell out the show. 

20
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,340
 After Seung Ji Min won the competition, he claimed a lot of the market share. 

21
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,750
 Probably...a lot more than you think. 

22
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,180
Please give me lessons.

23
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,090
I'll participate in the Tchaikovsky competition.

24
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,510
 I thought that once the calluses on my fingertips became firmer...  

25
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,290
 He's so handsome! 

26
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,540
 So handsome! 

27
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,830
 my heart would grow firmer calluses as well. 

28
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,350
 We... 

29
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,200
 have nothing to do with each other anyway. 

30
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,270
 So, from now on... 

31
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,200
 I'll be fine. 

32
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,200
 I told myself that every day. 

33
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,150
 Could you sign mine too? 

34
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,860
 Song Ah! 

35
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,390
Song Ah!

36
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,510
Song Ah.

37
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Are you okay?

38
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,190
I like you.

39
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,960
I like you, Joon Young.

40
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,760
 That day, I heard his story. 

41
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,590
 About his piano... 

42
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,210
   

43
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,650
  his love, 

44
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,180
 his friend... 

45
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,100
 I heard the sound of his heart, 

46
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,550
 his heart that he kept emptying, again and again,  

47
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,490
 because he was afraid that he'd be exposed. 

48
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:45,850
 Playing Träumerei was like a habit of mine. 

49
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,340
Every day, after sitting in front of the piano and playing that song,

50
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,290
my heart that had been so full all night became at least a little bit emptier.

51
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,370
Jung Kyung's mother's accident

52
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,980
didn't happen because of you.

53
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,330
Even so, the feelings in my heart...

54
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,590
aren't that simple.

55
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,670
Sorry for telling you this.

56
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,980
I think I need...some time.

57
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,770
Knowing this...

58
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,410
would you wait for me?

59
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,430
Yes.

60
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,500
I'll wait for you.

61
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:22,280
   
   

62
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,190
By the way, what sequence number did you get for your graduation performance?

63
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,410
I'm the fifth one.

64
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,130
That's good.

65
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,380
That... the Franck Sonata.

66
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,570
Take it as practice for the stage and play this as your graduation performance,

67
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,840
and take the exam for graduate school.

68
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,590
How about your accompanist?

69
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:23,250
I'm planning to ask the piano major student that I worked with for the practical exam.

70
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,710
You're going to ask a student?

71
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,180
Do you think a school practical exam and a college entrance exam are the same things?

72
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,370
The accompanist is extremely important.

73
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,980
Violin sonatas are pieces that are composed for the violin and piano.

74
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,030
It's not just a violin piece that requires piano accompaniment.

75
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,960
The two people performing a sonata must breathe in sync,

76
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,300
think together, and create music together.

77
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,960
You guys are equals. Partners.

78
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,480
Yes.

79
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,710
If you don't know any pianists, work with her.

80
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,080
She's my friend's daughter.

81
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,530
She got a master's in accompaniment at Julliard.

82
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,140
I sent you her contact.

83
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,800
Do you still remember what I said when I first gave you a lesson back then?

84
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,020
"At a competition, you must get seven, eight or nine points

85
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,240
from all the judges no matter what."

86
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,310
"A performance that gets ten points from one or two people but six or seven from the rest

87
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:57,470
can never win in a competition." This is what I said.

88
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,410
Yes. I've never forgotten.

89
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,920
You're really good at that.

90
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,050
You know how to adequately satisfy others.

91
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:13,030
No matter what field you're in, it's an ability to be able to know what you're good at.

92
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,460
So it's the same this time.

93
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,040
Do what you're good at, not what you want to do. Got it?

94
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,590
Yes.

95
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,200
Music exists only when the people who will listen to it exists.

96
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,770
If you don't want to be pressing keys in an empty room by yourself,

97
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,700
win the competition.

98
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,760
Though without my words,

99
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,310
you're probably much more desperate.

100
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,570
   

101
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,070
Section Chief. Section Chief, Section Chief!

102
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,050
Mmh?

103
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,540
Master Joon Young made a contract with Chris's company

104
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,310
after getting that prize at the Chopin competition, right?

105
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,690
And Chris gave the Korean management rights to Kyunghoo.

106
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,690
Yes. It was a sort of outsourcing, in remembrance of their past relationship.

107
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,610
But... what if Chris really

108
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,750
takes back the Korean management rights over Master Joon Young?

109
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,190
Won't he be putting Master Joon Young under another company, then?

110
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,330
Master Joon Young and Chris still have a few years left to their contract, after all.

111
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,200
Team Leader will probably take care of it.

112
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,050
Pardon?

113
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,040
Ah, yes.

114
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,320
 It all sounds like an excuse to us. Unfortunately,  

115
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,890
 you leave us no choice but to take back Kyunghoo's management rights of Joon Young in Korea. 

116
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,770
Wait— Hello? Chris!

117
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,580
Unni, did you decide on the piece you'll play at the graduation performance?

118
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,900
Franck's sonata.

119
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,470
That's the piece for the graduate school entrance exam, no? Did the professor tell you to play that?

120
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,150
Yes.

121
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:11,160
Oh, there... It's Park Joon Young!

122
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,680
He's looking at us.

123
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:26,170
Excuse me... Is it alright if I sit here?

124
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:42,560
You're also taking fourth-year classes, but none of ours overlap with the piano majors'.

125
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,440
It's such a pity.

126
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,330
Then you'll be holding a graduation performance too! I'll go see you.

127
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,270
Me too!

128
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,770
Yes, please come.

129
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,860
- We have class. 
 - Already?

130
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,580
We'll be on our way.

131
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,010
We'll see you later.

132
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,540
Unni, enjoy your lunch!

133
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,120
Sure.

134
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,550
Why aren't you saying anything? As if we're strangers.

135
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,750
Who are you?

136
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,520
♫   Though I'm alone, I long for your warm smile   ♫

137
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:45,140
♫   Even the sunlight reminds me of your bright eyes    ♫

138
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,160
Is it your first time at the student's union?

139
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Well, it's my first time in this place, except for the cafeteria downstairs.

140
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,860
There are so many clubs.

141
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,050
   

142
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,810
So you plan on joining one if there's any you like? 
    

143
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,260
Can I join even if I can only be active for two months before graduating?

144
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,520
No, of course not.

145
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,030
- Ah, it's over there. 
 - Ah.

146
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,880
So that is SRUPO.

147
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,350
The place where you spent your youth.

148
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,720
Pardon? My youth?

149
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,660
   

150
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,300
Yes, well, that's right.

151
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,360
Since this is also where I made the decision to go to Music School.

152
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,640
But actually I haven't been here in a very long time,

153
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,240
so I don't really know the current members...

154
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,210
Ah but they will recognize you!

155
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,860
They'll be so surprised.

156
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,500
♫   Everything looks like you,    ♫

157
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,720
♫  my love  ♫

158
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,430
♫   I remember everything single part of you   ♫

159
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,350
No one is here...

160
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,370
- W-well so, it's locked, right? 
 - Yes. 
 - Right?

161
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,290
Where are you going now? To Kyunghoo?

162
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,470
No, I plan on practicing at the school today.

163
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,210
Because I can't use the rehearsal room at Kyunghoo when there is a concert.

164
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,960
What about you?

165
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,750
Me, well, I'll just go home.

166
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,830
Uhm, tomorrow...

167
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,670
I mean, tomorrow, uhm...

168
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,670
At what times do you have classes?

169
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,590
I only have one class in the afternoon tomorrow.

170
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,960
Do you want to go for ice cream at the student union tomorrow?

171
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,880
They still sell some, right?

172
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,770
Yes. I'd be happy to.

173
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,180
It taste's the same as in the old days. Though the price is 500 won  (≈ $0.50)  higher now.

174
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,820
Mm?

175
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,880
What is it?

176
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,040
It's just that... you really talk like an old person.

177
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,730
What are you saying? We're the same age.

178
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,220
Oh... 
 ♫   I like everything about you   ♫

179
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,710
♫   Are you listening to my confession for you?   ♫

180
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,730
Your shoelace is undone. Hold this for a second.

181
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,010
I don't want to.

182
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,260
I'll tie it myself.

183
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:05,000
♫   Though I'm alone, I long for your warm smile   ♫

184
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,520
You know how in movies, the guy always ties the girl's shoelaces?

185
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
Movies?

186
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,930
Yes.

187
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,090
Then the girl falls for the guy.

188
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,870
But I don't want to fall for you.

189
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,690
Give it to me.

190
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,290
♫   To the place you are, I   ♫

191
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:32,540
♫   I want to go right now   ♫

192
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,870
Please don't laugh, I'm being serious.

193
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,050
Okay.

194
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,510
♫   Will you always stay by my side?   ♫

195
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,300
I said, don't laugh.

196
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,060
♫   I remember everything single part of you   ♫

197
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,960
Alright.

198
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:58,610
♫   Again, I long for you   ♫

199
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,860
Here.

200
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,250
I'll just go wash my hands in the bathroom.

201
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,600
 Let me remind you that although this teaching staff recruitment session 

202
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,510
is to fill the vacancy created by the retirement

203
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,650
of violin professor Song Jung Hee,

204
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,700
the position in itself is for a string music major.

205
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,600
Thus, we will pick only one person with the highest score

206
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,680
among all violin, viola, cello and contrabass players here.

207
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,320
We ask the applicants to check the date of your master class, recital and interview

208
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,790
on the homepage of the  faculty of music.

209
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,120
Thank you for your attention.

210
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,630
Excuse me for a minute, then.

211
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,470
Give it to me.

212
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,060
Sorry?

213
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,640
Leave your violin with me.

214
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,130
You can't go anywhere with it.

215
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,310
Of course. I won't run away.

216
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,930
You can trust me.

217
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,230
I didn't know you applied as well.

218
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,850
You should have told me.

219
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,780
Aren't you angry?

220
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,230
About what?

221
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,370
I'm going to compete with you.

222
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,550
I'm trying to steal your position. Aren't you angry about that?

223
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,070
What right do I have to be angry at you?

224
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,760
When you and I are nothing to each other.

225
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,250
It looks like you're going on your own path, so I feel at ease.

226
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,860
You feel at ease?

227
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,820
You feel relieved?

228
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,570
Then how do you want me to be?

229
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,940
We broke up.

230
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,000
Then what do you want me to do?

231
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,020
Jung Kyung.

232
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,020
What did I do wrong?

233
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:54,070
Did I ever do anything that wasn't to your liking?

234
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,590
What did I do so wrong, that you'd do this?

235
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,730
I kept thinking about what I could have done wrong.

236
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,560
What did I miss, for you to leave me?

237
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,030
But no matter how hard I think about it,

238
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,040
I've done nothing other than look only at you for ten years.

239
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,820
Is that wrong? Did you get tired of it? Is that any way to act in consideration of our ten years together?

240
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,820
What do you want me to? Did I hide anything from you?

241
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:25,330
I told you that my feelings were wavering. I asked you to hold onto me.

242
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,460
But you didn't do anything.

243
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,760
It's not that I didn't want to, it's that I couldn't.

244
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,090
Because what was making you waver... was Park Joon Young.

245
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,800
You're right.

246
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,450
I love Joon Young, Hyeon Ho.

247
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,250
I... I love him.

248
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,900
Stop it.

249
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,000
Hyeon Ho, she's just saying whatever out of anger—

250
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,390
Did you like Jung Kyung?

251
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,780
Woah. How could you...

252
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,890
 Is this the one I gave you?  

253
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,630
  When you did your Chopin Piano Competition? 

254
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,820
 Yeah. 

255
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,610
 Here. 

256
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,260
How could you, to me- How could you like Jung- Hey!

257
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,710
How could this happen, when you've been watching us for ten years?

258
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,090
Huh?

259
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,070
Park Joon Young. Tell me.

260
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,780
- Tell me, you— 
 - Han Hyeon Ho.

261
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,170
If you have something to say, say it to me.

262
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,270
 You two... 

263
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,790
What did you do in New York?

264
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,090
What did you do, that you both lied like that?

265
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,140
Did you two...

266
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,470
sleep together?

267
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,040
Yeah.

268
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,060
We slept together.

269
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:09,360
No. No we didn't. Lee Jung Kyung, what are you saying?

270
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,540
Hyeon Ho. It's really not true.

271
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,640
- It's not true. Hurry up and tell him it's not! 
 - What isn't?

272
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,660
You love me.

273
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,810
Tell me.

274
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,330
You tell me.

275
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,320
Hyeon Ho.

276
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,200
Song Ah.

277
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,080
Song Ah!

278
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,260
Solve the misunderstanding with Hyeon Ho.

279
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,500
Song Ah.

280
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,790
There was no such thing, I'm saying the truth.

281
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,900
Please believe me.

282
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,480
I believe you.

283
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,980
I do.

284
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,970
But...

285
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:12,430
Between you and Jung Kyung...

286
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:16,200
I mean, in between those times...

287
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:22,760
Is there any room for me to go in?

288
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:37,530
I'll wait for you... I'm waiting for you, but...

289
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,740
But still, I want to wait knowing that.

290
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,040
I'll get going.

00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,800
 Hey, you remember that cake? 

320
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,850
- Cake? 
 -  Yes, the one you brought on Song Ah's birthday. 

321
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:45,280
 Where did you buy it? It was so tasty. 

322
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,140
When do you need it for?

323
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,510
It's a shop in Jamsil, but you have to order one week in advance.

324
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:55,630
 Darn. A week? I guess I'll have to buy one around here. Okay. 

325
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:00,600
-  On another note, my group's newbie says she has time this weekend. Is that fine with you?   
 - Huh?

326
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,760
 I told you I'd arrange a date. I'll send you her number, so you two get in touch. 

327
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,290
Hey—

328
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,890
What's this, all of a sudden?

329
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,520
 - Congrats! Happy birhtday! 
 - Happy birthday, Song Ah. 

330
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,250
 Thank you. 

331
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,520
 Come with us. 

332
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,100
No, Joon Young has...

333
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,990
Yes. I'll go with you.

334
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,480
   

335
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,070
Does it make sense to do it now?

336
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,750
It doesn't, right?

337
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,410
Chae Song Ah!

338
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,030
Huh?

339
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,580
You weren't listening, were you?

340
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:09,100
- Oh, sorry, how far did we get?
 - Hmph!

341
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,790
Eun Ji told me that Yoon Dong Yoon really is going on blind dates.

342
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,290
But what's wrong with your face? Did something bad happen?

343
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,860
Oh, no. It's nothing.

344
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:43,900
No...there's definitely something going on.

345
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,430
I told you it's nothing.

346
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,660
Miss Chae Song Ah! Who are you trying to fool?

347
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,230
It's written all over your face!

348
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,990
N-no it isn't!

349
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:02,560
What is it? Tell me.

350
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,370
Well,  you see...

351
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,030
I have someone I like now.

352
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,860
Someone you like? Who?

353
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,210
Is it someone I know?

354
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,020
Park Joon Young. It's Joon Young.

355
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,020
The p-pianist Park Joon Young?!

356
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,820
Does he know that you like him?

357
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,360
- He should. Because I confessed to him. 
- Huh?!

358
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,230
Confessed?! You?!

359
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,410
- Hey, not so loud.
- Ah...

360
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:57,900
- So, Chae Song Ah confessed. To a guy.
- Yeah.

361
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,980
I confessed to him.

362
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,900
So? What did he say after you confessed?

363
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,300
He asked me to wait.

364
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:16,480
But...I don't think he'll come to me.

365
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,750
He would've come to me already if so.

366
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,930
Why is the weather so nice?

367
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,750
I know right?

368
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,480
Yes, Noona it's me.

369
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,450
How is Chairman Na?

370
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,680
Oh, that's a relief.

371
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,790
 I just arrived at the hospital. Do you want to come with me? 

372
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,750
I think she'd be happy to see you.

373
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,120
 Oh, no. I'll visit next... 

374
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,250
Next time I'll go.

375
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,640
Yes.

376
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:15,610
Joon Young is losing his Korean management rights?

377
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:22,870
Yes. I'm trying to change Chris's mind, but it's hard through the phone.

378
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,550
Forgive me. It's all because of my carelessness.

379
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,910
What does Joon Young think?

380
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,190
I haven't told him yet.

381
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:39,770
I did talk with him about something else, but seeing how he didn't mention it,

382
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,600
it looks like he's unaware.

383
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,320
Joon Young must have resumed lessons with Professor Yoo?

384
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,570
Yes.

385
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:57,550
Team Leader Cha. Isn't it uncomfortable with Professor Yoo there?

386
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,680
It's been a long time since we separated.

387
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,560
I'm not exactly comfortable, but there's nothing uncomfortable about it either.

388
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:13,370
Love, too, is nothing special once it passes.

389
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:19,870
Life has too many obligations for you to live just chasing after love.

390
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,230
How could you realize that when you're young?

391
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:26,600
I was the same, so...

392
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:32,440
I intentionally hurt him.

393
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,660
 Joon Young, this is why you won't succeed. 

394
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,740
 If some do exceptionally well while others lag behind, 

395
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,010
 then you get spiteful thoughts. 

396
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:50,680
With the passing of time, would he understand?

397
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,340
Right now, love is everything, so he'd likely feel bitter.

398
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,420
Why I shook him about like that.

399
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:01,360
Later...

400
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,900
No... even if he never understands me, it's fine.

401
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:12,860
But... I don't feel too great about it.

402
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:21,790
I do selfishly want to remain a good person in everyone's thoughts.

403
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,560
You're already a good person,

404
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,260
To so many people.

405
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,190
This is so annoying!

406
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,490
Mom, they told me to wait.

407
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:51,890
Attorney Kim said if I waited, he'd get the case for me.

408
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,850
But it's going straight to Attorney Jang!

409
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,090
I thought it was going to Jang anyway?

410
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,560
Still he promised to give it to me!

411
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,560
 Oh let go of it already. Is that the only case available in your law firm? Do something else. 

412
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,600
I don't want to! I trusted he'd give it to me so I made all the preparations!

413
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,470
Ah! This is so annoying!

414
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:12,520
You should know how to be patient!

415
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,580
How can two sisters be this different?

416
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:19,920
What about me? Would you rather I live like a frustrating moron like that?

417
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,200
What did I do?

418
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,440
 This won't do. I'm going to protest this to Attorney Kim. 

419
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,120
What are you going to protest? You probably didn't get it because you weren't as good as Attorney Jang.

420
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,600
It's not true! Ah, that was supposed to be mine!

421
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,520
He shouldn't have told me to wait for it!

422
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:43,410
I stayed up so many nights for it. How could Attorney Kim do this to me?

423
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,230
 What's up with her? 

424
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,420
Mom.

425
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:16,400
Oh...I was watching a movie with Seung Hoo.

426
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:22,260
Did I say I wasn't going to practice today? I'll do it when I get home!

427
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,810
Stop talking about Julliard! You couldn't make it either!

428
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,130
You should've been more careful!

429
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,630
I'm so sorry!

430
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,910
- Let me... 
- No, I got it.

431
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,120
Get me some tissues instead.

432
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,640
- No, I got it. 
- I said it's fine...

433
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,080
Seung Hoo...

434
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,290
You see that's...

435
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:51,360
Is this...an application?

436
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,200
Didn't you apply to Julliard?

437
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,530
   

438
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,570
Yes?

439
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,640
- Song Ah. 
- Oh, Dad.

440
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,970
- You want to have a can with me?
- Yeah.

441
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,110
- Song Ah
- Yeah?

442
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:33,960
Just then...

443
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,300
What your sister said earlier... Don't take it to heart.

444
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,420
I scolded her.

445
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,840
- Dad. 
 - Yeah?

446
00:40:53,830 --> 00:41:01,260
Do others think that people who wait quietly are frustrating?

447
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,560
I'm also good at waiting.

448
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,120
I wait for the bus, for the subway,

449
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,610
and for my meal at the restaurant.

450
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,750
Song Ah. I...

451
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:31,260
I am waiting to see how you'll find your happiness.

452
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:38,830
No matter the path you take, I believe you will find

453
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,230
the path that makes you happiest.

454
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,360
Thank you.

455
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,210
You've gotten more CDs.

456
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,080
"Violinist Chae Song Ah."

457
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:11,970
It looks cool.

458
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:15,510
   

459
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:21,430
So he signed like that because you were carrying a violin at the concert hall.

460
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,150
He's a nice person.

461
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,390
Yeah.

462
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:34,220
He's a nice person.

463
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,790
 Is this the one I gave you?  

464
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:39,560
  When you did your Chopin Piano Competition? 

465
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,240
 Here. 

466
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,500
I even made the time to come here.

467
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,710
You're here.

468
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:23,130
Were you practicing with your accompanist?

469
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:23,980
Yes.

470
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:29,020
But I don't like her, so I'll look for someone else.

471
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,730
I see.

472
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,720
Get some rest, then.

473
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,890
Yes. You too.

474
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:47,150
Dad. I broke up.

475
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,180
With Hyeon Ho?

476
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:55,340
Yes. You remember his name.

477
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:03,200
Jung Kyung. I realized that as time passes,

478
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,030
the scars I caused remained longer in my mind than the scars I received.

479
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,810
So you too...

480
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:19,460
 don't hurt anyone too deeply. 

481
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,360
You worked hard, Teacher.

482
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,610
No, it's alright.

483
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:47,860
If she works hard, she can also go to Seoryeong University like you, right?

484
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,670
I'm not even asking for her to get first place for the practical exam like you did.

485
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,250
She is working hard these days.

486
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,450
I told you.

487
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:58,480
Just make it into Seoryeong University, and you'll see, I'll do everything you want.

488
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,980
Teach! You heard that, right? You're my witness.

489
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,540
Oh, sure.

490
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:08,770
I'm so forgetful. Here's the payment for today's lesson.

491
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,260
Here you go.

492
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,890
Thank you.

493
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:14,940
Your parents must have been so happy.

494
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,600
No, not at all.

495
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,650
Welcome!

496
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,430
You scared me.

497
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,460
What's wrong with you, Han Hyeon Ho?

498
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,320
My back hurts!

499
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,980
- Mom. 
 - Yes.

500
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,090
I'll be a good son soon. Just wait a little bit.

501
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:57,930
A good son? Why are you asking me to wait, instead of doing it now?

502
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:02,080
You...! And you won't be good to me?

503
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,330
Of course, you two come as a set, with Mom.

504
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,180
We're a set, we are.

505
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:11,280
Ah right. Tell Joon Young to come for a meal sometime. Tell him I'll make something delicious.

506
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,440
Why do you never tell him to bring Jung Kyung, even if just to be polite?

507
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,390
Are you being jealous of your son's lover?

508
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:19,350
You really don't know anything.

509
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:24,190
They aren't even married, so if I tell her to come she'll be uncomfortable.

510
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:27,340
And Jung Kyung probably doesn't eat such a thing like our home-cooked meals.

511
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,430
Right?

512
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,460
Ah, I'm so tired.

513
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,510
I gave three lessons today, I'm so tired.

514
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:34,580
- You're tired? Alright, go. 
 - Okay.

515
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,190
- Go get some rest. 
 - I'm off.

516
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,140
- I'm going. 
 - Yes, see you later.

517
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,980
It's hot, let's go inside to talk.

518
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,630
Actually no.

519
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,190
Let's just talk here.

520
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,260
Why did you come?

521
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,390
I'm sorry.

522
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:28,590
About what?

523
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,940
It was a lie.

524
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,620
When I said Joon Yeong and I slept together.

525
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,890
Is that so important now?

526
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:47,290
You saying that you—

527
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,160
The fact that you said that...

528
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,400
Made me understand your feelings well enough.

529
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,660
Do you know why I applied to Seoryeong University?

530
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:22,340
I have to do something, anything.

531
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:29,200
Graduating from Seoryeong with top honors or having a doctorate from Indiana is no use, actually.

532
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:35,570
There are too many cellists as good as me in South Korea, and I don't have much money.

533
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:39,590
I needed to do something to put food on the table.

534
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:42,550
- Hyeon Ho— 
 - The second reason is...

535
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,230
I wanted to stand on a place similar to yours.

536
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:17,820
I didn't want to make you feel ashamed. Yeah.

537
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,640
I wanted to be someone who was somewhat suitable

538
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,450
to be next to you.

539
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:33,960
That was my effort

540
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,570
and my love, I think.

541
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,400
It's all futile now, isn't it?

542
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,870
Goodbye.

543
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,440
And don't come find me again.

544
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:17,710
♫   I guess you can't express everything with love    ♫

545
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:24,710
♫   Those words of yours make me sad   ♫

546
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:29,870
♫   You're leaving like this   ♫

547
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:38,000
♫   but if you can be happy, that's enough for me  ♫

548
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:47,300
♫   These tears that have gotten cold 
 cannot be considered part of our farewell  ♫

549
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:53,290
♫   Come back to me a bit less late   ♫

550
00:51:53,290 --> 00:52:01,930
♫   Even these tears that are falling 
 will become   ♫

551
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:10,400
♫   Part of my last farewell to you, take care   ♫

552
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:40,970
Alright, Song Ah.

553
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,600
Yes?

554
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,070
Let's stop here for today.

555
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,680
Yes.

556
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:00,100
- Professor, this—
 - Yes, ahjumma?

557
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,390
Sorry?

558
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,500
No, not the living room. The curtains in the master bedroom.

559
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,020
Take them off and bring them to the dry cleaner.

560
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,600
Oh, and in the morning my eldest...

561
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:20,370
Joon Young. Are you seeing a violinist these days?

562
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:23,970
Pardon?

563
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,790
I heard that girl is being really pushy to try to get involved with you.

564
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,560
Is that true?

565
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,940
She's not that kind of person.

566
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,900
Why so serious?

567
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:44,660
But is there really someone?

568
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:48,070
This world is smaller than you think.

569
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:52,010
Whether you date or break up, people are too happy to tittle-tattle about it.

570
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:55,050
That reputation lasts a really long time afterward.

571
00:53:55,050 --> 00:54:00,660
So if you are seeing someone, prevent rumors from spreading for that person's well-being.

572
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,500
Song Ah, here.

573
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:15,430
Why is it so complicated to put together a chamber orchestra?

574
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,420
But I'm so glad you're here, Song Ah.

575
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,760
Joon Young.

576
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,240
Hello.

577
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,650
It's been a while. I heard you returned to university?

578
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,290
Yes.

579
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,190
Are you two keeping your distance from each other because I'm here?

580
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:43,750
Sorry?

581
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,870
I heard you two are dating.

582
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,960
- No, we aren't. 
 - We aren't.

583
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,280
You're not?

584
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,360
The rumor reached the professors' council.

585
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,380
Song Ah, none of the professors knew who you were, but—

586
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,790
We're not.

587
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:04,030
We really aren't.

588
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,260
If you're not, then you aren't. Why are you being so serious?

589
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:13,700
You're making me embarrassed.

590
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,750
My apologies.

591
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:19,450
But that rumor really isn't true.

592
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:24,000
Alright. I got it.

593
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:27,590
Wait a second.

594
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,400
Yes, Hae Na?

595
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,070
What?

596
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:38,060
Really? Well, it can't be helped then. Okay, I got it.

597
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,420
Yes...

598
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,640
Oh my, this girl really.

599
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:46,990
Song Ah! Do you want to take a master class?

600
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:48,230
I'm sorry?

601
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:52,510
I had asked Hae Na, but she says she's sick.

602
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:56,460
It'll start soon. If you don't have any class, do you want to do it?

603
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,720
You can get a private lesson for your entrance exam piece.

604
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:07,430
It's for the recruitment of a new professor. Her name is Lee Jung Kyung.

605
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,430
You don't have to do it.

606
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,350
I'll do it.

607
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:22,830
I want to get that lesson.

608
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:28,120
Well, for the master class, you'll be fine as long as you don't do a big mistake.

609
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,390
The recital is important.

610
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:34,130
You have to get many points from that recital.

611
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:38,060
So you really have to find a good pianist as your accompanist.

612
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,640
Got it?

613
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,390
Yes.

614
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:47,590
Won't you be uncomfortable with Jung Kyung?

615
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:53,260
I won't be comfortable, for sure.

616
00:56:55,010 --> 00:57:01,870
But you know... My feelings for you are important,

617
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:08,600
but there are other things I like and want to do well, too.

618
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:16,740
For now, the entrance examination for graduate school is really important to me.

619
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:23,210
That's why I dont want to lose the opportunity to learn one more thing,

620
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:27,370
just because I was swayed by my emotions.

621
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,230
I'll get going.

622
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:55,470
About the rumor, the professor talked about earlier.

623
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:02,620
I am disconcerted such a rumor is going around, but...

624
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,530
I'm saddened.

625
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,770
You were denying it so much in front of me...

626
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:23,550
that it saddened me, strangely.

627
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:29,550
I did it because of you.

628
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,750
Because I was afraid you'd be put in a tough spot because of that rumor.

629
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,320
I was worried.

630
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,260
Please don't talk like that.

631
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:54,150
Those words might not be anything special for you,

632
00:58:54,910 --> 00:59:02,760
but each sentence of yours, and every little action, it all stays on my mind.

633
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:12,370
But now... I don't want to be like that anymore.

634
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,660
Song Ah.

635
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,560
Joon Young.

636
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,340
Good thing you're here. I had something to tell you.

637
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:32,860
Please be my accompanist for my recital.

638
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:40,990


639
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:44,950
No.

640
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:57,360
I won't be your accompanist.

641
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:06,000
♫   I'm reminded again of you who drifted away   ♫

642
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,420
♫   Though I loved you   ♫

643
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:18,100
♫   The radiant memories of our past days  ♫

644
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:25,410
    
 ♫   come visit me again.   ♫

645
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:33,340
♫   In the end, I wasn't able to forget anything about you   ♫

646
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:38,850
♫   I must have loved you too much   ♫

647
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:43,290
♫   Because I miss you   ♫

648
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:46,990
♫  I cry out your name   ♫

649
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:50,000
♫   Even if it's just a lingering attachment  ♫

650
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,110
♫  I'll have no regrets   ♫

651
01:00:54,110 --> 01:01:02,770
♫   Can you hear my heartfelt story?  ♫

652
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:09,390
♫   Without you, I'm nothing   ♫

653
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:12,420
 Dong Yoon cancelled his blind date? 

654
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,770
 Could it be because of me? Because he's concerned about me? 

655
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:15,950
 Song Ah, I... 

656
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:16,900
 Why would you come here? 

657
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,060
 It's all my fault.  

658
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:18,950
 What is your fault? 

659
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:20,690
 Unni, are you dating Park Joon Young? 

660
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:23,270
 Do you think a world-class person would date an average music school student? 

661
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:25,550
 Is that why you've been constantly pushing me away these days? 

662
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:29,290
 Each sentence of yours, and every little action, stays on my mind, Song Ah. 

663
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:31,600
 Song Ah, I... 

664
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:37,220
♫   Were yours the same as you turned away?   ♫

665
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:40,600
♫   Because I miss you  ♫
