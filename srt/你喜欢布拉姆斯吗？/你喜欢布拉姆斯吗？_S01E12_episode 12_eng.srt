1
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,360
   

2
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:53,160
♫  When I'm with you, I smile  ♫

3
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,630
I'll bring you home.

4
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,180
♫  I feel happy  ♫

5
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,480
Then should we walk there?

6
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,040
It'll take around thirty minutes.

7
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,480
Sure.

8
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,530
♫  Stay with me, stay by my side forever  ♫

9
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,330
♫  The stars  ♫

10
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,870
♫  shine on us   ♫

11
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:24,200
♫  I find everything about you lovable   ♫

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,330
♫  If asked what love means, I'll answer it's you  ♫

13
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,200
♫   Like in the movies,  ♫

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,220
Thank you for today.

15
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,610
I enjoyed it as well.

16
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,300
♫  Please hug me  ♫

17
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,360
Sleep well.

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,370
Get home safely.

19
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,910
♫  I want to be with you  ♫

20
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,350
♫  Will you approach me? I'll wait for you  ♫

21
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,500
Ah right!

22
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,470
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

23
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,640
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

24
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,540
♫  I'll be waiting for you  ♫

25
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:07,000
♫  I hope this isn't a dream  ♫

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,610
I came really fast, didn't I?

27
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,480
I thought you were flying.

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,920
♫  I love you  ♫

29
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,570
This. It's a present.

30
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,950
A p-present?

31
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,300
Last time...

32
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,740
 It's raining. 

33
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,840
 Could you lend me an umbrella?  

34
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,810
 What do I do?  

35
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,220
 I don't have an umbrella.  

36
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,130
 You don't? Not even one?  

37
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,920
 No.  

38
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,530
 I've lived in hotels for the last few years.  

39
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,250
 So I didn't need an umbrella.  

40
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,010
 Since there would always be one at the hotel.  

41
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,640
So I wanted to give you one.

42
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,590
Since you have a place you will stay in now.

43
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,780
Thank you.

44
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,670
Truly.

45
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:28,220


46
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,820
Chae Song Ah!

47
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,830
Unni.

48
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,780
Mom.

49
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:47,000
My apologies. I should have come to greet you first.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,040
Don't worry. It is late, so let's say goodbye for today,

51
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,900
and we'll meet again next time.

52
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,560
Yes.

53
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,900
Let's go.

54
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,820
- Song Ah. 
 - Yes.

55
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,080
 Goodnight.  

56
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,950
Sleep well.

57
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,490
 Excuse me, more kimchi here, please. 

58
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,730
    

59
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,820
Joon Young's father did it again.

60
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,590
This time, we risk losing the restaurant.

61
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:01,140
Earlier, I was so shocked that I called Joon Young, but I hang up before he answered.

62
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,050
I can't bring myself to ask him for money anymore.

63
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,490
What do I do?

64
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,640
What do I do?

65
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,210
♫   Think about you, your everything   ♫

66
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,370
♫   I wanna stay, always by your side   ♫

67
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,020
♫   I watch a transparent you   ♫

68
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:58,230
    
 ♫   My lips call for you again   ♫

69
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:04,240
♫   I thought you'd know even if I tried to hide my feelings   ♫

70
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,260
♫   I thought if you saw my eyes, you'd feel my gaze   ♫

71
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:17,290
♫   Though I always linger a few paces behind you like a fool  ♫

72
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:25,680
    
    

73
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,710
- Joon Young. 
 - Song Ah.

74
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,720
- Were you practicing? 
 - Yes.

75
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,640
What are you playing? Bach, Tchaikovsky,

76
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,680
Rachmaninov...

77
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,680
When you study music from different eras together like this,

78
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,590
isn't it a bit difficult?

79
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:05,660
That is... I'm actually preparing for a competition.

80
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,230
The Tchaikovsky competition.

81
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,020
 Piano competitions... were something I really hated. 

82
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,230
 After a while, I hated the competitions more than death itself. 

83
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,490
I've been preparing for some time. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

84
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,560
No, it's fine.

85
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,630
Then you must be really busy.

86
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,370
Shouldn't you have been practicing instead of coming to Daejeon yesterday?

87
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,690
No, it's all right.

88
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,950
Then, practice well.

89
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,480
Where are you going?

90
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,470
I... I have homework for my harmonics theory class, so I'll go find an empty classroom.

91
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,740
Or something.

92
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,270
You can do it here, too. If that's alright with you.

93
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,360
No, it's fine. Practice comfortably, Joon Young.

94
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,270
You did well.

95
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,690
You did well, but here you played with a down-bow.

96
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,830
But what about using an up-bow?

97
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,580
Because I think you should start with an up-bow here, so that the last C on the octave scale

98
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,940
can be played on a down-bow.

99
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,920
Yes.

100
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,410
Then should we try like that?

101
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,830
Pardon? My accompanist?

102
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,830
Yes, Cecilia. You know she's my friend's daughter, right?

103
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,930
I just got a call from her. She says she really can't do it with you.

104
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,340
She also said you've been impolite and talking back to her.

105
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,990
Seriously, I've never seen a student being fired by their accompanist.

106
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,170
What are you going to do for the upcoming graduate exam?

107
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,390
Call Cecilia and implore pardon, or find someone else.

108
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,980
And I have to leave now, so you lock the door behind you.

109
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,160
 Hello? 

110
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,430
Madam, this is Chae Song Ah—

111
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,350
 Oh sorry, I really can't be your accompanist.  

112
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,350
 Good luck on your exam. 

113
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,810
No, but, wait—

114
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,950
Here, my scores.

115
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,740
Photocopy them and bring them back to me next time.

116
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,860
Yes.

117
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,160
Is it fine with you if we meet here next time as well?

118
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,960
- Yes.  
 - Okay.

119
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:35,420
And actually, my mom doesn't know I came here.

120
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,460
Ji Won. You need to tell your mom.

121
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,310
Do tell her.

122
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,110
Okay?

123
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,510
Yes.

124
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,620
Yes, could you somehow make it?

125
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,710
My graduate school exam is coming up.

126
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,570
Yes, hello Master.

127
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,410
I got your contact through Lee Ji Ho, a fourth-year at Seoryeong University.

128
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,040
My name is Chae Song Ah.

129
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,570
Then, is there anyone else you could introduce to me maybe?

130
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,810
Mom.

131
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,720
Hello.

132
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:46,230
Master. Did you just give her a private lesson?

133
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,420
I mean, don't you know what kind of person Professor Song Jung Hee is?

134
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,770
How can you do this without my knowledge?

135
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,990
I'm sorry. I was just—

136
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,140
Yang Ji Won! Is that why you seemed so cautious

137
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,370
when you said you'd go practice at school?

138
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,500
How dare you lie to your mom, huh?

139
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,840
Madam. Please calm down first.

140
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,010
Who are you?

141
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,170
I'm Jung Kyung's—

142
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,150
I'm her colleague.

143
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,240
I think there was a communication issue along the way.

144
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,060
What about going outside and listening to what Ji Won has to say, first?

145
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,120
Many of the kids here know Ji Won, so...

146
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,730
Let's go. Hurry. What are you doing?

147
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,550
Should we have a chat?

148
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,490
Did you give her a private lesson without getting permission from the professor?

149
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,820
Why do you do something you can't handle? What are you going to do?

150
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,130
Imagine if it wasn't her mother, but someone else who had seen you.

151
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,450
It's only a matter of time before it reaches Professor Song Jung Hee, then you...

152
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,390
Then you'll be rejected from Seoryeong university right away.

153
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,910
You also give lessons.

154
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,510
Aren't you also a supplementary teacher?

155
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,960
You and I are different.

156
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,150
How are we different?

157
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,860
Have you ever had to confront the students' parents?

158
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,290
You never gave any lesson during your university days.

159
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,450
It's also the first time someone tells you something to your face like this.

160
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,510
It's my business.

161
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,490
I'll take care of it.

162
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,550
Okay, I got it.

163
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,010
How can she do that, when she's Professor Song Jung Hee's pupil?

164
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,950
I really don't get it.

165
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,070
What are you doing?

166
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,170
Study your music sheets.

167
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,890
Yes.

168
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,990
   

169
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,570
Oh.

170
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,310
What is it?

171
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,320
Nothing.

172
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,720
Are you going to keep playing this way?

173
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,610
How can you think of getting first place on a competition with this?

174
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,590
Do you want to hear that you've regressed?

175
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,290
Should we happily get ruined together?

176
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,830
I'll do it again.

177
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,170
Do it like I tell you, come on!

178
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,090
 My schedule is too packed, so it'll be difficult. 

179
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,150
- Joon Young. 
 - You're here, Song Ah?

180
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,840
 I heard Kim Gyu Hui is entering the Tchaikovsky competition. 

181
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,710
 Isn't that too much of a gamble?  

182
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,090
 She must be confident she'll get first place again.  

183
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,770
You haven't had dinner yet, right? Let's go eat.

184
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,430
Yes.

185
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,760
Unni!

186
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,090
Yes, Su Jeong?

187
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,610
Hello. I saw you as I was passing by, Unni.

188
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,560
What is it?

189
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,810
Did you try contacting the accompanist you asked me about earlier?

190
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,850
Did she say she is available?

191
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,180
No, she can't.

192
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,980
Ah, okay. It's a pity.

193
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,390
If I think of anyone else, I'll let you know.

194
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,270
Thank you.

195
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,850
Are you looking for a new accompanist?

196
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:57,580
Yes. The person I was practicing with had some circumstances that made them unable to do it.

197
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,010
It's alright, I can find someone quickly.

198
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,310
Can't I do it for you?

199
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:08,930
Why look far away when there is a pianist in front of you?

200
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,920
I remember that you said you wanted to achieve this with your own strength, and I respect that.

201
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,920
I also understand that you don't want to go back on something you said.

202
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,390
But still, in case you're in a difficult situation—

203
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,080
But you're busy.

204
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,770
You have to prepare for the competition.

205
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,890
So I don't feel comfortable asking that of you.

206
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,660
It's all right.

207
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,300
Your entrance exam piece is Franck's Sonata, right?

208
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,540
I have to play it for Jung Kyung anyway,

209
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,310
so it's not like I have to master a new piece...

210
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,840
Ah, what I mean is—

211
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,870
That's true.

212
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:07,220
I was forgetting that you were Jung Kyung's accompanist.

213
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,860
Why does the conversation flow to that?

214
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,280
I was just saying it wasn't a burden for me so you wouldn't feel uncomfortable.

215
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:27,130
That's why I talked about Jung Kyung, but why... Why do you react like this?

216
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:43,450
I think both of us are a bit tired today.

217
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,250
Let's stop talking about this.

218
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,110
- Song Ah— 
 - I'll get going first.

219
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,160
   

220
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,170
Oh? Did they say it would rain today?

221
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,900
But I don't have an umbrella.

222
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,160
- Let's run then. 
 - Wait for me!

223
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,970
Let's go together.

224
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,080
You had an umbrella with you?

225
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,410
Yes. I bring it with me every day.

226
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,060
- Everyday? 
 - Yes.

227
00:19:52,060 --> 00:20:00,080
♫   My feelings towards you have always been the same   ♫

228
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,030
I'm sorry.

229
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,170
♫   I've always stood behind you, like this   ♫

230
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:09,020
I was having a headache because of a few things that happened today,

231
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,130
and I was being a bit sensitive.

232
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,170
I'm sorry.

233
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,970
♫   That my sincerity may reach you   ♫

234
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,890
I'm also sorry.

235
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,100
♫   Because you're my everything   ♫

236
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,460
Then you'll let me be your accompanist, right?

237
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,990
♫   A melody for you   ♫

238
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,180
Are you not going to answer?

239
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,240
♫   My beautiful, unwavering feelings   ♫

240
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,240
Yes, I'll ask this of you then.

241
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,940
♫   No matter who asks   ♫

242
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,790
I'll work hard. 
 ♫   My answer is you   ♫

243
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,850
♫   I love you with my whole heart   ♫

244
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,850
♫   I'll give you my heart   ♫

245
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,940
Come here.

246
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,050
Come on.

247
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,770
Don't worry about the rain from now on.

248
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,990
I'll be carrying an umbrella with me all the time.

249
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:01,920
You... Why do you do that with your bow here?

250
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,250
Sorry?

251
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,480
For this scale here, I told you to start with a down-bow.

252
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,010
Why use an up-bow?

253
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,140
Why do you do as you please?

254
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,920
If I start with an up here, the scale can end with a down-bow.

255
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,210
I thought it might sound a bit better like that.

256
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,170
Are you the teacher?

257
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,700
I'm sorry.

258
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,640
Do it properly at the competition.

259
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,140
Yes.

260
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,190
You're home.

261
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,670
Yes, hi.

262
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,130
I apologize for last time.

263
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,390
I spoke a bit too harshly.

264
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,430
It's all right.

265
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,110
It's nice to hear you talk more.

266
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,360
Since I've never seen you do that before.

267
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,470
I was always wondering

268
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,710
what you might be thinking and feeling.

269
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:31,140
If you were wondering, you should have asked me.

270
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,450
That's right. I should have.

271
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,860
Jung Kyung.

272
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,980
Don't you miss your mom?

273
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,060
What about you?

274
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:09,070
If I knew this piano would be staying here this long,

275
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,810
I probably should have learned how to play.

276
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,750
   

277
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,730
From Mom?

278
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,380
I miss her.

279
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,470
I know, too.

280
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:35,180
That she won't come back just because I miss her.

281
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,970
But there's nothing I can do about it,

282
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,730
so I'm just enduring it.

283
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,780
 When will you start working for the foundation? 

284
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,750
 I went to the board meeting, didn't I?  

285
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,900
 Jung Kyung. Why do you hate so much working for the foundation? 

286
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,860
 I told you.  

287
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,890
 I will keep playing the violin. 

288
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,410
 Your violin career ended a long time ago.  

289
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,470
 Why can't you accept it? 

290
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,080
 Like you say, you should accept it, Grandma.  

291
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,210
 The fact that you are thinking of the foundation as mom, and obsessing over it. 

292
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,290
 Did you really create the foundation in honor of mom? 

293
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,740
 You didn't.  

294
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:33,000
 You did that to try to relieve your guilt.  

295
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,210
 The guilt you carry for not having an affectionate relationship with Mom when she was alive.  

296
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,870
 You can't handle the reality of your child leaving this world before you, so you obsess over the foundation.  

297
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,620
 Jung Kyung. 

298
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,360
 You're the same, Dad.  

299
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,410
 All the things my great uncles say about the foundation...  

300
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:59,690
 That it's just the product of grandma's meaningless obsession that eats up money.  

301
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,280
 You also think that's true, to be honest.  

302
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,630
 Then why can't you get rid of the foundation? 

303
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,090
 Even though Mom, with whom you didn't get along, died,  

304
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,690
 why do you keep living in this house?  

305
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,630
 You see, I... Just seeing you two living in this obsessive state 

306
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,380
  while having regrets all your lives, I feel completely worn-out. 

307
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,920
 I don't want to live like that.  

308
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,240
Yes, Mom? I'm practicing.

309
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,300
Sorry?

310
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,420
I'm sorry,  Joon Young. But...

311
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,460
I think I might lose the restaurant.

312
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,160
- Your restaurant? 
  - Yes.

313
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:09,020
Your father put it up as collateral...

314
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,720
 Is Father in his right mind?! 

315
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,120
Your restaurant is the only thing we have left, doesn't he know that?

316
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,220
I'm sorry, Joon Young.

317
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,890
I tried every place I could think of, but I can't find a solution at all.

318
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,800
How much is it?

319
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,060
 Around thirty million won (≈ $25,000) .

320
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,100
By when?

321
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,560
I think the sooner, the better.

322
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,700
I got it for now.

323
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,130
Seriously.

324
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,060
I guess I shouldn't have decided to take a sabbatical year.

325
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:28,310
Had I not come to Korea, I wouldn't have to see this in person.

326
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,990
And I would just have had to make money and send it over.

327
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,180
If you really can't find anywhere else to help,

328
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,300
if you really have no other solution,

329
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,670
- Director Na— 
 - No.

330
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,880
I have received so much from them already.

331
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,460
How can I ask them to help again?

332
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,810
I can never do that.

333
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,290
Woah, both of you said you couldn't come but you did in the end.

334
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,050
Let's go in. Let's go in.

335
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:48,050
Are you two... dating for real?

336
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,020
Since when?

337
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,690
The cake for your boyfriend last time...

338
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,270
It just turned out this way. Let it go.

339
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,030
How can we just let it go?

340
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,860
Can we really let it go?

341
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,220
Why do you make these faces?

342
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,000
Aren't you going to congratulate us?

343
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,980
Come on, congratulate us.

344
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,760
Well, okay. Congrats.

345
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,610
Congrats!

346
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,310
- Nice for you. 
 - Be together forever, and all that.

347
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,420
I'm jealous.

348
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,380
Cheers!

349
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:21,410
And... hop! Ah!

350
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,290
Why do you act like we're close?

351
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:29,830
What are you doing, sir? Do you know me?

352
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,170
The time I wasted because of you.

353
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,910
The feelings. Alcohol.

354
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,460
It's all a waste.

355
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,370
It's such a big waste.

356
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,000
Do you know what I feel the most regretful about losing?

357
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,060
Song Ah.

358
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:10,080
When Eun Ji and Min Su said they were dating,

359
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,280
do you know what was the very first thing I thought of?

360
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,870
That if it doesn't go well for them,

361
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,430
it'll strike the end of SRUPO.

362
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,730
It's ruined now.

363
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,140
I'm sorry.

364
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,990
I was wrong.

365
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,450
Min Seong.

366
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,460
I hope... that like before, we—

367
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,990
No.

368
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,260
Even if I'm not included,

369
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,630
I hope you and Song Ah

370
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,250
can go back to being friends

371
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,100
like before.

372
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,570
 You have to prepare for the competition. 

373
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,780
 So I don't feel comfortable  

374
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,660
 asking that of you. 

375
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,660
 It's all right. 

376
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,400
Should I...

377
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,580
not have asked him to be my accompanist?

378
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,840
 I'm sorry, Joon Young.  

379
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,440
 I tried every place I could think of, but I can't find a solution at all. 

380
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,830
 I think I might lose the restaurant.  

381
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,000
You're saying Park Joon Young will be your accompanist?

382
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,020
Yes.

383
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,010
But why would Park Joon Young play for someone like...

384
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:32,120
Oh my, wait, are you two really dating?

385
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,670
Ah, that is...

386
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,340
Yes.

387
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,770
You were so quick to deny it last time.

388
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,680
Goodness, that's great.

389
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,840
Hey, you've got quite the skills.

390
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,740
Joon Young, this is really frustrating for me right now.

391
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:02,180
Do you think you just have to ask and you can appear on a TV reality show?

392
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,930
Do you know how hard I worked to promote you for it?

393
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:11,330
I already told you last time that I wouldn't do it.

394
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,800
Okay. Then let's say you can think a bit more about the TV appearance.

395
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,730
I have something else to talk about today.

396
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:32,210
A private concert for the VIP clients of Kyunghoo Cards. That's fine, right?

397
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,980
I know you don't like to keep doing things while you're on your sabbatical year,

398
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,930
but this is a private event so word won't get out.

399
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:44,920
More than that, it's a good sum of money,

400
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,370
so Chris said it was fine as long as you would give your okay.

401
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:53,790
It's this. Thirty million won.

402
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,840
Since Kyunghoo cards is my former workplace,

403
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,730
I made this opportunity using my personal connections.

404
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,660
So please,

405
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,190
let's do it this once.

406
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,180
Okay, Joon Young?

407
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,900
- I... 
 - Yes, tell me.

408
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,020
 All the other conditions are as we said, right?  

409
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,930
Yes, yes. Oh, wait, just one.

410
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,050
The performance fee.

411
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,590
Can it be paid in advance?

412
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:41,050
Hae Na, how come

413
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:45,110
- you have no passion lately? 
 - Sorry?

414
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,710
Can't you work a bit more tenaciously?

415
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,560
Look at Song Ah.

416
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,560
She managed to get Park Joon Young to be her accompanist for her entrance exam.

417
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,880
She might look meek, but she actually has great tenacity.

418
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,830
She's one to get anything done.

419
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:02,330
In that regard, you should learn from her.

420
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:05,520
Anyway, I have to go now,

421
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,690
so you lock the door behind you.

422
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,420
See you on next week's lesson.

423
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,510
- Goodbye. 
 - Yes.

424
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,860
 But why would Park Joon Young play for someone like... 

425
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:09,300
 You're going to quit the violin... No? 

426
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,780
 You've started too late, Song Ah. 

427
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,120
 Irrespective of whether you're good or bad at it,  

428
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,690
 it's not something you can catch up to. 

429
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,950
 You can never beat time. 

430
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,650
 Even these guys have souls too. 

431
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,840
 They've lived over a couple of hundred years.  

432
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,720
 You can't let them think they met the wrong owner. 

433
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,660
 I love you. 

434
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,940
 I love you. 

435
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,220
 I love you. 

436
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,360
   

437
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,430
    

438
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:54,150
- Thank you for the lecture. 
 - Thank you for the lecture.

439
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,020
- Unni. 
 - Yes?

440
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,520
For your graduate school exam...

441
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,650
Is Joon Young your accompanist?

442
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,170
Yes.

443
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,510
How did you know?

444
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,820
Unni. Uhm...

445
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,790
   

446
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:26,250
   

447
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:32,190
 Unni, you shouldn't join that chatroom. 

448
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,970
 Alright?  
    

449
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,480
   

450
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,230
   

451
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,490
 Park Joon Young should be taking care of his own career.  

452
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,890
 Why would he play for that girlfriend of his? 

453
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,260
 Maybe she seduced him so she could use him as her accompanist.  

454
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,060
 Park Joon Young is wasted on her.  

455
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,100
I told you three times that the key wasn't making any sound.

456
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,480
I'm sorry. I am,

457
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,970
but we can't call for the repair services just for one broken piano.

458
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,130
Then we would have to call them every day.

459
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:33,540
Then are you asking me to wait until another piano breaks?

460
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,810
It's the school's policy,

461
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,380
what do you want me to do?

462
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:43,480
None of the other students complain about that, so why are you the only one

463
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,820
doing this?

464
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:52,090
If you don't like the school's piano, you can just practice on your own piano at home, can't you?

465
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,240
All right.

466
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,340
 Master Joon Young and Song Ah? 

467
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,420
Yes. You didn't know?

468
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,370
No. When did that happen?

469
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,850
How did you know? I didn't even know.

470
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:22,500
I have a friend from my Arts High School who is a piano teacher at Seoryeong University. She told me.

471
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,660
As expected of you, you have the best personal connections in the College of Music.

472
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:30,610
Then the rumor must have spread all throughout campus already, then.

473
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,400
- But... 
 - What is it?

474
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,270
I think the rumors aren't too good.

475
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:41,480
Is the competition over?

476
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,460
I'm so tired.

477
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:48,270
Team Leader. I heard Master Joon Young and Song Ah are dating.

478
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,010
- I heard. 
 - Wow.

479
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,600
I'm the only one who didn't know?

480
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:58,840
But what's wrong with the rumors? What is not good?

481
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,600
Well, since they are both musicians...

482
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:06,800
In truth, there's a big gap in their skills.

483
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,330
But Joon Young is being Song Ah's accompanist for her graduate school exam, and that seems to get people talking.

484
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,590
Will you also practice at school today?

485
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,400
No, I plan on going to the rehearsal room.

486
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,450
What about you?

487
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,870
Me neither. I'm going to go home.

488
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,130
You like this, don't you? I saw you enjoyed eating it last time.

489
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,060
Thank you.

490
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:56,130
- When— 
 - Yes?

491
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:01,070
Why are you so surprised?

492
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:07,090
It's nothing. What were you going to say?

493
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,270
When are we going to practice playing together?

494
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,920
Should we do it tomorrow?

495
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,760
When should I start going to your professor's lessons?

496
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:27,090
Let's do it a little later.

497
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:31,700
Will you be okay? There's not much time left before the exam.

498
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:36,230
Just a little while.

499
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:43,070
I'll practice alone just a little bit more... let's do that.

500
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:58,320
   

501
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:26,250
Yes, Professor? Ji Won came in first place.

502
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:31,430
Not only did you deliver such great news, you even treat me to dinner.

503
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:34,790
No, it's nothing. Of course, I should invite you.

504
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:39,580
Today is such a good day, I couldn't decline your invitation.

505
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:43,950
But just the fact that Ji Won trusts me and follows me,

506
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,690
is something I'm grateful for.

507
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,250
Yes...

508
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,500
 When that happens, I just pretend not to know.   
    

509
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,780
 It's my name which will be on their profiles anyway.  

510
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,330
What? Why not?!

511
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:28,850
Is that because we asked for the performance fee in advance?

512
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,150
No.

513
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:36,160
The team reviewed it, and honestly, Park Joon Young's marketability is not that high these days,

514
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,820
and it looks like he's not taking care of his image either.

515
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,850
So that's why it was decided we wouldn't go ahead with it.

516
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:46,070
How can you say this nonsense? What's wrong with his image?

517
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:51,340
Well, I hear he's a campus couple, he's being the accompanist for his girlfriend, etc.

518
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,570
He can, of course. But it's a bit, you know?

519
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:58,030
Everyone in our team already knew about it. You know, don't you?

520
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:01,270
That we do very detailed reference checks.

521
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:03,890
I know. But...

522
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:20,980
Joo Sang Hoo. You told me you'd take responsibility for this matter. Did I teach you like that, back then?

523
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,640
To be this irresponsible?

524
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:30,080
I wasn't going to say that, but well.

525
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,060
I really didn't want to send that proposal to the higher-ups,

526
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,820
but I did it for your sake and got seriously told off.

527
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:42,780
They asked me why I would push forward with such a has-been proposal.

528
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,570
What?

529
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:49,580
Hyeong, you coached me back in the day, but now I'm the one who gives you work.

530
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:54,470
So what I'm saying is, bring something that is properly interesting next time.

531
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:02,200
Also, if you came to ask for a favor, then you should at least buy me coffee.

532
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,890
Stop trying to benefit from my company card all the time.

533
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,470
You even order snacks without asking me.

534
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,540
- Hey. 
 - I'm leaving.

535
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,820
Hey, Joo Sang Hoo!

536
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:28,060
 You're doing well today. 

537
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,830
Thank you.

538
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:36,370
For the next lesson, come together with your accompanist. Okay?

539
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:38,270
With Park Joon Young.

540
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:39,570
Yes.

541
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,430
You're doing good, yes.

542
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:48,860
Professor. I...

543
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,880
This.

544
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,010
Here you go.

545
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,380
What is this?

546
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,700
It's the list of tickets purchased for our chamber's concert.

547
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,570
Okay. Thank you.

548
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:04,430
Ah right. You made a reservation of the menu for our get-together, right?

549
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:06,840
Nanjianwanzi always needs a reservation.

550
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,850
Yes.

551
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,570
Okay.

552
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,910
 Song Ah. Call me, please.  

553
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,110
I'll speak comfortably.

554
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:44,180
Park Joon Young is a public figure.

555
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,820
A public figure.

556
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:50,040
Nothing good can come out of a rumor saying he has a girlfriend.

557
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:58,330
I mean, there's nothing we can do about you being bad at your instrument.

558
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:03,450
But isn't it a bit too much to ask Joon Young to be your accompanist?

559
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,010
Well, if it were Lee Jung Kyung...

560
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:09,930
If it were someone like Lee Jung Kyung, it would be fine, but...

561
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,760
Anyway, I tried to get him a performance but because of the rumor about you,

562
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,540
everything got cancelled. What will you do about this?

563
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,510
I thought you were a clever person, but if you hinder your boyfriend's career like this,

564
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:27,570
then it won't do.

565
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,450
Oh my, Hyeon Woo bought a hundred tickets by himself.

566
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,900
Oh? Song Ah? 
    

567
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,330
 Kyunghoo Cards said 

568
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:57,910
 that because they are currently tightening their budget, they can't go ahead with it.  

569
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:04,130
I'll look for something else for now.

570
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:07,240
 - But, Joon Young.   
 - Yes?

571
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:13,420
It's nice you don't look at people's background when dating,

572
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:16,880
but please keep a low profile with your love life.

573
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,270
 You understand? I'll call you again later.  

574
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,520
You're here?

575
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:43,740
I'm going to a get-together for Professor Lee Soo Kyung's chamber orchestra tonight.

576
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:48,750
Ah, the chamber? When is your concert?

577
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:54,330
At the end of the year. We asked to book the great auditorium at Kyunghoo Art Hall.

578
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:56,100
Ah, at Kyunghoo.

579
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:59,770
I'll go see you then.

580
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:03,430
Where is your dinner tonight?

581
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,370
At Hannam-dong.

582
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:07,150
Ah, Hannam-dong.

583
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:10,030
I also need to go there later.

584
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:16,060
We planned to practice with Jung Kyung.

585
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,830
 If it were Lee Jung Kyung...  

586
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:22,760
 If it were someone like Lee Jung Kyung, it would be fine, but... 

587
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,080
I see.

588
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:35,410
When will we practice together?

589
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,480
Next time. Let's do it next time.

590
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,270
All right.

591
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:50,090
Then do you want to meet up later tonight?

592
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:53,840
No, you'll be tired after your practice.

593
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:58,030
Let's meet up. I want to get some fresh air,

594
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:03,460
and walk a bit together with you. I've been feeling suffocated these days.

595
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:12,500
I'll call you. Let's meet if the timing works out.

596
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,090
Yes.

597
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:22,160
Hello. What is your name?

598
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,520
- Kim Da Hae. 
 - Kim Da Hae.

599
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,580
- Choi Yoon Ji. 
 - Alright.

600
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,860
Thank you, you can go in.

601
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:32,120
Welcome. What is your name?

602
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:35,470
Sorry? In Seoul?

603
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:38,060
 I'm sorry for coming so suddenly.  

604
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:46,790
It was a bit difficult for me to stay with your father. So just for today...

605
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:53,010
Yes. You can sleep in my room.

606
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:57,320
But I have something planned, so I can't go to the bus terminal now.

607
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,320
You know my address, right?

608
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,640
Then be careful on your way.

609
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,350
Yes.

610
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,750
 Song Ah, I'm sorry but I don't think we'll be able to meet up tonight.  

611
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:25,290
 My mom suddenly came to Seoul. 

612
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:27,490
 I'm sorry. 

613
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:31,910
 Okay, it's all right.  

614
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:36,710
 Enjoy your time with your mother, and see you tomorrow.  

615
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:47,460
 I'm sorry. Enjoy your dinner.  

616
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,500
- Ah, Jung Kyung. 
 - Yes?

617
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,300
Can I charge my phone?

618
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,290
Over there.

619
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:29,480
Why couldn't you come last time?

620
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,260
What?

621
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:38,660
Last time. On the day we were supposed to practice. Why didn't you come?

622
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:44,110
I went to Daejeon.

623
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,750
- To Daejeon? 
 - Yes.

624
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,960
Let's practice. Do your tuning.

625
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,940
Professor, good evening.

626
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,090
I'm a bit late, aren't I? Are there many people inside?

627
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:12,420
- Yes, almost everyone came. 
  - Alright.

628
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:18,130
Ah right! About the list of tickets purchase for our concert that you gave me.

629
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:23,730
I saw that you had bought tickets as well, but you didn't need to.

630
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,790
I'm sorry?

631
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:28,230
You're working hard as a secretary, why would you buy tickets on top of that?

632
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:32,160
It's fine if just the orchestra members who will play buy them.

633
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,130
Okay?

634
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:37,670
- Ah but, Professor? 
 - Yes?

635
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:46,300
Am I... not a member?

636
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,820
Of course not. I only gathered the talented ones here.

637
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:58,220
I've been making you work as my secretary from the start.

638
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,790
Wrap it up and come in.

639
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,240
You're all here?

640
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,530
- Hello, Professor! 
 - Good evening, Professor.

641
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,970
Sit down, sit down.

642
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:14,120
 Hello, I'm Nam Hae Ran from the class of 2003.  

643
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,590
 I'm a lecturer at Woojin University at the moment. 

644
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,150
Hello, I'm Kim Hae Na from the class of 2017.

645
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:28,770
I'm glad to meet my seniors here. Please take good care of me.

646
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:46,770
Hello, I'm Chae Song Ah from the class of 2017.

647
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:50,370
Song Ah. Our secretary.

648
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:54,050
She's not a member, she helps out for our chamber orchestra.

649
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:59,850
And she's so perfect at her work, she's of great help to me.

650
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:04,660
When she graduates, she'll enter the graduate program and study with me.

651
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:08,270
Okay, our secretary worked really hard to prepare for today's dinner,

652
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:11,810
so please give her a big round of applause.

653
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,660
Get back home safely, all of you.

654
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:34,530
Bye.

655
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:36,720
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye,  Professor.

656
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,570
Let's see each other soon.

657
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:40,930
Yes. Goodbye.

658
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:57,030
Thank you for your work today. See you next time.

659
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:59,330
Goodbye.

660
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:51,830
 Song Ah, I'm sorry but I don't think we'll be able to meet up tonight.  

661
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:54,670
 My mom suddenly came to Seoul.  

662
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,580
 I'm sorry. 

663
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:09,850
 Da capo.  

664
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:17,050
 Going back... to the very beginning  

665
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:20,940
 of the piece. 

666
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:30,600
 At that moment... that term came to mind.  

667
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:42,960
♫   My feelings towards you have always been the same   ♫

668
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,540
   

669
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:51,010
♫   I've always stood behind you, like this   ♫

670
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:57,940
♫   I pray again today   ♫

671
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:06,210
♫   That my sincerity may reach you   ♫

672
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:10,570


673
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:14,700
♫   Whenever you feel sad   ♫

674
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:20,650
♫   Close your eyes and think of this   ♫

675
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:29,890
♫   A melody for you   ♫
 ♫   A melody directed towards you   ♫

676
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:36,080
♫   My beautiful, unwavering feelings   ♫

677
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,650
♫   No matter who asks   ♫

678
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:41,230
 What gave me comfort was Joon Young playing that piano.  

679
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:44,080
 I'm sorry for not being able to see into your heart.  

680
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,430
 Will you keep playing as you please?! 

681
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:47,750
 Can't I at least play the piano as I please?  

682
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:50,530
 Playing the piano doesn't make me happy at all. 

683
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:52,530
 Joon Young has a great eye for women. 

684
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:56,090
 You need a wife who packs your bags and manages your schedule, after all. 

685
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:58,000
 Could you stay by Jung Kyung's side? 

686
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,310
 It keeps bothering me, that you're being Jung Kyung's accompanist. 

687
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:06,170
 Let's not see each other anymore. 

688
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:10,070
♫   I've only looked at and wanted you   ♫
