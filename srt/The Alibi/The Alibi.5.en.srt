1
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,039
No one should know about my
connection with Walter.

2
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:43,543
It's possible Walter was with
another woman before he died.

3
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,087
That means he was with two
women that night?

4
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,214
Walter is not
an innocent victim.

5
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,507
He was a monster.

6
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,843
It's an invitation
to the investor's ball.

7
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,303
Do you really think
I'll be there?

8
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:57,056
Why don't you show our family
what kind of person you are?

9
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:02,896
You are playing a game
you've already lost!

10
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,855
What are you doing here?

11
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:06,608
-Are you upset?
-Just go home.

12
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,902
You being here isn't helping.

13
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,780
Even though you're my brother,
I don't trust you.

14
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,865
So back off from Stella.

15
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:14,949
Alegria?

16
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,911
Let go of me!
I said let go of me!

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,123
That's what you deserve,
Stella.

18
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,334
You homewrecking bitch!

19
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,795
Your family was already broken
before I came into his life!

20
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,673
Did you turn modest
all of a sudden?

21
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,139
Mr. Lim, I'll take you
to the hospital myself.

22
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,140
We're willing to arrange
for everything.

23
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,060
No need.

24
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:46,981
Just make sure that woman
pays for what she did to me!

25
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,984
-We're really sorry.
-Sir. Sir.

26
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,914
Aren't you used
to being naked?

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,085
Come on.

28
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,627
Come on, Stella.

29
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,713
Entertain us!

30
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,924
-You guys want a show, huh?
-Yeah!

31
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,259
You guys want a show?

32
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:18,346
Come on, Stella. Give us the
best performance of your life.

33
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,223
Take a video
so Daddy will see it.

34
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,642
What? Are you shy?

35
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,394
Claudia! Claudia, stop!

36
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,062
How dare you!

37
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,939
-Ma'am, that's enough.
-You witch!

38
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,233
Claudia, stop! You're making
a fool of yourself!

39
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,442
-Oh, yeah?!
-Ma'am.

40
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,153
Are you okay?

41
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,488
Vincent.

42
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,242
We're leaving. We don't
want any trouble.

43
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,785
No, she's staying!

44
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,203
The police
are on their way.

45
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,622
She needs to be accountable
for what she did to Mr. Lim

46
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,749
and the humiliation
she caused us.

47
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,418
Stella didn't do
anything wrong.

48
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,838
It was all Matthew
and Claudia's fault.

49
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:57,468
Fine.

50
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,138
Call the cops.

51
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:04,350
That way, I can report
what Claudia did to me

52
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,561
and how Mr. Lim
harassed me.

53
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,689
You may think
I'm just a nobody,

54
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:13,484
but I have the right
to defend myself!

55
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,070
-I have nothing to lose.
-Stella.

56
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,573
Because I can't get any
lower than this.

57
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,828
But for all of you
with money and power,

58
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,079
you have everything
to lose.

59
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,957
And once you go down,

60
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,961
it will be a big
humiliation to your family.

61
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,463
Stella, that's enough.

62
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,799
Stella.

63
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,426
Stella.

64
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,969
Stella, are you okay?

65
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,346
Let's go home.

66
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,183
Mr. Moreno, I'm really sorry
you had to witness that.

67
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,226
It's a mess, Vincent.

68
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,103
-I know, sir, but...
-Sorry, Mr. Cabrera.

69
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,357
I'll get back to you.

70
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,359
Mr. Moreno, we'll fix...

71
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,197
We'll talk later.

72
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,248
Stella.

73
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,708
Are you okay?

74
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,005
Just stay here, okay?

75
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,716
I'll find a cab.

76
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,553
I'll drive
you home.

77
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,724
We can manage.

78
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,394
Stella, I insist. I can't just
let you leave like that.

79
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,731
What happened? I thought
you were going home.

80
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,402
I was going to.

81
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,320
But Mr. Lim saw me.

82
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,614
Stella, you shouldn't
have talked to him.

83
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,741
You should've just
ignored him.

84
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,536
If you had, Claudia wouldn't
have seen you.

85
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,455
She wouldn't have
hurt you.

86
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,792
Why, Vincent?

87
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,298
Do you think I like
what happened?

88
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,300
Stella, that's not what
I meant.

89
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,469
I'm just frustrated that I
wasn't able

90
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,055
to protect you
from all of this.

91
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,140
But, Stella...

92
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,310
This is a huge mess.

93
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,854
And to be honest,

94
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,356
I don't know
how to fix this.

95
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,651
Stella, you shouldn't
have come here.

96
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,113
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,242
I thought
I was helping you.

98
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:28,202
But don't worry.

99
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,288
I won't put you
in a situation

100
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,081
where you'll
get humiliated again.

101
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,584
That way, you won't have
to protect me from them.

102
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,502
Stella... Stella...

103
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,546
And we don't have
to see each other again.

104
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,883
This is where it all ends.

105
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:43,217
Stella.

106
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,117
Stella.

107
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,453
Are you really okay?

108
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,123
Let me see your wounds.

109
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,458
Let's clean it.

110
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,542
Wait.

111
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,421
What were you
doing there?

112
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,715
Why are you
wearing a uniform, huh?

113
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,219
I looked for a job...

114
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,471
so I can help you.

115
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,348
You didn't have to,
Katherine.

116
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,643
I told you I'll take care
of you, right?

117
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,520
What if you can't
work anymore?

118
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,481
What if you get tired,
who will help you?

119
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,233
That won't happen.

120
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,943
I have you and Joseph.

121
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,861
You two are my source
of strength.

122
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,530
I won't get tired.

123
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,284
All I'm saying...

124
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,998
is please protect
yourself too.

125
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,586
I hope you think about
what happened earlier.

126
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,092
I saw how it's
all messed up...

127
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,096
and how they
can hurt you.

128
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:15,476
I hope what you said
to Vincent is true.

129
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,271
I really hope...

130
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,607
you stay away
from them.

131
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,531
Once I find Joy,

132
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,074
we'll leave this place.

133
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,702
We'll go somewhere
far from here.

134
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,830
We'll go to a place...

135
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,209
where no one knows me
as Stella.

136
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,920
I'll fulfill my promise
to you.

137
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,797
We'll start a new life.

138
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,800
They won't hurt us
no matter what they do.

139
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:53,181
I won't get tired
until that happens, Katherine.

140
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,891
That's a promise.

141
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,933
That's my promise
to you and Joseph.

142
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,853
As long as I have
you two,

143
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,732
I won't get tired in working
to change our lives.

144
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,610
Remember that, okay?
That's a promise.

145
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,629
Arthur, we have got
to stop this.

146
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,380
The more we push Vincent,

147
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,716
the more he grows
distant to our family.

148
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,218
I don't want
to lose my son.

149
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,302
Your son!

150
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:37,015
Did you see
what he did earlier?

151
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,269
Instead of following what
I want to fix everything,

152
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:42,480
he sided with
that woman.

153
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,274
He doesn't care about our
family and reputation.

154
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,568
All he thinks about
is his personal interests.

155
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,945
Is that all you care about?

156
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,155
Our name and reputation?

157
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,324
We are prisoners
of our name!

158
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,909
We're full of secrets!

159
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,619
Look at what happened
to our children!

160
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,038
Oh, don't get confused,
Jacqueline!

161
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,499
If it weren't for our
reputation and money,

162
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,960
a simple mistake
could've destroyed everything!

163
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,504
Our name is not our prison.
It's our protection!

164
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,928
Hey, Stella. Why are you here?

165
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,639
I thought you were
with your boyfriend?

166
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,266
We're over, Mama Mona.

167
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,894
I'll be working here
again from now on.

168
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,104
No matter what I do,

169
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,357
I can't escape
from this life.

170
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,292
Ow! What the f...

171
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,796
Is that what you wanted
out of last night

172
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,881
by bringing that whore,
Matthew?!

173
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,343
Dad, I only did this
because of what you wanted.

174
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,262
You wanted that woman
to stay away from Vincent

175
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,722
and our family.

176
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,225
Did you see how they
parted ways that night?

177
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,310
They fought.

178
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,187
Exactly.

179
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,522
So my plan worked.

180
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,773
And because of that,

181
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,192
you are very much welcome.

182
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,944
Don't be an idiot, Matthew!

183
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,322
You've caused us
more harm than good!

184
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,035
If Walter were here
and I had him do this job,

185
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,413
he would've
controlled everything

186
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,374
and made sure it's only Stella
and Vincent involved.

187
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,127
He would've kept it clean,
but you...

188
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,755
You're so reckless and stupid!

189
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,175
You let them fight
in front of us.

190
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,845
Instead of Stella
getting screwed over,

191
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,556
it's our whole family
that ended up suffering

192
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,808
because of your screw-up!

193
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,351
Is that so hard to understand?!

194
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,896
Thank you! Thank you!

195
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:15,317
You only succeeded
in making a fool of our family

196
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,404
and that clown of yourself!

197
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,325
Get out.

198
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,287
Get out, Matthew.

199
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,679
What, sir?
Sir Cardo went AWOL?

200
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,603
Uh... How come?

201
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,063
We're in the middle
of an investigation.

202
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,190
Forget him.

203
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,779
Does he think the case
will wait for him?

204
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,994
I've found a new partner
for you anyway.

205
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,413
Who, sir?

206
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,374
He's skilled.

207
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,669
He's been in the service
for 25 years.

208
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,838
He has impeccable record.

209
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,590
He's solved...

210
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,928
a lot of cases except one.

211
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,058
Meet Detective
Andres Tolentino.

212
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,976
He's Norman.

213
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,271
He'll be your partner
from now on.

214
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,367
Sir.

215
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,245
These are the evidences
we found in Cunanan's villa.

216
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,413
-Have some coffee, sir.
-Thank you.

217
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,712
We're still trying to figure out
the connection of some of them

218
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,214
to the case.

219
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,220
You know...

220
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:12,893
sometimes the smallest detail
is the key to solving a case.

221
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:09,908
Sway your hips more.

222
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,702
That's it. Down.

223
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,828
Down.

224
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,164
And don't forget your face.

225
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,333
Seduce the audience.

226
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,751
There you go!

227
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,919
Down. Down.

228
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,089
-That's it.
-What are you doing here?

229
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,175
Stella doesn't want
to see you anymore.

230
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,218
Just leave!

231
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,262
Please, Vincent.
Don't cause trouble here.

232
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,390
I'm not here to cause trouble.
I just want to talk to Stella.

233
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,017
Stella?

234
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,602
-Vincent!
-S-Stella?

235
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,187
Stop it, Vincent!

236
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,856
The bar is still closed.
Just come back later.

237
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,360
Mama Mona, I just want
to explain my side to Stella.

238
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,822
Don't bother explaining.
It doesn't matter what you say.

239
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,574
Vincent...

240
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,661
Stella got really hurt.

241
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,997
She was humiliated
and degraded.

242
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,292
What happened to her
wasn't part of your deal.

243
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:05,172
Hasn't she done enough
for you?

244
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,093
So, please just leave.

245
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:10,844
Go on.

246
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,680
Leave.

247
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,244
Hey, Katherine.
Is it your day off?

248
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,412
No.

249
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,082
I'm thinking of resigning.

250
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,208
What?!

251
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,043
Stop asking questions.

252
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,463
You just started working there,
and you're already being lazy.

253
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,590
I'm not being lazy, okay?!

254
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,052
There's someone I'm not
on good terms with at work.

255
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,222
Oh, come on.

256
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,558
That's not the Katherine I know.

257
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,351
Since when did you
back down from anyone?

258
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,271
You didn't work
to make friends, right?

259
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,856
Oh, please, Joseph.

260
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,692
You're just sulking because you
won't get any gifts from me now.

261
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,694
It's not like that.

262
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,906
It's just a shame since you'd
finally be able to help Stella.

263
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,700
Isn't that what matters?

264
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,454
Will Stella still wear this?

265
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,332
It's torn.
I better throw it away.

266
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:23,541
Don't throw it away.

267
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,878
She'll probably stitched it up
so she can wear it again.

268
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,179
Hey!

269
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,516
What are you doing here?

270
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,895
You've been lurking
around here for a while.

271
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,898
Are you a spy?

272
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,108
We live clean here.

273
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,568
No addicts around.

274
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,112
Yeah, do we look
like addicts to you?

275
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,947
Guys, what's
all the ruckus about?

276
00:17:55,491 --> 00:18:00,579
Look, this guy's been hanging
around the area

277
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,873
and acting kind of sketchy.

278
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,625
Guys, let's all calm down.

279
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,378
He's my friend.

280
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,255
-Well, now we know.
-That settles it.

281
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,590
-Let's go.
-Come on.

282
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,844
Why'd you come all the way here?

283
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,805
You're lucky
you didn't get stabbed.

284
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,097
What?

285
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:22,518
-I was hoping to talk with you.
-What for?

286
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,728
Did you forget to say anything?

287
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,605
I heard you're resigning.

288
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,440
What did you expect

289
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,443
after your family humiliated
my sister?

290
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,737
She's my brother's mistress.

291
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,533
Did you think her coming
to the ball was a good idea?

292
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,368
She should've known better
than that.

293
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,286
Victim blaming much?

294
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,541
Your family caused a scene,
not my sister.

295
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,793
And on top of that,
they had no right to hurt

296
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,628
and humiliate her.

297
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,296
But everything should
be fine now.

298
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,132
My sister has probably ended
things with your brother,

299
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,635
so your family doesn't need
to worry about her anymore.

300
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,805
Are we really sure they're
not getting back together?

301
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,017
To be honest,

302
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,728
I'm not comfortable with your
sister being involved with us.

303
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,021
Well, it's a tie!

304
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,566
I don't like
your brother Vincent.

305
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,067
He's full of red flags!

306
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,027
He's only going
to ruin my sister's life.

307
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,821
We're on the same page.

308
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,406
I admit.

309
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,825
I'm not proud
of my sister's actions,

310
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,285
but I love her.

311
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,370
I know.

312
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,497
Why don't we join forces

313
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,626
and keep them from getting
back together?

314
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,420
Is it a deal?

315
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,967
Sure. It's a deal.

316
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,595
I'll see you at work, okay?

317
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,096
I've got you.

318
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,022
This will look great
at the rest house.

319
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,733
How much?

320
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,485
Um...

321
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,487
Just five million pesos,
Miss Nelia.

322
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,865
A bit pricey.

323
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,533
Is there any chance
of a discount?

324
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,494
I'm sorry, but...

325
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,039
that's the last price.

326
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,166
It's worth every peso, ma'am.
It's an Esteves piece,

327
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,293
and it's a very good investment.

328
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,712
I'm just curious.

329
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,214
Why are you selling it?

330
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,508
Um...

331
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,595
Well, let's just say that...

332
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,057
I've got something more
important to use the money for.

333
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,269
Um, if you want, ma'am...

334
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,563
I can include this
as a freebie.

335
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,399
I'm sure your husband
will like it.

336
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:42,157
Also, I have a collection
of rare watch pieces.

337
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,618
If you add it all up,

338
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,037
including the painting,

339
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,666
it would cost, more or less,
around 15 million pesos.

340
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:54,419
But I can give everything up
for just 10 million.

341
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,839
That's a very good deal, ma'am.

342
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,841
It's basically a steal.

343
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,386
Okay, I'll pay in cash.

344
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,598
Missing someone, aren't you?

345
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,060
Why would I miss that moron?

346
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,396
I didn't name anyone.

347
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,273
Mmm.

348
00:21:56,356 --> 00:22:01,028
Vincent popped into your head
when I said that, didn't he?

349
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,868
I don't need him.

350
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,120
I'm used to being alone anyway.

351
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,997
It's been this way
for a long time.

352
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,167
You keep saying that.

353
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,005
But nothing beats having someone
by your side.

354
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,633
They'll just be a pain.

355
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,387
I've got a lot
on my plate right now.

356
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,321
We're not open yet.

357
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,240
Hi, Stella.

358
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,576
What brings you here?

359
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,411
Uh...

360
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,789
Vincent wanted you to have this.

361
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:06,802
"I kept my side of the deal.
Thanks for everything. Vincent."

362
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,348
Stella, I'll be on my way.

363
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,772
Vincent.

364
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,026
I already gave Stella what
you wanted me to give her.

365
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,198
What a lucky woman.

366
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,034
Ten million is ten million.

367
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,037
Come to think of it...

368
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,999
It's for the best
to cut ties with her.

369
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,043
I mean, she held up her end
of the deal.

370
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,837
You got to use her
as your alibi,

371
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,339
and now the investigators
are off your back.

372
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,049
Win-win, right?

373
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,886
Hmm.

374
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,805
Come on.

375
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,394
So... is there more
to the story or what?

376
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,022
Because I'm all ears.

377
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:49,905
Vincent.

378
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,825
Don't tell me you've caught
feelings for Stella.

379
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,370
-Is that coffee or alcohol?
-Hey, dude! Come on!

380
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,497
Lighten up!

381
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,125
Just focus on yourself for now.
The case is still ongoing.

382
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:06,087
The case ends only when
they find Walter's killer.

383
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,300
Now that you've mentioned it...

384
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,554
I really suspect Matthew.

385
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,680
It doesn't add up.

386
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,642
Why did he invite Stella
to the party?

387
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,519
Just so he could try to ruin you
and Stella? And then what?

388
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,274
Or maybe to avenge
Walter's death.

389
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,610
That's possible.

390
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:30,987
Hold up.

391
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:34,032
How were they connected, really?

392
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,619
Vincent...

393
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,413
Could he be using drugs, too?

394
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,460
-Good evening, sir.
-Hello.

395
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,719
We've been waiting
for you, Sir Matthew.

396
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:55,929
Really?

397
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,890
Wow, that's sweet of you both.

398
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,644
-Come with us, sir.
-Why?

399
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,938
-Just do it.
-I don't understand.

400
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,773
I think you got
the wrong person.

401
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,817
-Now don't be scared.
-Where are we going?

402
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,527
-We'll just talk.
-What's going on?

403
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,445
Hey, come on,
get your hands off me!

404
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,968
Wait! What exactly is going on?

405
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,220
-What do you need from me?
-Keep walking!

406
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,889
Is this a ransom situation?
I'll pay!

407
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,557
Just tell me how much!

408
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,683
He's all yours!

409
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,146
I thought we were just
going to talk.

410
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,273
Yes, while we're
breaking your bones!

411
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,777
Boss said you're not paying
your debt,

412
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,487
and it's increasing because
of the interest!

413
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,659
How will I be able to pay
if you're not letting me play?

414
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,661
You're very unlucky.
You don't win at all.

415
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,914
-That's not true!
-You're all out of luck!

416
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,087
Guard, help me! Help me!

417
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,588
Guard!

418
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,134
Are you stupid?
No one will help you here!

419
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,097
Help!

420
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,066
Please stop! I'll pay you!

421
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,359
I...

422
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,903
I'll be inheriting our company.

423
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,364
Just wait a little longer.

424
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,621
Wait. Hold on.

425
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,209
Wait. Please, I'm begging you.

426
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,710
If you kill me now,

427
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,338
I wouldn't be able
to pay my debt at all!

428
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,933
-Come on.
-Let's go.

429
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:05,618
Vincent.

430
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,980
Good day.

431
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,858
I'm Stella.

432
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,776
I was the one
who called you last night.

433
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:40,778
Oh, yeah.

434
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,115
You're the one with
the missing sibling, right?

435
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,036
Yes, that's me.

436
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,414
She was a baby
when she went missing.

437
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,337
Six years have passed since.

438
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,056
Here.

439
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,103
This is going to be hard.

440
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,981
Especially she was a baby
when she disappeared.

441
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,653
I can pay.

442
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,404
Whatever it will cost.

443
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,740
Just tell me
where she was taken.

444
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,205
I need all the details.

445
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,585
I can't fit that in
on Sir Vincent's schedule.

446
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,753
It's already full.

447
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,963
Where's Vincent?

448
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,840
He's at the finance office,
Sir Matthew.

449
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:24,966
Finance?

450
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,468
Why is he there?

451
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,470
He didn't say.

452
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,099
Argh! Come on!

453
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,602
Argh!

454
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,021
Come on, Matthew. Think! Think!

455
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,545
Come on, come on.

456
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:07,091
Shit! Shit! Shit!

457
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,052
Shit! Shit!

458
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,553
Fuck!

459
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,679
Argh!

460
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,758
Sir Ricardo is still not
answering my calls.

461
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,093
What's with him?

462
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,474
Sir.

463
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,059
How many videos have you
gone through?

464
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,854
Good thing we got some videos

465
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,565
from the social media accounts
of their guests.

466
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,196
Right. You need
to focus on that.

467
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,199
I need your help.

468
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:17,578
We need to find whose clothes
match this piece of fabric.

469
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:21,082
There are photos in the box.
Go through it one by one.

470
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:34,053
Sir, it seems this fabric...

471
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,348
was from a woman's dress.

472
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,394
If it's from a woman,

473
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:44,439
then it can't be Sir Arthur.

474
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,191
It can't be Matthew.

475
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,278
Most of all,
it can't be Vincent.

476
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,908
Hold on.

477
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,360
Man, you look serious.

478
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,945
It's as if you're
an auditor.

479
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,532
An equipment upgrade
without a receipt...

480
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,827
Delivery in freight...

481
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,455
Also no receipts.

482
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,250
Office supplies...

483
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,710
All these have no receipts.

484
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,297
Staff...

485
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,882
Staff training?

486
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,301
Man.

487
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:59,430
Look. We had a staff training
and I didn't know.

488
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,515
Here.

489
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,443
We didn't have staff training
this year, right?

490
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,866
So much money
has been unaccounted for.

491
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,660
Man.

492
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,161
What are you thinking?

493
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,497
And Walter was the CFO
during this period

494
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,749
and I'm sure
he knew all this.

495
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:30,628
And it's impossible that Matthew
is clueless about this.

496
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,884
Yes, I'll be there
30 minutes before Dad.

497
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,845
Have you sent him a reminder?

498
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,973
And make sure
no one else is there, okay?

499
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,950
Good day.
Are you Vincent Cabrera?

500
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:04,287
-Who are you?
-Uh, I'm Detective Tolentino.

501
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,664
I was newly assigned
to Walter Cunanan's case.

502
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,458
Why? What happened to Ricardo?

503
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,378
We're the ones
who should be asking questions.

504
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,464
I'm in a hurry.
I have to be somewhere.

505
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,924
You have five minutes.

506
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,676
Where's Stella?

507
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,553
She's not here.

508
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,598
Really? I thought
she lived here.

509
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,182
What is this about?

510
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,351
What was Stella doing
at the resort in San Juan

511
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,395
the night Walter Cunanan died?

512
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,023
This is Stella, right?

513
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,238
She didn't mention
in her statement

514
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,990
that you met with her
that night.

515
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,368
I asked her to go there.

516
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,371
Generally, we're not required
to volunteer information,

517
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,082
especially if the cops
didn't ask.

518
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,335
I called Stella.

519
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:55,004
I told her to meet me
at the bar.

520
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,176
Vincent invited me over.

521
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,260
To do what?

522
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,514
To cook
vegetable-pork stew.

523
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,352
What else could it be?

524
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,103
Of course, for a sexy time.

525
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,314
That was bold of you.
His wife was there, right?

526
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,692
Do I look like I care?

527
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,069
No, I don't.

528
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,237
Besides, that was a nice resort.

529
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,239
The bed is soft.

530
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,449
I'm just wondering,

531
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,327
how come that didn't come up
the first time we talked?

532
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,453
Why?

533
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,580
Did you ask me that?

534
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,667
It's hard to just say something
when you're not even asked.

535
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,835
You know, Ms. Morales,
we can sue you

536
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,421
for obstruction of justice
for harboring information.

537
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,006
Oh.

538
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,592
Gosh, that was too deep.

539
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:46,555
Did you do anything else
aside from that 'sexy time'?

540
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:51,102
We asked you
what you guys did around 11PM.

541
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,229
You said you were together
in the club.

542
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,439
We didn't meet at the resort.

543
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,943
He got pissed with his family
so I also left.

544
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,903
There.

545
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,030
Then we proceeded
to have a great time.

546
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,949
Would you like to know...

547
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,702
the littlest details
of what we did?

548
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,080
Ask away.

549
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,083
I can answer it.

550
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,960
Come on,

551
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,129
if I leave off
some details again,

552
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,839
I might get crucified next time.

553
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,262
Oh, cat got your tongue?

554
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,388
Ask away.

555
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,389
Don't worry, Ms. Morales.

556
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,559
If something comes up,
we'll be back again.

557
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,187
This is going to be long, huh?
But, sure.

558
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,898
I haven't backed down to
a single question from you.

559
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,151
See you at the finals.

560
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,319
You're taking too much
of my time.

561
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,071
I need to get ready.

562
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,007
Thank you for giving me
a heads-up before the cops came.

563
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,676
That could've been
a huge trouble.

564
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,178
Good thing I got around it.

565
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,764
Why?

566
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,771
Stella, you haven't told me
why you were there that night.

567
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,191
I was doing a side hustle.

568
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,692
What kind?

569
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:25,196
Why were you there?
W-Who are you with?

570
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,448
Is this part two
of the interrogation?

571
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,825
I thought the cops
had left already.

572
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,285
I need to get back to work...

573
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:32,369
Stella.

574
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,750
I'm sorry.

575
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,461
Not just for today but...

576
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,463
for all the trouble
I've caused you.

577
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,426
Are you still mad?

578
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,721
Why would I be mad?

579
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,890
I'm aware of what
I've put myself into.

580
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,683
I'm your alibi,

581
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,185
and I'll stand by everything

582
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,229
to clear your name.

583
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,439
I don't have the right
to resent you.

584
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,775
I'm used to being used.

585
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,360
I'm getting paid here, remember?

586
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,237
Who am I to complain?

587
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,947
Yes, we have a deal.

588
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,032
But believe me or not,

589
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,618
Stella, I'm doing everything
I can to protect you.

590
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,578
I try to, for your sake.

591
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,458
Oh, please, Vincent.

592
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,836
Are we fooling each other now?

593
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,796
Who do we think we're kidding?

594
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,924
Stella, do you really think

595
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:30,219
I'll go to you
and tell you all the cops know

596
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,762
if I don't care about you?

597
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,557
Look.

598
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,017
I'm sorry for bringing you
into this mess.

599
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,689
I'm sorry if I made you feel
like I was just using you.

600
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,150
Stella, you don't deserve
to be treated that way.

601
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:48,112
I know this has been difficult
for you because of me.

602
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,573
I'm fine.

603
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,740
I can handle it.

604
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,451
Stella, you're not okay.

605
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,077
You're just telling
yourself that

606
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:59,290
for others to see you as someone
strong, brave, and determined.

607
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,376
But Stella,
I know that you get tired.

608
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,839
It gets hard and you get hurt.

609
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:09,675
You told me that, remember?

610
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,135
Your life hasn't been easy.

611
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:15,264
That all your life, all you do
is sacrifice for your siblings.

612
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,933
You put other people first
before yourself.

613
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,186
Stella, in the short time
I've known you,

614
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,979
I've witnessed all that.

615
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,648
What are you trying to say?

616
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,318
Where is this going?

617
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,196
Stella, I want you to know
that I appreciate you.

618
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:36,452
You need someone who'll protect
and take care of you.

619
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,580
Someone who sees your worth.

620
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,882
Vincent, enough of this.

621
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,134
That's enough.

622
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,638
I got what I wanted.

623
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:56,764
The money you paid me

624
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,934
was a huge help
to me and my siblings.

625
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:05,648
It gave us the possibility
to be together again.

626
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,316
Hold on? What do you mean?

627
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,362
I have a missing sister.

628
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,074
Now that I have the money,

629
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,994
it'll be easier to look for her.

630
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:22,081
-Stella, I'll help you find...
-There's no need. No need.

631
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,833
Vincent, enough already.

632
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,336
I can handle myself.
I've got this.

633
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,632
The money you paid me was
more than enough.

634
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,154
Vincent. Hey, Vincent.

635
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,825
Not now, George.
I've got a meeting with Dad.

636
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,618
Vincent, you need to see this.

637
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,125
So that's why
another investigator

638
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,418
spoke to me and Stella.

639
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,627
Mm-hmm.

640
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,462
Word around the police station

641
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,755
is that the change was sudden.

642
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,549
What do you think?

643
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,009
Think there was foul play?

644
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,761
It can't be a coincidence,
that's for sure.

645
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,806
He died while handling
Walter's case.

646
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,683
You know what's worse?

647
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,936
Maybe he uncovered something
and was killed because of it.

648
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,197
Marge, where's Dad?

649
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,451
Wait, did you get my text
saying I had an emergency?

650
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,077
I'm sorry, but the chairman
has already left.

651
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,996
He's got tons of external
meetings lined up today.

652
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:45,664
What?

653
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,337
Hey, Vincent!

654
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,550
Vincent, hang on!
Where are you going?

655
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,843
Are you going to see Dad?

656
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,345
What do you plan to talk about?

657
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,471
Hey! Wait for me!

658
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,431
What's going on?

659
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,643
Are you still trying to win back
Cabrera News?

660
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,935
Yes.

661
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,562
Among other things.

662
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,522
We've got a lot to cover.

663
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,442
A long conversation that could
change the course of our lives.

664
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:14,902
What will you talk about?

665
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,403
Why can't you tell me?

666
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,821
Alright.

667
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,531
-You really want to know?
-Yeah.

668
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,910
It's about your
gambling addiction.

669
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,996
And where you're getting
your money from.

670
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,500
Okay, look, I can explain.

671
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,710
Hold on. Was Walter
your partner-in-crime

672
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,253
in stealing from the company?

673
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,547
No! No!

674
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,885
Vincent. Vincent, please...

675
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,512
Vincent! Hear me out first!

676
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:42,554
Okay. Look...

677
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,556
I made some mistakes, okay?

678
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,017
Yes, I had a serious
gambling problem.

679
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,060
But...

680
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,728
I-I thought I could control it,

681
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,814
but I just kept digging deeper
and deeper.

682
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,441
Now I need
to pay off everything,

683
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,693
before they take my head off.

684
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,529
Please. I'm so sorry.

685
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,491
Believe me when I say...

686
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,494
I'm trying to fix this.

687
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,578
Just...

688
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,123
Just please don't tell Dad.

689
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,333
Dad needs to know about this.

690
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,751
Vincent, no!

691
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,129
We both know him, don't we?

692
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,339
If he finds out,

693
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,341
everything will get worse!

694
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,135
He's going to disown me!

695
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,387
Vincent, please...
Give me a chance.

696
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,888
I just need a little time.

697
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,306
Please, please!

698
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,393
-Then answer my question!
-Okay...

699
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,645
What was Walter's role
in all this?

700
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,480
Oh, yes, Walter!

701
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,817
He basically talked me into it!

702
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,363
He found out I had a gambling
issue and offered to help.

703
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,407
And of course, I accepted.

704
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:47,536
But stealing from the company
was a stupid move on my part.

705
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,663
Still, what choice did I have?

706
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,291
Walter...

707
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,085
He promised that
no one would find out.

708
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,504
Said he'd buried everything
related to this.

709
00:45:58,505 --> 00:45:59,506
Vincent...

710
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,757
Please.

711
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,634
Please.

712
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,094
I'm begging you.

713
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,098
Don't tell anyone.

714
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,567
Vincent.

715
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,194
I talked to your dad.

716
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:23,447
He is willing
to meet up with you,

717
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,741
but you have to make an
appointment

718
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,576
with his secretary again.

719
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:31,121
What are you going to talk
about? Maybe I can be of help.

720
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,707
Let Dad and I
talk about it first.

721
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,627
I talked to your
dad's secretary

722
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,214
and she said that she saw
you and Matthew talking.

723
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,717
She didn't hear anything,
but Matthew was in distress.

724
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,427
Are you two fighting?
Is there a problem?

725
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,179
Well, he has
a huge problem.

726
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,181
Huh? What is it?
What's his problem?

727
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,224
Tell me.

728
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,851
-I have the right to know.
-Mom.

729
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,979
Are you just going to let me
find it out from others

730
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,147
or through other means?

731
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,482
Because I can do that.

732
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,443
But what if I find out
about the problem

733
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,196
and it's already late
to fix it?

734
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,952
Matthew has gambling issues.

735
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,746
He owes a loan shark
a huge amount of money.

736
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,915
-Is he in danger?
-No.

737
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,085
Well, not yet.

738
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,256
But he's stealing money
from the company

739
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,341
and it's a huge amount
of money.

740
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,635
I also found out...

741
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:32,015
that he and Walter had been
working together regarding this.

742
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,267
I can't believe it.

743
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,937
And the problem
isn't over yet.

744
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,814
I'm sure that Matthew
is drowning in debt,

745
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:43,443
and he will take money from
the company again.

746
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,654
I'm doing everything to save
Cabrera News

747
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:49,366
while Matthew is stealing
from us.

748
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,755
I passed by our favorite
store in the south.

749
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,882
The one we would
often visit.

750
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:09,011
They still sell our favorite
pastries.

751
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,263
We often went there,
remember?

752
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:12,973
Well, that's all
I could afford.

753
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,808
I was just a struggling
journalist then,

754
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,184
but you gave me
a chance.

755
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,645
It's probably because
of these pastries.

756
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,189
Here.

757
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,317
Thank you.

758
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,908
Is there something wrong?

759
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,201
What are you
thinking about?

760
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,622
If you had talked
to Vincent,

761
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,832
you would know
why I'm like this.

762
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:39,958
Tell me.

763
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,796
I'm worried about Matthew.

764
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,257
I've been trying to call him,
but he's not picking up.

765
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,843
He hasn't come home yet.

766
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:52,304
He'll be home soon.
You know how he is.

767
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,514
What if he doesn't?

768
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,309
What if he got
in trouble?

769
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:59,227
What are you talking about?

770
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,453
Vincent found out...

771
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,458
Matthew is deep in debt.

772
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:26,380
He's stealing a huge amount
of money from the company.

773
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:50,904
Do you have any updates
on where my sister is?

774
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:54,324
Ma'am Morales,
I've started gathering evidence

775
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:57,994
to verify everything
you told me before.

776
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,538
But for now,

777
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:03,250
I can't find any clear motive
for her disappearance.

778
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,715
If the money I first gave you
isn't enough,

779
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:10,882
please let me know.

780
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,718
I'll add whatever
amount it takes.

781
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:17,264
Miss Stella,
this isn't just about money.

782
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,434
I want to help you.

783
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,771
But I don't want you to get your
hopes up that it'll be easy.

784
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,566
Or...

785
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,067
Or what?

786
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:35,615
There's a big possibility you'll
never find your sister again.

787
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:41,329
Well, thank you all for coming
on such short notice.

788
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,791
We have an urgent matter
that needs immediate attention.

789
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,752
Is it about the anomalies
in the company?

790
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,003
Yes, Arthur.

791
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,463
We all know that.

792
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,548
Misallocated funds.

793
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,425
Tampered reports.

794
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,678
Confidential data leaked
to external competitors.

795
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,930
HR violations.

796
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,808
And all this
was done by one person.

797
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,853
And he's not just any employee.

798
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:07,355
It's your own son, Mr. Cabrera.

799
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,608
Have you spoken to him?

800
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:13,236
What evidence
do you have against Matthew?

801
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,780
Matthew?!

802
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:15,781
No, Ms. Cabrera.

803
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,366
We're talking about Vincent!

804
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,536
And we've
found plenty of evidence.

805
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,872
I'm surprised
this hasn't reached you yet.

806
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,333
Vincent would never do that.
That's impossible!

807
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,251
The evidence points clearly.

808
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,836
His signature.

809
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,255
His authorization codes.

810
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:35,717
His personal email
linked to the transfers.

811
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,093
And most of all,

812
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,137
we have CCTV footage of him

813
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:42,265
taking the company's
official documents.

814
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,392
I want to see all the evidence
you're talking about.

815
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:48,230
I want this investigated
as soon as possible!

816
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:49,940
Check your folder.

817
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,237
Whoa.

818
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,826
But I want Vincent Cabrera

819
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:03,453
out of this company immediately!

820
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,830
Wait.

821
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,207
You're firing Vincent
from the company?

822
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,708
I won't allow it!

823
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,378
And I will fight this
with every right I possess!

824
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,921
Jacqueline, calm down.

825
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,589
Calm down.

826
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,175
Don't let your emotions
control you.

827
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,761
He's our son, Arthur.
This is wrong!

828
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,346
Motion on the table

829
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,890
for the removal
of Vincent Cabrera

830
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,976
from all executive functions

831
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:29,938
pending legal reviews
and accountability proceedings.

832
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,858
Raise your hands
for those who are in favor.

833
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,414
This isn't right.

834
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:51,918
We need to comply with the
company protocols, Jacqueline.

835
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,301
The sooner we show
the struggles of the family,

836
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,928
the faster the viewers
will connect.

837
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,222
-Right, sir?
-Mm.

838
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,932
Yes.

839
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:09,811
But it should be less political
and more personal.

840
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,022
Something that hits
closer to home.

841
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,189
Right!

842
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,650
Lately, we've been relying
too much on drone shots.

843
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:19,446
Why not focus on substance
instead of the form?

844
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,615
-Exactly, I agree.
-Mm.

845
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,326
And the background music
should be dramatic.

846
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,288
-Sir, what's wrong?
-Stay out of this!

847
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,289
Sir!

848
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,582
You can't...

849
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,294
-Pack up all his stuff.
-Yes, sir.

850
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,633
France, what's going on?

851
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,259
Sir, I failed to stop them.

852
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,178
-You know what they need?
-No, sir.

853
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,679
Excuse me.

854
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,642
-What are you doing here?
-Orders from the Chairman.

855
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,143
What orders?!

856
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,812
-Take Sir Vincent out.
-Huh?!

857
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,356
-What?!
-Sorry, sir.

858
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,857
What do you mean?! Hold on!

859
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,610
What are you doing?!
I'm the head of this department!

860
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,904
Did you even tell me
what I did wrong?!

861
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,906
You can't do this to me!
Get off me!

862
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,407
We're all employees here!

863
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,450
Vincent!

864
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:06,701
Behave.

865
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,912
-Dad, what's going on?!
-I couldn't believe my own son

866
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,622
would do this to me!

867
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,793
What did I do wrong?!

868
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:18,338
The Board of Directors
already knows what you've done.

869
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,966
The Board has decided
to terminate you immediately.

870
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,847
I'm so sure
that at this very moment,

871
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,350
Dad's already firing Vincent.

872
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,649
So, what they did to Vincent...

873
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,610
You're behind that?

874
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,112
Well, of course.

875
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:45,323
Why do you seem pissed?

876
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,783
Don't you want that?

877
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:50,829
You can finally take revenge for
everything Vincent did to you.

878
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,874
What?!

879
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,961
You've made several
back-handed deals!

880
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:06,344
You signed contracts with shell
companies you secretly control.

881
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,806
You're bleeding this company
to later buy it cheap!

882
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,726
You're driving
this company to fall,

883
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:16,396
then you'll pretend
to save it yourself, right?

884
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,564
That's not true!

885
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,982
I've received several reports

886
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,443
of you bullying
and harassing staff.

887
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:24,779
-What?! That's bullshit!
-And worse...

888
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,574
You leaked
confidential documents.

889
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,783
You made it seem like

890
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:32,037
there's widespread corruption
here in the company...

891
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,204
...when in reality,

892
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,248
you're the one
behind it all, Vincent!

893
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:36,916
Dad, you know that's not true!

894
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,627
And you have
no evidence against me!

895
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,213
We have evidence.

896
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,233
Dad...

897
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,318
Dad, I can explain.

898
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,361
The reason I wanted
to call you the other day

899
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,738
is because this is important.

900
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,031
It's about...

901
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:09,908
Dad, it's about...

902
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,785
Dad, talk to me...

903
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:12,994
Dad!

904
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,519
Stella, your boyfriend.

905
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:41,231
-What do you mean my boyfriend?
-Check this out!

906
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,194
See?

907
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:48,863
Why do you look like that?
You're frowning.

908
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:52,117
Didn't you and Vincent
break up already?

909
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,869
Goodness.
Are you worried about him?

910
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,622
No. It's just that...

911
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:00,917
Something feels wrong about
what's happening to Vincent.

912
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,045
Stella, just stay out of it.

913
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:08,299
You already got what
you needed from him, right?

914
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,093
You're finally free, dear.

915
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:13,012
Stop thinking about him, okay?

916
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:17,100
Don't stress over his problems!

917
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,352
Hey, you two.

918
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:22,647
Come on,
take care of our customers.

919
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,029
Mm-hmm.

920
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,702
We've been married
long enough, Arthur.

921
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,580
I know how that brain
of yours works!

922
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:41,457
You went as far as using
the Board to corner Vincent

923
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,543
and press charges against him.

924
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,129
Is this because of what
I told you about Matthew?

925
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:49,174
Don't you think
you're being unfair, Jacqueline?

926
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,259
Why are you blaming me?

927
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,847
The Board called for the vote.

928
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,974
The Board followed
the proper procedure.

929
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,017
Fine!

930
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,768
I'll go through
the Board's proper procedure

931
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,604
to bring Vincent back!

932
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,647
But can I rely on you
to have my back?

933
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,649
Do I have your vote for our son?

934
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,026
Your son!

935
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,237
Vincent is your son, Jacqueline!

936
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,823
And I will only protect
what's mine!

937
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,520
Sir Vincent!

938
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,481
We believed in you.

939
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:50,276
But because
of your stealing and lies,

940
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,112
all of us could lose our jobs!

941
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:04,999
-How about us, sir?
-Yeah, what about us?

942
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,762
I returned to Walter's house.

943
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:20,556
Besides Claudia, another
woman had been there.

944
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,600
She is connected
to Walter's death.

945
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,269
We need to find out
who she is.

946
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,853
That's the hardest kind
of enemy,

947
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,730
the one you don't know.
A traitor.

948
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:30,900
You're Walter's ex-girlfriend.

949
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,653
That's the woman's accessory.
It was found at Cunanan's villa.

950
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,906
Everything we've got
now points to Stella

951
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,992
possibly being involved in
what happened to Walter.

952
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,078
I trusted you! I thought
we were on the same side?!

953
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,913
Did you kill Walter?!
