1
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,288
Stella, you shouldn't
have come here.

2
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,707
I'm sorry. I won't put you
in a situation

3
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,125
where you'll get
humiliated again.

4
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,293
I'm Detective Tolentino.

5
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,211
I was recently assigned
to Walter Cunanan's case.

6
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,255
What was Stella doing
at the resort in San Juan

7
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,923
the night Walter Cunanan died?

8
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,300
I asked her to go there.

9
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,469
Matthew has gambling issues.

10
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,888
He's been taking money
from the company.

11
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,475
I want Vincent Cabrera out
of this company immediately!

12
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,351
I'll go through the Board's
proper procedure

13
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,646
to bring Vincent back.
Do I have your vote for our son?

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,232
Your son!
Vincent is your son, Jacqueline!

15
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,401
And I will only protect
what's mine!

16
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,582
Vincent.

17
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:23,917
How are you?

18
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,504
What is she doing here?

19
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,378
She's with me. Don't make
a big deal out of it.

20
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:33,009
I tried to defend you
to your father

21
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,844
and the Board members,

22
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,179
believe me.

23
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,640
Vincent.

24
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:41,559
There's still a way for you
to stay in the company.

25
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,478
I'm willing
to give you my shares

26
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,229
so you can start anew.

27
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,440
Thanks, Mom,
but you don't have to.

28
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,400
Dad might hold it
over my head.

29
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,820
I don't want to force myself
into this company.

30
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:55,198
I know that none of you
will have my back.

31
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,200
That's not true, son.

32
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,827
Mom, I trusted you.

33
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,580
I told you everything
about Matthew.

34
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,291
And they used it
as ammunition against me.

35
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,336
I know what you're implying,
but I did no such thing.

36
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,967
I didn't think you could make
a bigger fool of yourself,

37
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,262
but you always manage
to surprise me.

38
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,848
Dad, I'm sorry.

39
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,099
I just made a mistake.

40
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,560
And I'm tired of fixing
each one for you!

41
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,607
How long do I have to keep
fixing your mess, Matthew?

42
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,900
How long?!

43
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:32,944
I...

44
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,240
Now, you listen here.

45
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,909
Help me with Vincent.

46
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,162
Make sure he never finds out.

47
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,622
Okay, Dad.

48
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,957
I'll try my best.

49
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,838
-No more mistakes.
-Okay.

50
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:55,591
Next time, you will face
the consequences

51
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,845
of your mistakes
on your own!

52
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,770
More and more, things are
becoming clear to me.

53
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,898
Your concern for me, it's...

54
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,610
Is it just a ploy
to manipulate me?

55
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,739
Because at the end
of the day,

56
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,574
you are just like Dad.

57
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,661
You don't see me as a son.

58
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,748
I'm just... I'm just someone
indispensable to you.

59
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,791
That's not true.
You are my son.

60
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,462
Maybe we can talk better
if it's just us two.

61
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,964
Please give me a chance
to explain.

62
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,550
Let's go.

63
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:51,230
Thank you.

64
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,651
I thought we were done.

65
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,527
Why did you come
to the office?

66
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,788
Well...

67
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,541
Because you need it.

68
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:20,218
You know, just think
of it this way.

69
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,763
At least you're free now.

70
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,015
You're no longer beholden
to that company

71
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,809
or your family.

72
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,894
You can start over.

73
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,398
So, what's your plan?

74
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:37,151
Everything happened so fast.
I haven't given it much thought.

75
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,319
How about you?

76
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,322
What would you do if you were
given a fresh start?

77
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,703
I'll ride a bike.

78
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:54,419
Remember when I said I never
got to enjoy my childhood?

79
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:01,926
That's why I'm jealous of people
who know how to ride a bike.

80
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,637
They can drive fast,

81
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,182
their hair whipping
in the wind,

82
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,228
laughing without a care
in the world.

83
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,732
That's all I want.
A simple life.

84
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,404
Add that to our list.

85
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,948
What list?

86
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,288
Aside from finding
your missing sister,

87
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,956
I'll teach you
how to ride a bike

88
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,666
so you can give her a ride.

89
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,086
You're right.

90
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:45,511
From now on, I will only do
the things I want to do.

91
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,722
I'll start my own news channel.

92
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,726
One free from baggage

93
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,773
and only reports the truth.

94
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,779
Aren't we supposed to toast?

95
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,868
-Oh!
-Wait, wait, wait.

96
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,537
Hold on a second.

97
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,789
-Okay. Okay...
-Ow.

98
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:58,876
Here's how you set it up.

99
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,505
Once you've set the height,
you'll lock it with this handle.

100
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,925
-Oh. Like that?
-Okay.

101
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:09,554
Lock it just like that.
It's set in place, see?

102
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,270
And then, after that...

103
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,773
You see this bubble here?

104
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,068
It needs to be in the middle.

105
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,990
Once it's in the middle,
just twist it like this.

106
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,715
I... I got it.

107
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,927
Um, I can do it next time.
I can manage.

108
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,137
Okay.

109
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:59,353
What's your first
episode about?

110
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,106
You haven't told me about it.

111
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,025
I'm sure you'll like it.

112
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,195
It'll solve our problems.

113
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,368
The first 48 hours

114
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:20,374
have been difficult
for Cabrera News,

115
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:21,959
to say the least.

116
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:29,759
The person I relied on
to lead you,

117
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,720
the person you all
believed in

118
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,307
and trusted the most,

119
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,229
he betrayed
not just my trust,

120
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:47,193
but the very core of what
this company stands for.

121
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,863
And for that, there must
be consequences.

122
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,324
But...

123
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,410
Even in the face of betrayal,

124
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,832
leadership must continue.

125
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,711
We can never fall apart.

126
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,381
Eat up.

127
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,466
Thank you.

128
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,929
That's why today,

129
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,182
I am placing all my trust

130
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,644
in someone who understands
our values,

131
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,312
who knows what it means

132
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,484
to fight for family,
for this company.

133
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,569
For the truth!

134
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,737
So...

135
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:36,826
Please welcome the new CEO
of Cabrera News...

136
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,914
Matthew Cabrera!

137
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,425
In the past month,

138
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:56,304
my name was involved
in controversy and crime.

139
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,140
Wow, Dad.
This is truly an honor.

140
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,227
As all of you know,

141
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:08,524
my brother Vincent
was adopted into the family.

142
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:16,532
But after nearly bankrupting
this company

143
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,492
and dragging all of us

144
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:24,040
into the scandal surrounding
Walter Cunanan's death,

145
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,000
I could not help but feel...

146
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,878
...disappointed.

147
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,798
I was caught in a storm
of scandal and manipulation.

148
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,551
It cost me my name,
my platform,

149
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,931
and my position
in Cabrera News.

150
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,933
You know,
we gave him our name.

151
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,605
And he didn't truly value
what it stood for.

152
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,066
But now that I am here,

153
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:55,196
a true Cabrera who cares
about the company,

154
00:10:55,988 --> 00:11:00,951
a true Cabrera who cares
about every single one of you,

155
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:07,249
it is the beginning
of a new day.

156
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,169
I am speaking to all of you

157
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,923
not as a mouthpiece of power,
but as a voice of truth.

158
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,175
Because sometimes,

159
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,429
all we need
is an honest voice.

160
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,143
Not only will we erase
the shame that he left behind.

161
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,395
No.

162
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,149
We will build
something stronger.

163
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,944
We will build something bigger.

164
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,698
And we will build
something better.

165
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,536
And we will all do this...

166
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,164
...together.

167
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,132
This is Vincent Cabrera,

168
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,968
breaking my silence.

169
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,180
For our first episode,
we start with the death

170
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,765
of Walter Cunanan.

171
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,393
This isn't just
to clear my name,

172
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:11,981
it's to clear the names of
everyone involved in this case.

173
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,819
We will uncover
all the details.

174
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,238
We will follow the facts.

175
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,658
And we will bring...

176
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,704
...the real culprit to justice.

177
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,099
Why didn't you stop him?

178
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,602
Aren't you scared?

179
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:53,272
Vincent's investigation
might reveal

180
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,442
your past with Walter.

181
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,737
I didn't think it would
end up this way, Mama Mona.

182
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,822
I was blindsided too.

183
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,618
Maybe you should tell
Vincent the truth.

184
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:11,290
You idiot! That'll cause
a huge problem.

185
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,666
Think about it.

186
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,669
Come here, you two.

187
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,423
Come here.

188
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:25,888
Remember, only the three of us
know about you and Walter,

189
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,223
no one else.

190
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,267
It's a good thing
he never introduced me

191
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,394
to his family and friends.

192
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:37,942
He always made me feel
that he was ashamed of me.

193
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,654
I never introduced
my siblings to him

194
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,447
because I didn't want them
to get involved.

195
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,115
It's a good thing I never did.

196
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,325
But...

197
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:53,665
Stella, Vincent is determined
to find out the truth.

198
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,252
I don't think you have
anything to worry about, Stella.

199
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,212
Aside from the measly
view count,

200
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,632
his video is getting dislikes
and negative comments.

201
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,217
What do they say?

202
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,554
Listen to this.
"Wasn't killing Walter enough?

203
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,847
Now you're making
content out of him?

204
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,975
How shameless can you be?"

205
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,309
That's harsh.

206
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,611
Oh! Oh! Oh!

207
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,031
Your hips should be softer!
Do it like that, okay?

208
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,743
Do your best, okay?

209
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,997
Sir!

210
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,415
We're still closed.

211
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,834
Uh, I'm Detective Tolentino,

212
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,545
newly assigned to
Walter Cunanan's case.

213
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,547
I just wanted to...

214
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:46,302
Ah, Stella's not here right now.

215
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,513
I only need a few minutes,
I just have a few questions.

216
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,391
Yes, Mrs. Topacio.

217
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,102
I'm building a new
online news channel.

218
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,479
We're focusing on
engaging and reliable content

219
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,023
for the digital audience.

220
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:03,611
For now, we're doing
podcasts and video content....

221
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:07,990
That's why I'm looking
for a potential investor

222
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:12,202
who sees a big opportunity
in digital news.

223
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,579
If you're willing, Mrs. Topacio,

224
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,166
maybe I can pitch the concept
to you around this week?

225
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,543
Thank you, Vincent.
But I think I'll pass.

226
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,882
Mrs. Topacio, if you'd
just give me a chance...

227
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,217
I'm sorry, Vincent,
I've seen your podcast.

228
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,469
We don't want to get involved

229
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,262
in something that controversial.

230
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,307
Is that the only reason?

231
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,768
Look, I'll be honest
with you, Vincent.

232
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,102
We've had a
long-term partnership

233
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,437
with the Cabrera group.

234
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,940
I'm telling you this because
I see you as a friend.

235
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,068
They've been threatening
to pull our contracts

236
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,612
if we invest in you.

237
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,990
I'm sorry, Vincent, as
much as I'd like to help,

238
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,576
but I cannot risk
offending Arthur.

239
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,620
I understand.

240
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,788
Thank you for your time.

241
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,298
Eat something first.
Take a break.

242
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,052
You haven't eaten all day.

243
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,512
I made pancit canton.

244
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,599
I'm fine.
Not really hungry.

245
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,934
Really?

246
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,853
I made this, and
I'm the one eating it?

247
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,857
Come on, you should eat.

248
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,152
I know what you're doing.
You're trying to distract me.

249
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,446
Exactly. So just go with it.

250
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,366
Don't make it hard for me.
Come on, sit down.

251
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,076
Eat.

252
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,744
Mm.

253
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,829
Mm.

254
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,874
You even want me to feed
you, huh? Come on, eat.

255
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,465
One more?

256
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,177
Mm.

257
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,765
Tastes good, right?

258
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,310
Stella,
can you hand me my tablet?

259
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,229
I just want to check the views.

260
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:11,780
The views went up,
but there are so many...

261
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,116
You think I didn't notice
the initial reaction?

262
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,829
I saw the comments,
and all those thumbs-down too.

263
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:19,913
Hmm.

264
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,208
Hindi ka apektado?

265
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,003
As long as there's
someone who believes...

266
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,841
even just one...

267
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,760
that's enough to keep me going.

268
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,679
"We don't believe you, Vincent!
You're desperate!"

269
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,061
Hold on.

270
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,732
-Hello?
-Hello.

271
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,233
Stella.

272
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,737
Hey, that detective came by.

273
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,114
Andres is looking for you.

274
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,241
-Why?
-He said...

275
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:00,329
someone sent a selfie
of you and Vincent

276
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,372
at the resort.

277
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,459
He's asking why you two
didn't mention...

278
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,877
being there together.

279
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,756
Who sent it??

280
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,008
Well... No idea.

281
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:17,679
But they confirmed
the photo's real.

282
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:25,354
Metadata proves it's authentic.

283
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,817
They even found that
torn dress of yours.

284
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,529
They're asking
where that came from.

285
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,239
-Stella.
-Huh?

286
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,365
What happened?

287
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,871
That must be
what Sir Andres has.

288
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,541
It's the same photo
from the resort.

289
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:49,336
He's asking why we never
told them we met there.

290
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,005
Still...
this doesn't prove anything.

291
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,181
Ah!

292
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,976
Come back here!

293
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,186
Stella.

294
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,111
How did he even get a copy?

295
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,113
It was only in my phone.

296
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,448
I never sent it to
Bubbles or Charlie.

297
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,951
Maybe your phone got hacked.

298
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,453
Or someone accessed it
without you knowing.

299
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,373
I honestly don't know.

300
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,294
But whoever did this...

301
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,714
probably has something to do
with what happened to Walter.

302
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,382
They're pinning this
on both of us.

303
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:40,470
I've long believed someone's
been pulling the strings.

304
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:46,810
Before, it was only me.
Now they're dragging you too.

305
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,855
We need to be extra careful.

306
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,733
If they could get
that close to you,

307
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,028
who knows what they'll do next.

308
00:19:56,111 --> 00:20:00,324
The worst kind of enemy
is the one you can't see...

309
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,408
A traitor.

310
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,332
It's true what they say...

311
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:12,711
A single photo is worth
a thousand words.

312
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,047
Not just a thousand words,

313
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,798
-but a thousand lies!
-Okay.

314
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,509
So that means
they were together that night.

315
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,677
Exactly!

316
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:25,015
And that throws Vincent's
alibi right out the window!

317
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,893
Now his "investigation"
on his channel

318
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,646
is going to backfire on him.

319
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,730
Where'd you get this?

320
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,651
You know what they say,
Claudia...

321
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:41,281
"Never question
how a mistress moves."

322
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,326
I'm getting three bras.
How much in total?

323
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,662
Mm-hmm... Hold on.

324
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,250
That's 525 pesos,
but I'll give it to you for 500.

325
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,379
-500? Deal. Here's the cash.
-Mm-hmm.

326
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,464
Thank you! Perfect!

327
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,383
-I just read it earlier.
-What?!

328
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:03,136
You only gave 1,500,
we agreed on 2,500!

329
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,180
-So loud, let me check.
-So unfair!

330
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:08,058
I'm doing my job here!

331
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,602
I've been paying off girls
from that club,

332
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,688
they trust me completely.

333
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,232
Every whore has a price, huh?

334
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,608
But why?

335
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:21,196
Why would Stella go to Vincent
if they were already meeting up?

336
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:26,076
Maybe Vincent got too drunk
and asked Stella to come.

337
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,412
He was bound to drink
that night, come on.

338
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,579
No, no.

339
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:33,792
That's impossible.
Vincent is not that reckless.

340
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:38,130
He wouldn't risk that
at his family's party.

341
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:42,009
-But you did it, right?
-Oh, shut up.

342
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:45,887
This all started because Vincent
saw you having sex with Walter.

343
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,559
Maybe he wanted revenge,

344
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,645
that's why he called Stella.
He wanted revenge sex.

345
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,647
Hey, don't overthink it.

346
00:21:55,731 --> 00:22:01,236
What matters is the
cops think they're lying.

347
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,238
Their alibi's full of holes.

348
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:06,116
Who was your customer
at the resort that night?

349
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,244
Why?

350
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,498
Won't he speak up?

351
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,209
He could be the next
to come out.

352
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,963
If he was going to speak up,
he should've done it long ago.

353
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:24,593
Who in their right mind would
admit to hiring a woman?

354
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,386
Stella, I just need a name.

355
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,597
It's not important.

356
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,517
Besides, I'm not even sure
if that's really his name.

357
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,190
Why does it feel like you're
hiding your customer from me?

358
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,026
Hiding? The question is,

359
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,528
how did this picture
get to the police?

360
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,365
Vincent?

361
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,534
Bro.

362
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,245
-George.
-Sorry, the door was open.

363
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,373
Stella.

364
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,209
Bro...

365
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,668
I'm sorry.

366
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,879
It's fine, George.

367
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,632
I understand you have
a family depending on you.

368
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,092
Well, yeah,

369
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,510
but...

370
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,887
our friendship's important too.

371
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,058
I can't stand the things they've
been saying and doing to you.

372
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,893
So, bro,

373
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,728
are you hiring?

374
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,231
I could really use a job.

375
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,618
What did you even
see in that woman?

376
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,169
Look, you know
I'm busy, right?

377
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,797
I'll come to you when I'm free.

378
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,674
Stop calling me all the time.

379
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,260
I have work to do. Okay?

380
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,220
Bye.

381
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,429
Who was that?

382
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:16,163
Why did you get into
an affair with Walter?

383
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,291
Other than doing drugs together,

384
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,334
did he play you too?

385
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,587
Did he sweet-talk you too?

386
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,301
"Did he play you too?"

387
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,761
"Did he sweet-talk you too?"

388
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,807
S...

389
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,852
Stella.

390
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,446
Walter was fine as a neighbor.

391
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,198
He was pretty quiet.

392
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,783
He just minded his own business.

393
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,453
Has he argued with anyone here?

394
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,998
Hmm.

395
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,667
Not that I can recall.

396
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,714
That's why we were all so
shocked by what happened to him.

397
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,549
Is it true that...

398
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,844
he was killed brutally?

399
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:17,641
Whoever did it
must've hated him badly.

400
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:22,437
Were there any visitors
you saw coming here regularly?

401
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,232
Yes, a woman.

402
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,442
Probably his girlfriend.

403
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:31,363
But she didn't look
very friendly.

404
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:35,075
I greeted her once,

405
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,993
but she ignored me.

406
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,745
Wait a second, ma'am.

407
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,334
Is this that woman?

408
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,920
Yes, that's her.

409
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:52,217
I remember her because
she always came by at odd hours.

410
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,928
Other than her,

411
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,847
was there anyone else
you saw visiting,

412
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:01,059
maybe a guy?
Or anyone suspicious?

413
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,894
No one else, sir.

414
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,022
Well, there was...

415
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,941
another woman.

416
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,485
Another woman?

417
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,655
Yes, a woman confronted him.

418
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,748
She kept pounding on his door,

419
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,002
yelling in anger.

420
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,588
Walter, you bastard!
Open the door!

421
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,173
Walter!

422
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,300
What?!

423
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,433
Who was she?

424
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,643
I didn't find out about that.

425
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,479
I didn't see her
come back here since.

426
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,816
Do you remember
when this happened?

427
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:53,737
It was probably a few weeks
before Walter's death.

428
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,826
Do you remember
what she looked like?

429
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,245
I can't really remember,

430
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:07,208
but she was sexy
and wearing a lot of trinkets.

431
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,337
That was the first time
I saw Walter angry.

432
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,184
How did your plan go?

433
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,478
I went back to Walter's place.

434
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,730
I asked some of his neighbors.

435
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,150
Did you...

436
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,818
Did you get any information?

437
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:38,281
Aside from Claudia,
another woman went there

438
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,492
just a few weeks
before his death.

439
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,870
Wh...Who?

440
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,246
The neighbor
didn't see her face,

441
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,040
but she said they were fighting.

442
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,544
Did she hear...

443
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,088
what they were fighting about?

444
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,466
No, she was too far
to hear them clearly.

445
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,884
It could be anything.

446
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,888
We know Walter
was involved in drugs.

447
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,474
Or it could be
another girlfriend.

448
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,525
Could she be the same woman
Zamora was talking about?

449
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,571
Do you remember?
The woman who owns the lipstick?

450
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,535
Liar!

451
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:27,038
Liar! I know what you did!

452
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:31,084
I was jailed for something
I didn't do, because of you!

453
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,546
And you gave away my sister,
you monster!

454
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:38,383
I kept calling you from prison,
but you never answered!

455
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,511
-Where's my sister?!
-Where's your proof?!

456
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,638
You don't have any, right?

457
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,014
Leave.

458
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:49,060
I'm not leaving until you
tell me where my sister is.

459
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,396
You're so annoying!

460
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,110
Fine.

461
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,236
Fine!

462
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,155
Want to know the truth?

463
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,533
One hundred thousand pesos.

464
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,662
-One hundred thousand?
-Mm-hmm.

465
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:09,330
That's how much
you'll have to give me

466
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,625
to find out
where your sister is.

467
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,170
If it's the same woman,

468
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,965
that means she was there
the night Walter was killed.

469
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,180
S-So what's going
to be your plan?

470
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,016
If she's involved
in Walter's death,

471
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,894
we need to find out who she is.

472
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:34,522
And if I prove that she has
something to do with it,

473
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,567
she'll pay for it.

474
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,913
So, what did you find out?

475
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,750
This came from
that nasty club, right?

476
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,882
I guess?

477
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:47,178
I got that from Walter's office.

478
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,431
It's from the same bar
Stella works at.

479
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,392
That is possible.

480
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:56,771
So there's a big possibility
he knows Stella.

481
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,857
You think...

482
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,735
something was going on
between them?

483
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,238
I'm not sure, Matthew, but...

484
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,740
I remember Walter talking
to someone on the phone,

485
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,200
and I'm sure it was a woman.

486
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,745
He denied it.
I just didn't get the number.

487
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,539
What are you getting at?

488
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,417
That all of this
isn't pure coincidence.

489
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,462
There's a reason
Stella came into our lives,

490
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,464
and it's deeper than you think.

491
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:27,635
She's not just
Vincent's mistress and alibi.

492
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,472
Do you think she targeted
the two of them? But why?

493
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,682
I don't know.

494
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,394
I got this.

495
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,521
Leave it to me.

496
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:47,363
Alright, have a seat.

497
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,700
Stella, did you wash
the cutlery properly?

498
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,201
-Yes.
-You know there are

499
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,745
a lot of cockroaches here.

500
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,581
We have bopis and paksiw.

501
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,499
-There's rice.
-Joseph, what are you doing?

502
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,044
-Go on and eat.
-You can't lift things yet.

503
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:04,088
Stella, Vincent's not used
to such a hot place.

504
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,882
He's going to be all sweaty.

505
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,052
Right?

506
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:14,057
Good thing Mama cooked
a lot of dinuguan.

507
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:19,937
Top it with pork cracklings and
you might forget your own name.

508
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,274
There you go.

509
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,901
Alright, come on.

510
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,695
I'll add the pork cracklings
for you.

511
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,531
-There you go.
-Miss Sonya, did you wash up?

512
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,243
Why? It gets tastier
because of my palms.

513
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,037
Eat up while it's hot.

514
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,375
Hurry before it gets cold.
Go on.

515
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,966
Tasty, right?

516
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,804
-You like it?
-Try this, sir!

517
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,431
Taste my Poqui Poqui.
It's delicious!

518
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,309
It's as tasty as
my grandma's Poqui Poqui.

519
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,353
Hey! You...

520
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,063
Where's that soda?

521
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,565
Katherine! Where's your sister?
Katherine!

522
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,901
-Won't you join me?
-Where did your sister go?

523
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:08,236
Katherine!

524
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,535
You're really
looking after him, huh?

525
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,121
Just the other day,
you were cursing him out.

526
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,998
-Hey!
-Well, it's true.

527
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,669
Have you forgotten
what his family did to you?

528
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,463
I thought you two
were breaking up?

529
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,881
What happened?

530
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,970
Katherine, watch your mouth.

531
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,099
Because I don't give up easily.

532
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,316
And my relationship with
your sister is important to me.

533
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,862
That's so sweet.
Go on and eat then.

534
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:55,408
I'm sure one day you'll be gone
without warning.

535
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,452
Ouch.

536
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:01,998
You'll leave my sister
and never talk to her again.

537
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,208
And my sister here...

538
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,377
...will end up crying again!

539
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,880
I know it. My sister has
terrible luck with men.

540
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,884
Katherine, will you watch it?

541
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,137
When Stella went to jail,

542
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:18,347
the guy vanished into thin air.

543
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,853
He was her first boyfriend.

544
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,938
And hopefully, her last.

545
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,733
We didn't even get to meet him.

546
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:29,817
Right, Joseph?

547
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,779
-She never brought him here...
-Hey!

548
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:35,114
Just go to bed.

549
00:34:35,197 --> 00:34:36,364
Take Joseph with you.

550
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,617
You two should sleep now.

551
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,202
You still have school tomorrow.

552
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:40,578
Yeah, you have to get up early.

553
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,373
Hey, what are you
looking at, huh?

554
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:46,417
Stella, let's go
to the riverside!

555
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,418
-Take your boyfriend with you!
-Come on!

556
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,004
-Go where with whom?
-Hurry!

557
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:51,088
-Let's go!
-Faster!

558
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,130
Yeah.

559
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,966
Let's see how
he holds his liquor.

560
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,717
Mama? Bubbles?

561
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,056
Come drink with us.
Let's go.

562
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,766
Are you game?

563
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,727
Of course, we have to dance!

564
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,729
-That's right!
-Aye!

565
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:10,566
Aye aye aye aye aye

566
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,151
Just follow my lead.

567
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,486
Put that down for now.

568
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,612
-There.
-Hmm?

569
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,323
Sing and dance with us.
Five, six, seven, eight.

570
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:23,996
Aye aye aye aye aye

571
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,248
It's your turn now.

572
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,291
-Five, six, seven, eight.
-One, two, three, go.

573
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:34,382
Aye aye aye aye aye

574
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,428
You should do it solo!

575
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,597
-Solo stage!
-This is your moment to shine!

576
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,850
-I like Stella's boyfriend.
-Wait...

577
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,102
I'm a journalist,
not a dancer.

578
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,524
Your boyfriend is amazing,
Stella!

579
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,817
He's up for anything!

580
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,237
So, what's the real score
between you two?

581
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,154
Are you seriously dating?

582
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,996
I don't enter a relationship
if I'm not serious about it.

583
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,003
I'm feeling giddy!

584
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,170
Uh...

585
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:16,299
Your drinks aren't cold anymore.
Let me get some ice.

586
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,967
-Oh, really now?
-You just don't want to answer.

587
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,553
-Yeah.
-Sit down, Vincent.

588
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,221
Vincent, listen up.

589
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,056
Take good care of Stella.

590
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,351
You see, she's been
through a lot.

591
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,688
I'll just help Stella
get some ice.

592
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,565
Yeah, especially
when she got jailed.

593
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,441
Poor Stella.

594
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,651
We even had to chip in
for her bail.

595
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,694
But it still wasn't enough.

596
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,947
Katherine mentioned earlier...

597
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,909
...that Stella had a boyfriend.

598
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,661
Do you know who it was?

599
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,789
He never showed up here.

600
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,875
Their relationship
didn't last long anyway.

601
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,460
Stella didn't even
tell us his name.

602
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,378
Don't worry about it.

603
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,922
Past is past.

604
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,632
Stella doesn't like
talking about him.

605
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,718
She gets worked up
when she remembers him.

606
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,178
Anyway, let's drink!

607
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:05,056
-Cheers!
-Whoo!

608
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,059
Give me another shot!

609
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,228
Aye aye aye aye aye

610
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,313
Hey, Katherine.

611
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,899
I thought we had a deal.

612
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,193
Why is your brother
at our place?

613
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,862
We should be
splitting them up, right?

614
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,281
Sorry, I had no idea
that he's there.

615
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,283
Why don't you ask your sister
what's going on?

616
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,285
She's already pissed at me.

617
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,663
Well, I hope you're okay.

618
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,498
Let me know if there's
something I can do.

619
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,709
Whatever!
Let's just talk tomorrow.

620
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,216
-Put him here.
-I knew it!

621
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,636
-Okay. Slowly now.
-He couldn't hold his liquor!

622
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,597
-Guys, I'm okay.
-Thank you.

623
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,557
Oh, really?
You look totally wasted.

624
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,476
-It's just very hot.
-Yeah, right.

625
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,395
Here you go, Stella.
Let him use my shirt.

626
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,729
Oh, thank you.

627
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,272
-His shirt is drenched in sweat.
-That'll fit him.

628
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,857
-What's that?
-Oh, thank you.

629
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,942
I have an idea.

630
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:01,195
I'll make some porridge
to help him sober up.

631
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:02,238
You two, come help me.

632
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,532
The porridge will
be ready in a while.

633
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,450
-I won't eat it.
-Okay, thank you.

634
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,495
Tell Miss Sonya
I don't like porridge.

635
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,289
Just let her be.
She wants to cook for you.

636
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,542
Looks like you had
a lot of fun tonight.

637
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:18,587
I can't remember the last time
I was this happy.

638
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,675
Laughing out loud.

639
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,344
Can I just stay here?

640
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,470
-Hey!
-Please.

641
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,306
You know what?
You're drunk. Very drunk.

642
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,516
Seriously?

643
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,561
I wish...

644
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,272
I have this kind of life.

645
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,690
Just like you.

646
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:42,695
You're surrounded
by happy people.

647
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:46,407
They take good care of you.

648
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,118
You can see that they're
genuinely concerned about you.

649
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:53,080
You can feel their love.

650
00:38:56,542 --> 00:39:01,422
My own parents
don't believe in me.

651
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,175
They even kicked me
out of the company.

652
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,551
As for my brother,

653
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,056
the thieving one...

654
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,432
...even got promoted.

655
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:18,606
I don't know why I'm even
calling them my family

656
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,107
when I'm just adopted.

657
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,446
My own wife cheated on me.

658
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,993
Oh, come on.

659
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:38,250
Am I that useless for them
to just get rid of me like that?

660
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,004
Maybe even if...

661
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,758
my real parents see me

662
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,969
lying on the street,

663
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,556
they won't do anything.

664
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,101
I mean...

665
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:58,604
they'll just walk past me
until...

666
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,648
I eventually die.

667
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:09,740
Where do I belong
if nobody wants me, Stella?

668
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,831
Am I really that hard to love?

669
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,425
Vincent...

670
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:32,763
Stop thinking that
you're always at fault.

671
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,224
You're a good person.

672
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,852
I can sense it.

673
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,188
And above all...

674
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,153
you're not hard to love.

675
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,761
As long as that slut's around,

676
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,722
I can't make a move on Vincent.

677
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,224
We need to get rid of her.

678
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:21,228
We need to dig up some dirt
on that woman, like...

679
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,354
anything!

680
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,107
You cheated on Vincent.

681
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,817
You let him go.

682
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,861
And now, you're acting up?

683
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,490
I just didn't expect him
to replace me that fast.

684
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,326
I mean, come on,

685
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,411
how can you replace
someone like me?

686
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,997
I'm one of a kind.

687
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,292
You're easy to replace, Claudia.

688
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,169
With someone like Stella?

689
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,253
Ooh.

690
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:50,007
I'm sorry,
but you've got it all wrong.

691
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,551
Vincent isn't your backup.

692
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,179
You're Vincent's backup.

693
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,311
Where's the lead I gave you?

694
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:05,773
Who's this?

695
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,277
Someone who used to work
at that bar.

696
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,824
Who knows?

697
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,577
Maybe she knows Stella from when
Walter used to hang out there.

698
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,788
Go talk to her.

699
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,800
Excuse me.

700
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,385
What is it?

701
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,970
Are you Tanya?

702
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,265
Dear, go inside.

703
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,851
Why?

704
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,315
You used to work
at Basement, right?

705
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,236
It's been a long time.

706
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,280
And my husband and son
don't know about that.

707
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,240
So, please leave.

708
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:02,830
Look, I'm not here
to cause trouble.

709
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,708
I just need to ask you
a few questions,

710
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,710
then I'll be out of your way.

711
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,712
Can't you see? I'm busy.

712
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:12,506
Don't waste my time.

713
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,467
Leave.

714
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,347
I can pay for your time.

715
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,686
What do you want to know?

716
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,981
You know Stella Morales, right?

717
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,859
You worked with her before?

718
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,027
Stella?

719
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,947
Oh, you mean, Alegria.

720
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,907
I haven't had contact with her
in a long time.

721
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,535
I don't even know
where she is now.

722
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,662
I'm just curious.

723
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,165
Did she have a boyfriend
back then?

724
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,293
Yeah, she did
before she went to jail.

725
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,379
She even thought
he'd set her up in a house.

726
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,839
Do you remember the guy's name?

727
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,175
Wally?

728
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,510
Waldo?

729
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,679
Something like that.

730
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,222
But classy.

731
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,515
Walter.

732
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,184
Yeah, that's it! Walter.

733
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,562
That was his name.

734
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,405
Stella!

735
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,159
Damn it.

736
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,620
Claudia, I don't have time
for this right now.

737
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,288
I'm not here to fight.

738
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,207
We need to talk.

739
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,209
What's there to talk about?

740
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,753
To end all of this.

741
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,255
Let's go somewhere private.

742
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:07,830
What do you want to talk about?

743
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:11,291
I was trying to stay silent.

744
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:16,547
But you just can't stop
bothering my family.

745
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,219
Oh, so you have
a concept of "family" now?

746
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,012
Can you get to the point?

747
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,973
I've got things to do.

748
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:28,225
I want you to disappear.

749
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:36,150
Your husband's father
already tried to bribe me.

750
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:40,863
You think I'd back off
just because you want me gone?

751
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:44,867
You know what?

752
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:51,206
I know something worth
more than any money.

753
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,463
About you and Walter.

754
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,925
I know you two
have a connection.

755
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:11,226
You're Walter's ex-girlfriend.

756
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,485
What are you talking about?

757
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,655
Oh, Stella.

758
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,701
I know everything about you.

759
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,954
Walter told me all about it.

760
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,915
And he was laughing.

761
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,333
You know what he said?

762
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,417
He said...

763
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:42,633
...there was this whore
who went crazy over him.

764
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,386
A delusional one.

765
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:50,224
Oops, sorry.

766
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,351
Aww.

767
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:57,231
Sorry,
you just didn't get Walter.

768
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,526
So, now, you're targeting
my husband.

769
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,737
What do you think
they'll see in you?

770
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,032
You're nothing.

771
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,450
You're just a plaything.

772
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,368
You know that?

773
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,621
A used sex doll.

774
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,915
That's what Walter
thought of you.

775
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,543
I'm sure Vincent
will realize it soon.

776
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,378
Wait, I have a question.

777
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,339
What were you doing
at the resort?

778
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,759
Did Walter find out about
your connection to Vincent?

779
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:29,638
Or was Walter about
to tell Vincent

780
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,431
that you two had a relationship?

781
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,936
Did you kill Walter?

782
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,951
What are you doing here again?

783
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,497
I'm just here to talk
about Stella.

784
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,589
That woman's accessory
was found in Cunanan's villa.

785
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,424
And this, I think,

786
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,593
matches Stella's lipstick
that night.

787
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,471
Plus, this fabric we found

788
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,891
looks like what she was wearing
that evening.

789
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,937
You were together, right?

790
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:24,776
So, you can't blame us
for investigating her.

791
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,361
Still circumstantial evidence.

792
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,113
True, but like I said,

793
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,115
you were together
that night, right?

794
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,658
I already answered all of that.

795
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,745
And everything we have now
points to the possibility

796
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:38,415
that Stella was involved
in Walter's death.

797
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,583
If she wasn't
the one who did it.

798
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,419
But how would you feel

799
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:46,173
if I told you someone's
manipulating the case?

800
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:50,510
Someone wants to frame you
for a crime you didn't commit.

801
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,806
Shut up.

802
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,352
You don't know
what you're talking about.

803
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,813
Oh my god, that's so strange.

804
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,066
You're backing away.

805
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,276
What happened to you, Stella?

806
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,988
Where's the tough Stella
I used to know?

807
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,073
Huh?

808
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,075
Look at me.

809
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,748
Why can't you answer
my question?

810
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:24,044
Because deep down,
you know the truth.

811
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,128
If I were you,

812
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:27,798
I'd leave.

813
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:32,094
Go far away while you still can.

814
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,472
Because soon, the only thing
you'll be touching

815
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:36,807
are prison bars.

816
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,227
Not my husband.

817
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,940
Is this blackmail?

818
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,150
Is that what you want?

819
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,487
So, what if Walter was my ex?

820
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,990
Just because he's my ex,
you think I killed him?

821
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,619
Then many exes would be dead.

822
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,204
Vincent's also your ex, right?

823
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,333
I'm going to call
Detective Tolentino.

824
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,418
Let's end this.

825
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,544
Go ahead.

826
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,129
Call him if you want.

827
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:11,133
Let's expose everyone's
dirty secrets while we're at it.

828
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:12,259
Stella, my affair?

829
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,262
Big deal.

830
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,555
Breaking news.

831
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,599
Oh, you want breaking news?

832
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,684
Fine.

833
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,561
Here's one for you.

834
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,233
"Claudia Cabrera,
Matthew Cabrera...

835
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:32,112
partners in crime,
thieves in the company!"

836
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,031
Hey, why are you backing up?

837
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,658
Shocked?

838
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,703
Vincent knows a lot about you.

839
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:43,540
We have plenty of evidence
against you and Matthew.

840
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,792
We can prove that
your brother-in-law

841
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,546
is addicted to gambling
and you to illegal drugs!

842
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,214
You're lying! You're lying!

843
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,759
-Shut...
-What, you're going to deny it?

844
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,303
Take a drug test.
I'll even come with you.

845
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,597
-Shut up! Shut up, Stella!
-We have proof!

846
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,015
Yeah?!

847
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,309
And it wasn't just you
and Matthew.

848
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,478
You were also in cahoots
with Walter.

849
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:08,398
But you ended up fighting,
so you killed Walter!

850
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,649
That's what happened, right?

851
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,152
You're lying.
You better shut up!

852
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,321
It's not just Vincent who knows.

853
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,448
Like you said,
I knew Walter.

854
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,992
He told me everything.

855
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:21,661
That's impossible.
He tells me everything.

856
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,705
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure!

857
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,041
We have evidence.

858
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:31,546
Only Matthew and Walter
are stealing from the company!

859
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,965
You knew, yet you keep
covering up for them.

860
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,384
How did you know?
How did Vincent know, huh?!

861
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,427
You better shut up.

862
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,012
You better keep
your mouth shut, Stella,

863
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,889
if you don't want to end up
like Walter!

864
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,182
Are you threatening me?

865
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,391
Yes!

866
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:51,483
Do you play Bingo?

867
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,153
Letter B...

868
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,072
Bingo.

869
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,580
There's your blackmail material.

870
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,227
Shit...

871
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,399
What?

872
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,402
Claudia, can you calm down?

873
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,696
Stella and Vincent!

874
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:38,947
What about them?

875
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:41,408
Matthew...

876
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,410
they have something against us.

877
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,537
What do you mean?
What did you do?

878
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,415
I confronted Stella.

879
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:55,088
Didn't I tell you
not to do anything?

880
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,798
-I know, okay?
-And?

881
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:57,924
I know!

882
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,175
I know, but...

883
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,468
But...

884
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,971
We need to get that recording!

885
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,055
Re...

886
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,725
Recording?

887
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,769
Shit...

888
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,106
That girl, she recorded me.
She recorded our conversation.

889
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,649
And...

890
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:18,486
I know...I'm sure she's
going to use everything I said

891
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,863
against us.

892
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:24,492
Shit!

893
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,972
-Stella! Stella!
-Mm?

894
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,682
-Help! Help!
-Hey! Thief!

895
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,934
Who are you?!
Give me back my phone!

896
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,769
Thief! Thief!

897
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,857
My phone!

898
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:41,194
Thief! There's a thief!

899
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:43,905
Give me that, you thief!

900
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,073
Joseph?

901
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,993
-Stella! Miss Sonya!
-S-Stella!

902
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,244
What's happening?

903
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,870
I think a thief broke inside.

904
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,372
Stay here. I'll take care of it.

905
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,832
-Who are you?!
-Stella!

906
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,917
-Aah!
-Hey!

907
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,794
-Stella, where's Joseph?
-Thief!

908
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,130
There's a thief! Help us!

909
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,464
Edward!

910
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,133
Hey! Give me my phone!

911
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,093
-Where's Joseph?
-My phone!

912
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,262
There's a thief!

913
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:10,765
Sir, do you think

914
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,976
you were able
to convince Vincent?

915
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,979
He should be thinking hard
about it now.

916
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,939
Why? Wouldn't it be
in his favor?

917
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,066
If Stella were the killer,

918
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,860
he wouldn't face any charges.

919
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,488
Aranda, what's going on?

920
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,574
Sir, there was a reported
robbery in Kawayan.

921
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,034
Someone's house was broke into.

922
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,496
Barangay Kawayan?

923
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,249
Wait. That's where Stella lives.

924
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:37,959
Let's go.

925
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,046
Open your mouth.

926
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,717
Stella, Vincent...

927
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,093
Are you guys okay?

928
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,344
Is someone hurt?

929
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,222
Should I have these two
sleep at my house?

930
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,641
That would be better,
Miss Sonya.

931
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:54,851
Is it okay?

932
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,978
Of course. Don't worry about it.

933
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,314
Uh, Katherine,
prepare your things.

934
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:01,066
Already done.

935
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:04,027
Stella, did you see
the thief's face?

936
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,737
I wasn't able to catch up
to them.

937
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,074
But don't worry about it.
You need to rest.

938
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,366
Joseph, you should go.

939
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,869
Why don't you come with us?

940
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,538
I need to clean up the house,
Miss Sonya.

941
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,749
All right. We'll get going then.

942
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,709
We'll stay at our house.

943
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:23,129
-Thank you.
-Don't worry about it.

944
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,756
-Vincent.
-Katherine, look after Joseph.

945
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,758
-Okay, Stella.
-Let's go.

946
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,510
I'll accompany them
on their way, Vincent.

947
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,318
There's something
we need to discuss.

948
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:55,537
What is it?

949
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,539
Is it important?

950
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,714
That's the women's
accessory we found

951
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,842
in Cunanan's villa.

952
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,387
That matches the color of
Stella's lipstick that night.

953
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,889
We also found
that piece of fabric,

954
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:18,017
which I think matches what
Stella was wearing that night.

955
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:20,645
Hey.

956
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,398
What is it?

957
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:27,068
W-What were you doing
in Walter's villa?

958
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,665
What are you talking about?

959
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:45,295
I've asked you
about this before,

960
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,630
but you avoided the question.

961
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,924
So, even though there was
doubt in my mind,

962
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,053
I didn't force you
to answer it.

963
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:59,475
I told myself that you
would never do that to me.

964
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,649
Andres found new evidence...

965
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,198
...related to this.

966
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,661
Oh, come on. Those things
are sold everywhere.

967
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,288
Lots of people have one.

968
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,749
Don't lie to me.

969
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,460
What were you doing in
his villa? Did you know him?

970
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,973
Stella, I trusted you.

971
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:42,143
I thought we were
on the same side.

972
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,938
Were you just using me
this whole time?!

973
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,148
Let me go!

974
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,816
Stella, answer me!

975
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,949
Did you kill Walter?

976
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,960
Who's going to tell them,

977
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,921
me or you?

978
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,555
We've sent it to the police.

979
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:23,268
There's CCTV footage
of Stella at the resort.

980
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:24,894
We need to pin this
on Stella.

981
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,730
And I've got something juicier
to pin on her.

982
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:30,566
I kept it from you
because I was scared.

983
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,486
They can easily pin
the crime on me.

984
00:59:33,569 --> 00:59:35,905
So you let the blame
fall on me?

985
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,907
You turned me
into your alibi?!

986
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:40,660
It's time for both of you
to tell the truth.

987
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,704
You want to know her motive?

988
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:43,871
I know.
