1
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,330
If you don't trust him,
why did you let him stay here?

2
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,416
We have to keep
our enemies closer.

3
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,834
I've known Matthew
for a while now.

4
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,837
A snake remains a snake
even after shedding its skin.

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,548
Vincent is asking
about Walter's past.

6
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,341
They can't know the truth.

7
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,802
Your father started all this.

8
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,804
What does he have
to do with all this?

9
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,474
Walter planned his way
into our lives.

10
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,185
That means there's someone
who knows all this.

11
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,103
We have to find that person.

12
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,647
They're going to conduct
another autopsy

13
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,815
on Walter Cunanan.

14
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,277
Dr. Ramona Castro was tasked
to handle it.

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,654
Vincent is close
to finding the truth.

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,704
- Stop! Stop!
- Aah!

17
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,414
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,423
Come in.

19
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,551
You might need this.

20
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:34,636
Stella.

21
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,222
Let's go.

22
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,101
Nurse.

23
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:49,067
Walter Cunanan's remains
are ready for autopsy.

24
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,109
Alright.

25
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,777
- Get it started.
- Okay.

26
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,244
As soon as I begin
my examination,

27
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,538
we'll find
what you're looking for.

28
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,707
And hopefully
with the results,

29
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,709
I'll be able to prove
your innocence.

30
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,422
We're going to make
some enemies here, Doc.

31
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,507
I'm aware.

32
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,469
You should fear the
living more than the dead.

33
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,059
Just drop me off here.

34
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,353
It's just one ride away
from our house.

35
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,397
Wait.

36
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,358
Stay.

37
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,405
Why?

38
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,490
We've been together all day.

39
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,118
We've been productive today.

40
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,537
Walter's parents
are on our side.

41
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,581
And so is Dr. Castro.

42
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,626
If you think about it,
we did a good job today.

43
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,795
We can rest early for once.

44
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,422
- Come on.
- Wait.

45
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,927
Every time we're together,
we either have a problem

46
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,847
or we're in trouble
and someone is hurt.

47
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,476
But now, at least...

48
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,272
...we have a reason to be happy.

49
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,690
To hope.

50
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,987
I want to experience
that with you.

51
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,704
What...

52
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,373
What are you planning?

53
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,587
- Okay, we're close.
- What--

54
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,631
- Just a few more steps.
- What is this?

55
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,883
You'll see. It's a surprise.

56
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,385
- Didn't expect this from you.
- Okay. One, two...

57
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,100
What's this about?

58
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,311
Nothing. It's a bike.

59
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,981
Why is there only one?

60
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,734
Because today, you're going
to learn how to ride one.

61
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,319
I'll teach you. Come on.

62
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,575
You still remember
what I told you before?

63
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,789
I remember
everything you say, Stella.

64
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,750
And I also don't forget
the promises I made to you.

65
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,212
So even if the case
is still ongoing,

66
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,339
and even if we still
haven't found your sister,

67
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:20,301
at least for now,

68
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,388
I can do this for you.

69
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,978
Thank you.

70
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,604
I got you.
Just keep your balance.

71
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,356
Don't let me go. I might fall.

72
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,774
- I'll hold you.
- Aah!

73
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,734
Just relax, don't be nervous.

74
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,113
- I'm not nervous. I'm scared!
- Okay-- Look!

75
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,698
- You're balancing already!
- Aah!

76
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,616
Oops!

77
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,416
I told you so.

78
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:54,460
You said I wouldn't fall.

79
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,255
Even if you do fall,

80
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,756
I'll catch you.

81
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,055
Ugh! I almost fell.

82
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,098
Go on.

83
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,558
- I'm done.
- No.

84
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,025
Don't they look
so cute and happy, Ms. Morales?

85
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,238
Wine and cheese.
Caviar and blinis.

86
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,407
Some things just
go well together.

87
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,952
And Edward and Daphne...

88
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,371
You know...

89
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,541
Edward professed his love
for Daphne

90
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,209
before she left for London.

91
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,504
But Daphne's an overachiever.

92
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,091
She focused on her studies
first, which is good.

93
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,094
And now that she's back,

94
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,264
they can continue
what they had before.

95
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,643
And that's what I want
for my son.

96
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,353
An easy love.

97
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,606
Something he can enjoy.

98
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,735
Not something
he has to fight for

99
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,445
or struggle to keep.

100
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,665
You know,
when all of this is over,

101
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,334
I'm going back to school.

102
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,254
What course are you
planning to take?

103
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,340
Hmm... Business Administration.

104
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,342
- Is that what it's called?
- Mm-hmm.

105
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,636
I'm actually good at selling.

106
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,346
I mean, I'm selling--

107
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,056
Enough with that, Stella.

108
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,808
You're more than that.

109
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,269
More than what?

110
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:40,233
Even if you're just joking,
don't belittle yourself.

111
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,360
Because I...

112
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,988
I believe there's nothing
you can't do.

113
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,661
I just hope my brain
can handle college.

114
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,456
Oh, no! Erase! Erase!
Erase! Erase!

115
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,917
My brain can handle college.

116
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,587
Once people stop keeping
watch on us,

117
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,048
I'll use the money
you gave me.

118
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,801
That'll be my key
to start fresh.

119
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:10,555
Katherine, Joseph, and I
will all go to school.

120
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,225
And I'll continue searching
for Joy.

121
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,893
I won't give up on that.

122
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,979
Our lives will be better.

123
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,781
Oh, no.

124
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,534
Dear, I don't like
the look on your face.

125
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,495
I'm really sorry, Auntie.

126
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,582
I really thought
this would be easy,

127
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,001
considering my history
with Edward.

128
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,711
You told me you regret

129
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,088
how things ended
between you and Edward.

130
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,675
I really want you for Edward.

131
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,469
You have to fight
for your place.

132
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,597
That's why you came back
to the Philippines, right?

133
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,600
Are you just going to let
Edward slip away like that?

134
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,522
Daphne, I won't let another
one of my children end up

135
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,191
with another Morales.

136
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,246
What are you doing?

137
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,457
Huh? Uh, my charger is missing.

138
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,293
So I thought I'd just
borrow yours.

139
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,136
- Here.
- Thank you.

140
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,288
Hello, Vincent?

141
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,372
Doc.

142
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,542
I've confirmed the cause
of Walter's death.

143
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,504
Alright, Doc.
I'll head over there.

144
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:50,089
We have to be careful.

145
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,716
With everything happening
right now,

146
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,218
I wouldn't be surprised
if your phone's also bugged.

147
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,344
Alright.

148
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,846
I'll wait for you.

149
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,930
Okay, Doc.

150
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,021
Stella.

151
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,064
Hello, Vincent?
I'm on my way.

152
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,733
Any update from the doctor?

153
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,401
Doc Castro just called.

154
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,569
The results are out.

155
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,945
I'm heading there now.

156
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,905
Alright, I'll come with you.

157
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,158
Stella, no need. I got this.

158
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,161
Come on, Vincent.
You know you can't stop me.

159
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:23,497
Either you take me with you,
or I'll follow you there.

160
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,043
Fine. Wait for me there.

161
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,089
Chairman.

162
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,263
I've been waiting for you.

163
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,604
I thought you said
you'd settle this.

164
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,688
What happened?

165
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,025
Why is Vincent
still slipping through?

166
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,070
I already have a plan.

167
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,448
But I'll need extra payment.

168
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,991
If I'm going
to pay you again,

169
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,078
make sure I actually
benefit from it.

170
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,872
I want results.

171
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,647
Here. Buy yourself some coffee.

172
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,987
Who are you?

173
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,238
What do you want from me?

174
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,782
What else?
The autopsy result of Walter!

175
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,452
Is that it?

176
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,536
Give it to me!

177
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,455
Is it here?

178
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,082
Aah!

179
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,086
Hey!

180
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,381
- Get down!
- Aah!

181
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,134
- Let me go! Aah!
- Ah!

182
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,271
Hey, hey!

183
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,612
- Hey!
- Aah!

184
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,457
Where's the guard?

185
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,917
Sir?

186
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,717
Wake up! Stand up!

187
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,801
Hurry!

188
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,807
Where's Tonyo?

189
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,686
- Sir!
- Leave it, let's go.

190
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,249
Doc?

191
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,590
Vincent?

192
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,015
There's blood!

193
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,434
Looks like something
broke here too.

194
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,650
Hello, Vincent?

195
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,901
Doc!

196
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,319
We're at your office right now.

197
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,487
Are you okay?

198
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,031
Someone broke into my office.

199
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,367
Good thing I escaped.

200
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,868
But...

201
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,662
They're still chasing me.

202
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,081
Where are you now?
We'll come to you.

203
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,790
I'm in the other building.

204
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,085
I'll hide here for now.

205
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,005
Let's meet outside.

206
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,674
I'll call the police too.

207
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,760
Wait for us and make sure
you're around people!

208
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,054
- Where?
- In the other building!

209
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:00,858
Hurry!

210
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,767
Tonyo, let's go!

211
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,435
We got what we need!

212
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,855
Come on!

213
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,817
What's that? Check it!

214
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,492
Forget it, let's go!

215
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,801
Doc!

216
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,386
Vincent!

217
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,096
Doc, behind you!

218
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,062
- Vincent!
- Stella!

219
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,275
- Duck!
- Hide!

220
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,031
- Vincent!
- Are you okay?

221
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,533
Yeah, who was that?

222
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,538
Doc!

223
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,748
- Vincent!
- Watch out!

224
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:42,167
Doc!

225
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,963
- Vincent!
- Hey!

226
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,757
Vincent!

227
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,509
Vincent!

228
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,304
Vincent! Vincent!

229
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,181
Doc! Vincent!

230
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,266
Vincent, stand up!

231
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,767
Are you okay?

232
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,977
Come on, hurry, let's go!

233
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,437
Doc...

234
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,688
Come on, let's help her.

235
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,814
- Doc?
- Doc!

236
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:04,815
Help!

237
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:06,942
Somebody help us! Help!

238
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,277
- Help!
- Doc!

239
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:18,037
- The laptop.
- Huh?

240
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,539
Doc!

241
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,499
Doc!

242
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,799
Hurry, call an ambulance,
come on!

243
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,509
Hurry! Help!

244
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,596
Sir, Dr. Castro is dead.

245
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,476
I didn't order
anything like that.

246
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,145
We weren't the ones
who did it, sir.

247
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,439
Then who?

248
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,648
We don't know.

249
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,866
- Norman.
- Yeah?

250
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,701
Isn't that Stella's aunt?

251
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,289
Yeah.

252
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,458
That's Linda.

253
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,043
What is she doing here?

254
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,685
I'm fine.

255
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,318
What happened here?

256
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:35,114
Someone attacked Dr. Castro.

257
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,242
From her office, they chased her
all the way here until...

258
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,203
Why are you two here?

259
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,621
What's your connection to this?

260
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,374
Hey, we didn't do
anything wrong.

261
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,417
Why didn't you call right away?

262
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,921
Because we were trying
to help and save her.

263
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:54,341
If you had called sooner,
this wouldn't have happened.

264
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,386
Interfering like that
is obstruction of justice.

265
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,598
You're both linked
to Walter Cunanan's death.

266
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,351
Now someone's dead again,

267
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,145
and you're both here.

268
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,773
Why are you blaming us for this?

269
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,236
Your meddling
will end sooner or later.

270
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,405
- You know--
- Let's go, Stella.

271
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,531
Come on.

272
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,833
Hey, are you okay?

273
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,626
Are you hurt?

274
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,627
No.

275
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,504
I'm just annoyed
at that cop.

276
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,756
He's acting like
we did something wrong.

277
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,175
Forget him.

278
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,052
He can't prove anything anyway.

279
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,556
- But...
- But what?

280
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,350
Why did they target Ramona?

281
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,230
That's what I've been
wondering, too.

282
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,190
Are we really going up
against a powerful person

283
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,318
that they had
to take another life?

284
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,528
This wasn't just about
targeting her.

285
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,822
They made sure
she wouldn't talk.

286
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,909
That means whatever
information she had

287
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,913
was so important
that they had to silence her.

288
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,082
Stella, there's only one person
I know who could do that.

289
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,336
My father.

290
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,713
What?

291
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,466
Wait.

292
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,010
The laptop.

293
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,555
Doc Ramona mentioned
about it before she died.

294
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,807
Where could that laptop be?

295
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,393
I don't know.
Maybe in her office, her house,

296
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,187
or with her assistant.

297
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,189
That's what we need to find now.

298
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,526
Hello?

299
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,405
Okay, copy.

300
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,201
Soledad!

301
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,955
- Sir.
- Are you sure you're okay?

302
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,083
Yes. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

303
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,418
Stella Morales, come with us.

304
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,920
Huh? Why?

305
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,130
- What's going on?
- Stay out of this.

306
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,715
This is a police matter.

307
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,926
You have to answer some
questions at the station.

308
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,552
What did I do?

309
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:09,101
There's new information linking
you to Walter Cunanan's death.

310
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,227
What?

311
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,688
- Let's go.
- What information?

312
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,356
We'll talk at the station.

313
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,983
Go on, place her in cuffs.

314
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,443
W-Wait! I didn't do
anything wrong!

315
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,903
- You have the right...
- Stella.

316
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,113
...to remain silent.

317
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,032
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

318
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,575
in a court of law.

319
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,078
You have the right
to an attorney.

320
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,496
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

321
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,540
one will be provided for you.

322
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,527
I believe
Stella killed Walter Cunanan.

323
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,904
What are you saying?

324
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,281
So that's it?

325
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:07,951
Someone accuses me
and suddenly I'm a suspect?

326
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,286
Please continue.

327
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,874
I'm reporting you because
of your grudge against Walter.

328
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:18,128
You believe he took your sister.

329
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,796
- You're lying!
- Stella.

330
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,800
Why don't you tell them
why I think it was Walter?

331
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,845
It's because you sold
my sister to him!

332
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,765
What's your proof? Show it!

333
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,726
I don't even know
that Walter guy.

334
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,395
And I didn't know
you were together.

335
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,774
He was your type anyway.

336
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,526
A rich man you can
take advantage of.

337
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,780
- You're such a witch!
- Stella! Stella!

338
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,907
You're acting like
we're not even family!

339
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,533
You've already done me wrong,

340
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,327
and now you're getting me
into trouble!

341
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,538
See how violent she can be?!

342
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,666
She once threatened me
with a broken glass bottle.

343
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,503
If her friend hadn't
held her back,

344
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,047
she would've stabbed me!

345
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,882
And that's just me!

346
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,635
Imagine what she could do
to Walter,

347
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,387
the man she accused of
taking her sister!

348
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,598
- You witch!
- Stella.

349
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:15,310
Is that why you were
at the resort that night?

350
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,106
To kill Walter Cunanan?

351
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,236
Stella,
you don't have to answer.

352
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,114
My client has the right
to remain silent.

353
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,866
Oh, and possible intention

354
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,536
does not prove
that she committed the crime.

355
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,831
Cut the legal jargon.

356
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:40,127
The CCTV clearly shows
she was at the crime scene.

357
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,587
All you have is motive
and opportunity

358
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,506
since Stella was
at the crime scene.

359
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,134
But are you sure of the cause
of Walter's death?

360
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,887
Your report mentions a gunshot.
Where's the gun?

361
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,474
You declared Walter's death
as blunt force trauma,

362
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,434
so where's the murder weapon?

363
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,311
And is there any link to Stella?

364
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,981
Attorney, get your client
to calm down.

365
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,401
He might get into trouble.

366
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,571
That's why we initiated
a re-autopsy, for God's sake!

367
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,823
We're doing the work
you should be doing!

368
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,825
Why is it only Stella
who's getting the heat?

369
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,161
Vincent, let me handle this.

370
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,745
Fine!

371
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:22,586
Let's say Stella thinks Walter
knows where her sister is.

372
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,880
Think about it.

373
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,382
Why would she kill
the only person

374
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,217
who could lead her
to her sister?

375
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,970
And more importantly,

376
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,972
do you actually
have physical evidence?

377
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,224
If you can show me proof,

378
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,019
I'll take Stella
to prison myself.

379
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,907
I know Aunt Linda.

380
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,327
She wouldn't just come here
and accuse me

381
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,204
unless she was being paid.

382
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,957
They murdered Dr. Castro

383
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,001
and tried to stop us
from finding the truth.

384
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:07,088
And now, they dragged someone
from your past into this.

385
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,341
It means they're desperate...

386
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,177
because we are
on the right track.

387
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,804
Exactly. Desperate.

388
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,724
They rushed the arrest
and questioning,

389
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,977
yet they don't have
sufficient physical evidence.

390
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,771
That violates your rights,

391
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,857
so they have no choice
but to let you go right away.

392
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,777
Thank you, Attorney.

393
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,488
Vincent...

394
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,741
Thank you.

395
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,077
I couldn't have
managed it alone.

396
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:49,005
Make sure Linda gets
everything she needs,

397
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,508
but Stella must not know.

398
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,094
Claudia?

399
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,805
Who's Linda?

400
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,266
What's up with her and Stella?

401
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,435
Linda is Stella's aunt.

402
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:07,315
She's one of our cards
to put Stella in prison.

403
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,358
And?

404
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,153
She knows who Stella really is.

405
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,822
And because of her,

406
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,324
that woman will be buried
deeper in trouble.

407
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,784
- But...
- But what?

408
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,078
Stella's youngest sister
has gone missing.

409
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:23,415
And she's accusing
her Aunt Linda to be behind it.

410
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,710
She claims Linda
brought the baby

411
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,919
to Walter.

412
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,630
And that could be
Stella's motivation

413
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,008
to kill Walter.

414
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,261
It will further implicate her
in the case.

415
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,263
No matter what your plan is,

416
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,890
the priority is to have
Stella locked up

417
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,976
as soon as possible.

418
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,488
"Meanwhile, the wicked witch
was in her tower,

419
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,616
trying to make
the charm's magic work.

420
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,327
- She's too ba--"
- Bea.

421
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,163
- Bea! Bea!
- Daddy!

422
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,582
Oh, you're here!

423
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,084
We saw the news.

424
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,171
And I came to check on you.

425
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,550
Um, Bea, Mommy and I
will talk first, okay?

426
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,469
Okay, Daddy.

427
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,845
Come here, Bea.

428
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,264
Let's just play.
Do you know the song...

429
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:25,685
Mommy and Daddy
Should be the ones at home

430
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,730
That's a good one.
It's popular nowadays.

431
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,149
I know a song better than that.

432
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,734
Hmm.

433
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:36,905
Heaven, Earth, hell...

434
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,741
Bea belongs to heaven,
of course.

435
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,493
And me?

436
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,912
Of course, you're the princess!

437
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,790
- Of Earth?
- No, hell.

438
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,291
There's the queen.

439
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,712
Bea, just go with Fiona.

440
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:57,050
Come on. Let's read a book about
witches who destroy families.

441
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,927
Let's go!
This is fun!

442
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,389
Will you be okay here?

443
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,517
Alright.

444
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,353
Fiona, can I read that book?

445
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,402
Does Bea know what's going on?

446
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,694
No.

447
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:20,031
I just brought her here
in case you want to see her.

448
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,701
Stella...

449
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:29,040
is the most viable suspect
in Walter's death.

450
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,126
You're risking your life.

451
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,919
You have to stop this.

452
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,712
Don't you get it?

453
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:40,260
I'm doing all of this because
I also want to know the truth.

454
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:45,515
It's what's going to get me out
of all this mess.

455
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,225
The truth?

456
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,811
What are you talking about?

457
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,730
If you keep going,
you're going to end up in jail

458
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,691
or dead on the street.

459
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,401
Don't you understand?

460
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,696
Would you like to end up
like your friend Ramona?

461
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,992
Vincent, think about this
carefully.

462
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,286
Are you really doing this
for the truth?

463
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,331
Or are you doing this
for that Stella?

464
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:14,419
Do you want your child
to lose her father?

465
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,553
Bea.

466
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:27,182
Here, I made
orange juice for you.

467
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,559
Do... Do you need anything?

468
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:33,688
I'm looking for my toy.
I know I left it here.

469
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,565
Did you take it?

470
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:39,152
Oh no, I didn't.
But I'll help you look for it.

471
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:42,697
I thought you took
my toy too,

472
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,574
just like you did to Daddy.

473
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,121
What's going on here?

474
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,041
I was just gone for a bit.
Is Stella scolding you?

475
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,459
No, she's not.

476
00:29:56,336 --> 00:30:00,423
Aunt Stella,
can I look for my toy first?

477
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,008
Oh, sure, go ahead.

478
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,718
I'll help you.

479
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:06,137
- Where could that be?
- Stella.

480
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,599
Hey, I heard what the kid said.

481
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:14,646
Don't you feel even
a little bit of guilt?

482
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:19,108
While you're happy in the arms
of Sir Vincent...

483
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,193
Ah!

484
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,737
...a child is suffering
because of you.

485
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,656
You know, you're so evil,

486
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,908
hell's basically
a vacation spot for you.

487
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,910
Wanna come with me?

488
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,250
Aunt Stella! I found my toy!

489
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:40,004
Oh, wow! Can I see it?
Come on, sit with me.

490
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,883
Let me see. Wow!

491
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,677
It's so cute!

492
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:47,845
Bea!

493
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,560
What the hell
are you doing here?

494
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,481
- Bea, go with Fiona first.
- Come.

495
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,402
Let's go do some coloring.

496
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,654
Stella.

497
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,323
I'm tolerating you.

498
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:11,202
But don't you ever interact
with my child like that.

499
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,539
I may be letting you flirt
with Vincent.

500
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,417
But when it comes to Bea,

501
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,378
I draw the line.

502
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,057
You're leaving already?

503
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,747
Stella. Hey.

504
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:58,333
I heard about what happened.

505
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,543
Are you okay?

506
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,628
I'm fine.

507
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,130
Wait, you're leaving?

508
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,214
Obviously.

509
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:09,052
A lot has happened today.

510
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,429
I'm going to rest.

511
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,764
Bye.

512
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:14,807
Hold on.

513
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:19,520
I can see it in your eyes.
You're still rattled.

514
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,230
Let me take you home.

515
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,816
It's too dangerous
at this time of night.

516
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,402
I can handle myself.

517
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,404
Please?

518
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,282
I said, I'm fine.

519
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:35,870
Alright. Then,
I'll just follow you home.

520
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,705
Just to make sure
you get home safe.

521
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,749
What's it gonna be?

522
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,812
"And she goes to
a far away land."

523
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,453
Bea, where's Aunt Stella?

524
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,540
She left, Daddy.

525
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,041
Where is she going?

526
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,628
I saw Stella and
Sir Matthew leaving.

527
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,755
They were together,

528
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,466
but I don't know
where they're going.

529
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,261
Maybe somewhere far, far away.

530
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,512
The end.

531
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,400
My phone's dead.
Can I borrow a charger?

532
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,780
Why did we stop?

533
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:57,910
Every time
I pass by here, I take a break.

534
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,662
Just for a few minutes.

535
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,372
Just to catch my breath.

536
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,790
Come on. Try it.

537
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:15,344
What's with this place?

538
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,389
This is my special place.

539
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,813
Special?

540
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,067
There's nothing but grass here.

541
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,819
Exactly.

542
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:34,362
There's absolutely
nothing here.

543
00:34:35,822 --> 00:34:38,034
Whenever I'm here,

544
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:42,246
it feels like my problems
are a million miles away.

545
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:46,876
Are you cold?

546
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,252
I'm fine.

547
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:53,007
You look cold.
Come here, I'll keep you warm.

548
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,884
Hey! What are you doing?!

549
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,304
Stella, I'm sorry.

550
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,931
I got carried away.
It's an honest mistake.

551
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,349
I really thought you were
seeking comfort!

552
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,935
Don't touch me, you nutjob!

553
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,061
Stella...

554
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,980
- Stella, please don't get mad.
- I'm leaving--

555
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,316
Let me take you home, please.
It's not safe out here.

556
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,193
You're acting like a child.
I'm leaving.

557
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,738
- No, I'll take you home.
- Don't test me, Matthew!

558
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:20,326
Don't force me to defend myself
against you.

559
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,371
I'm leaving.

560
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,832
Don't follow me!

561
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,401
Hey!

562
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,656
Vincent?

563
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,242
I've been looking for you.

564
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,786
I tried calling you,
but you weren't picking up.

565
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,373
My phone's dead.
Why are you so upset?

566
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,083
Because I was worried!

567
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,878
You saw what happened
to Dr. Castro.

568
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:16,340
I feared the worst
when I couldn't contact you.

569
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,217
Why did you leave
all of a sudden?

570
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:22,430
Your wife and kid are there.
I'm not shameless, you know.

571
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,182
Did you expect me
to stay in that house?

572
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,310
I know my place, Vincent.

573
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,812
Did Claudia say something?

574
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,190
She didn't have
to make me leave.

575
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:36,027
I'm not comfortable stealing
your time with your daughter.

576
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,572
Why does it feel like you're
hiding something from me?

577
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,909
Vincent, it's been a long day.
Go home.

578
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,911
I'm fine. Just go.

579
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:48,247
Wait. You always say
that you're fine.

580
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,041
Why are you making me leave?

581
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,001
But you don't mind
going with Matthew?

582
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,253
He insisted on taking me home.

583
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,796
And you agreed?

584
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,007
Where is he now?
Where is he?

585
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,885
For crying out loud,
Vincent, just leave.

586
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:04,096
I don't have the time or energy
to argue with you.

587
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,514
What did you with Matthew?

588
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,558
We played rock, paper,
scissors. Happy now?

589
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,602
Please, just go.

590
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,979
Stella, stay away from Matthew.

591
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,273
Don't come near him
without me.

592
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,943
Why? Who are you
to tell me what to do?

593
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,527
- Are you my father?
- Stella!

594
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,237
Are you my boss, huh?

595
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,616
We're nothing to each other,
so don't tell me what to do.

596
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,661
You're just using me
to fix your problems.

597
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,995
What am I to you?

598
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,164
I mean nothing in your life.
None of this matters--

599
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,333
Can't you see how
important you are to me?!

600
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,251
- Why?!
- Because I love you!

601
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,025
Our situation is complicated.

602
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,360
You're married.

603
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,113
You have a daughter.

604
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,658
And we're dealing
with Walter's case.

605
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,496
There are a million reasons...

606
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,291
...for us not to be together.

607
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,670
But I only need
one reason to love you.

608
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,350
You know what? Just go home.

609
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,853
You're not thinking straight.

610
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,062
Think it over first.

611
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,773
Wait, what do you--
What do you mean?

612
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:42,862
Ask yourself...

613
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,200
...why you would love
a woman like me.

614
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,455
Stella, what reason
do you need?

615
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,835
Vincent--

616
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,629
Vincent, I don't know.

617
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,506
I don't know.

618
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,301
Maybe a reason not born
out of necessity?

619
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,182
I once let myself believe
that someone could love

620
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,059
a woman like me.

621
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:16,520
What did it get me?
Nothing but pain.

622
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:23,152
My life was ruined. And I'm
paying for it to this day.

623
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,495
But, Stella...

624
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,249
We don't know what will
happen to us, Vincent.

625
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,590
I won't put myself
in a situation

626
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,343
where I know I'll end up hurt.

627
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,266
I have to go.

628
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,165
Tell me the truth.

629
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,462
Are you involved
in Dr. Castro's death?

630
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,215
Yes.

631
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:30,094
See? I told you that
I'm willing to do anything.

632
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,972
Anything for you, Dad.

633
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,682
And that's what I did.

634
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:39,019
And in order
to cover my bases,

635
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,481
I sent men to her office.

636
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,028
And then?

637
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,453
What happened?

638
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,457
Dr. Castro just called.

639
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,127
The results are in.
I'm on my way there.

640
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,796
No need. Just wait for me.
I'll handle this.

641
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,382
Wait for me there.

642
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:15,973
They killed Dr. Castro.

643
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:22,563
And you placed
Vincent's life in danger.

644
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,857
Dad...

645
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,318
I just wanted to prove myself

646
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,445
and my loyalty.

647
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,698
How was I supposed to know
those idiots would do that?

648
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:38,204
You hired those people,
so you're the idiot.

649
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:41,457
You started half of this mess.

650
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,210
And you just made it worse.

651
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,387
Dude, the people you're after
are capable of murder.

652
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,476
I'm not scared, George.

653
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,980
They've only strengthened
my resolve to uncover the truth.

654
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:10,819
Dude, how sure are you
that Dr. Ramona knew something?

655
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,991
She conducted the re-autopsy.

656
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,827
She had the results.

657
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,121
We were supposed
to talk about it.

658
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,917
Before she died,
she mentioned a "laptop."

659
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,627
Where is it?

660
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,296
I don't know, but I suspect
it's in her clinic.

661
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,298
We were supposed to meet there.

662
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,802
I need your help.

663
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,101
Attorney.

664
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:45,437
Vincent, the CGC Board of
Directors are pushing through

665
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,106
with the charges
against you.

666
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,567
Your bank accounts
and assets will be frozen

667
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,360
until the investigation
is over.

668
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:55,614
Dad!

669
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,700
Dad!

670
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,495
Why are you stopping everything
I've worked hard for?

671
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:03,539
Are you planning to take
everything from me?

672
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,916
Sir Arthur, he insisted
on seeing you.

673
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,379
Leave us.

674
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,135
Vincent, you don't have
to get upset.

675
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,053
You just need to cooperate,

676
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,932
and I can make things
go away.

677
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,892
What do you mean?

678
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,353
Just sign an NDA.

679
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:30,357
Stop speaking up against
the Cabrera Group of Companies

680
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,777
and stop investigating
Walter's case.

681
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,572
Just let the authorities
deal with the case.

682
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,282
And why would I do that?

683
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,159
To end this family's problems!

684
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,786
I'll reinstate you
in Cabrera News if you want!

685
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,623
What makes you think
I want to go back?

686
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,958
For what?

687
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:51,211
For further cover-ups
to clean your name?

688
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,922
Watch your tone, Vincent.

689
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,717
I worked in Cabrera News
for years.

690
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,094
I know how you operate.

691
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,598
This is just convincing me

692
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,601
that there's manipulation
and cover-up happening

693
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:06,894
in Walter's case.

694
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,854
I am just protecting
this company

695
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,231
and I'm trying to save
this family!

696
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,109
Can't you see, Vincent?

697
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,487
I am also saving you!

698
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:20,157
I know you're involved
in Dr. Castro's death.

699
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,410
I never thought
you'd go this far.

700
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,496
I know you're coming
after Stella, too.

701
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,748
If you want to fix things
between us,

702
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:32,920
if you value whatever's
left of this family,

703
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:36,507
follow me and do what I say!

704
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,308
I'm fighting back, Attorney.

705
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,976
I know it'll make things worse,

706
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,354
but I don't care
what happens to me.

707
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,776
Okay. Keep me posted,
Attorney.

708
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,416
We're taking your car, sir.

709
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,959
Sir Arthur's orders.

710
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,387
Hand over the key, sir.

711
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,032
You already kicked Vincent out
of the company.

712
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,703
Do you have take
everything else from him too?

713
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:50,414
I gave him the option
to save himself,

714
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,916
but he chose
to go against us.

715
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,836
And we both know
that is the only way

716
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,629
to make him stop,

717
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,883
once he has nothing left and
he's been backed into a corner.

718
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:03,844
Once he's suffered enough,
he'll come crawling back

719
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,430
to follow our wishes.

720
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,560
Do you really think
he will do that?

721
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,563
Vincent is not like
Matthew or Edward.

722
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,356
You raised him
to be different.

723
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,611
The more he's cornered,
the more he's going to fight.

724
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:42,007
- Get on the ground!
- This is a raid! Nobody move!

725
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,887
Stay where you are!

726
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,723
Customers, stay where you are!

727
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:52,935
- Hey, wait! Wait!
- Get on the ground!

728
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,145
W-What's going on?

729
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,481
Ma'am, this is
a police operation.

730
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:02,069
We received a tip that illegal
drugs are being sold here.

731
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,905
- Drugs?! We don't sell drugs!
- We have a search warrant.

732
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,490
What?

733
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,576
You'll face more charges
if you don't cooperate.

734
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,745
Huh?

735
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,331
Sir, we don't sell drugs.

736
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,458
You can explain
at the station.

737
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,752
- Sir, I'm telling the truth.
- Arrest them all!

738
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:23,924
I'm telling the truth!
Sir! You must be mistaken!

739
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,843
Please have mercy!

740
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,432
- Thank you, Attorney.
- You're welcome.

741
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,187
- Thank you, Stella.
- Go home.

742
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,605
- Go.
- Thanks, Stella.

743
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:42,317
Thank you for helping us,
Stella, Attorney.

744
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,403
Based on the results
of the inspection,

745
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,864
no illegal drugs
were found in your bar.

746
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,618
They have no reason
to file charges against you.

747
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,705
Attorney, those policemen
are out of their mind.

748
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:58,500
I'd be filthy rich
if I were selling drugs.

749
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:02,254
- True.
- They just wanted to harass us.

750
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:05,007
- They're power tripping.
- Mm-hmm.

751
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:10,178
Attorney, we don't have money
for your fee...

752
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,848
Bubbles, don't worry about that.

753
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,975
Vincent will take care of it.

754
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,602
- Okay?
- Thank you.

755
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:21,356
Stella, please tell Vincent
how grateful we are.

756
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,654
Did they hurt you?
Tell Attorney if they did.

757
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,364
They said they're fine.
I'll get going.

758
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:32,367
- Attorney, thank you.
- Thank you.

759
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,788
It's finally over.

760
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,957
Stella, my dream of swimming
with whale sharks

761
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,500
will finally come true!

762
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,757
Swimming with
whale sharks, huh?!

763
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,467
What's going on here,
Charlie?!

764
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:52,888
- Ma...
- You too, Bubbles?

765
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,307
To think, I served youdinuguan at my house!

766
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,227
- My goodness, Charlie!
- Ma...

767
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,356
How's Miss Mona?

768
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,653
Thanks to your help,
they were discharged.

769
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:11,156
Also, thanks for the attorney
you sent.

770
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,449
That's good.

771
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,744
You know,

772
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:18,747
I really have a strong feeling
that all of that was made up.

773
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,458
They couldn't successfully
pin it on me,

774
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:25,128
so they're dragging my
colleagues from the bar into it.

775
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,464
Stella, what's important right
now is that no one got hurt

776
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,091
and no one was jailed.

777
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:34,137
Where are you going?

778
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,389
It's already late.

779
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,143
I'm going into
Dr. Ramona's clinic.

780
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,479
I'll look for her laptop.

781
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,606
- Okay, I'll go with you--
- Stella, no need.

782
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,359
- It's dangerous.
- Then you need me even more.

783
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,444
Vincent, you can't stop me.

784
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,405
Tell me your plan.

785
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,202
Here.

786
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,290
I studied the guards' shifts.

787
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,459
This is the right way.

788
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,682
Just stay here.

789
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,268
You're the lookout.
Don't leave out here, okay?

790
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,436
Okay.

791
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,731
Wait, Vincent--

792
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:02,309
Sir Arthur, we're already
at Dr. Ramona's clinic.

793
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,853
Come on, come on.

794
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:10,502
Vincent!

795
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,045
- Stella?!
- It's me.

796
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,380
What are you doing here?!

797
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,383
Of course I'm joining you.
What you're doing is dangerous.

798
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,176
Didn't I tell you
to wait outside?

799
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,679
You can't do anything about it,
I'm already here.

800
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,104
- There.
- Help me look.

801
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,106
I've already looked here.
You search the side.

802
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,612
Boss!

803
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,995
Maybe someone else
already took it.

804
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:48,832
This is where Dr. Castro
last came from before she died.

805
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,542
I'm sure the laptop is here.

806
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,218
- Stella.
- Oh?

807
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,345
- The laptop's here!
- Huh?!

808
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:09,978
Oh, right!

809
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,813
Come on, someone might
see us here.

810
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,481
It's closed.

811
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,983
Move.

812
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,443
Stella, turn off
your flashlight.

813
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,403
W-Wait-- I don't know.

814
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:27,162
You search here,
I'll search inside.

815
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,501
Hurry, Stella!

816
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,177
Come inside. Hold this.

817
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,637
- Go under.
- Huh?!

818
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,888
Hold this. Hurry!

819
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,848
Hurry up!

820
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,726
Vincent!

821
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,066
- Take that!
- Ouch!

822
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:40,819
Come on!

823
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:44,072
Hurry, here!

824
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,159
- Boss!
- Chase them!

825
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,497
Hello.

826
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,082
Okay, we're coming.

827
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,044
I need people!

828
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,339
Someone broke into
Dr. Castro's office! Now, hurry!

829
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,558
Come on! Hurry!

830
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,477
Hurry up! Faster!

831
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,271
Aah!

832
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,483
Come on! Hurry!

833
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,819
Come on, let's go! Aah!

834
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,947
Aah! Ah!

835
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,369
Vincent! Aah!

836
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,621
- Vincent!
- Stella, run!

837
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,540
- That's important!
- Huh-- Okay!

838
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,083
Vincent, come on!

839
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,085
Vincent!

840
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,962
Vincent!

841
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,213
Stand up there! Stand up!

842
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,673
Vincent, get down! Fast!

843
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,383
Get down!

844
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,180
- Come on! Hurry!
- Aah! Aah!

845
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,857
Men, move!

846
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,157
- Come on.
- Hurry.

847
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,041
- Get in!
- Andres?!

848
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,834
- Get in!
- Hurry!

849
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:20,919
Faster!

850
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,590
That's Allan, my asset.

851
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:30,762
He'll help us open the laptop.

852
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,180
So, can you access it?

853
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:35,100
Yeah, I've used
this kind of software before.

854
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:39,312
My laptop's just old,
that's why it's a bit slow.

855
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:43,566
There, I'm in.

856
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,361
Wait, pull up
the most recent files.

857
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,245
Oh!

858
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,715
I thought your stupidity
had limits,

859
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:10,593
but you always manage
to surprise me.

860
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:11,845
You may be my son,
Matthew,

861
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,222
but you won't be the one
to destroy my name.

862
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,724
You're the fool here.

863
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,894
You caused half of this mess,

864
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,689
and now you've made it worse.

865
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:31,447
Hey, why aren't you replying
to my texts?

866
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,369
What happened to you?

867
00:57:36,452 --> 00:57:38,288
I'm having a bad fucking night,
alright?

868
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,873
Well, same here!

869
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,125
Dad's starting
to watch me closely!

870
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,878
He's asking about
the Cabrera Land money!

871
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,047
Then tell him the truth!

872
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,340
That the money's in your pocket!

873
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,592
Hey, shh--

874
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,468
I'm not joking with you, Walter!

875
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,053
Matthew!

876
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,806
I don't even know what
to say to you anymore!

877
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:01,144
Maybe you're forgetting
that you benefited too!

878
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,947
It hurts. Hold on...

879
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,495
Are you high?

880
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,039
Oh, shit.

881
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:23,249
Oh, shit...

882
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,963
Is it painful?

883
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:32,550
Come on, I have rare whiskey
at the villa.

884
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,553
That'll numb the pain for sure.

885
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,555
Let me treat those wounds too.

886
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,681
Alright?

887
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:42,227
Come on, let's talk
before Dad catches me.

888
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,396
What the hell?!

889
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,027
What's your problem, Matthew?

890
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,905
Are you trying to kill me?

891
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,573
You're fucking crazy!

892
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:05,750
So it wasn't blunt force trauma
that killed Walter?

893
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,214
Fentanyl?

894
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,138
Walter was poisoned?

895
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,769
They all have reasons to
hide who really killed Walter.

896
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:27,272
Vincent mustn't find out
what happened.

897
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,732
Are you sure you can
sacrifice your own son?

898
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,693
Let's say
I'm sacrificing Vincent

899
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:35,321
to keep the truths
that can't come out.

900
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,199
At this point, I don't even know
what "family" means anymore.

901
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:41,536
Your investigation
ruined this family!

902
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,788
- You're ruining my life!
- Get out of here!

903
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,248
What are you guys
hiding from me?!

904
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,041
Shut up, Vincent!

905
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,334
Stop it!
