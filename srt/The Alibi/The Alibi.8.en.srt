1
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,537
<i>It's been sent to the police.</i>

2
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,082
<i>The CCTV footage of Stella</i>
<i>at the resort?</i>

3
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,792
<i>Vincent can't go to jail.</i>

4
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,419
<i>Stella should go down</i>
<i>for this.</i>

5
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,172
<i>And I've got something juicier</i>
<i>to pin on her.</i>

6
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:50,383
<i>You had every reason to tell</i>
<i>them everything. Why didn't you?</i>

7
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,343
<i>Because I choose</i>
<i>to believe in you.</i>

8
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,928
<i>I'm holding on to that.</i>

9
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,972
<i>Take back those lies</i>
<i>you said about me!</i>

10
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:57,849
<i>Prove that everything</i>
<i>I said is wrong.</i>

11
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,810
<i>It's hard to prove the truth</i>
<i>when you're being accused.</i>

12
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,773
<i>This will all end if we find out</i>
<i>what happened to Walter.</i>

13
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:08,318
<i>Alright, fine. I'll tell you</i>
<i>everything I know.</i>

14
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:15,784
Like I already told you,
I got into debt.

15
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,329
And that debt worsened
because of Walter.

16
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,206
You stole from the company.

17
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,291
I had no choice.

18
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,001
My life was at stake.

19
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:28,421
But Walter?
He benefited from it.

20
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,090
He stole so much
from the company.

21
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,177
He did it for a long time.

22
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,929
He was the mastermind.

23
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,891
Matthew, you have a strong
motive to kill Walter.

24
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,768
Because he could have
turned on you.

25
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,188
Vincent, if I wanted
to kill him,

26
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,482
I would've done it sooner.

27
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,818
He was blackmailing me
for a long time.

28
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,986
But I couldn't do it.

29
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,532
He promised
that he would help me.

30
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,325
You tell me.

31
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:02,247
Why would I kill the only person
who could help me?

32
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,584
Come on, Vincent.
Bro, please.

33
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,795
Please help me.

34
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,131
Despite our differences,

35
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,424
we're still brothers, right?

36
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,011
I'm sorry for being selfish.

37
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,597
I was just a kid.

38
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,891
I didn't know how to react.

39
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:27,605
There's no manual about
having an adopted sibling.

40
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,232
But I...

41
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:34,070
I was never selfish when it came
to our parents' love, right?

42
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:38,783
Honestly, they think more
highly of you than me.

43
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,411
Bro...

44
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,371
I don't know what to do
with myself.

45
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,209
I'm scared of being alone.

46
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,587
I don't know what
I might do to myself.

47
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,755
You've got to help me,
bro, please.

48
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:01,973
Fine.

49
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,144
You can stay here.

50
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,439
- Yeah?
- You'll be safe here.

51
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,733
Okay.

52
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,944
Despite everything,

53
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,362
you still took me in.

54
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,073
Thank you.

55
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:32,253
We'll store all the evidence
we've gathered in here.

56
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,882
We can't trust Matthew.

57
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,469
Huh?

58
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,849
If you don't trust him,
why did you take him in?

59
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,143
You're inviting a snake
into your home.

60
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:51,773
He's here because we need
to keep an eye on him.

61
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,191
A snake is only dangerous

62
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,151
when you don't know
when it'll strike.

63
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:58,321
We have to keep
our enemies closer,

64
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,532
so we need to keep
an eye on Matthew.

65
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,368
And we need to be careful.

66
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:07,872
So, you didn't believe
a word he said earlier?

67
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,249
I've known Matthew
for a long time.

68
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,670
A snake that sheds its skin
is still a snake.

69
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:19,050
Does that mean we need
to make him believe

70
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,011
that we trust him?

71
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,392
And I know exactly
how to do it.

72
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,616
Hey, what are you doing here?

73
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,327
Don't worry,
I won't stay long.

74
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,164
You can now go back
to work tomorrow.

75
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,339
What? How did this happen?

76
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,099
Hi, I'm Edward Cabrera,

77
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,976
the new manager of The Fides.

78
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,895
Congrats, Mr. Cabrera.

79
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,567
Let's just say that
we came to a realization.

80
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,570
That we can't lose someone
as special as you.

81
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,366
You're crazy!

82
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,749
See you tomorrow.
Don't be late.

83
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,688
Daphne?

84
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,856
Edward?

85
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,358
Edward!

86
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,281
I've missed you so much!

87
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,576
I just graduated from
London business school.

88
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,869
With honors!

89
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,164
I was hoping you'd show up
at my graduation.

90
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,457
Sorry.

91
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,751
I've been busy.

92
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,713
Oh. Well, I got you something.

93
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,298
Some souvenirs.

94
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,424
Thanks!

95
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,468
How have you been?
What's new with you?

96
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,555
I'm good. I mean,
I'm the manager now.

97
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,599
I know.
The job suits you well.

98
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,227
Thanks.
Congrats on graduating.

99
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,354
- Thanks.
- So, what's your plan?

100
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,422
What is this place?

101
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,916
I'm sorry, Mr. Cabrera.

102
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,502
Sir, can't we take
a quick look?

103
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,880
We really need
to check something.

104
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,549
Our files are confidential.

105
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:37,558
The law forbids us
from releasing information

106
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,645
to unauthorized individuals
who aren't related to the child.

107
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:44,732
We'll need a written request
and a court order

108
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:48,277
to release those files.

109
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,612
Please excuse me.

110
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,331
How did it go?
I bet they refused.

111
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,084
I need to get
into that room, Stella.

112
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,211
How? They won't let you in.

113
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,049
Oh. Wait.

114
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,718
I'll create a distraction.

115
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,347
Sneak in while that's happening.
Make it quick.

116
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,225
Go. Stand there.

117
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,831
Guard, help!
Guard! We need help!

118
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,666
- Ma'am are you okay?
- What happened?

119
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,168
- Help her. She fainted.
- Madam?

120
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,712
Ma'am, are you okay?

121
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,255
Clean that up.

122
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,424
Rose, call a nurse.

123
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,092
Should we call an ambulance?

124
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,177
Madam? Madam?

125
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,816
Get a mop.

126
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,693
Clean that up.

127
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,695
Madam?

128
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,890
Hey! What are you doing?

129
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,018
That room is off-limits.

130
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,688
Sir, uh... There was
a commotion outside,

131
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,483
so I went in to look
for an application form.

132
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,692
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,989
They're all attending
to the unconscious woman.

134
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,032
Madam?

135
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,034
- It's okay.
- It looked like a bad fall.

136
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,245
- Sorry about that.
- Is she wounded?

137
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,456
Madam? Madam?

138
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,209
Madam, are you okay?

139
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,212
- Are you okay?
- Wait.

140
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,048
- Are you okay, madam?
- What happened?

141
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,800
Are you okay?

142
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,845
I am. Uh...
I'm sorry for the trouble.

143
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,264
- Are you sure, miss?
- Yes.

144
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,016
Go see a doctor.

145
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,935
Take care. Can you walk?

146
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,561
Yes. Thank you.

147
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,776
We just want to know the truth
about Walter's past.

148
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,194
The truth?

149
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,155
Look at me.

150
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,994
My current state
was caused by Walter.

151
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,623
I nearly died because of him.

152
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,668
We're begging you.

153
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,796
Please leave.
We don't want any trouble.

154
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,798
We just want a quiet life.

155
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,010
Walter left our home
a long time ago.

156
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,514
We disowned him years ago.

157
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,643
We're sorry, ma'am, sir,

158
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,479
but we won't rest
until we've found out

159
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,523
what really happened to Walter.

160
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,944
I know you.

161
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,238
You're Arthur Cabrera's son.

162
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,616
I am.

163
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,369
This all started
with your father.

164
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,876
We need to find out the truth.

165
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,462
We'll leave you alone
after this.

166
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,464
Please tell us the truth.

167
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,592
Wait.

168
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,093
What do you mean?

169
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,929
What does my father
have to do with this?

170
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,226
We stood as Walter's parents
for many years.

171
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:57,776
He seemed normal
when he came into our lives.

172
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,781
But as time went on,
he started acting strange.

173
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,867
<i>Mama died because of you.</i>

174
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,744
<i>You should die!</i>

175
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:10,206
<i>Die! Die! Die!</i>

176
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,790
<i>Die!</i>

177
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,459
<i>Walter! Walter, son.</i>

178
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,753
<i>- Aah!</i>
<i>- Son!</i>

179
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,089
<i>Walter...</i>

180
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,134
<i>Son...</i>

181
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,929
<i>I'm going back to bed.</i>

182
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,473
<i>I have class tomorrow.</i>

183
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,558
<i>But...</i>

184
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,867
<i>My goodness, Walter.</i>

185
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,079
<i>You were kicked out</i>
<i>of school again?</i>

186
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:55,084
<i>Why are you always getting</i>
<i>into fights, son?</i>

187
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,796
<i>They gave me a dirty look.</i>

188
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,091
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- So, I hit them.</i>

189
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,886
<i>Before they could hurt me.</i>

190
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:31,537
Then one day,
for reasons we don't know,

191
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,540
he suddenly snapped.

192
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:38,502
<i>We are always</i>
<i>on the quest for truth.</i>

193
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,215
<i>We've never bribed</i>
<i>a whistleblower.</i>

194
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,176
<i>And I'm so happy that legally,</i>

195
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,972
<i>we have been cleared</i>
<i>of any wrongdoings.</i>

196
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,891
<i>We wouldn't ruin our name</i>

197
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,729
<i>for an individual's wrongdoings.</i>
<i>We will remain...</i>

198
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,189
<i>- Walter! Walter!</i>
<i>- ...true to our mission.</i>

199
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:03,569
<i>Walter! Walter! Walter!</i>

200
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,279
<i>Aah!</i>

201
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,240
<i>- Die! Die!</i>
<i>- Walter, stop!</i>

202
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,951
<i>You ruined my life!</i>

203
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,203
<i>- Die!</i>
<i>- Emilio!</i>

204
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,165
<i>- Die!</i>
<i>- Walter, what are you doing?!</i>

205
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,292
<i>That's enough! Stop it!</i>

206
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,753
<i>Get away from her!</i>

207
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,463
<i>Hey! Stop it!</i>

208
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,384
<i>That's enough!</i>

209
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,304
<i>Aah! Walter. Walter...</i>

210
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:34,224
<i>- Argh...</i>
<i>- Emilio?</i>

211
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,478
Walter left our home
after that incident.

212
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,771
<i>Help!</i>

213
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:42,399
He never once visited
Emilio at the hospital.

214
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,113
I thought he just
felt guilty, but...

215
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,534
I couldn't be more wrong.

216
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,997
Based on what you've shared,

217
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:01,835
Walter's anger and trauma
seem to have rooted

218
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,128
from his mother.

219
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,050
Do you know who Walter's mom is?

220
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,929
The orphanage didn't give us
any information.

221
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,766
It's part of their policy
in adopting Walter.

222
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,186
We tried asking him but...

223
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,856
he didn't share stories
about his mom.

224
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,946
Maybe it was because
of all the trauma.

225
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,203
We always wonder...

226
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,247
was there something
we could've done

227
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,624
to prevent what happened?

228
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,503
We could've prevented that.

229
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,507
That's enough, Marla.

230
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,427
We tried to give him
the love he needed,

231
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,431
but Walter had long since
closed off his heart...

232
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,435
...after all he
had gone through.

233
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,856
Now...

234
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,651
I hope you understand

235
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,280
why we just want
to forget about Walter.

236
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,785
<i>So that's why.</i>

237
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,873
Why what?

238
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,583
Why Walter turned out like that.

239
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,627
Don't tell me
you feel bad for him

240
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,796
after everything
he has done to you.

241
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:33,469
It just made me realize
that no person is innately bad.

242
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,889
People like Walter...

243
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:43,896
They've gone through the worst
to end up monstrous.

244
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,773
Walter was already broken

245
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,150
before he was taken in
by that family...

246
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,195
...because of his
mother's death.

247
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,782
Stella, the question is,

248
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:58,869
what has Dad done to make Walter
that mad at him?

249
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,332
We learned a lot from
Walter's adoptive parents,

250
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,958
but it's still not enough.

251
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,087
We don't even know

252
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,256
who his real parents are.

253
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:15,677
If it was Walter's plan all
along to get into our lives,

254
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,056
that means there's one person
who knew all about this.

255
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,099
We need to find that person.

256
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,734
Oh.

257
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,194
You're here.

258
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,403
Where's Vincent?

259
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,947
Too bad you missed Mommy.

260
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,782
She brought groceries.

261
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,160
Come with me.

262
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,829
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

263
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,288
Whoa! Whoa!

264
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,873
Hold on.
Where are you taking me?

265
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,208
Just come.

266
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,334
Sure!

267
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,629
Okay?

268
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,131
Where are you taking me?
Does Vincent know about this?

269
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,592
Mmm.

270
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,555
Get in.

271
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,189
Wait...

272
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,067
You're giving me access here?

273
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,862
That means...

274
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,822
I'm part of the team!

275
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,949
Am I going to be part
of the investigation?

276
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,033
Sit.

277
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,796
We need information from you.

278
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:35,841
Wait.

279
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,968
Why? What do you need this for?

280
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,428
Just answer the questions.

281
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,934
You've known Walter
for the longest time.

282
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,105
Did you know
who his real mother was?

283
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,523
Why are you asking me that, bro?

284
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,068
This won't be over
unless you give me answers.

285
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,738
Okay. Uh...

286
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,617
When Walter was still alive,

287
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,038
we didn't talk
about personal stuff like that.

288
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,540
Did you really think
we were best friends?

289
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,376
Come on. He was just
one of Dad's employees.

290
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,170
Okay.

291
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,714
Then let's start
from the beginning.

292
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,424
Maybe from there,
we can figure out

293
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,967
what his mom was like.

294
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,385
Wait.

295
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,262
What does his mom
have to do with this?

296
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:26,433
How did Walter get
into our family?

297
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,518
I'm sure you know something.

298
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,103
Yeah...

299
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,815
I-It was kind of weird, actually.

300
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,776
He just...

301
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,195
popped up out of the blue.

302
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,279
All of a sudden.

303
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,825
<i>Hey! Thief! Hey!</i>

304
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,952
<i>Hey!</i>

305
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:59,299
<i>- Get him, bro!</i>
<i>- Argh!</i>

306
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,717
<i>Scram!</i>

307
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,017
<i>Sir!</i>

308
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,144
<i>I believe this is yours.</i>

309
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,148
<i>Thank you.</i>

310
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,733
<i>What's your name?</i>

311
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,318
<i>I'm Walter.</i>

312
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,736
<i>Walter Cunanan.</i>

313
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,701
<i>Oh, you don't have to.</i>

314
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,785
<i>No. Take it.</i>

315
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,620
<i>Thank you.</i>

316
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,038
<i>You don't have to, sir.</i>

317
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,792
He didn't accept
the money Dad offered.

318
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,546
Instead, he asked for a job.

319
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,883
I don't know what it was
with Walter but...

320
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,803
I mean...

321
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,055
It was like,
everything just clicked.

322
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,767
Dad had an instant affinity
towards him.

323
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,229
And then, I didn't see Walter
for a while.

324
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,773
And out of the blue...

325
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,986
Walter reappeared.

326
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,823
Dad got him as an asset
for a story he was building.

327
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,953
<i>What do you need?</i>

328
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,455
<i>Boss,</i>

329
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,623
<i>I want to apply for a job.</i>

330
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,916
<i>Apply as what?</i>

331
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,587
<i>I heard from a friend...</i>

332
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,255
<i>that you need someone.</i>

333
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,555
<i>Fine.</i>

334
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,392
<i>End all my suffering.</i>

335
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,645
<i>No one will look for me anyway.</i>

336
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,483
<i>But you'd benefit from me</i>
<i>if I'm alive.</i>

337
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,445
<i>You can count on me.</i>

338
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,988
<i>Fine. Come with me inside.</i>

339
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,406
<i>I'll introduce you to our boss.</i>

340
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,997
<i>This is our machine.</i>

341
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,897
<i>Hey! What's that?</i>

342
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,065
<i>What?</i>

343
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,191
<i>It's nothing.</i>

344
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,275
<i>Show it to me!</i>

345
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,611
<i>You bastard!</i>

346
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,405
<i>Damn you!</i>

347
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,784
<i>Aah!</i>

348
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,953
<i>Agh!</i> <i>Come back here!</i>

349
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,831
<i>Congrats on</i>
<i>your latest story, Arthur!</i>

350
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,126
<i>- You've busted the syndicate.</i>
<i>- And the minors were saved.</i>

351
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,169
<i>Your coverage was very in-depth.</i>

352
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,921
<i>Especially those</i>
<i>hidden camera shots.</i>

353
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,214
<i>That was very suspenseful.</i>

354
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,799
<i>Well...</i>

355
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,926
<i>thank you for appreciating it.</i>

356
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:51,680
<i>I put my life on the line</i>
<i>to expose the truth</i>

357
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,973
<i>that needed to be told.</i>

358
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,935
Walter passed Dad's tests.

359
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,856
And ever since then,

360
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,192
Walter became
Dad's best soldier.

361
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,779
For him,
Walter was indispensable.

362
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,698
Since then,

363
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,992
Dad took care of him.

364
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,453
Dad treated him like family.

365
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,914
He bought him a house
to live in.

366
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,541
He gave him a scholarship.

367
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,626
<i>Et cetera, et cetera.</i>

368
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,838
What do you think Walter did
to gain your dad's trust?

369
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,339
I don't know.

370
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:30,594
We'll never know
what happened between them.

371
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,097
But knowing Dad,

372
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,224
and based on Matthew's stories,

373
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,810
he probably saw desperation
in Walter.

374
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,063
And that was something
he could use.

375
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,481
Hold on, bro.

376
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,109
Your theory seems to have holes.

377
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,361
If Walter was angry at Dad...

378
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,782
why was he so loyal to him
the whole time?

379
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,743
He stayed in the company
for so long.

380
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,538
He worked like a slave.

381
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:02,375
Maybe his childhood became
so traumatic because of Dad.

382
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,627
He blamed him.

383
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,256
That's why he had
deep-seated hatred for Dad.

384
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,800
And that anger could be enough

385
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,761
to endure all of that.

386
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,972
To play the long game.

387
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,892
For him to pester
all our lives.

388
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,810
He was plotting
something bigger.

389
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,938
And possibly...

390
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,524
something that could
get him killed.

391
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,282
You know what's infuriating,
Andres?

392
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,952
From a witness,
a key witness at that,

393
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,830
the security guard of the resort
was relegated to a complainant

394
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,207
because you kept harassing him!

395
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,625
Sir, I didn't harass him.

396
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,001
What then?

397
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,504
First of all, we have no use
for his testimony.

398
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:51,216
We found holes in it.
We acquired CCTV footage.

399
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,468
And secondly,
I saw fear in his eyes.

400
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:56,513
That means if he's hiding evidence and is lying to us,

401
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,056
a powerful person's behind this.

402
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,976
- I want to focus on that.
- Well, I don't care.

403
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,479
I'll assign you
to a different case,

404
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,022
effective immediately.

405
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,524
- But sir--
- And please!

406
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,235
Enough of your
conspiracy theories!

407
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,028
Sir, the case is still ongoing!

408
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,531
I don't give a damn!

409
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,032
Pick your poison.

410
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,409
Follow my orders

411
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,703
or get a disciplinary sanction?

412
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,795
That's my prerogative, Andres!

413
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,672
I am the head of this office!

414
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,452
<i>That's their first</i>
<i>picture together.</i>

415
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:05,123
<i>From the same date</i>
<i>as Walter's death.</i>

416
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,334
<i>If they've been in a</i>
<i>relationship all this time,</i>

417
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,794
<i>why don't they have</i>
<i>more pictures?</i>

418
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,840
It means...

419
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,093
it's all a lie.

420
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,562
Hello, Dad?

421
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,813
Is it okay to talk?

422
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,107
Yeah, yeah. It's okay.

423
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,777
Have you done
what I asked you to do?

424
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,530
<i>I would like to remind you,</i>
<i>Matthew...</i>

425
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,785
that I'm just giving you
a second chance.

426
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,496
<i>I'll do anything, Dad!</i>

427
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,289
<i>Please!</i>
<i>Let me make it up to you!</i>

428
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,708
<i>I will do anything! Please!</i>

429
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,793
<i>Anything?</i>

430
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,003
<i>Anything.</i>

431
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,089
Yeah... Yeah, I think...

432
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,633
I think our plan
is really working, Dad.

433
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,344
<i>Vincent and the others</i>
<i>have no idea.</i>

434
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,347
But I think it's better
if we talk in person.

435
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,681
Are you free to meet up?

436
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,308
Is Mom around?

437
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,019
No, she's not.

438
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,146
She's busy with the hotel.

439
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,773
Right, yeah.

440
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:17,070
If Mommy finds out that we're
ganging up on her favorite son,

441
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,905
it'll get messy.

442
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:19,989
I know.

443
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,451
See you in an hour.

444
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,203
Alright.

445
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,515
They are starting
to look into Walter's past.

446
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,893
But I suppose
you used your brain.

447
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,439
Dad, I didn't say much,

448
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,274
but Vincent is smart.

449
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,360
He won't believe
I know nothing.

450
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,570
So at the very least,

451
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,447
I need to give him
something to chew on.

452
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,615
It's just a hassle
that he's behaving

453
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,076
like such an arrogant scumbag.

454
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,455
Where are they?
What are they doing?

455
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,539
Uh...

456
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,001
I don't know
where they went, but...

457
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:19,382
I'm sure they'll dig into
every part of Walter's life.

458
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,594
They're definitely
seeking answers.

459
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,973
But they won't find anything.

460
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,725
Right?

461
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:40,778
Sir?

462
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,491
Vincent is looking into
Walter's past.

463
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,161
They cannot find anything
about Walter's life.

464
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,372
Not a single thing.

465
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,208
Yes, sir.

466
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,975
This is it.

467
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,229
This is where Walter
was brought when his mom died,

468
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,356
before he was taken
to the orphanage

469
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,400
where his adoptive mother
Marla took him in.

470
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,405
Based on the time frame,

471
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,701
this is the only NGO that
could've taken him in that time.

472
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,829
This is the only one that
catered to abandoned children

473
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,957
before they're transferred
to long-term shelters

474
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,291
or orphanages.

475
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,921
So I'm sure they have
a record of Walter's history,

476
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,131
including his mother's identity.

477
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,648
- Surprise!
- Aah!

478
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,233
Oh my goodness.

479
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,402
What?

480
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,486
Is everything set?

481
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,947
Don't worry, Sir Vincent.

482
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,448
Everything is set.

483
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,033
We're ready to go.

484
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,120
Okay. Go ahead inside.
I'll be right there.

485
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,621
Thank you, sir.
Let's go.

486
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,082
What was that?

487
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,166
What's with the clown?

488
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,836
What are you planning?

489
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,340
<i>Okay, you want more?!</i>

490
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,551
- Yes!
- You want more?!

491
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,844
- Yes!
- Okay.

492
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:33,558
Ma'am, before I forget...
A small donation for the kids.

493
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,227
I see what you do here.

494
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,481
These kids are lucky
to be under your care.

495
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,068
We try our best, Vincent.

496
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:48,239
We're lucky
to have people like you.

497
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:54,912
You understand what
these kids are going through.

498
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,164
Thank you.

499
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,166
That's why I'm hopeful that...

500
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,587
...there will be people
who will accept them

501
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,047
and ease their sadness.

502
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,801
I hope we can see them
like this every day.

503
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,345
Happy.

504
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,224
Okay, kids!
Who wants their makeup done?

505
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,018
- Me!
- Alright! Come here!

506
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,937
- Hello.
- Can you do my makeup?

507
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:20,980
Of course!

508
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,775
- What do you want to be?
- A princess.

509
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,944
A princess?
I'll turn you into a princess.

510
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,113
- What's your name?
- Monica.

511
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,365
Monica.

512
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,866
Alright, Princess Monica.

513
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:33,451
Come here. Look up.

514
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,412
I'll draw a star right here.

515
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,626
There you go!
The other side.

516
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,671
Let me see. Wow!

517
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,255
Wow!

518
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,257
Thank you, miss!

519
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,012
Stand up, sweetie.

520
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,305
How old are you?

521
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,556
I'm eight years old.

522
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,646
You're about the same age
as my sister.

523
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,898
She's missing, you see.

524
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,942
I haven't found her.

525
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,527
Are you okay?

526
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,245
What... What was that for?

527
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,832
It looks like
you really miss your sister.

528
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,751
I'll hug you for her

529
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,837
while she hasn't come back.

530
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,564
Thank you.

531
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,149
Thank you, sweetie.

532
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,692
Ma'am, excuse me.

533
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,694
Where do I put these files?

534
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,738
Bring them over
to the other building.

535
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,489
- To the records room.
- Okay.

536
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,907
Go on.

537
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,784
Thank you.

538
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,845
- Captain?
- Leon.

539
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,930
You left the precinct already?

540
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,224
I don't like wasting time.

541
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,225
Good.

542
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,060
That's what I like
about you, Detective.

543
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,937
You act fast.

544
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,063
Now...

545
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:30,943
I presume you already know
who our main suspect is.

546
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,237
Stella Morales.

547
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,323
Exactly.

548
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,371
I'll turn you into a princess.

549
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,707
- Stella.
- Hold on, sweetie.

550
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,376
Go choose what color you want.

551
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,423
The records room
is in the other building.

552
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,635
I need to move
while everyone's occupied.

553
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,220
But I need time.

554
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,222
Alright, I got it here.

555
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,431
Be careful.

556
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,068
Vincent Cabrera!

557
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,449
What do you need, sir?

558
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:22,495
We're here to investigate
Walter Cunanan.

559
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,543
I thought Andres
was handling Walter's case.

560
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,670
You haven't heard?

561
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,923
He's been removed
from the case.

562
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:37,134
Detective Leon Mercado has
taken over the investigation.

563
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,595
He ordered us to come here.

564
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,597
Vincent?

565
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,350
Ms. Morales!

566
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,478
Good afternoon, sir.
You're here too.

567
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,357
What are you both doing here?

568
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,442
What's the occasion?

569
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,821
Or does this have anything
to do with Walter Cunanan?

570
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,409
Sir, we don't need a special occasion to help kids.

571
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,995
Vincent was also adopted,

572
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,539
so he often does charity work
for institutions like this.

573
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:10,126
Why are you assuming
it's about Walter Cunanan?

574
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:14,547
It looks like you know a lot
about Walter Cunanan.

575
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,134
I'm sure the information we have
is just the same

576
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,011
as what the police
have gathered.

577
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,307
While you're here,

578
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,726
why don't you talk to the kids
to inspire them?

579
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,854
Maybe one of them wants
to become a cop like you.

580
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,523
They could follow
in your footsteps.

581
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,359
- Come, sir.
- I'll be downstairs, sir.

582
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,778
Alright.
Keep an eye downstairs.

583
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,821
Yes, sir.

584
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,615
Alright. This way, sir.

585
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,450
They'll love you.

586
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,912
- Kids, we have a visitor!
- Wow! Give him a hand!

587
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,163
Alright!

588
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,291
Who wants to be a cop
when they grow up?

589
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,792
- Raise your hand!
- Me!

590
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,205
Okay. Say "police!"

591
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,874
- Police!
- Police!

592
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,904
- Hello!
- Enough

593
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,198
Kids, go back to your seats.

594
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:07,368
- Where's Cabrera?
- I think he's in the restroom.

595
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,495
But I'm sure he's
on his way back now.

596
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,747
Sir!

597
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,834
Stay seated.

598
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,419
Do you want to see
more magic tricks?

599
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,321
Alba!

600
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,489
Sir.

601
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,659
I think Vincent Cabrera
has already left.

602
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,204
Sir, I saw him go
to that building.

603
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,920
- Guard.
- Yes, sir?

604
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,882
What's in that building?

605
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,508
The records room, sir.

606
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,260
It has the records
of the children

607
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,720
who got adopted
from this foster home.

608
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,430
- Come with us.
- Okay, sir.

609
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:11,807
It's over here.

610
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,684
The door.

611
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,207
It's locked.
Do you have the keys?

612
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,333
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

613
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,626
<i>Go, open it.</i>

614
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:25,965
Sir.

615
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:28,968
Let's go.

616
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,825
Oh, sir.

617
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,035
Uh, you should eat.

618
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,037
Please give him some food.

619
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,706
Where's Cabrera?

620
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,332
Sir.

621
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,051
- Hand it here.
- It's fine. I'll put them here.

622
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,096
Where have you been?

623
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,975
He said he saw you go
to the other building.

624
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,271
I just got some deliveries

625
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,857
of stuff we're going
to give the kids.

626
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,526
Looks like it's true

627
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,695
that you're investigating
about Walter.

628
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,531
That's the job of the police!

629
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,662
But...

630
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:43,500
maybe you can tell me
what you've found out.

631
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:47,421
Sir, you couldn't wait
to leave earlier,

632
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:48,964
and now, you're back here again.

633
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,049
Stella.

634
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,469
First of all,

635
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,680
it's our right
to know the truth.

636
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,599
Second,

637
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,018
we already gave our statements
when we were in the station,

638
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,062
and they don't have
enough evidence to implicate us.

639
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,230
And third,

640
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,399
we know the law
and we know our rights.

641
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,778
If you have more questions,

642
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,863
talk to my lawyer.

643
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,504
That scared me.

644
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,638
- I haven't finished this.
- It's from him.

645
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,997
They removed you
from Walter's case.

646
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,918
News really travels fast, huh?

647
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,338
You guys must be happy because
you got me out of your hair now.

648
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,673
You guys win.

649
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,883
No one's a winner yet, Andres.

650
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,554
Walter's murderer
is still out on the loose.

651
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,773
I need your help.

652
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,697
What made you think
that I'm going to help you?

653
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:43,037
Because you never stop
until you know the truth.

654
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,705
Based on what I know
about you,

655
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,749
I know that you're
an honest policeman.

656
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,667
I think your suspicion is right.

657
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,712
Someone is manipulating
all of this.

658
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,340
And I think they took
you off the case

659
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:57,426
because you're close
to uncovering their secrets.

660
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,928
"Their secrets"?

661
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:04,266
Why? Were you able
to find new information?

662
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,935
I don't think Walter
approaching my family

663
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,146
and getting close to my father

664
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,106
was a coincidence.

665
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:17,321
Walter deliberately targeted us because he's mad at my father.

666
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:22,785
You know, if Walter's motive
is to get revenge,

667
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,788
he wouldn't wait that long
before exacting it.

668
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,331
He was always
with your father.

669
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:29,375
He could shoot him
and be done with it.

670
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:32,378
That's why I need
your help, Andres.

671
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,296
If Walter waited that long,

672
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,715
it means he meticulously
planned for it.

673
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,844
Do you know a Teresa Lopez?

674
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,056
She's Walter's mom.

675
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:47,351
Walter was 10
when his mom died.

676
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,145
And I think

677
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,981
that's the reason why he
despised us Cabreras.

678
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,528
If we find out
what really happened to her,

679
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:03,158
we will be able to know
Walter's plans and motives.

680
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,412
And maybe we'll be able
to discover who killed him.

681
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,138
"Tereza Lopez"

682
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,416
Walter's mom killed herself?

683
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,752
What does this
have to do with your dad?

684
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,297
I don't know yet.

685
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,342
But I found out that she
used to be Dad's employee.

686
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:06,013
She wasn't just
an ordinary employee, Vincent.

687
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,806
Read what's written below.

688
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,317
She was my dad's protégé?

689
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,176
- Evelyn Sillano?
- Yes?

690
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,095
You're the one
I'm having a meeting with?

691
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:48,889
Yes.

692
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,225
And I'll get straight
to the point.

693
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,936
Oh. Uh, I'm sorry.

694
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,480
- I'm busy. I have to go.
- Uh, ma'am. Wait.

695
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,191
There's something
we want to ask you

696
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,276
about Teresa Lopez.

697
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,613
I have nothing to do with that.
I know nothing.

698
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,907
You were the one
who made her report, right?

699
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,868
We have the documents.

700
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,247
We can hand them
over to the police

701
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,207
so they can investigate you
themselves.

702
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,417
What exactly
do you want to know?

703
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,336
That happened a long time ago.

704
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,672
I no longer work
for the company.

705
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,967
We want to know what really
happened to Teresa Lopez...

706
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,554
and why she died by suicide.

707
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:52,119
Teresa was among those
trained by Sir Arthur.

708
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:59,209
Teresa got dragged into the case
he forced her to handle.

709
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,670
Um...

710
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:07,509
She didn't turn on Sir Arthur
despite what he made her do.

711
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:13,682
It was Sir Arthur
who betrayed her.

712
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,979
<i>Sir.</i>

713
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:22,024
<i>Have you already secured</i>
<i>our informant's affidavit?</i>

714
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,942
<i>Um...</i>

715
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,111
<i>Not yet, sir, because...</i>

716
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,866
<i>I found inconsistencies in his</i>
<i>statement when I reviewed it.</i>

717
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,534
<i>He might be lying to me.</i>

718
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:33,952
<i>For God's sake, Teresa!</i>

719
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,203
<i>You're my intern!</i>

720
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,747
<i>Follow my instructions!</i>

721
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:40,375
<i>You know how important</i>
<i>his statement is for our scoop.</i>

722
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,753
<i>- Sir--</i>
<i>- He's our only whistleblower</i>

723
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,588
<i>to expose that judge!</i>

724
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,590
<i>But, sir,</i>
<i>we'll be in trouble</i>

725
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:50,010
<i>if we publish the story</i>
<i>based on his statement.</i>

726
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:53,972
<i>Once he signs the affidavit,</i>
<i>we won't be liable.</i>

727
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,266
<i>If he lies, that's on him!</i>

728
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,144
<i>But... Sir, how?</i>

729
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,854
<i>You have confidential funds!</i>

730
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,356
<i>You know what to do!</i>

731
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,650
<i>Why? Are you scared?</i>

732
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:09,154
<i>The first quality</i>
<i>of a journalist is bravery!</i>

733
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:13,283
<i>You should be ready to throw</i>
<i>yourself between bullets</i>

734
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,369
<i>if you want to get that story!</i>

735
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,791
<i>What?</i>

736
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,336
<i>You'll have him sign it,</i>
<i>or you'll lose your job?!</i>

737
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,729
<i>Here's the affidavit.</i>

738
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:47,859
<i>Sign it so we can publish</i>
<i>the story against your boss.</i>

739
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,528
<i>I just got carried away</i>
<i>with my emotions</i>

740
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,196
<i>when I told you those things.</i>

741
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,948
<i>I'm pulling out my statement.</i>

742
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,199
<i>What?!</i>

743
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,284
<i>Oh, no.</i>

744
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,494
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

745
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,914
<i>I'm begging you!</i>
<i>Please sign it now!</i>

746
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:04,251
<i>My job depends on this!</i>

747
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,352
<i>Come on, take it.</i>

748
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:27,941
<i>Then sign the affidavit.</i>

749
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,820
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

750
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,790
<i>What's that?!</i>

751
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,377
<i>- Teresa Lopez.</i>
<i>- Uh...</i>

752
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,879
<i>You are under arrest</i>

753
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,881
<i>for obstruction of justice!</i>

754
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,049
<i>- Come on, cuff her.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

755
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,598
<i>You set me up.</i>

756
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,933
<i>- Let's go.</i>
<i>- Come on.</i>

757
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,310
<i>Wait, sir!</i>

758
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,854
<i>- Just come with us.</i>
<i>- Sir--</i>

759
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,355
<i>You set me up.</i>

760
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,398
<i>Sir.</i>

761
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,775
<i>Boss, wait!</i>

762
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:10,901
<i>Please.</i>

763
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,527
<i>Get in. Come on.</i>

764
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:15,989
<i>Boss, don't do this.</i>

765
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,366
<i>Please...</i>

766
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,413
<i>Hello, Ma?</i>

767
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,040
<i>Are you on your way home?</i>

768
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:30,128
<i>Son, I don't think</i>
<i>I can come home tonight.</i>

769
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:33,131
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>Mama got into trouble.</i>

770
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,883
<i>What happened, Ma?</i>

771
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:38,720
<i>Sir Arthur asked me</i>
<i>to do something.</i>

772
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,305
<i>I-I don't know.</i>

773
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,808
<i>I might go to jail, son.</i>

774
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,726
<i>Ma! What do you mean?!</i>

775
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,979
<i>But maybe he won't abandon me.</i>

776
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,232
<i>Maybe everything</i>
<i>will be okay, son.</i>

777
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,983
<i>What are we going to do, Ma?!</i>

778
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,819
<i>I don't know.</i>

779
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:58,031
<i>I don't know!</i>
<i>I don't know what to do!</i>

780
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,327
<i>Son, I'm so scared.</i>

781
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,056
<i>Ma?</i>

782
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,019
<i>I'll just borrow from the store.</i>

783
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,313
<i>Do you want anything?</i>

784
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,566
<i>Ma?</i>

785
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,196
<i>Mama!</i>

786
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,782
<i>Ma! Ma!</i>

787
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,742
<i>Ma, why?!</i>

788
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,412
<i>Mama! Mama!</i>

789
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,249
I couldn't do anything.

790
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,751
That's why I resigned.

791
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:56,715
I could no longer take
Sir Arthur's cruelty.

792
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:03,430
That explains
why Walter was so furious.

793
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:07,934
He blamed your father
for his mother's death.

794
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,063
Even if Dad
didn't directly do it,

795
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,275
from Walter's perspective,

796
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:19,779
my father pushed his mother
to do all that.

797
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:25,577
That also pushed Walter
to do this.

798
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,662
To get into our family.

799
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,539
To wait that long.

800
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,918
To get revenge on my father.

801
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,088
<i>How did your errand go?</i>

802
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:41,384
We talked to the company's
former HR officer.

803
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,638
Things are getting clearer
about Walter's death.

804
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,097
We're gathering proof

805
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:49,267
about why he was killed
and who might have done it.

806
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,852
You think it's your father?

807
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,773
I need to be sure, Andres.

808
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,693
We're talking about my family.

809
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,195
Let us work on it.

810
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,490
Us?

811
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,076
You'll still help us?

812
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:08,870
If they think I'll stop after
removing me from the case,

813
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,747
they don't know me.

814
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:14,459
I won't stop until the real
culprit pays for what they did.

815
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,003
You need an ally, right?

816
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,100
Mrs. Cunanan!

817
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,312
Oh, what are you doing here?

818
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,481
We've already given you
all the information.

819
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:39,442
I have nothing more to tell you.

820
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,611
There's something else
we need from you.

821
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,113
What is it?

822
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:48,660
We'd like to ask your permission
as Walter's legal parent.

823
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:53,623
We're planning to exhume
his body for autopsy.

824
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,209
What for?

825
00:54:57,168 --> 00:55:01,589
We suspect his first
autopsy was manipulated

826
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,675
to derail the investigation.

827
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,386
Who would do that?

828
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:10,473
Someone covering up
what really happened.

829
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,642
The one who killed him.

830
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,569
Sir Arthur.

831
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,573
Part of the protocol...

832
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,408
The Review Board informed us

833
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:32,787
that they will perform
a new autopsy on Walter Cunanan.

834
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:36,332
<i>And unfortunately, a doctor...</i>

835
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:40,170
<i>named Dr. Ramona Castro</i>
<i>has been tasked to handle it.</i>

836
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,422
How did they manage to do that?

837
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,800
Apparently, they got permission
from the legal parent.

838
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,510
Damn it.

839
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,512
What did you even do?

840
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,473
Why didn't you stop them?

841
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:55,268
You are the police department
for God's sake!

842
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:57,145
<i>Sir Arthur.</i>

843
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,856
<i>They are an independent body.</i>

844
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:04,778
They are not
within my jurisdiction.

845
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,071
I'm sorry.

846
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,580
Teresa Lopez.

847
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:19,584
Then Walter Cunanan.

848
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,629
Vincent is getting closer
to the truth.

849
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,480
We're here.

850
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,482
Alright.

851
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,077
- Get it, come on.
- You're from the morgue?

852
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,453
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

853
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:58,206
Can you show us the permit
from the doctor?

854
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,708
Uh, sure. It's in the van.

855
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,377
Can you show it?

856
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,337
You know
this is a high-profile case.

857
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,505
We're just making sure.

858
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,549
Okay, sir. We'll put
the coffin in the van first.

859
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,050
It won't take long.

860
00:57:36,452 --> 00:57:37,787
- Doc, excuse me.
- Yes?

861
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,123
The morgue staff will be late.

862
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,916
They got a flat tire.

863
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,751
- Huh? A flat tire?
- Yes.

864
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,087
- Sir, we're leaving.
- Wait. Hold on.

865
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,924
- Doc.
- Hello, Vincent.

866
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,968
<i>The staff from the morgue</i>
<i>will be late.</i>

867
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,597
Stella, get the car!
They tricked us!

868
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,890
Huh?!

869
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,814
Stop what you're doing!

870
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,071
Vincent!

871
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:55,907
Vincent!

872
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:01,037
- Vincent, behind you!
- Argh!

873
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,830
Vincent! He has a gun!

874
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,968
Vincent!

875
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,219
Stop!

876
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:19,138
Stop! Let go of him! Get down!

877
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,431
Get down!

878
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:24,560
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

879
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,737
<i>Some men tried</i>
<i>to take Walter's body.</i>

880
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,031
<i>Who would do that?</i>
<i>You might know them.</i>

881
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,324
<i>Once it's proven</i>

882
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,619
<i>someone manipulated</i>
<i>Walter Cunanan's autopsy,</i>

883
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:42,954
<i>they'll pay for it, right?</i>

884
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,539
<i>As soon as I begin</i>
<i>my examination,</i>

885
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:46,374
<i>we'll find</i>
<i>what you're looking for.</i>

886
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:47,834
<i>And hopefully, with the results,</i>

887
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,377
<i>I'll be able to prove</i>
<i>your innocence.</i>

888
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,045
<i>We'll surely get</i>
<i>in trouble, doc.</i>

889
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,423
<i>I'm aware. You should fear</i>
<i>the living more than the dead.</i>

890
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,966
