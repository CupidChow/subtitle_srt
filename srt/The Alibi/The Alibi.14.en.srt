1
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,413
<i>I trusted you, you traitor!</i>

2
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,749
<i>Arthur Cabrera is behind</i>
<i>all of this.</i>

3
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,126
<i>Claudia's death,</i>
<i>Stella's accusation...</i>

4
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,421
<i>You should've taken</i>
<i>the chance to escape.</i>

5
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,089
<i>Ma, after everything</i>
<i>I've been through,</i>

6
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,549
<i>I don't back down</i>
<i>from any fight.</i>

7
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,718
<i>This is one fight</i>
<i>I'm not losing.</i>

8
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,762
<i>You can't have everything,</i>
<i>Vincent.</i>

9
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,264
<i>It's either Stella or Bea.</i>

10
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,724
<i>Take your pick.</i>

11
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,768
<i>Claudia lost your baby.</i>

12
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,311
<i>Where did that child come from?</i>

13
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,563
<i>I really don't know!</i>
<i>Maybe you should ask your mom.</i>

14
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,647
<i>Mom?</i>

15
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,182
You monster!
How could you do this?!

16
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,267
What did you do to my sister?!

17
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,062
Why did you do it? Why?!

18
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,231
I don't know what
you're talking about, Stella.

19
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,024
This is the proof.

20
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,609
Can you see this?

21
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,197
Mama and Bea's DNA are a match.

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,076
That means, Bea is Joy!

23
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,830
She's my sister!
How could you do this to me?!

24
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,665
T-That's fake!

25
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,042
She's manipulating you
against me!

26
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,377
It's not true!

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,129
Can you just stop it, Mom?

28
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:14,092
I'm the one who took the sample
and initiated the test.

29
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,554
So, I know for a fact
that this is true!

30
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:21,224
Seriously, Mom?
Even my own daughter?

31
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,978
How could you lie
about an innocent child?

32
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,604
No-- No!

33
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,065
It's all Walter's fault!

34
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,028
<i>How's Claudia doing?</i>

35
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,531
<i>She still can't take care</i>
<i>of the baby.</i>

36
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,950
<i>I think she's having postpartum.</i>

37
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,911
<i>I've told her to see a doctor</i>
<i>about it, though.</i>

38
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,580
<i>Uh...</i>

39
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,124
<i>Moms and babies just have</i>
<i>a different bond</i>

40
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,252
<i>during the first few months.</i>

41
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,963
<i>Vincent, meanwhile,</i>
<i>is excited to come home.</i>

42
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,799
<i>It's been months since</i>
<i>he started training in the US.</i>

43
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,719
<i>- When is he coming home?</i>
<i>- By the end of the month.</i>

44
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:03,349
<i>He's a bit sad that he couldn't</i>
<i>be here to see the delivery,</i>

45
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,477
<i>but he's very excited</i>
<i>to come home and meet her.</i>

46
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,314
<i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>how excited they must be.</i>

47
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,233
<i>They've always wanted a baby.</i>

48
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,068
<i>Regarding her rashes,</i>

49
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,321
<i>I think you should see</i>
<i>a doctor about it, too.</i>

50
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:20,617
<i>But she's a little physically</i>
<i>big for her age, right?</i>

51
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,286
<i>Yeah, but you can ask</i>
<i>them to run some tests</i>

52
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,246
<i>just to be sure.</i>

53
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,832
<i>Could you do it?</i>
<i>I trust you more.</i>

54
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,543
<i>And so we can get the results</i>
<i>much faster.</i>

55
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,170
<i>Sure.</i>

56
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,967
<i>Oh, doctor! Where are you going?</i>

57
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,553
<i>I called your secretary</i>
<i>to say that I was dropping by.</i>

58
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,930
<i>Emergency call.</i>

59
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,765
<i>How can I help you,</i>
<i>Miss Jacqueline?</i>

60
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,643
<i>I need some documents</i>
<i>regarding Claudia's delivery.</i>

61
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,020
<i>We're taking Bea</i>
<i>to a new pediatrician.</i>

62
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,105
<i>Have you talked to Claudia</i>
<i>about this?</i>

63
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,982
<i>That's why I'm asking you.</i>

64
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,859
<i>Is there something</i>
<i>I need to know?</i>

65
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,070
<i>I'm sorry, Miss Jacqueline,</i>

66
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,821
<i>but I can't help you.</i>

67
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,157
<i>You know me, Doc.</i>

68
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,742
<i>You know who my husband is.</i>

69
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:06,996
<i>I can have you banned in all</i>
<i>the hospitals in the country.</i>

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,165
<i>I can have your license revoked.</i>

71
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:13,628
<i>I'll ruin your life if you don't</i>
<i>tell me the truth.</i>

72
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,130
<i>I'm really sorry,</i>
<i>Miss Jacqueline.</i>

73
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,716
<i>I think you should talk</i>
<i>to your family about this.</i>

74
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,805
<i>Hi, baby girl.</i>

75
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,433
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't visit you</i>
<i>for a while, but I'm here now.</i>

76
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,396
<i>Claudia.</i>

77
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,735
<i>Mom.</i>

78
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,153
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

79
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,614
<i>I should be the one</i>
<i>asking you that.</i>

80
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,282
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

81
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,456
<i>What have you done?</i>

82
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,917
<i>Did you think</i>
<i>I wouldn't find out?</i>

83
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,128
<i>I had Bea tested.</i>

84
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,046
<i>She's not your daughter.</i>

85
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,674
<i>- Mom...</i>
<i>- Where did she come from?</i>

86
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,553
<i>Claudia!</i>

87
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,513
<i>Mom...</i>

88
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,640
<i>Walter got me the child.</i>

89
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,857
<i>How about the hospital?</i>
<i>The doctors?</i>

90
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,650
<i>The documents?</i>

91
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,652
<i>Dad helped us.</i>

92
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,362
<i>He knew all this time?</i>

93
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,866
<i>Mom, we already had the child</i>
<i>when he helped us.</i>

94
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,035
<i>But you know Dad.</i>

95
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,246
<i>He's not gonna risk anything</i>
<i>to ruin his reputation.</i>

96
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,584
<i>- I need to tell Vincent.</i>
<i>- Mom, please don't tell him.</i>

97
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,170
<i>He needs to know that</i>
<i>that's not his daughter.</i>

98
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,380
<i>Mom, please.</i>

99
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,798
<i>Please...</i>

100
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:50,391
<i>You know how important it is</i>
<i>for him to become a father.</i>

101
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,229
<i>He's changed ever since Bea came</i>
<i>into our lives.</i>

102
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,566
<i>Mom... He's calmed down.</i>

103
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,027
<i>He's found a purpose in life.</i>

104
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,031
<i>Mom, I hope you understand.</i>

105
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,657
<i>Please, don't tell him.</i>

106
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,244
<i>He lives for Bea.</i>

107
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,788
<i>You know that.</i>

108
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,707
<i>He's changed the moment</i>
<i>we had a child.</i>

109
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,839
<i>Oh.</i><i>Oh, Bea.</i>

110
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,759
<i>You know what? Dad is so tired,</i>

111
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,053
<i>but the moment I see you,</i>

112
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,097
<i>I forget about all the stress.</i>

113
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,848
<i>What? Yeah?</i>

114
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,517
<i>You like that?</i>

115
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,478
<i>Okay. There.</i>

116
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,562
<i>You want to open it?</i>

117
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,107
<i>Hm?</i>

118
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,734
<i>Mom, have you heard</i>
<i>the good news?</i>

119
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,277
<i>No. What is it?</i>

120
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,447
<i>I just got promoted</i>
<i>as Head of News at Cabrera.</i>

121
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,407
<i>Oh. Really?</i>

122
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,326
<i>Wow. Congratulations, dear.</i>

123
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,579
<i>I did so well that Dad had</i>
<i>no choice but to promote me.</i>

124
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,375
<i>You know what, Bea?</i>

125
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:01,963
<i>I think you're my lucky charm!</i>
<i>Hm?</i>

126
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,090
<i>I want my daughter</i>
<i>to be proud of me.</i>

127
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,388
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>how happy I am, Mom.</i>

128
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,849
<i>I think Bea</i>
<i>just completed my life.</i>

129
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:17,979
<i>- Oh!</i>

130
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,357
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

131
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,235
<i>Where did you get the child?</i>

132
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,488
<i>Ma'am Jacqueline,</i>
<i>it was just some...</i>

133
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,285
<i>Some random child</i>
<i>who needed help.</i>

134
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,621
<i>Claudia begged me for help.</i>
<i>I had no choice.</i>

135
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,707
<i>How dare you, Walter?</i>

136
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,251
<i>To do this without even</i>
<i>consulting us?</i>

137
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,588
<i>Who do you really work for?</i>
<i>Claudia or us?</i>

138
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,881
<i>Now, it's too late.</i>

139
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,010
<i>Ma'am Jacqueline, everyone lies.</i>

140
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:54,098
<i>This is just another lie</i>
<i>we have to live with. Okay?</i>

141
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,767
<i>You're just an employee, Walter.</i>

142
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,477
<i>Know your place.</i>

143
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,231
<i>The next time you do something</i>
<i>behind our backs,</i>

144
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,066
<i>you're going to regret it.</i>

145
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,403
By the time I found out,

146
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,071
it was too late!

147
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,783
Son, I couldn't bear
to break your heart.

148
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,160
Please, believe me.

149
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,663
That's the reason I kept mum

150
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,167
about what Claudia, Walter,
and your Dad did.

151
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,670
I didn't know that baby
was your sister--

152
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,382
Your silence makes you
an accomplice!

153
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:33,429
I blamed myself countless times
for my sister's disappearance,

154
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,139
only to find out you took her!

155
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,642
If you had only chosen
to tell the truth,

156
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,185
no lives would've been ruined!

157
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,811
We wouldn't be here right now!

158
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,939
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

159
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,565
"Sorry"?!

160
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,110
Your sorry won't undo
what you did to us!

161
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:53,824
You had all the chance
to come clean, but you didn't!

162
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,660
Why, huh?

163
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,828
Tell me!

164
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,081
We're all Walter's victims!

165
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,334
He toyed with us!

166
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,921
You still won't take the blame?

167
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,632
You're not innocent!

168
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,302
Well, I'm sorry

169
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,555
because I'll right
all of your wrongs!

170
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,932
I'll take Bea back.

171
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,559
And the moment I clear my name

172
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,646
from all the crimes
your pinned on my family,

173
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,484
I'll make you pay.
Mark my words!

174
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,778
I told you, didn't I?

175
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,863
You don't know me.

176
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,078
Vincent...

177
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,084
Vincent-- Vincent, please.

178
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,042
What are you doing?

179
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,419
You're supposed to take
one pill at a time.

180
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,588
I... I...

181
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,883
I just wanted to numb the pain.

182
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,052
Just for a while.

183
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,345
What do you mean?

184
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,764
I've lost my sons.

185
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,310
Now, I've lost
my granddaughter too!

186
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,778
What happened?

187
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,781
Vincent found out the truth
about Bea.

188
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,169
Do you have
other questions, dear?

189
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:15,466
Does that mean
I have two families now?

190
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,219
Aunt Stella is my sister?

191
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,392
Isn't that more fun, dear?

192
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,685
You've got two sisters...

193
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,812
And a brother.

194
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,147
And you have another mother.

195
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,359
But you're still
my daddy, right?

196
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,945
Of course, dear.

197
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,781
And Daddy loves you very much.

198
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,825
That will never change.

199
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:47,164
But Grandma and Grandpa said
Stella is a bad person.

200
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,332
Dear...

201
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,920
Stella isn't a bad person.

202
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,174
If that was true, Daddy wouldn't
have come with her.

203
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,051
And if she becomes bad,

204
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,012
Daddy will scold her.

205
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,435
So I hope you believe me
that Stella isn't bad, okay?

206
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,317
Stella?

207
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,905
Joy.

208
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,908
Joy.

209
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,125
I looked for you
for a long time.

210
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,586
I didn't know you were
right in front of me.

211
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,672
I never stopped
looking for you.

212
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,301
I hope you forgive me.

213
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,929
We will never be away
from each other again.

214
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,349
I love you so much.

215
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,075
Hi, Bea.

216
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,954
I'm your big sister, Katherine.

217
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,541
And I'm your big brother,
Joseph.

218
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,378
Katherine,

219
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,005
Joseph,

220
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,425
hello.

221
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,844
And dear...

222
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,308
That's your mom, Rebecca.

223
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,896
Hello, my daughter.

224
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,067
You're so big now.

225
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,196
We haven't seen each other
for a long time, right?

226
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,451
I know you don't know us.

227
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,495
But can I request something?

228
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,084
Can I get a hug?

229
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,920
And a kiss?

230
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,714
Is it okay?

231
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,818
Hello.

232
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,529
"Mama".

233
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,531
Mama.

234
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,332
Stella...

235
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,505
Thank you. Thank you so much.

236
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,059
I saw it on the news.

237
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,853
You two should be careful,

238
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:59,440
especially from Arthur's
scheme against you.

239
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,818
Stella, here. Take this.

240
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,196
This is yours.
Why are you giving it to me?

241
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:10,159
Because Mama and I
won't be with you.

242
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:14,163
Hug it whenever you miss us.

243
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,710
Thank you.

244
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,754
But...

245
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:25,591
what are you going to hug
if you give this to me?

246
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,636
I have Mama, Katherine,

247
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,387
and Joseph.

248
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,265
I will hug them instead.

249
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,270
Alright. I'll take this.

250
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,481
But once everything is okay,

251
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,566
I'll give it back to you.

252
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,735
Wait.

253
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,988
It has a hole.

254
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,115
Do you want me to fix it?

255
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:54,078
I thought Grandma
already fixed it.

256
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,412
It got ripped

257
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,790
when I went to see Mommy.

258
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,752
Your Grandma touched this?

259
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:05,714
Yes. And I think she
took something inside.

260
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,175
She took something?

261
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,886
Yes, from inside my toy.

262
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:13,263
But I don't know what it was.

263
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,308
She didn't tell me either.

264
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,830
I have a hunch that Mom
has Claudia's USB flash drive.

265
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,542
Do you think they still have it?

266
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,335
If my hunch is correct,

267
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,879
Mom hid it.

268
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,092
How will we get past
all those people inside?

269
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,771
Stella.

270
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,281
Come on, hurry.

271
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,509
Vincent.

272
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,763
This one is locked.

273
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,806
We need a key.

274
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,392
Wait, wait.

275
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,438
Turn on the generator.

276
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,856
- Hurry.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,902
What's going on outside?

278
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,029
Have you seen
any suspicious vehicles?

279
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,907
No, sir. We also called
the electric company.

280
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,159
<i>They said there's no scheduled</i>
<i>power interruption tonight.</i>

281
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,827
Besides, all the neighbors
have power.

282
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,457
- We need a key.
- Try this.

283
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,799
It's not working.

284
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,300
Vincent.

285
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,802
Wait.

286
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,264
- Did you see anyone outside?
- No, sir.

287
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,185
The sound came from that room.

288
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,735
That's it.

289
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,072
Someone's coming.

290
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,907
- Let's go, hurry.
- Take this.

291
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,229
Keep searching the area.
They probably haven't gone far.

292
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,318
Sir, we found out the cause
of the power interruption.

293
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,487
Someone cut the wire outside.

294
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,198
It was intentional.

295
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,286
Did you see who broke in?

296
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,496
- No, ma'am.
- Who else could it be?

297
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,747
That's a no-brainer.

298
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,916
Of course, it was Vincent.

299
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,378
I told you those bastards
were up to something.

300
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,338
Wanting to meet with him was
a grave mistake!

301
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,548
Get out, Bobby!

302
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,471
So what could their plan
possibly be?

303
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,516
They opened your trunk.

304
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,270
What could they have seen?

305
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,981
What were you hiding?

306
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,066
Arthur...

307
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,777
What could have gone missing?

308
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,613
What was hidden there,
Jacqueline?

309
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,492
The flash drive!

310
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,080
It contains the resort's
CCTV footage

311
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,082
from the night Walter died.

312
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,752
How could they have known
it was in there?

313
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:12,794
Believe me...

314
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,379
I don't know!

315
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,965
Why did you keep it?!

316
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,010
Was there ever truly
a need, Jacqueline?!

317
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,806
I had to do that!

318
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,059
To protect Vincent!

319
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,102
It's the last piece of evidence

320
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,771
that will prove his innocence!

321
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,731
Protect from what?!

322
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,608
From you!

323
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:43,283
A guarantee that
you wouldn't hurt him!

324
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,804
So what happens now?

325
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,057
Because of what you've done...

326
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,642
Tell me!

327
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,643
What happens now?

328
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,728
You've endangered all of us!

329
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,982
Do you understand, Jacqueline?!

330
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,365
Sir?

331
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,368
It's all over social media.

332
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,584
We've made a decision, Arthur.

333
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,003
We're leaving the company.

334
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,005
Effective immediately.

335
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,716
Leaving because of rumors?

336
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,801
You're unbelievable.

337
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,262
The evidence against you
is solid.

338
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,307
And we all think
enough is enough.

339
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,642
Every one of us
is certain there's only

340
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,728
one way this investigation ends.

341
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,688
With you behind bars!

342
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,107
And we are not staying

343
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,526
to watch you burn
the house down.

344
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,278
Then leave!

345
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,072
Get out!

346
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,698
Get out!

347
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,950
Leave me alone, all of you!

348
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,829
I built this empire
with my bare hands!

349
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:53,914
Get out!

350
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,167
Go away!

351
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,585
Leave!

352
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,925
<i>The crime that</i>
<i>they themselves committed</i>

353
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,969
<i>and continue to cover up</i>

354
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,640
<i>is the one they are blaming</i>
<i>not only on me</i>

355
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,809
<i>but also on Stella Morales.</i>

356
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,562
<i>Because they think</i>
<i>we can't fight back.</i>

357
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,781
Oh, fuck!

358
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,783
Fuck!

359
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,580
<i>Dad!</i>

360
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,916
Where have you been?
I've been trying to call you.

361
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,668
Dad, what happened?

362
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,211
You said everything
would be fine!

363
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,504
You said you would protect me!

364
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,005
That this would never come out!

365
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,133
Yes, everything is going
to be fine.

366
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,509
I'm here for you.

367
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,761
This is all Vincent's fault!

368
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,013
Dad...

369
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,725
I'd rather die
than end up in prison.

370
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,144
We're leaving.

371
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,812
We'll be out of here.
Remember that.

372
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,272
Everything is ready.

373
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,857
Everything will be alright.

374
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,900
- You promise?
<i>- Yes.</i>

375
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,986
It's all set.
All preparations are complete.

376
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,113
I'll send you the meeting place.

377
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,197
Leave. Now.

378
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,290
Just a moment.

379
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,209
I'll send Matthew
the meeting location.

380
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,586
What about Edward?

381
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,920
He's close to Vincent.

382
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,797
I don't know if I can trust him.

383
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,591
Our family is falling apart!

384
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,844
You promised me that
we'd fix this mess!

385
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,221
And we'll fix it.

386
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:37,058
You know what's really at stake
for us, for you, don't you?

387
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,227
Let me protect you.

388
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,362
What happened?

389
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,406
Looks like a car accident, sir.

390
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,074
Can't we just drive around it?

391
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,830
Hello.

392
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,873
Hello, Dad?

393
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,666
What's going on?

394
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,919
What's this video I'm seeing?

395
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,337
And they're saying
they have a warrant

396
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,130
against you, Mom, and Matthew?

397
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,842
Vincent staged the whole thing
to clean up Stella's image.

398
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,594
But none of us are guilty.

399
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,012
Where are you right now?

400
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,722
So you can tell Vincent?

401
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,224
Stella?

402
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,892
Or that little girlfriend
of yours?

403
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,018
Dad, no!

404
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,519
I'm worried about you.

405
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,065
We're leaving.

406
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,484
So you're all just running away?

407
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,903
And here I thought
you weren't guilty.

408
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,322
My priority right now is
to secure your mother,

409
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,574
and you know how fragile she is.

410
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,868
I'm doing this
to protect our family.

411
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,037
Edward, now it's your choice

412
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,539
whether to still be part
of this family or not.

413
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,166
Dad, please.

414
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,543
<i>Let me come with you.</i>

415
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,088
<i>I can't possibly leave Mom</i>
<i>on her own.</i>

416
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,804
Come on, Dad.

417
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,557
Where are you?

418
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,481
Vincent, we're here.

419
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,201
Mister!

420
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,577
Mister, I need help!

421
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,082
Can you help me for a bit?

422
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,585
What's the problem, sir?

423
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,337
Mister, you see...

424
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,881
My car broke down.
I have no idea why.

425
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,758
Can you check it out for me?

426
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,761
I'm Edward Cabrera,
one of Arthur Cabrera's sons.

427
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,221
I'm on the flight.

428
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,889
Did they leave already?

429
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,392
Chairman Cabrera hasn't
arrived yet, sir.

430
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,769
Could you please check it?
I think this is what's broken.

431
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,563
I don't know what happened.

432
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,696
Come on.

433
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,699
Come on...

434
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,555
Dad.

435
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,266
Vincent?

436
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,602
What are you doing here?

437
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,522
I came here to finish this.

438
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,149
It's time to surrender, Matthew.

439
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,109
How did you find this place?

440
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,861
Matthew, that's not
important anymore.

441
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,946
This will all end soon.

442
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,990
The truth will finally come out.

443
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,475
The truth?

444
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,643
Why?

445
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,478
What do you even know, Vincent?

446
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,605
Just who exactly
do you think you are?

447
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,317
I'm not going
to let you ruin this,

448
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,152
you fucking bastard!

449
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,576
Now... we're live.

450
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,870
I told you not to mix
tomato with chayote slices!

451
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,497
- Ma! Ma! Ma!
- Did you?

452
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,581
- Ma!
- What?

453
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,999
- What is it?
- It's Vincent...

454
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,167
What's going on this time?

455
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,378
Oh my.

456
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,171
It is Vincent.

457
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,301
Sir, take a look at this.

458
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,515
Find out where they are.

459
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,183
Yes, sir.

460
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,687
You think you can escape the
consequences just like that?

461
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,480
Matthew, tell me the truth!

462
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,399
Did Dad kill Walter?

463
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,817
You think...

464
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,735
Dad killed Walter?

465
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,613
You don't have to keep lying
for him, Matthew.

466
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,366
I've seen how he makes you
his own puppet!

467
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,161
You think I'm just his
brainless idiot?!

468
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,205
Did you seriously think
I'm that weak?

469
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,248
No.

470
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:13,126
I'm saying all this
because I understand.

471
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,502
You and I are the same.

472
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:18,089
You and me...
We've both been victims of Dad.

473
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,383
Stella! You have to see this.

474
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,344
- Vincent?
- Huh?

475
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,305
E-Excuse me.
I have to go, Ma.

476
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,431
Stella!

477
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,515
Why? What's going on?

478
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,850
- Ma...
- Let me see.

479
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,354
Victim?!

480
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:39,569
Victim?!

481
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:43,781
He trusted and respected you
more than me!

482
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,992
You're all the same!

483
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,912
You all think
I'm good for nothing!

484
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:54,626
But only I knew
about everything Walter did.

485
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,212
The way he blackmailed
Mommy and Daddy

486
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,298
and how he ruined our family!

487
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,634
<i>Are you high?</i>

488
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,682
<i>Is it painful?</i>

489
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,600
<i>Come with me.</i>

490
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:13,228
<i>I have some rare whiskey</i>
<i>in my villa.</i>

491
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,647
<i>It'll definitely numb the pain.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

492
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,067
Only I, Mighty Matthew,

493
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,861
dared to do something

494
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,531
to stop that motherfucker!

495
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:29,911
<i>I don't even know why Dad</i>
<i>chose you to be CEO.</i>

496
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,621
<i>Well, let's just say that...</i>

497
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,750
<i>they bought...</i>

498
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,295
<i>...my silence.</i>

499
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,588
<i>What?</i>

500
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,050
<i>Hey, what do you mean?</i>

501
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,718
<i>Look, Matthew...</i>

502
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,972
<i>Now that I'm CEO,</i>

503
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,517
<i>there will be many changes.</i>

504
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,394
<i>The boat is sinking, alright?</i>

505
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:57,188
<i>You should just</i>
<i>get this over with.</i>

506
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,692
<i>Just tell your father the truth</i>

507
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,112
<i>about how you've been stealing</i>
<i>from the company</i>

508
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,489
<i>because you got addicted</i>
<i>to gambling.</i>

509
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,117
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

510
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,494
<i>He's going to disown me!</i>

511
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,413
<i>I'm sure he'll help you out.</i>

512
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,000
<i>Come on. Your father's used</i>
<i>to cleaning after your mess.</i>

513
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,752
<i>I'm sure he's going</i>
<i>to forgive you.</i>

514
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,463
<i>Let's say I do that.</i>

515
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:27,427
<i>You'll also get</i>
<i>kicked out of CGC.</i>

516
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,761
<i>What?</i>

517
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,138
<i>Matthew...</i>

518
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,100
<i>I'm clean.</i>

519
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,437
<i>Do you honestly think that</i>
<i>when I agreed to do this...</i>

520
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,357
<i>I didn't protect myself?</i>

521
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,819
<i>If they check the account</i>
<i>of Cabrera Land,</i>

522
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,032
<i>only your name would appear</i>
<i>amongst the transactions.</i>

523
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,620
<i>Shit!</i>

524
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,581
<i>What do I do?</i>

525
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,249
<i>You're gonna figure it out.</i>

526
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,584
<i>Come on.</i>

527
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,211
<i>And your father</i>
<i>will not abandon you.</i>

528
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,713
<i>I mean, that's your...</i>

529
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,381
<i>your privilege...</i>

530
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,009
<i>...as a Cabrera.</i>

531
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,512
<i>A privilege Vincent and I</i>
<i>don't have.</i>

532
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,848
<i>Matthew...</i>

533
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,102
<i>it's time to grow up, okay?</i>

534
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,981
<i>It's time to face the music.</i>

535
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,778
I'm the only useful one

536
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,905
among us brothers.

537
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:32,659
Only I had the guts
to stop Walter!

538
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,743
None of you tried!

539
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,537
You killed Walter?

540
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,914
Yes!

541
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,540
But shh!

542
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:17,245
<i>Hey.</i>

543
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,289
<i>One last drink?</i>

544
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,127
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

545
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,844
<i>Cheers.</i>

546
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,226
<i>Ahh.</i>

547
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,653
<i>Ahh...</i>

548
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,567
And you know
what the best part is?

549
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,278
No one else
will find out the truth.

550
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,491
Except for the two of us.

551
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:43,289
Tell Walter I said what's up

552
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,500
when you see him in hell!

553
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,336
You couldn't have
done this alone, Matthew.

554
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,630
Mom and Dad were always there
to bail you out!

555
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,757
Your whole life,
you depended on them.

556
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,469
That's what everyone saw
on the CCTV footage!

557
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:59,472
Shut up! Shut up!

558
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,061
Matthew, what happened
that night?

559
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,063
Tell me.

560
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,650
Come on. I know you're
dying to tell me.

561
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,573
What's that?

562
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,158
Are you filming me?!

563
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:22,078
You fucking bastard!

564
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,748
Can we fix it?

565
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,876
Looks like no one's
watching the gate.

566
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,170
- Let me open it.
- No, don't bother.

567
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,505
It's about to be over.

568
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:39,011
You can go, Bobby.
Lie low for now.

569
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,681
Yes, sir.

570
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,018
I'll need someone
to push the car.

571
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,275
You don't know anything
about cars either?

572
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,359
Edward?

573
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,069
Dad?

574
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,612
What are you doing here?

575
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,448
Let's go.

576
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,534
- Come on.
- Dad...

577
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,827
You can't go.

578
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,120
What do you mean?

579
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,956
Edward, let's go.

580
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,165
Is...

581
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,417
Is Vincent here?

582
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,919
Matthew...

583
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,046
Call the other guards.

584
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,924
Dad!

585
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,385
- Alpha, alpha--
- Hey!

586
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,387
Stop!

587
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,483
Argh!

588
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,704
Ahh!

589
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:47,747
Argh!

590
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,795
Stop it, Matthew!

591
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,506
Everyone knows
you killed Walter.

592
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,437
- Matthew!
- Ah!

593
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,325
Matthew, enough!

594
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,370
- Argh!
- Stop it!

595
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:37,588
Matthew...

596
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,798
Please stop this.

597
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,682
By the end of this day,

598
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,810
I won't be the only murderer
between us.

599
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,689
You'll have my blood
on your hands, Vincent!

600
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,315
Ah!

601
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,075
No! Matthew!

602
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,349
Stella!

603
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,351
Vincent is inside!

604
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,554
Vincent!

605
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:26,947
Stella!

606
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,867
Stella!

607
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,039
Dad!

608
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:36,624
Stop this!

609
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,584
Please, Dad!

610
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,003
You killed my son!

611
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,090
Believe it or not,
I tried to save Matthew.

612
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,092
Liar!

613
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,219
Until when are you going
to blame me

614
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,304
for the web of crimes
you started?!

615
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:53,682
You treated your family
like slaves

616
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,643
all for your desire for power!

617
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,478
Power?

618
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,275
I did everything
for this family!

619
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,152
Even for you!

620
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,445
Arthur, no!

621
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,031
Please! Enough!

622
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:13,119
When will you stop?!
When all of us are dead?!

623
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,540
If there's anyone to blame,
that's me, Vincent!

624
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,378
This is all my fault.

625
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,004
<i>- I...</i>
<i>- Matthew, son?</i>

626
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,297
<i>- - Remember the--</i>
<i>- Ugh.</i>

627
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,632
<i>Oh my god!</i>

628
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,468
<i>What happened here?!</i>

629
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,303
<i>I don't know!</i>

630
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,222
<i>We were just drinking when...</i>

631
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,683
<i>Walter passed out.</i>

632
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,809
<i>I don't know!</i>

633
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,061
<i>This doesn't look good!</i>

634
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,604
<i>We need to call for help.</i>

635
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,314
<i>No, Ma! Ma, no, no, no!</i>

636
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,859
<i>- Ah!</i>
<i>- Please! Please don't.</i>

637
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,110
<i>Why not?</i>

638
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,862
<i>I don't want to end up in jail.</i>

639
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,738
<i>You did this to Walter?</i>

640
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,659
<i>Why?!</i>

641
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,327
<i>- I...</i>
<i>- Why, Matthew?!</i>

642
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,205
<i>- He was blackmailing me!</i>
<i>- About what?!</i>

643
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,875
<i>About my stealing money</i>
<i>from the company!</i>

644
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:04,128
<i>- What? My god!</i>
<i>- Ma... Ma, please.</i>

645
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,338
<i>No one else must know</i>
<i>about this.</i>

646
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,798
<i>Help me.</i>

647
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,467
<i>I... Wait, Ma--</i>

648
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,511
<i>- No, no, no!</i>
<i>- Ma, Ma, Ma!</i>

649
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,388
<i>Let's bring him</i>
<i>to his villa.</i>

650
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:17,391
<i>Please help me! I don't want</i>
<i>to get arrested! Please!</i>

651
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:19,894
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to be imprisoned, Ma! No!</i>

652
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,437
<i>- Help me!</i>
<i>- Matthew!</i>

653
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,355
<i>Just this once!</i>
<i>Please, Ma!</i>

654
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,900
<i>- No!</i>
<i>- </i><i>Please!</i>

655
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,985
<i>- No...</i>
<i>- Ma, please!</i>

656
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,403
<i>Please!</i>

657
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,731
<i>What happened here?</i>

658
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,609
<i>I don't know. I don't know!</i>

659
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:12,446
<i>Well? Is he still alive?</i>

660
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,074
<i>Is he?</i>

661
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,124
<i>Oh, shit. Shit, shit--</i>

662
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,918
<i>- Holy shit!</i>

663
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,086
<i>What the--</i>

664
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,384
<i>- Hello?</i>

665
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,385
<i>Hello...</i>

666
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,845
<i>- Hello? We need help.</i>
<i>- Ma...</i>

667
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:38,430
<i>- Ma!</i>
<i>- Hello?</i>

668
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,807
<i>What are you doing?! Ma!</i>

669
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,935
<i>- Ma, no!</i>
<i>- We're here at Walter's villa.</i>

670
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,061
<i>Ma!</i>

671
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,147
<i>Go ahead, Ma!</i>
<i>Call for help!</i>

672
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,983
<i>Stop this, Ma!</i>
<i>Stop this!</i>

673
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,277
<i>Put the phone down, Ma!</i>

674
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,570
<i>- We can still fix this!</i>
<i>- Put it down!</i>

675
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:59,243
<i>Between me and Walter, only one</i>
<i>shall survive tonight.</i>

676
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,787
<i>If he makes it out alive,</i>

677
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,123
<i>I'm going to kill myself!</i>

678
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,541
<i>I swear.</i>

679
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:09,128
<i>- No, Matthew...</i>
<i>- No, I'd rather die</i>

680
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,754
<i>than end up in jail!</i>

681
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,757
<i>- We can still fix this!</i>
<i>- You have to make it stop!</i>

682
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,677
<i>Ma, make it stop! Please!</i>

683
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,679
<i>Make it stop!</i>

684
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,017
<i>Make it go away!</i>

685
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,144
<i>Son...</i>

686
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,603
<i>Son, stop this.</i>

687
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,989
<i>- Bobby?</i>
<i>- Ma'am.</i>

688
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,534
<i>What happened to Sir Walter?</i>

689
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:41,744
<i>He's still alive!</i>

690
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,455
<i>- I'll call for help!</i>
<i>- No! You're not doing that!</i>

691
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,459
<i>You didn't see anything!</i>

692
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,294
<i>You didn't hear anything.</i>

693
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,549
<i>Call Arthur. Now.</i>

694
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,180
I let Walter die.

695
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,725
I insisted on covering up
his death.

696
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,603
Your father just did
what I wanted.

697
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,455
<i>If you were going to get</i>
<i>your hands dirty,</i>

698
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,166
<i>you should've done it right,</i>
<i>you stupid fool!</i>

699
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,752
<i>- Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!</i>

700
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,380
<i>- Stupid!</i>

701
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,256
<i>I got scared, Dad.</i>

702
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,967
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

703
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,969
<i>You never did anything right!</i>

704
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,097
<i>Do I have to watch</i>
<i>your every move</i>

705
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,558
<i>to make sure you won't</i>
<i>make a mistake?!</i>

706
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,320
<i>Matthew.</i>

707
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,324
<i>We have to clean up</i>
<i>your room.</i>

708
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,787
<i>No one should know</i>
<i>that Walter was there.</i>

709
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,211
<i>Fix this mess, Arthur.</i>

710
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,429
<i>Hello? I need your help.</i>

711
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,139
<i>I have a favor to ask.</i>

712
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,850
I'm sorry.

713
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,227
I'm really sorry
for everything.

714
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,311
I know that...

715
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,441
I had the chance to make things
right, but I didn't do it.

716
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:39,486
Because as a mother,
I had to protect Matthew

717
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,904
and this family.

718
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,282
I thought I had no choice.

719
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,995
I'm really sorry.
Please forgive me.

720
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,289
Please.

721
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:53,876
It's not your love that you
made us feel.

722
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:58,547
You and Dad forced what you
want on us siblings.

723
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,548
Arthur.

724
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:00,841
Arthur, please.

725
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,092
Please don't.

726
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,510
Please listen to me.

727
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,804
You don't understand!

728
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:14,146
Vincent doesn't understand
that if I don't stop him,

729
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,815
I'm going to lose
you again.

730
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,901
Wait. Listen to me.

731
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,862
Please listen to me.

732
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,323
All my life,
I've always listened to you,

733
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:27,910
even if it hurts me and
we're hurting other people

734
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,536
because I love you.

735
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,664
I love you so much, and I know
that you love me too.

736
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,666
But don't you see it?

737
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,127
That love ruined
all of us!

738
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,213
- That's not true!
- Aah!

739
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,719
That's not true.

740
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:49,431
I gave up all my principles
and sold my soul...

741
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,852
to have everything
I have now.

742
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:57,064
To keep everything
I've worked hard for.

743
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,483
But because of you,

744
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,069
I lost everything
that's mine!

745
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,446
I didn't take away
anything from you, Dad.

746
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,451
You're the one
who sold your soul

747
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,412
for wealth and fame.

748
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:18,043
Rebecca, Walter, Matthew,
Claudia, Stella...

749
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:21,088
We were all victims
of your greediness, Dad.

750
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,465
No, I'm not greedy, Vincent.

751
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,885
I deserve everything
I've earned.

752
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,307
Because I have proven
I can.

753
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:37,604
And I did what I did
because I had to.

754
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:39,773
That's enough, Dad.

755
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:45,112
You have to face the
consequences of what you did.

756
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,113
It's over.

757
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,661
Why don't we try to fix
what we have ruined?

758
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,663
So that's it, huh?!

759
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,749
You took my son!

760
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:04,006
You took everything
from me!

761
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,968
Damn you, Vincent!

762
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:09,803
Arthur.

763
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,932
Please let's end this cycle
of hatred and pain.

764
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,978
Let's end it
with Matthew's death.

765
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,062
Yeah.

766
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,941
I'll end this.

767
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,320
I'll end this now.

768
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:28,864
Dad.

769
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,080
Aah! That's enough!

770
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,708
Vincent!

771
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,793
- Stop it!
- That's enough!

772
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,008
Please stop.

773
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,305
- Aah!
- Ugh!

774
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:55,307
Vincent!

775
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,186
Stop it! That's enough!

776
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,397
Vincent!

777
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,985
Stop it! That's enough!
Please stop it, you two!

778
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:13,200
That's enough! Stop it!

779
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,328
Vincent!

780
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,746
- Aah!
- Stop it!

781
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,878
This all happened because
of your mom's stupidity.

782
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,839
- You're both stupid!
- Aah!

783
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:28,924
Stella.

784
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,552
- Vincent.
- No, not me.

785
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,846
Get him. He's the criminal.

786
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,181
Mr. Cabrera.

787
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,183
- These are--
- We saw and heard everything.

788
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,019
He's the criminal.

789
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,997
That's enough,
Mr. Cabrera.

790
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,171
- Stella!
- Say goodbye!

791
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,113
Stella, are you okay?

792
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,367
Yeah, I'm okay.

793
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,133
Vincent.

794
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,891
Vincent. Vincent.

795
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,685
Vincent, wait. Hold on.
Wait.

796
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,021
Vincent. Vincent.

797
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,356
Vincent. Vincent, don't die.

798
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,358
Vincent.

799
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,443
Vincent.

800
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,946
Don't forget
our agreement.

801
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,034
Fulfill your dreams.

802
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,705
"Our dreams."

803
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,875
It's our dream, remember?
We talked about that.

804
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:31,254
We made a deal that we won't
give up, remember?

805
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,839
Vincent.

806
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,718
I'd be happy, Stella...

807
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:42,974
if you'd fulfill
our dreams.

808
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,687
Vincent.

809
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,481
I love you so much.

810
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,317
I love you so much too.

811
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,778
I love you so much.

812
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,488
Vincent.

813
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,511
Vincent.

814
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:25,225
Vincent.

815
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,172
What... What's going on?

816
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,467
Why can't I move?

817
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,805
Why can't I move?!

818
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,391
Is anyone here?

819
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,767
Doc!

820
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,477
Where are my doctors?!

821
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,856
Mr. Cabrera,
according to your doctors,

822
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:15,317
- your spine got damaged...
- Help me!

823
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,861
when you got shot
in the back.

824
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,197
You're paralyzed
from the neck down.

825
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,283
You won't be able
to walk again.

826
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,951
Call my lawyer!

827
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,411
Get me out of here!

828
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:30,040
This is illegal detention!
I need my lawyers! I can't--

829
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:33,293
I'm here to make sure you'll
face the charges against you.

830
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,086
What are you talking about?

831
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,423
I need my lawyers!
I need my lawyers!

832
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:41,009
My lawyers will answer the
questions for me.

833
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,511
Help me. Get me out of here.

834
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,263
Take me to my wife.

835
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,016
Jacqueline.

836
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:52,896
Jacqueline.

837
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,732
Jacqueline!

838
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:00,654
Help me! Jacqueline,
please come here!

839
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,364
Take me to my wife.

840
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,409
Jacqueline,
please come here!

841
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,544
Thank you for your
condolences.

842
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,842
If Vincent were here,

843
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,054
he wouldn't want
to see us grieve for him.

844
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,518
He'd rather have us
remember...

845
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:36,064
all the lessons
he learned in life.

846
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,486
Because for him...

847
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,907
truth is the most important
thing of all.

848
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:49,494
The truth is, we started
as a lie.

849
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,500
We had to save
each other...

850
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:59,421
so we resorted
to wrong ways.

851
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:05,010
And while we were living
in those lies,

852
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:07,303
we got to know
each other more.

853
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,015
<i>And along the way...</i>

854
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,727
<i>the truth started</i>
<i>to come out.</i>

855
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,439
<i>We almost gave up</i>
<i>several times.</i>

856
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,735
<i>But love prevailed.</i>

857
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:28,658
<i>We kept hoping that the truth</i>
<i>will come out someday.</i>

858
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,955
<i>That we'll be free</i>
<i>from all the lies...</i>

859
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,834
<i>and start a new life.</i>

860
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:41,880
And most of all...

861
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:51,347
Vincent showed how he
can love genuinely.

862
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,106
He accepted me
wholeheartedly

863
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,818
despite my weaknesses
and shortcomings.

864
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:09,657
Despite the kind of woman
I am.

865
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,706
Vincent, thank you.

866
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,458
Thank you.

867
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,422
I love you so much.

868
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,550
Rest now,
my love.

869
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,585
Rest now, my love.

870
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,586
Vincent.

871
00:58:28,504 --> 00:58:30,465
I fulfilled my dream.

872
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,180
I'm a graduate now.

873
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:14,634
<i>Thoughts kept running</i>
<i>in my head.</i>

874
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:15,927
<i>Why do--</i>

875
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,231
<i>Claudia, not in front of Bea.</i>

876
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,775
<i>Is she joining</i>
<i>for Sunday dinner?</i>

877
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:33,987
<i>They don't know</i>
<i>where they're going.</i>

878
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,614
<i>- Are those your friends?</i>
<i>- Huh?</i>

879
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,116
<i>They're probably members</i>
<i>of the press.</i>

880
00:59:40,576 --> 00:59:41,619
<i>I'll go back inside.</i>

881
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,746
<i>Sorry.</i>

882
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,793
<i>- Uh... Wait.</i>
<i>- Wait.</i>

883
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,295
<i>Um... Why?</i>

884
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,048
<i>- You're laughing.</i>

885
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,633
<i>- Cut!</i>
<i>- I'm wearing lipstick.</i>
