1
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,373
<i>I officially name the new CEO</i>
<i>of Cabrera News,</i>

2
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,083
<i>Walter Cunanan!</i>

3
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,962
<i>So, you wanted Walter to be</i>
<i>the CEO all this time.</i>

4
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,714
<i>After all that I did?</i>

5
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,424
<i>Just accept that Walter</i>

6
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,176
<i>is a better choice than you!</i>

7
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,595
<i>Most of the time,</i>
<i>the lie we tell ourselves</i>

8
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,555
<i>is the lie</i>
<i>that hurts us the most.</i>

9
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,141
<i>I use the money I earn here</i>
<i>on important things.</i>

10
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,101
<i>Because I won't</i>
<i>work here forever!</i>

11
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,061
<i>If you find a man</i>

12
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,938
<i>who will truly love you</i>

13
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,149
<i>and will get you</i>
<i>out of this place!</i>

14
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,860
<i>Where were you the night</i>
<i>Walter Cunanan died?</i>

15
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,112
<i>Are you saying I have something</i>
<i>to do with Walter's death?</i>

16
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,239
<i>I didn't kill him!</i>

17
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,574
<i>Are you looking for trouble?</i>

18
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,409
<i>I need you. I can pay you.</i>

19
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,869
<i>One million.</i>

20
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,625
One million?!

21
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,001
Wow!

22
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,169
If I have a million,

23
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,296
I'll open a mini grocery.

24
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,006
And I'll resign from this job.

25
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,925
Oh, if I have that kind
of money,

26
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,676
I will travel to Boracay,

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,804
Palawan, Batanes, Iloilo,

28
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,847
and I'll swim
with the whale sharks!

29
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,265
You won't bring us with you?

30
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,309
Of course, I will!

31
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,353
- I can't come.
- Why?

32
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,022
I'm managing
my new grocery store, remember?

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,900
So, will you take his offer?

34
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,528
No.

35
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,280
Hey, we're talking
about a million.

36
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,783
One million, oh please.
I'm not a fool!

37
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,869
What person in their right mind
would give a million so easily?

38
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,162
Who? Tell me.

39
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,748
I don't trust people like him.

40
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,125
I don't know
what's going through his mind.

41
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,711
- He looks rich.
- He's cute and charming, too.

42
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,631
Exactly. That's the type
of people who trick others.

43
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,383
What if he abducts and kills me?

44
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,510
What will happen to my siblings?

45
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,762
Fair enough.
He might be a weirdo.

46
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,056
I'm willing to get scammed

47
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,850
by someone as handsome as him.

48
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,476
Can I see his calling card?

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,644
Let me see.

50
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,398
Look, he works
in Cabrera News.

51
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,441
Maybe he just wants
to interview you.

52
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,569
This is why you two
get scammed often.

53
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,320
This can be easily made.

54
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,406
I can make one for you
if you want.

55
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,909
He was wrong for thinking
that he could fool me.

56
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,164
Where's the trash bin?

57
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,171
Why aren't you answering
the police officer's questions?

58
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,384
I know what you did there.

59
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,845
I have eyes everywhere.

60
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,931
I didn't do anything wrong.

61
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,057
They're mad at me.

62
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,934
They're going to twist
anything I say.

63
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,520
Then why are you acting
like you're hiding something?

64
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,025
What do you know
about Walter's death?

65
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,028
Nothing.

66
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,698
You don't even have to ask.

67
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,993
Cabrera News
is on the line, Vincent.

68
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,246
No one is indispensable

69
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,206
in the Cabrera Group
of Companies,

70
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,042
not even my children.

71
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,923
Weren't you the one
who raised me?

72
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,508
Shouldn't you know
the answer to that?

73
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,719
A desperate man can do anything.

74
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,430
You can call me desperate.

75
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,934
But I'm not evil.

76
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,852
Then fix it.

77
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,021
Prove me wrong
because if you can't,

78
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,440
Cabrera News isn't
the only thing you'd be losing,

79
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,150
but also your family.

80
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:58,196
I won't let the Cabrera name
be ruined just because of this.

81
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,495
Argh!

82
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,665
Man.

83
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,502
Your awards.

84
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,171
They're shattered.

85
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,846
Man.

86
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,099
Why are you acting this way?

87
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,309
I'm just trying to get things
off my chest.

88
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,854
Looks like you've done
a pretty good job at it.

89
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,778
I need to clear my name, George.

90
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,071
Hold on.

91
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,073
Is this because of Walter?

92
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,367
Just let the cops do their job.

93
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,078
Sooner or later,
the truth will come out.

94
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,746
That's the problem, George.

95
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,540
I feel like the cops
will implicate me

96
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,835
because of the video
of me and Walter fighting.

97
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:54,919
And so?

98
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,882
You only need
to prove one thing, right?

99
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,097
You weren't at the crime scene
when the incident occurred.

100
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,433
Then you're off the hook.

101
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,699
Ms. Morales, we already managed
your brother's asthma.

102
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,493
But while
we were monitoring him,

103
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,746
we conducted a few tests.

104
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,040
We discovered a new condition.

105
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,459
He has
a ventricular septal defect

106
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,044
or VSD.

107
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,087
What's VSD?

108
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,922
He has a hole in the heart.

109
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,637
People with VSD
are prone to asthma.

110
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,473
His symptoms came out late,

111
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,433
that's why
it wasn't detected right away.

112
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,477
He needs immediate surgery.

113
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,983
Surgery?

114
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:04,238
How much money
will the surgery cost?

115
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,283
More or less
half a million pesos.

116
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,953
Half a million pesos?

117
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,456
Half a million pesos,
half a million pesos.

118
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,241
Sir, come in.

119
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,460
That's all of it?

120
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,129
A typhoon just passed, sir.

121
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,422
A lot of CCTVs malfunctioned.

122
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,759
So the CCTV around
Walter's villa wasn't working?

123
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,223
Did you see anyone...

124
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,517
he was with after the event?

125
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,353
Sir, there were a lot of people
that night.

126
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,523
Aside from the day of the event,

127
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,024
did you see Walter around?

128
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,318
Oh yes, sir. I almost forgot.

129
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,529
He was here
during the food tasting.

130
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,614
Do you have footage of it?
Can I see?

131
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,244
Here, sir.

132
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,975
<i>Hello?</i>

133
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,476
Sir Ricardo.

134
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,895
There's something
you need to know.

135
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,055
Stella...

136
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,640
Stella, I'm scared.

137
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,978
What if what happened before
happens again?

138
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,399
I don't want
to lose another sibling again.

139
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,110
Katherine,

140
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,613
I want you to keep this in mind.

141
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,865
That's not
going to happen again.

142
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,909
That'll not happen again.

143
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,250
<i>Do you understand these rights?</i>

144
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,713
<i>Wait! The drugs</i>
<i>aren't mine! I don't use drugs!</i>

145
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,215
<i>Just come to the station.</i>

146
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,258
<i>I don't know who owns them!</i>
<i>Those aren't mine!</i>

147
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,220
<i>I'm begging you!</i>
<i>Why are you taking me?!</i>

148
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,763
<i>Auntie Linda!</i>

149
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,473
<i>Please take care of Joy!</i>

150
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,851
<i>I'll fix this!</i>

151
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,854
<i>- Stella!</i>

152
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,399
<i>Stella!</i>

153
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,318
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>I'll get out of here soon.</i>

154
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,736
<i>Just wait a little more.</i>

155
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,282
<i>We'll be together again</i>
<i>and we'll never be separated.</i>

156
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,492
<i>I'll find a way.</i>

157
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:45,079
<i>I'll not do to you</i>
<i>what Ma did to us.</i>

158
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,207
<i>Where's Joy?</i>

159
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,792
<i>How is Joy, Katherine?</i>

160
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,795
<i>Does she still have milk?</i>

161
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,965
<i>What is it?</i>

162
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,050
<i>Stella...</i>

163
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,468
<i>sorry.</i>

164
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,887
<i>Joy is missing.</i>

165
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:06,142
<i>Auntie Linda</i>
<i>didn't know what happened.</i>

166
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,686
<i>She said she left her</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

167
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,815
<i>Stella, Joy was gone.</i>

168
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,818
<i>We've looked for her everywhere.</i>

169
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,000
Stella, the bar is still closed!

170
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,170
Stella, I know there's cash
in trash but--

171
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,296
There's none there!

172
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,755
What are you looking for?

173
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,090
The calling card.

174
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,300
It's Vincent Cabrera's.

175
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,636
The one I threw away.
Then I put a gum in it!

176
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,055
I know! But I thought
you didn't trust him?

177
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,141
What brought you here?

178
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,269
I just have a few questions
to ask.

179
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,565
So you and Walter were close?

180
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,568
I almost forgot.

181
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,111
The food tasting at the resort.

182
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,030
A few days before Walter died.

183
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,037
Yeah. Uh...

184
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,955
we were together that night.

185
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,749
We organized Dad's birthday.

186
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,668
F-Food tasting.

187
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,128
He fed you?

188
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,380
Oh, we were just messing around.

189
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,593
We needed to taste
a lot of food so, uh...

190
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,928
and we were all friends.

191
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,429
Is that bad?

192
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,516
Not really.
But in the investigation,

193
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,351
it showed
that you really were close.

194
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,521
He was the best man
at your wedding.

195
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,564
A godfather at the christening.

196
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,941
Am I right?

197
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,901
Yes.

198
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,445
That's why what happened
to him is really hard for us.

199
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,948
Is this familiar to you?

200
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,952
This was on the crime scene.

201
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,496
At Walter's villa.

202
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,208
There's a letter C
inscribed on it.

203
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,001
Any idea who owns this?

204
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,090
Uh, please come in, Sir Zamora.

205
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,635
Yes.

206
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,303
Uh, that's mine.

207
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,138
I didn't see
the picture clearly.

208
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,266
The picture is blurry.

209
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,893
How did this get into
Walter's villa?

210
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,271
Maybe it fell when I went there.

211
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,940
You went to Walter's villa
that night?

212
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,568
To apologize for what happened
to him and Vincent.

213
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,903
You know what happened
with those two, right?

214
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,780
They got into a fight
at Dad's birthday.

215
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,657
We've seen the video.

216
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,451
Maybe that's when my ring fell.

217
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,036
It has gotten loose.

218
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,832
You know, I've been losing
so much weight from stress.

219
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,042
Around what time was that?

220
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,211
Uh, maybe....

221
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,671
Maybe around 10PM?

222
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,590
Where were you
around 12 midnight?

223
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,966
Bea and I were heading home.

224
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,635
Just the two of you?
You weren't with Vincent?

225
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,762
Vincent said
he had to do a coverage.

226
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,223
We talked to his staff.

227
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,267
They said no one followed him.

228
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,227
Really?

229
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,395
I didn't know that.

230
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,607
Excuse me, ma'am.

231
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,778
Yes, hello.

232
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,781
Sir, the forensic report is out.

233
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,909
There are fingerprints
all over Walter's villa.

234
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,704
One of them
matches Claudia Cabrera's.

235
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,373
The other one matches
Vincent Cabrera's.

236
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,048
Okay.

237
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,132
Thank you.

238
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,721
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

239
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,931
Just a few more questions.

240
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:38,145
Did Vincent have any more
resentment towards Walter?

241
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,611
Actually, sir...

242
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,571
I don't know
how to say this to you.

243
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,867
But Vincent gets jealous
of Walter.

244
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,995
Is there something
he has to be jealous of?

245
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,708
He thinks

246
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,461
Walter likes me, but Walter
and I were just friends.

247
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,464
I don't know what's happening
to Vincent.

248
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,801
But maybe he's...

249
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,552
he's...

250
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,513
pressured with the Cabrera News.

251
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:14,932
Sir...

252
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,227
There's something
you need to see.

253
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,776
Sir, this is what Vincent
was wearing that night.

254
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,494
How well do you know your wife?

255
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,748
She's my wife.

256
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,375
Of course, I know her very well.

257
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,713
So you were aware that they were
together at the resort?

258
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:51,009
They even organized
your dad's birthday. Right?

259
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:54,346
She didn't need to tell me
because I trust her.

260
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,889
You trust her.

261
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:07,401
Food tasting. Take a look.
They look so sweet. See that?

262
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:11,572
If I didn't know them,
I'd assume they're newlyweds.

263
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,241
Honeymooners.

264
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,244
This stays between us.

265
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,038
Do you get jealous?

266
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,249
Because it seemed like...

267
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,418
there was something more.
The way they held each other.

268
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,794
T-That is--

269
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,965
There's no malice in that.

270
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,427
We were close friends.

271
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,764
I was also fed by Walter
in the past.

272
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:46,023
We got that from Walter's villa.

273
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,150
Your wife's ring.

274
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,783
Did you know that your wife
went to Walter's villa?

275
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,287
No.

276
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,455
No?

277
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,042
Really? You didn't know?

278
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,964
What if your wife
has been cheating on you

279
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,549
and you still have no idea?

280
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,344
What if your wife
has been cheating on you?!

281
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,513
Would you have any idea?!

282
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,514
Sir.

283
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,557
There's a woman outside
looking for you.

284
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,101
Who is it?

285
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,069
She'll corroborate
Vincent's alibi.

286
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,065
<i>Let's get this over with.</i>

287
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,439
<i>That's not what I need.</i>

288
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,565
<i>What?</i>

289
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,282
<i>Memorize all of this.</i>

290
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,828
<i>Memorize-- What's that?</i>

291
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,830
<i>I need to clear my name.</i>

292
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,584
<i>I'm a suspect in a murder case.</i>

293
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,127
<i>You need to tell the cops</i>

294
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,296
<i>that we were together</i>
<i>the whole night.</i>

295
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,131
<i>I need you to be my alibi.</i>

296
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:19,009
<i>Don't drag me into your mess.</i>

297
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,303
<i>- I'm innocent.</i>
<i>- I don't care!</i>

298
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,846
<i>I've been in jail!</i>

299
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,556
<i>I know how these cops operate.</i>

300
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,392
<i>They only believe in things</i>
<i>they want to believe.</i>

301
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,437
<i>I can't go back in there.</i>
<i>I have siblings to take care of.</i>

302
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,522
<i>And I wouldn't do it for you!</i>

303
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,319
<i>What makes this different</i>
<i>from what you're doing?</i>

304
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,614
<i>You also tell your customers</i>
<i>what they want to hear.</i>

305
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,199
<i>You're used to lying.</i>

306
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,118
<i>Yes. I lie to survive.</i>

307
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,329
<i>Not to cover</i>
<i>someone's wrongdoing.</i>

308
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,164
<i>There's a huge difference!</i>
<i>Hope you know that!</i>

309
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:50,832
<i>You're not going to lie.</i>

310
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,210
<i>As a matter of fact,</i>
<i>you'll tell the truth.</i>

311
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,588
<i>You were with me that night.</i>

312
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,428
<i>One million pesos is pretty big.</i>

313
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,975
<i>You'll say no it?</i>

314
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:24,408
Were you with Vincent Cabrera
the night Walter Cunanan died?

315
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,160
And how did you know
Mr. Cabrera?

316
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,413
He's my customer
at a bar where I work.

317
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,331
We were together

318
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,708
the whole night.

319
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,875
What did you guys do?

320
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,961
What else could it be?

321
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,546
Of course...

322
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,423
I gave him a good time.

323
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,842
I'm a dancer.

324
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,137
Escort.

325
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,388
What time did you two meet?

326
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,973
Around 11PM.

327
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,725
How long were you two together?

328
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,019
Mmm. All night.

329
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,105
Until morning.

330
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,482
You didn't part ways
since 11PM?

331
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,608
We did.

332
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:00,986
To go to the bathroom.

333
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,780
Bathroom break
was our only break.

334
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,283
Why?

335
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:09,202
Should I go into the bathroom
with Vincent whenever he pees?

336
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,205
I could.

337
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,004
Here's the blood test
result, sir.

338
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,255
Thank you.

339
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,890
We'll find out here
who's telling the truth.

340
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:43,153
Your wife said you hid this.

341
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,324
The night the victim died.

342
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,575
Tell me.

343
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,245
Is this your shirt, Mr. Cabrera?

344
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,719
And according to the results
of the blood test...

345
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,610
...the blood came from you.

346
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,908
I had an accident.

347
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:30,992
I was drunk then.

348
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,619
Accident? Where?

349
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,746
In a fight?

350
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,382
From a bite.

351
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,259
A bite?

352
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,679
Vincent and I
were fooling around,

353
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,389
and I accidentally
bit him on the lip.

354
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,391
- A bite?
- Kind of his fault.

355
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,392
I think we're done here.

356
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,893
We've answered
all your questions.

357
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,770
For now.

358
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,190
We'll call you
if we have more questions.

359
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,025
This is not over yet.

360
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:08,029
We will find out
who killed Walter Cunanan.

361
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,922
Did you tell them everything?

362
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,758
Of course.

363
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,094
The details are very important.

364
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,225
Thank you.

365
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:46,484
Alegria.

366
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,822
Are you okay?

367
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,242
I'm okay.

368
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,827
I'm just thinking...

369
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,372
...if it's true
you didn't kill him,

370
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,958
why do I still have
to come here?

371
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,335
Why do you still need me?

372
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:07,672
I'm strengthening my testimony
so my case will be stronger.

373
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,674
Your statement is my protection.

374
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,678
The one who died,
who was he to you?

375
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,097
He's not my relative.

376
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,808
He was our company's CFO.

377
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,143
An employee of my father.

378
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,566
He had no family?

379
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,651
No wife?

380
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,820
No children?

381
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,822
None.

382
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,200
Why?

383
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,786
Nothing.

384
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,038
I was just asking.

385
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,042
Alegria.

386
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,712
Wait here.
I'll talk to the attorney.

387
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,797
Don't leave.

388
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,805
Isn't that the woman
who was with Mr. Cabrera?

389
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,556
- Look!
- Come on, hurry!

390
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,769
Excuse me,
were you with Mr. Cabrera

391
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,271
when Mr. Cunanan died?

392
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,355
I'm busy.

393
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,482
- I won't do interviews.
- Miss, just a second!

394
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,151
What proof do you have
that Mr. Cabrera is innocent?

395
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,778
How are you related to him?

396
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,155
Yes, who are you in his life
and what's your connection?

397
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,074
Do you know Walter Cunanan?

398
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:19,119
- Miss, speak up!
- Are you hiding something?

399
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,789
Girlfriend!
I'm his girlfriend!

400
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,416
- How did you meet?
- Excuse me!

401
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,875
Excuse me, stop harassing her.

402
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,712
Sir Vincent, wait!

403
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,547
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Wait!

404
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,382
- Just a moment, please.
- Get inside.

405
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,177
Excuse me!

406
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,721
- Wait a minute!
- Sir!

407
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,902
Why did you say that?

408
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,321
What do you want me to say?

409
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,448
Tell the press you were
with a prostitute all night?

410
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,451
- I have a wife and child!
- How should I know?

411
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,870
That's not part of
what you made me memorize.

412
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,788
Do you think
they would believe me?

413
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,749
Then maybe
you shouldn't have answered!

414
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,793
They were already
ganging up on me.

415
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,921
They were practically pulling
my tongue out to make me talk.

416
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,299
But not for you to say
you're my girlfriend!

417
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,053
Who would believe
a woman like me, huh?

418
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,680
Sorry, Vincent.

419
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,516
I'm just thinking of the tiny
bit of dignity I still have.

420
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,686
I don't want to tell everyone
that I'm a prostitute!

421
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,192
You should be thankful
I even covered for you.

422
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,195
My life is complicated.

423
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,988
Hey, even if your life
is complicated

424
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,990
the world does not
revolve around you.

425
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,825
I have a family
who will be affected

426
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,577
by what you're making me do.

427
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,581
Just because you pay me
does not mean you own my life.

428
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,838
I already did the job, didn't I?

429
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,049
So where's my money?

430
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,802
I'm still working on it.

431
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,720
Hey, it's only one
in the afternoon,

432
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,805
you can still withdraw.

433
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:02,931
You're rich, right?

434
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,432
Everything is easy for you.

435
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,644
Give me the money
at the bar later

436
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,312
if you don't want trouble.

437
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,082
<i>What's your</i>
<i>relationship with Mr. Cabrera?</i>

438
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,334
<i>Girlfriend.</i>

439
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,377
<i>I'm his girlfriend.</i>

440
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,087
<i>When did you become a couple?</i>

441
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,475
Are you okay?

442
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,689
You already know?

443
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,566
It's all over the news.

444
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,485
Vincent does not deserve
all this.

445
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,738
You have to pull yourself
together, Jacqueline.

446
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,491
We do not need weakness
right now.

447
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,953
You better control
your emotions.

448
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:07,996
That won't help,

449
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,998
especially in finding
a solution.

450
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,086
You know that
I've mastered the art

451
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,297
of hiding my true emotions.

452
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,381
You know that.

453
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,760
But I am different
when it comes to my children.

454
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:28,391
That's why we need to talk.

455
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,353
We need to solve this
before it gets worse.

456
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,410
What the heck?!

457
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,745
Really, Vincent?!

458
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,330
A prostitute?!

459
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,831
You disgust me.

460
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,168
Do you know everyone
is talking about us now?

461
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,628
You humiliated me.

462
00:29:56,711 --> 00:30:00,757
How dare you drag me
and our family into this filth!

463
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,884
You're the one who dragged me
into the mud.

464
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,886
What did you give the police?

465
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:05,970
Why?

466
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:06,971
Can you blame me?

467
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,139
You hid that!

468
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,933
You could not even
explain to me

469
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,602
where you were when Walter died.

470
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,230
And now you know my reason.

471
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,856
I only did what I had to do

472
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,651
to prove to everyone
that I am innocent.

473
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,110
How dare you do this to me.

474
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,404
- How dare you--
- Don't act clean!

475
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,907
We both know
you have a big sin too.

476
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,452
I know you had a relationship
with Walter.

477
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,332
How dare you make up
stories about me.

478
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,586
How could I be with Walter
if I was putting Bea to sleep?

479
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,673
You want to know why
I didn't burst into that room?

480
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,424
Because Bea arrived.

481
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,554
And be thankful that my love
for our child prevailed.

482
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,139
That's why I don't tell
everyone what you're doing,

483
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,184
because I don't want
our child to know your filth.

484
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,687
You're using Bea now.

485
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,896
What is this?

486
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,940
Is this a product of
your insecurity about Walter?

487
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,527
Seeing things?

488
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,820
You're delusional.

489
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,738
You're paranoid.

490
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,658
Fine.

491
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,160
I'll tell the police
everything I know.

492
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,580
Let them investigate

493
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,499
and let everyone know
about your relationship.

494
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,712
What now?
You cannot answer?

495
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,464
Because what matters
more to you is your image.

496
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,926
Your reputation
is more important

497
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,679
than our family and our child.

498
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,641
That's why you don't want
your relationship exposed.

499
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,563
Go ahead, do it.

500
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,441
Humiliate yourself even more.

501
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,198
Our daughter loves you so much.

502
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,369
Bea looks up to you.

503
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,829
You know...

504
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,417
I almost wish I had been
the one to kill Walter.

505
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,924
Hey, Mom.

506
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,427
Are you ready for our date?
What do you want to do?

507
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,929
I'm sorry, Matthew.
Can we just do this tomorrow?

508
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,307
Ma, this is Friday night.
This is our thing.

509
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,934
We barely get to be together,
and you're being like this?

510
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,895
- Come on!
- I know, but--

511
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,190
Okay, let me guess...

512
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,610
It's Vincent.

513
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,071
Yeah.

514
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,781
I've been calling him
for a while now.

515
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,700
Well, there's a reason
he doesn't want to answer.

516
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,746
So maybe
don't force him to talk.

517
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,581
You can't stop me
from worrying.

518
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,625
What if Vincent
does something,

519
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,043
especially with that woman?

520
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,545
Did he ever tell you anything
about that woman?

521
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,924
Ma, you know
what our relationship is like.

522
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,260
When will the day come
that you two

523
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,304
will finally get along?

524
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,973
You see? That's the problem.

525
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,433
We're not siblings.

526
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,893
You adopted him.

527
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,269
Actually, you adopted someone

528
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,646
who doesn't even care
about you.

529
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,774
But you always
worry about him.

530
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:05,900
You know what?

531
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:08,945
He can take care of himself.
Did you know that?

532
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,571
- Matthew--
- Mom...

533
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,699
sometimes it feels like...

534
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,534
you worry about him more

535
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,619
than you do about me
and Eddie Boy.

536
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,414
You're all my children.

537
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,416
I love you all equally.

538
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,001
I don't want any of you
to get hurt.

539
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,128
You know that.

540
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,130
I guess, from now on...

541
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,259
I'll just do our Friday nights
on my own.

542
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,719
- Matthew--
- Mom!

543
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,637
I'm a big boy.

544
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,306
Don't worry about me.

545
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,691
Nothing
happened between us.

546
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,651
He's not my boyfriend either.

547
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,154
I just gave a statement
to the police

548
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,530
so he wouldn't get jailed.

549
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,866
In exchange, he'll pay me.

550
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,951
That's just it.

551
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,663
But people see you
as a mistress!

552
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,665
What matters is I have money.

553
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,042
Especially
for Joseph's operation.

554
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,627
What else can I do?

555
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,588
Of course, I'll hold on
to whatever I can.

556
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:11,966
If I have to embrace
that blade, I will.

557
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:14,093
But are you ready for what
you've gotten yourself into?

558
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,012
Are you ready to get cut
by that blade?

559
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,764
Well! That's even messier.

560
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,642
And dangerous.

561
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,562
Stella,
you have a customer.

562
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:36,365
Sorry, I took a while.

563
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,543
Are you my customer?

564
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,630
Um...

565
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,383
- It's my first time--
- I'm Vincent's mom.

566
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,055
We have a lot to talk about.

567
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,849
I want to know the truth.

568
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,313
Sir Cardo.

569
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,982
I'll just roam around here
for a bit.

570
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,653
Alright, I'll head over
to Walter's villa later.

571
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,412
Uh, sir.

572
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,790
Uh, good evening.

573
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,209
Do you work here?

574
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,753
Yes, sir.
I work in housekeeping.

575
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:36,342
Were you here the night
Walter Cunanan died?

576
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,010
The guest in Villa 4?

577
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,263
Do you know anything?

578
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,307
I saw something
that night when he died.

579
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,809
I was on my way home

580
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,103
when I saw a man
knocking on his door

581
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,896
and then entering his villa.

582
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,407
Are you really
my son's girlfriend?

583
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,533
I mean...

584
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:02,159
his mistress?

585
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,082
I'd rather just dance.

586
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,005
I'm talking to you, dear.

587
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,595
Yes, madam.

588
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,222
Mistress,

589
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,894
side chick, lover, fling--

590
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,437
All of the above.

591
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,382
Mister Ronald,
what are you doing here?

592
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,805
You seem proud.

593
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,558
I'm just being real.

594
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,102
So...

595
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,606
How did you and my son meet?

596
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,400
Naturally...

597
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,945
He came into this bar
and became my customer.

598
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,991
Vincent doesn't go
to places like this.

599
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,952
You're not sure about that.

600
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:29,538
Maybe you don't really
know your son that well.

601
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,295
You don't know us.

602
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,922
And you don't know me either.

603
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,650
We're all, in some way...

604
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,152
selling ourselves
in this world.

605
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,531
We just differ
in what we're selling.

606
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,081
Mom!

607
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,125
Vincent?!

608
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,546
Is there really something
going on between you two?!

609
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:28,973
Oh my god!

610
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,057
All this time,

611
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,852
I've been trying to
defend you to your dad,

612
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,729
but how could you do this?

613
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,606
Didn't you even think
about Claudia and Bea?

614
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,942
Mom, she's doing me a favor.

615
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,235
Please don't bother her.

616
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:43,696
It's my obligation
to protect our family.

617
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,615
And I know even better
how to protect myself.

618
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,659
[SIGHS

619
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,968
What are you trying
to accomplish, Mom?

620
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,678
Did Dad send you here?

621
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,264
He doesn't even know I'm here.

622
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,350
Then why?
Why are you even here?

623
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,894
Because I want
to know the truth.

624
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,897
What do you think
I'm feeling right now

625
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,899
that my son has this
whole other life

626
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,025
I know nothing about?

627
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:25,154
I want to understand
who that woman is,

628
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,823
the one you chose over
your wife and daughter!

629
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:32,119
She's not the kind of woman
you think she is.

630
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,163
Vincent,
I'm worried about you.

631
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:36,791
Is that all, Mom?

632
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,961
Or are you just here
so you can intimidate her?

633
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,466
Vincent, believe it or not,
I'm on your side.

634
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,676
But how can I defend you

635
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,845
when I'm blind
to what's happening?

636
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,973
I want to protect you,
but I don't know how.

637
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,558
You couldn't even
do that with Dad,

638
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,185
how will you
with other people?

639
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,398
I can protect myself.

640
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,069
And you don't need
to pretend anymore.

641
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,363
I know you just
don't want to tarnish

642
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,697
the name you gave me.

643
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,866
It's more than that, Vincent.

644
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,785
Think about your family!

645
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,578
You're hurting Claudia.

646
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,623
And do you really think
Claudia's innocent in all this?

647
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:19,792
Believe it or not,

648
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:23,379
I'm doing everything
to clear our family's name.

649
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,216
You said
you believe me, right?

650
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,844
But through all this...

651
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,141
you never even asked me
what the truth really is.

652
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,675
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening.

653
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,901
Didn't I tell you

654
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:31,489
to always call and let me
know where you're going?

655
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,241
I did something crazy.

656
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,120
I went to see Vincent's
girl at the bar.

657
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,124
What happened?

658
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,127
Vincent arrived

659
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,463
and defended her.

660
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,841
Here's the full amount
we agreed on.

661
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,181
It's all there.

662
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,816
Thanks.

663
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:11,320
You have no idea
how much this helps us.

664
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,408
I hope you can use that
to start a new life.

665
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,620
I already have plans for this.

666
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,955
So, are we good?

667
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,332
We can stop seeing
each other now, right?

668
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,043
I hope so.

669
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,213
It wouldn't make sense
if they'll keep on suspecting me

670
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,382
when we've been together
all night.

671
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,968
I hope they find
whoever really killed Walter.

672
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,221
I thought those days
were over...

673
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,891
his rebellious behavior,
getting into trouble.

674
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,687
You even sent him
to America back then.

675
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,691
I thought once he had a family,

676
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,693
things would settle down.

677
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:53,988
But...

678
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,699
he still sees us as enemies.

679
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,451
I told you.

680
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:02,788
Your son is hopeless.

681
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,083
It's our obligation
to help Vincent.

682
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,128
We can't give up on him.

683
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,131
We should be the first ones
to protect him!

684
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,843
Why don't you just
tell your family the truth?

685
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,929
Then your mom won't bother me
here at work.

686
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:22,766
They can't know
about our arrangement.

687
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,186
Why not?

688
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,815
Because they'll be the first
ones to throw me to the wolves.

689
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:32,568
They're just waiting
for a chance to get rid of me.

690
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,945
Why would they do that?
You're their own family.

691
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:39,408
It's hard to help someone
who refuses to listen.

692
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,704
In the end, we're the bad guys.

693
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,415
So what?

694
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,709
If he screws up,

695
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,045
does that mean
he stops being our son?

696
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,339
Or we stop being his parents?

697
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,133
Vincent is a grown man.

698
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,844
He makes his own decisions.

699
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,849
Is this the opportunity
you've been waiting for?

700
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,643
To finally get rid of him.

701
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,730
If I wanted to get rid of him,
I would've done it long ago.

702
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,526
Maybe this is what he needs.

703
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,322
A wake-up call.

704
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,872
No one should ever
know the truth.

705
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,666
What, even if your reputation's
getting destroyed?

706
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,794
That's the easiest to fix.

707
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:35,089
People forget easily.

708
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,010
Isn't that the problem?

709
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,388
People forget so easily.

710
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:46,392
That's why it's also so easy
to cover up all the lies.

711
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,324
Where did you get the money?

712
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,827
From him?

713
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,703
Who?

714
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,872
Stop acting like you don't know.

715
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,083
Katherine, enough with
the questions, okay?

716
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,461
I don't know how to feel.

717
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,047
Joseph's life
may have been saved,

718
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:20,259
but at the cost
of ruining a family.

719
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,219
The important thing is,

720
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,304
Joseph had his operation.

721
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,890
So Katherine,
listen to me, okay?

722
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,393
Put your life together.

723
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,395
Study hard.

724
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,064
You should graduate
and earn your degree,

725
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:38,026
so that no one can ever
look down on you.

726
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,321
Doc.

727
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,199
Ms. Morales,
the operation is complete.

728
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,952
I'm happy to inform you
that it was successful.

729
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,788
We've closed the hole
in your brother's heart,

730
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,916
and there were no complications
during the procedure.

731
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,711
T-Thank you.

732
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,380
Thank you.

733
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:06,972
Next time, I'll come with you
once school's over.

734
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,725
<i>Is that alright?</i>

735
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,560
Of course, dear.

736
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,895
Mr. Cabrera.

737
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,444
I'll call you again later,
dear, okay?

738
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:23,614
<i>Bye! I love you!</i>

739
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,491
Caught a lot today?

740
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,992
Just enough.

741
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:30,454
I'm guessing
you didn't come here to fish.

742
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,663
What do you need?

743
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,207
I just have a question.

744
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,708
We spoke to a witness.

745
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:40,464
They said they saw you rushing
into Walter Cunanan's villa,

746
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,798
angry.

747
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,510
That contradicts your story
of being with Stella Morales.

748
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,188
How far was the witness
from the villa?

749
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,565
- Any video footage?
- There's none.

750
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:03,070
Some CCTVs malfunctioned
due to the storm.

751
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:07,324
Then I hope you're not implying
things you can't prove.

752
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,952
I already told you
where I was that night,

753
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:16,959
so why won't you
present me solid evidence?

754
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:21,004
Or better yet,
find Walter's real killer.

755
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,258
Because
while you're accusing me,

756
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,760
the real killer's getting away.

757
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,647
What? Did it get away?

758
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,566
Too bad.

759
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:44,236
You really can't always
catch a fish by its own mouth.

760
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,752
Hurry up and take those out.

761
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,713
What's going on?

762
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,840
Ma'am, I'll deal with sir.

763
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,467
Go upstairs.

764
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,180
You're leaving?

765
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,809
Where's Bea?

766
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:18,228
She's in her room.

767
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,522
We're not leaving,

768
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,732
you are.

769
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,317
What?

770
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,153
Are you kicking me out?

771
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:30,616
I agreed to Dad's wish
to keep up appearances,

772
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:34,494
but I won't stay with you
under one roof

773
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,913
because I don't feel safe.

774
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,915
Then I'm taking Bea.

775
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,709
Are you insane?

776
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,295
Do you want your daughter
to be caught up in your case?

777
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,758
Do you really want
to pull her out of a home

778
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,010
where she's safe
and looked after?

779
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,597
Until your case is over,

780
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,682
I will protect my child.

781
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,143
Nothing's been proven yet.

782
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,688
Why are you so eager
to let go?

783
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,899
After everything
we've been through,

784
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,860
I did everything
to save our marriage.

785
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:11,740
I didn't pursue the annulment
before, did I?

786
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,992
Because I tried too, Vincent,

787
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,952
but I just can't
put up with you anymore.

788
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,496
What?

789
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:18,789
I was the one
putting up with you.

790
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:21,124
I even saved you from yourself!

791
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,459
Have you forgotten?

792
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:29,591
You can't save everyone.

793
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,760
Not even yourself.

794
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,142
Come with me already, Alegria.

795
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:23,895
I'll give you
everything you want.

796
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,525
Oh.

797
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,318
You really turn me on!

798
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,784
Ah...

799
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,872
We're done here.

800
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,373
Hey, hold on.

801
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,458
Hey! Hey!

802
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,668
That's not part of the deal!
Stop it!

803
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,462
Hold on! Stop!

804
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,755
I said stop!

805
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:54,551
You pervert! That's not
part of our deal!

806
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,970
- You like that, huh?
- Hey!

807
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:59,181
Hey!

808
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:01,475
What's wrong with you?!

809
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,562
Hey! Hey, stop it!

810
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:06,897
- What's happening?!
- Stop it!

811
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,816
- Charlie, help me!
- Hey, stop it!

812
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,568
Hey, that's enough!

813
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:12,903
I said enough!

814
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,905
Vincent, come with me.

815
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:18,325
I might lose my job
because of you.

816
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,367
There.

817
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,453
Calm down.

818
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:24,164
I was trying to help you!

819
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,624
Why did you have to do that?!

820
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,125
I can take care of myself!

821
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,169
He shouldn't have
done that to you!

822
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,587
I was
only trying to help!

823
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,172
Is that how you are
when you're angry?

824
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,381
You just beat people up?

825
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,425
My customer almost died!

826
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,096
What did you say?

827
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,389
Now you think
I'm capable of killing?

828
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:42,766
How should I know?

829
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,184
We're not close.

830
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,186
We aren't even friends.

831
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:50,148
I wouldn't throw my life away
for some low-life like him.

832
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,527
Hold on. Why did you even
come back to this place?

833
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,821
Wasn't the money
I gave you enough?

834
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:56,988
That money you gave me,

835
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,115
I used it to pay for
my brother's operation.

836
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,660
I also used it to pay for
their tuition, some debts,

837
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:04,538
our electricity and water bill,
rent, and other things.

838
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,747
Okay?

839
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:12,754
What about you?

840
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,340
They come first.

841
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:18,927
I can still work.

842
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,180
What about you?

843
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,724
What are you doing here?

844
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,769
I just wanted to get
away from my cursed life.

845
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,188
But this isn't the
best place to do that.

846
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:33,859
The only difference is,
all of us here are cursed.

847
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:37,404
No one here acts like
they're perfect or innocent.

848
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,739
Did you get into trouble with
your mom because of me?

849
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,492
That's how they've
seen me ever since.

850
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,495
Trouble.

851
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,331
I just want to
clear my name, Alegria.

852
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,589
Stella.

853
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,718
You can call me Stella.

854
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,474
She's an ex-convict.

855
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,101
She was arrested
for illegal drugs.

856
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:10,687
There's also information
on her family there.

857
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:20,238
Arthur, are you okay?

858
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,616
That Stella Morales...

859
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,995
...she can't be
part of Vincent's life.

860
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:29,289
We need to get rid of her.

861
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,498
Hey!

862
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,712
- You! Come with me!
- Hey!

863
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,464
What's going on?!

864
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:22,092
Let go of me!

865
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,094
I said let go of me!

866
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,887
What do you want from me?!

867
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,889
- Shut up!
- What's happening?!

868
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,808
Let me go right now!

869
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,977
How dare you! You monsters!

870
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,061
Let me go!

871
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,380
<i>You've got some</i>
<i>explaining to do.</i>

872
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,013
<i>You bastard!</i>

873
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,558
<i>I treated you as a friend!</i>

874
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,726
<i>A brother!</i>

875
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:22,147
<i>Are you still fuming</i>
<i>because I'm the new CEO?</i>

876
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,690
<i>Vincent, move on!</i>

877
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,526
<i>Does that mean you can</i>
<i>take Claudia from me too?!</i>

878
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,865
<i>I know something's</i>
<i>going on between you two.</i>

879
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,075
<i>How does it feel, huh?</i>

880
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,121
<i>You've lost everything.</i>

881
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:41,332
<i>You lost your career...</i>

882
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,251
<i>you being a Cabrera...</i>

883
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,045
<i>...and even your wife.</i>

884
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,847
<i>Hmm.</i>

885
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,557
<i>I can still smell your wife.</i>

886
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,396
<i>She smells so good.</i>

887
00:58:05,481 --> 00:58:07,609
<i>Uh, we're friends, right?</i>

888
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,987
<i>I mean, if you</i>
<i>don't mind sharing...</i>

889
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:16,826
<i>Come on, Vincent.</i>

890
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,787
<i>You can't shoot me.</i>

891
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:22,165
<i>You're too much of</i>
<i>a coward to shoot me.</i>

892
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,417
<i>Shoot me.</i>

893
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,835
<i>Do it.</i>

894
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,920
<i>Come on.</i>

895
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:29,964
<i>Can't do it, huh?</i>

896
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:55,698
<i>No matter what you do...</i>

897
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,535
<i>...I'll always</i>
<i>be better than you.</i>

898
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:05,124
<i>And your family</i>
<i>will always be on my side.</i>

899
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,852
<i>You paid her to be your alibi?</i>

900
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,188
<i>How sure are you</i>
<i>that you can trust Stella?</i>

901
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,233
<i>You put me in a situation</i>
<i>I didn't want to be in!</i>

902
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,734
<i>We've received some information.</i>

903
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:35,905
<i>Someone saw Mr. Vincent Cabrera</i>
<i>in Cunanan's villa.</i>

904
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,283
<i>Who's telling the truth?</i>

905
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,202
<i>You're stupid enough to let her</i>
<i>use you for your money.</i>

906
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,578
<i>I love Stella!</i>

907
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,956
<i>So many things</i>
<i>don't add up in this case.</i>

908
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:48,584
<i>Tell me what really</i>
<i>happened that night!</i>

909
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:51,212
<i>- Mr. Cabrera!</i>
<i>- I killed him!</i>
