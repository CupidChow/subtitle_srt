1
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,746
As soon as I begin
my examination,

2
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,539
we'll find
what you're looking for.

3
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,374
We're going to make
some enemies here, Doc.

4
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,169
You should fear the living
more than the dead.

5
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:47,422
Vincent is not like
Matthew and Edward.

6
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:48,715
The more he's cornered,

7
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,508
the more he's going
to fight.

8
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:54,512
We received a tip that illegal
drugs are being sold here.

9
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,014
- No, sir!
- Men, arrest them!

10
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,308
- That's not true, sir!
- You must be mistaken!

11
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,602
Walter's death isn't caused
by blunt force trauma.

12
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,686
Fentanyl?

13
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,397
Walter was poisoned.

14
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,114
Mama Mona?

15
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,618
Mama Mona. Mama Mona.

16
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,749
What are you doing here?

17
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,835
Of course, I came here
to comfort you.

18
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,170
You know, Stella...

19
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,968
I've spent half my life
in this club.

20
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:38,473
This is where I started to work
and build dreams.

21
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,850
This is where I learned
to love

22
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,019
and got my heart broken.

23
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:46,314
You are all like
a family to me

24
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:47,774
but I failed all of you.

25
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,400
Mama Mona.

26
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,735
You only lost the club.

27
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,988
I'm still here.

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,366
How can I get up again?

29
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,619
The owner
is kicking us out

30
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,455
and then they'll
sell this property.

31
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,957
It's a sign.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,209
You're good
in managing a business

33
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,377
and dealing with people.

34
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,795
And most of all...

35
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,424
you're good
in handling money.

36
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,884
Money?

37
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,053
I don't have money.

38
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,721
Well, I do.

39
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,224
Stella...

40
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:25,645
That money
is for your siblings.

41
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,438
Mama Mona.

42
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,774
I've already set aside
some money for them.

43
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,736
We'll put up a restaurant
instead of a club.

44
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,864
We can be business partners.

45
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,409
I guess this is also
our chance...

46
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,120
to start a new life.

47
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,207
Thank you so much.

48
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,668
Thank you.

49
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,886
This is a pleasant surprise,
my friend!

50
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,304
Oh.

51
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,514
The group said we're having
a meeting later.

52
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,142
- Are you going to attend?
- Yes, Arthur.

53
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,852
So what brought you here?

54
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,813
Is there a new
business opportunity

55
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,857
that you want to discuss
with me?

56
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,358
No, not business.

57
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,736
Something more important.

58
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,614
Something personal.

59
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,534
Family.

60
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,912
What about family?

61
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,748
You see, we're both fathers,

62
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,125
but you don't have
a daughter.

63
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,836
Because if you did,
you'd understand...

64
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,048
that one of the things
I hate

65
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,927
is when someone
makes my daughter cry.

66
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,597
Oh, I don't have
the full picture yet.

67
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,057
But once I do...

68
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,227
I'm sure I'll be able to help
you and your daughter.

69
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,439
Daphne is very close
to us after all.

70
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,692
That's good to hear, Arthur.

71
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,236
Really good to hear.

72
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,407
We've been through a lot
together,

73
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,743
and you owe me
a debt of gratitude.

74
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,370
It'd be a waste
to ruin everything

75
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,331
because of something
so trivial.

76
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:22,887
Edward.

77
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,557
We need to talk.

78
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,101
About what, Dad?

79
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,560
About Daphne.

80
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,439
Her father talked to me
and I didn't like what he said.

81
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:38,319
You know very well
how our family ties with theirs.

82
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,322
Dad, I'm not leading Daphne on.

83
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,617
She knows
that I'm courting Catherine.

84
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,454
Did you know that you're
the most sensible of my kids?

85
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,706
But you also know

86
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,792
that Daphne's family

87
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,087
is our biggest business partner.

88
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,216
And you're putting it at risk
just for a woman.

89
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,053
Dad, how do you expect me
to do anything I don't want to?

90
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,355
Edward.

91
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,569
You know how tough I am
as a father.

92
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,448
Do you think I'd want
to see you suffering?

93
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,783
I'm just saying.

94
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,328
Look at what's happening
with Vincent.

95
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:34,082
Do you think he will
have it easy with Stella?

96
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,504
Learn from his shortcomings.

97
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,480
Edward, what is this?
You resigned from your job?

98
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,232
What's going on?

99
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,942
Are you going on a trip?

100
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,028
I'm going to stay at the condo.

101
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,909
Uh...

102
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,369
You're leaving home?

103
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,831
Honestly, Mom, after
everything that's happened,

104
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,250
especially between us,

105
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,627
and Dad's pressure,

106
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,879
I want some space.

107
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,714
I'm tired of all the fighting.

108
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,300
This'll help me
be more independent, too.

109
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,264
T-there's no reason
for you to do this.

110
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,308
Uh... I won't be at ease.

111
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,645
I'd only get worried about you.

112
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,816
Mom, let's not argue
about this, too, please.

113
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:44,403
Alright, just... Just give me
some more time, okay?

114
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:49,617
I'll have the condo cleaned up
so you can be comfortable.

115
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,744
And I need to make sure
of your safety.

116
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,287
Mom, no need.

117
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,041
N-No, I... I insist, okay?

118
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,876
I'm still your mother.

119
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,211
Just do this for me.

120
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,672
So that I'll have peace of mind.

121
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,388
Claudia.

122
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,017
Where's Bea? I just wanted
to give her these books.

123
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,686
Uh, she's still showering.

124
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,397
I'm sure she's gonna be happy
to see you.

125
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,984
Maybe, you can stay,

126
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,902
and have lunch with us?

127
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,699
Alright.
We need to talk, anyway.

128
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,659
Really?

129
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,829
Tell me. I'm all ears.

130
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,082
Given your intimate relationship
with Walter,

131
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:43,254
I'm sure he'd told you
about himself, his plans,

132
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,174
and his connection to our family
and about his job.

133
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,761
Stop this, Vincent.

134
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,471
What game are you playing?

135
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,223
Whatever I say,

136
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,018
you'd still get hurt.

137
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,978
This isn't about us, Claudia.

138
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,981
I just want the truth
so I can clear up my name.

139
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:05,776
It's unfortunate for you
that you're closest to him.

140
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,529
And I'm hoping to get
the answers I need.

141
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,948
Well, then,
don't keep your hopes up.

142
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,119
Walter and I didn't share
anything deep.

143
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,204
You know that.

144
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,081
Not like us.

145
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,127
We didn't do drugs together.

146
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,342
So, that's what
you came here to say

147
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,220
while I'm here,
trying to connect with you?

148
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,974
Because that's the real cause
of his death.

149
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,187
Wait...

150
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,356
So, you're accusing me

151
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,442
of drugging Walter to death?

152
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,903
He supplied you with it.

153
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,490
You'd always sneak out and
do stuff with him, didn't you?

154
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,285
Well, you're truly desperate.

155
00:08:57,536 --> 00:09:01,040
I'm giving you a chance
to clear your name.

156
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,751
I'm this close to finding out
about the truth.

157
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,840
You know what?
If you're here to accuse me,

158
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,260
I'd rather you leave.

159
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,554
Claudia, I know you know
something to clear up this mess.

160
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,139
Now, tell me what it is.

161
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,266
Get out.

162
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,270
I'll just give these to Bea.

163
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,689
No.

164
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,608
And you can't see her anymore.

165
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,318
Leave!

166
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,696
Didn't you hear me?

167
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,364
I said, leave! Now!

168
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,888
Crap.

169
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,807
Matthew. We need to talk.

170
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,855
To be honest with you,
I'm so nervous right now.

171
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,818
What if I get blamed
for Walter's death?

172
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,322
Vincent has a reason
to bring me down.

173
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,448
We were right.

174
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,741
I'm an easy target!

175
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,412
Relax. I'll talk to Dad.

176
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,039
He'll figure it out.

177
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,458
Besides, we've been following
Vincent for a while,

178
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,834
and we're still safe.

179
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,461
You should stop panicking.

180
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,593
They're just waiting
for Dad's orders.

181
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,095
That means, Dad is the one
hiding the truth...

182
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,932
Because he knows
what really happened to Walter.

183
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,564
Good luck, Sir Edward.

184
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:49,732
Thank you.

185
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,816
Edward!

186
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,736
Why did you resign?

187
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:59,533
You'd always tell me
to follow my dreams.

188
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,452
I just thought,

189
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,622
what if my dreams
aren't here at Fides?

190
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,292
Is that the real reason?

191
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,503
You're the real reason.

192
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,714
Then, I'll resign!

193
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,174
I won't let you do that.

194
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,303
If I leave, they won't go
after you anymore.

195
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,306
Not even Daphne nor Mom.

196
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,183
I love you, Catherine.

197
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,894
I don't like
seeing you hurting..

198
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,563
You got your wish.

199
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,774
You will never see me again.

200
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,321
So, that's it?

201
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,452
You made me feel special.

202
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,540
You told me you'd fight for me.

203
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,960
Just to leave me behind?

204
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,421
You're even throwing away
our friendship.

205
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,716
It's not easy for me
to just treat you as a friend.

206
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,801
Why?

207
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,512
Life isn't easy..

208
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,475
Do you think it's easy for me
to deal with your mother?

209
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,270
Do you think it's easy to accept
that you deserve Daphne?

210
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,312
You know what, Edward?

211
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,440
It's so hard to love you!

212
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,028
So you love me?

213
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,491
Edward...

214
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,077
No take-backs.

215
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,120
Oh, my god!

216
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,366
So, who's going to be the CEO?

217
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:49,870
Vincent.

218
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:56,126
Vincent? Not me?

219
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,838
I thought we had a deal.

220
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,349
Teresa Lopez.

221
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,813
That's the name
of your real mother.

222
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,358
She used to work for me.

223
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,829
Look, I became an orphan
because of you.

224
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,708
And I stay true to my promise.
It's payback time.

225
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,045
I won't let you get away
with what happened to her.

226
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,009
You've been stealing
from my company for years.

227
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,093
Stealing?

228
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,430
No.

229
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,931
I wouldn't call it stealing.

230
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,475
I'd call it...

231
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,769
a payment.

232
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:04,612
Why didn't you tell me
about your real identity?

233
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,157
Did you ask?

234
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,953
I will fucking bury you.

235
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,581
And how exactly
will you bury me...

236
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,461
if I know where
all the skeletons are?

237
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,141
Remember her?

238
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,896
I know everything
you did to her.

239
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,441
And she just happens
to be my newest...

240
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,818
my newest exposé.

241
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,197
if I don't get
the CEO position.

242
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,798
I'm glad you kept your word.

243
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,925
And don't worry,

244
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,177
your secrets are safe with me.

245
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,532
Dad.

246
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,200
We have a problem.

247
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,911
Vincent knows something
about Walter's death.

248
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,934
Vincent is onto me.

249
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,271
He asked me if I drugged Walter
the night he died!

250
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,273
Why would he ask you that?

251
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,151
Dad, I don't know!

252
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,111
He was talking about drugs

253
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,239
like it was
Walter's cause of death!

254
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:14,324
But it's not, right?

255
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:16,617
He was hit in the head
for God's sake!

256
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:18,454
Where's Dad?

257
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,455
He's in his office, sir.

258
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,415
He's speaking to Sir Matthew
and Ma'am Claudia.

259
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,877
- Okay.
- Alright, sir.

260
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,505
I'll go there by myself.

261
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,632
I'll keep an eye out here.

262
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,717
Go ahead.

263
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,513
Blunt force trauma.

264
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,974
That's what
the autopsy report says.

265
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,936
Do you have any idea why Vincent
is asking you about drugs?

266
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,813
Did he show you anything?

267
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,106
No, Dad.

268
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,608
He showed me nothing.

269
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,276
But he seems so sure.

270
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,655
Maybe Vincent's
pressuring Claudia, Dad.

271
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,158
But I did not kill him!

272
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,035
This can't be happening, Dad!

273
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,953
Come on, you have to protect me.

274
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,038
Please.

275
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,167
This will ruin my life!

276
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,669
We need to know
what Vincent has.

277
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,677
Stella?

278
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,762
Uh...

279
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,889
Good evening, ma'am.

280
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,183
What are you doing here?

281
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,726
I'm waiting for Vincent.

282
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,145
Where is he?

283
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,814
I don't know.

284
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,440
I think he's looking for you.

285
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,617
Wait!

286
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,829
Dad, remember,

287
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,040
we all know what happened
to that Dr. Castro, right?

288
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,543
She did a re-autopsy
on Walter's body.

289
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,338
Vincent was there
when that doctor died!

290
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,967
Maybe he found out
something from her?

291
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,888
Yeah, yeah.
Maybe she's right.

292
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:04,184
Vincent did see her
at her clinic, so...

293
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,520
I'm so confused!

294
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,606
Why is the re-autopsy result
so important?!

295
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,775
Was the initial findings wrong?

296
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,443
Let me handle this, okay?

297
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,153
- But, Dad--
- No, please.

298
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:18,073
Claudia, do as I say,

299
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,576
Don't say another word
to Vincent.

300
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,660
Okay?

301
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,915
Wait!

302
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,126
Where are you going?

303
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,837
I'm going to see Arthur.

304
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,590
I have something important
to tell you.

305
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,967
About what, Stella?

306
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,011
Let's talk over there.
Come on.

307
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,971
I don't take orders from you!

308
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,726
Are you going to tell me why
you and Vincent are here or not?

309
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:51,064
Madam, what I have to say
is very, very important.

310
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,149
Mom.

311
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,610
Oh, Vincent.

312
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,069
It's good that you're here.

313
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,821
I need to speak
with you and Dad.

314
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,245
Oh, come on, Vincent!

315
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,580
Stop this drama.

316
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,081
What are you going to say now?

317
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,542
What's going on here?

318
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,339
I've had some time to think
over the last few days.

319
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,925
So I would like to start with...

320
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,843
an apology.

321
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,597
I shouldn't have
gone against you.

322
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,351
I owe a lot to this family.

323
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:31,230
From now on, I won't be
saying anything against you.

324
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,314
Oh, yeah?

325
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,524
But you confronted me
about Walter, right?

326
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,567
Remember?

327
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,528
And you accused me
of drugging him.

328
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:42,199
Because you discovered
something about his death.

329
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,202
And now, what?
You're acting like this?

330
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,037
- I'm not buying it!
- Claudia.

331
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:53,627
I'll let the police
uncover the truth, Claudia.

332
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,799
What about our deal with her?

333
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,472
I'm giving everything up...

334
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,478
except Stella.

335
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,190
She's my one request.

336
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,657
Now, we wait
for someone to slip up.

337
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,575
But then what?

338
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:29,746
You promised them
you'll stop investigating.

339
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,249
That's why we have
to be extra careful,

340
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,460
so they don't find out what
we're doing from here on out.

341
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:47,347
Andres?

342
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,474
Hello, Vincent?

343
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:55,022
Do you remember a case involving
your mom around 30 years ago?

344
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,357
No. Why? What happened?

345
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,861
I don't know. I just saw
her name in an old logbook.

346
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,032
The report said she came to the
precinct with physical injuries.

347
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,161
But she's not the type
to get involved in that.

348
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,163
Here's what's odd.

349
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,123
It never became a case.

350
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,667
It's like it was covered up.

351
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:25,802
Vincent?

352
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,804
Where are you, Edward?

353
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,807
I'm actually on my way
to my unit.

354
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:31,975
Where's Mom?

355
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,061
On the way there too.

356
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,604
She has my stuff.

357
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,439
I'm moving in today.

358
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,855
- Mom.
- Oh!

359
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,982
Oh my god.
You startled me.

360
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,111
Mom, what are you doing here?

361
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,446
Edward's a grown-up.

362
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,448
You don't have to
baby him anymore.

363
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,827
I'm just trying to talk
some sense into your brother.

364
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,871
He's impulsive, like you.

365
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,166
I'm not even done
renovating this unit.

366
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,627
What are you doing here?

367
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,298
Edward said you'd be here.

368
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,801
Truth is...

369
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,221
I want to talk you, Mom.

370
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,390
About what?

371
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,937
You filed a report at a
police precinct 30 years ago.

372
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,273
What happened?

373
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,819
How did you find out about that?

374
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,696
You came with
physical injuries

375
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,115
asking for help
from the police.

376
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,701
It was nothing.

377
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,912
Why didn't you file a case?

378
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,540
And why was
the report incomplete?

379
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,544
Listen, I was
a victim of a robbery.

380
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,838
I fought back
that's why I was injured.

381
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:28,049
But it was a waste of time
to press charges.

382
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,930
Please, don't be paranoid.

383
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,851
Not everything
is some bad conspiracy.

384
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:41,229
You only feel this way
because of Walter's case.

385
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,801
What's the matter?

386
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,972
Vincent found out about
what happened before.

387
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,058
What do you mean?

388
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,606
He knows about the incident
30 years ago.

389
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,274
What do you mean?

390
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,526
What does he know?

391
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,694
Not a lot.

392
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,532
The police have no records.

393
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,785
But I had to lie
to Vincent again.

394
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:42,290
We kept this a secret
for so long, Arthur!

395
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,960
I can't go back.

396
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,044
I can't.

397
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,924
It's been 30 years.

398
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,969
But I remember it
like it was yesterday.

399
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,860
Wait!

400
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,862
Who is it?

401
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:16,825
What are you doing here?

402
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,119
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

403
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,954
- Whose house is this?
- Wait.

404
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,039
- Jacqueline, let me explain.
- Huh?

405
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,541
- What are you hiding?
- Wait.

406
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,293
- Wait.
- Who's here?!

407
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,170
- There!
- Wait.

408
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,255
Arthur?

409
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,010
- I knew it!
- Arthur?

410
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,095
Jacqueline, wait!

411
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,560
How dare you!

412
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:48,064
We have children,
you homewrecker!

413
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,774
- He loves me.
- What?

414
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,067
You whore!

415
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,031
Rebecca...

416
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,369
Arthur...

417
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,210
Vincent cannot find out
about what happened.

418
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,295
I know, I know.

419
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,176
I will not let that happen.

420
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,597
Vincent won't find out
about anything else.

421
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,641
Only Walter knows the truth,

422
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,602
and brought that
with him to the grave.

423
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,194
Let me.

424
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,711
Sir, wait.

425
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,588
As usual,
please sign here first.

426
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,135
Thanks.

427
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,637
Alright, sir.

428
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,891
- Bro!
- Sir, sir!

429
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,976
- Please sign here first.
- Wait.

430
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,106
George Tobias.

431
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:12,899
Done. Thank you.

432
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,192
- Okay, sir.
- Bro.

433
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,277
I discovered a file.

434
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,073
Condominium Certificate
of Title. CCT.

435
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,242
Here.

436
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,207
The condo is under
Walter's name.

437
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,210
Yeah, and why was
he given a condo?

438
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,504
That's what we need to find out.

439
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,215
Bro. What are we going to do?

440
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:40,427
If anyone knows what his life
in the condo was like,

441
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,972
it would be his neighbors.

442
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,060
I've got an idea.

443
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,743
Bro.

444
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,704
Do you think this will work?

445
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,916
George, not everything can
be done the easy way.

446
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,004
We can't talk to
every single person here,

447
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,966
but we can find a way
to make them come to us.

448
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,932
How long have you
been living here?

449
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,642
Um, four years now.

450
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,186
I've been here
three years.

451
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,480
Actually, our units
are on the same floor.

452
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:37,734
Okay. So, how was
Walter as a neighbor?

453
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,611
Um, he was okay.

454
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:43,114
He didn't really mingle much
with the other homeowners.

455
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,782
- Yeah.
- Well, hopefully,

456
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,660
my sibling will mingle
with the other homeowners.

457
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,872
Congrats, Eddie Boy!

458
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,208
- Hey, Matt.
- Yeah!

459
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,210
Hey, Vincent!

460
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,294
George!

461
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,422
What are you doing here?

462
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,966
I saw this at home.

463
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,010
I should probably be offended.

464
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:08,014
What's this? Just you and
Eddie Boy having all the fun?

465
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,892
You don't want to invite
Mighty Matthew to celebrate

466
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,895
Eddie Boy's newfound
independence?

467
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,273
Enough talking. Let's party!

468
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,609
The lighting is so boring!

469
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,402
There we go!

470
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,738
Let's set the mood!

471
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:25,532
This is a housewarming
party, right?

472
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,159
Everybody!

473
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,495
Mighty Matthew brought
the drinks!

474
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,955
Let's party!

475
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,965
Edward.

476
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,467
What are you doing here?

477
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,136
Oh, I saw Matthew's story.

478
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,807
You're having a party
and didn't even tell me.

479
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,142
So what's going on here?

480
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,477
Housewarming party.

481
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,312
I live here now.

482
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,441
Where's Katherine?

483
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:02,944
She's not here.

484
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,201
Yo, Katherine!

485
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,420
Excuse me.

486
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,636
Good thing you made it.

487
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,013
- Katherine.
- Oh.

488
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,477
Katherine.

489
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,564
I'm so happy you're here.

490
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,777
Guys, this is Katherine.

491
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:46,946
My girlfriend.

492
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,543
When I say mighty,
you say Matthew!

493
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,878
- Mighty!
- Matthew!

494
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,838
- Mighty! Hey!
- Matthew!

495
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,674
Drink more, drink more!

496
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,759
Yes!

497
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,722
Ma'am.

498
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,226
Is there a problem?

499
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,520
You guys are so loud in here.

500
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,856
You're disturbing the neighbors.

501
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:24,567
Sorry, we're just having
a housewarming party.

502
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,195
If you want,
you can eat here.

503
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,198
No, it's fine.
You're being a nuisance.

504
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:34,327
I thought it would be
quiet once Walter left,

505
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,870
but apparently not.

506
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:41,042
What did Walter do here before?

507
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,962
Walter was such a huge
nuisance when he lived here.

508
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,048
He loved throwing parties.

509
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,009
I even reported him to
the admin a few times.

510
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:54,472
I could see all sorts
of women coming over.

511
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,517
But there was one woman
who came over all the time.

512
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,649
Is she the one who
came here all the time?

513
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,361
Not her. This one.

514
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,530
She's the one
who was here often.

515
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,864
Are you sure about that?

516
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,700
Yes.

517
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,160
I don't know what was
going on between them,

518
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,954
but she came here often.

519
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,999
Whenever I reported
Walter to the admin,

520
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,335
she was the one who
came to handle the mess.

521
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,800
Mom!

522
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,302
Vincent.

523
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,763
Why did you want
to see me, dear?

524
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,391
I thought Walter was just
one of the people dad helped?

525
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,726
What are you talking about?

526
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,854
We found out he was
bringing women to the condo,

527
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,273
and you were one of the
people who visited him often.

528
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,774
What are you talking about?

529
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,943
Did you really think
we wouldn't find out

530
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:51,195
that the condo is registered
under Walter's name?

531
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,406
Who exactly was
Walter in our lives?

532
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,283
Was he Dad’s protégé,

533
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,076
an employee,
or a family friend?

534
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,537
What are you hiding?!

535
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,457
Enough, Vincent. Stop!

536
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,127
Mom, answer me.

537
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,839
Did you have an affair
with Walter?

538
00:34:13,842 --> 00:34:15,678
- Mom!
- In the past!

539
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:20,016
Yes, I had an affair
with Walter.

540
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,024
I just met your mom recently,

541
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,484
but it never crossed
my mind that

542
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,027
she could do
something like that.

543
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,821
If Walter really did have
an affair with my mom,

544
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,158
that would be reason enough
for my dad to want to kill him.

545
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,702
Stella...

546
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,456
No one crosses Arthur Cabrera
and gets away with it.

547
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,958
If your dad knew about their
relationship from the start,

548
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,795
why did he wait so long?

549
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,588
Maybe he had another reason.

550
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,840
Or perhaps...

551
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,842
Walter had something
on Arthur Cabrera

552
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,345
that kept him from being killed.

553
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,477
That's what I need to find out.

554
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,358
Vincent, come take
a look at this.

555
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,199
Katherine and I
found this, Vincent.

556
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,494
I told her we'll only tell you.

557
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,497
Since we don't yet know
what's hidden behind that wall,

558
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,873
it might be dangerous.

559
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,585
You made the right decision,
Edward.

560
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,671
The less Katherine knows,

561
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,881
the safer she's going to be.

562
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,480
There's a room
behind the wall?

563
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,023
I know, right?

564
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,368
Have you checked the other side?

565
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,873
Not yet. I don't know
if it has that.

566
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,528
What the hell was Walter up to?

567
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,826
Vincent.

568
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,387
What do we do now?

569
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,351
I know someone
who can help us.

570
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,320
Bro.

571
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,656
He's still working on it.

572
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,741
But it's almost open.

573
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,159
You're just in time.

574
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,286
Where's Stella?

575
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,414
She'll be here. She just
had to stop by somewhere.

576
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,877
Oh! There you go!

577
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,004
It's done.

578
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,007
Thank you, Mister.

579
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,510
- I'll see you out.
- Okay.

580
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,763
Mister Johnny,
Edward will pay you.

581
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,515
- Thank you.
- Alright.

582
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,683
Let's go.

583
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,295
It's all bank documents.

584
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,548
And the amounts are huge!

585
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,384
Everything is under
Walter's name.

586
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,852
Vincent.

587
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,981
It's your birth certificate.

588
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,948
Since I was
just accidentally found,

589
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,700
I didn't have
a birth certificate.

590
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,244
I only had an official
birth certificate

591
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:51,620
when I got adopted.

592
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,541
It's indicated there that
Mom and Dad are my parents.

593
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,960
I'm just wondering

594
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,503
why this is in Walter's safe

595
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,797
when everyone knows
that I'm adopted.

596
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,467
Is that real?

597
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,678
We already know
how Walter worked.

598
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,722
This was all part
of his plan.

599
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,307
But...

600
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,976
what was he planning to do
with this birth certificate?

601
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,188
He wouldn't have been
able to use this against us.

602
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:30,951
This is my mom.

603
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,163
The woman in the picture
is my mom.

604
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,624
Wait.

605
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,587
Why would your mom's picture
be in Walter's safe?

606
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,923
What is it doing here?

607
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,391
Your vital signs
are still normal.

608
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,185
That means

609
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,062
you'll still live longer.

610
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,856
Well?

611
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,359
What are we going to do
with that patient?

612
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,611
That's what
I'm thinking.

613
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:08,155
How are we going
to get paid?

614
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,490
You know,

615
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,201
if we weren't getting paid big,

616
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,036
I wouldn't stay here
and do this.

617
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,956
Now I know why he hasn't been
calling or visiting.

618
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,415
He's already dead.

619
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:23,504
What the heck is this,
Sir Walter?!

620
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,507
Tend to your patient.

621
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,676
Look.

622
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,428
Sir Walter is already dead.

623
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,681
The problem is,
we don't know how to get

624
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,641
our payment from him.

625
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,686
My mom...

626
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,273
isn't like other moms.

627
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,150
She doesn't care about her kids.

628
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,527
She'd go with different men
every time.

629
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,821
So, after she left you,

630
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,614
she never tried to contact you?

631
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,160
She disappeared like a ghost.

632
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,786
Did you try to find her?

633
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,996
Why should I?

634
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,206
Do you think

635
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,750
that was the first time
she abandoned me?

636
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,420
When I was a kid,

637
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,256
she would always leave me
with our relatives.

638
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,550
And whenever she'd come back,

639
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,553
she'd bring a new kid in tow.

640
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,971
So...

641
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:17,266
Why would Walter have
your mom's picture?

642
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,061
Do they know each other?

643
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,400
I don't know.

644
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,529
That was an old picture of Mama.

645
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,700
I wonder what connection
she had with Walter.

646
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,956
Are you sure
you're her firstborn?

647
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,710
Vincent.

648
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,129
It's indicated
in Walter's records

649
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,173
that his mom is Teresa Lopez.

650
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,966
Walter wouldn't have
flirted with me

651
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,593
if he knew

652
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,637
that we're siblings.

653
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,681
Walter warned you
about our family.

654
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,102
I wonder how they're
all connected to each other.

655
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,396
I think it's unlikely
for my mother

656
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,857
to have any connection
to your family.

657
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,609
That's impossible.

658
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,403
Their worlds are too far apart for their paths to intersect.

659
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,640
Uh... I-I badly need some
right now.

660
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,850
Where are you?

661
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:42,935
Okay.

662
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,275
Where are you going?

663
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,236
Um... I just...

664
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,446
have some errands to do.

665
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,491
Why don't you just let Fiona
run your errands?

666
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,955
Why? Am I being held
as a prisoner here?

667
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,623
After all that's happened,

668
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,500
I don't want anything
to happen to Bea.

669
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,004
And you know,
you're going back to your...

670
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,256
old bad habits.

671
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,717
Are you using that against me?

672
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,010
Not at all.

673
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,263
I'm stopping you because I
don't want you to ruin yourself.

674
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,600
Not just for Bea but because
you're part of this family.

675
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:25,811
At this point,

676
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,981
I don't know what family
means anymore.

677
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,651
And us being a united front?

678
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,986
I don't think so.

679
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,240
Because everyone here
has their own agenda.

680
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,201
What are you talking about?

681
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,497
What do you know
about Walter's death?

682
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,711
Who really killed him?

683
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:56,008
I have a feeling
that Claudia's up to something.

684
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,926
She's plotting something
behind our backs.

685
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,512
What do you think she can do?

686
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,097
Did you talk to her?

687
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,891
Maybe you've said
or done something

688
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,643
that's making her act this way.

689
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,146
Arthur, she's been acting up!

690
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,427
I still have
all the evidence here.

691
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,096
I'm afraid.

692
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,348
Claudia may be playing us.

693
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,850
Maybe she's just waiting
for the right time.

694
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,813
Remember, she had
an affair with Walter.

695
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,566
It's possible she knows
everything Walter knew.

696
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:03,302
"Complainant: Jacqueline Cabrera
Respondent: Unidentified Male"

697
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,637
"Nature of Complaint: Rape"

698
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,025
Vincent.

699
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,902
Are you really sure about this?

700
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,031
Only my mom
can answer my questions.

701
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,875
Stella, just stay here.

702
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,044
Vincent...

703
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,652
Mom.

704
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,738
- Vincent!
- What are you burning?

705
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,031
Uh, it's nothing.

706
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:09,409
- Uh, let's just stay inside.
- Answer my question.

707
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,869
I said it's nothing!

708
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,551
Claudia's becoming a liability.

709
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,345
She is the weakest link.

710
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:32,015
Is the evidence we've gathered
enough to use against her?

711
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,643
Why do you want
to burn this?

712
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,937
I was just decluttering stuff.
T-That's nothing.

713
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,775
Mom, you told me
this is just some petty crime.

714
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:44,152
- What are you really hiding?
- It's really nothing.

715
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,613
And you think I'll believe you?

716
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,282
Did you really come here
to visit me,

717
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,200
or to accuse me?!

718
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:54,162
I came here because
I need answers from you.

719
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,622
About what?

720
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,249
About my identity.

721
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,296
About who
my real parents really are.

722
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,132
Come on, Vincent!
After all this time?!

723
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,884
Why do you want
to know who they are?

724
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,928
Why the sudden interest?

725
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,764
Do you know them?

726
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,267
Mom, did they try to find me?

727
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,102
What's going on with you?!

728
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,570
It's because of this.

729
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,040
What are you doing here?

730
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,916
I-I just came along
with Vincent.

731
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,835
He wants to talk to his mom.

732
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,130
Just let them talk
to each other in private.

733
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,841
- Get out of my sight!
- Ow!

734
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,944
How did you get this?

735
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,821
How did that end up with Walter?

736
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,990
He was blackmailing me.

737
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,076
He wanted more cash.

738
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,869
He wanted more property.

739
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:20,165
And this is the proof
of what a terrible person he is!

740
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,293
And how could he use that
against you, Mom?

741
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,586
Hold on.

742
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,297
Is it true that you and Walter
had a relationship?

743
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,590
Are you and Dad both going

744
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,009
to keep feeding me
nothing but lies?!

745
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,552
Vincent.

746
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,595
Mom!

747
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,681
Vincent, get out of here!

748
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,307
- Mom!
- Leave!

749
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:41,228
I'm not leaving until I get
the answers I deserve to know!

750
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,397
Just tell the truth.

751
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,149
Don't you care about
your son's peace of mind?

752
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,818
Shut up!

753
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:51,697
- You don't get to speak!
- Hey, why are you so mad, Dad?!

754
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,407
What are you and Mom
hiding from me?!

755
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,826
- Shut up!
- What are you hiding from me?!

756
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,828
- Arthur, stop!
- Shut up!

757
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,037
- Aah!
- Shut up!

758
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,289
Arthur, stop it! No!

759
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,166
Vincent!

760
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,127
Vincent. Vincent.

761
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,757
Just tell me the truth!

762
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,394
Don't listen to him.

763
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,065
You're my son, Vincent.

764
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,152
I'm your real mother.

765
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:42,038
If you're my real mother...

766
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,248
Hold on...

767
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,004
Who's my real father? W-Why
isn't his name on the document?

768
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:51,965
Mom!

769
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:53,925
Mom, just answer me!

770
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,428
You've kept this from me
my entire life!

771
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:59,222
Just answer me!

772
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,932
Mom, just answer me!

773
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,685
- Is it hard to tell me?!
- Shut up! I said, enough!

774
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,687
- Stay out of this!
- For so many years...

775
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,397
Mom, just tell me.

776
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:11,818
I couldn't tell you who your
father is because I don't know!

777
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,571
Because I was raped!

778
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,535
What?

779
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,374
What?

780
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,839
Your dad and I had problems.

781
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,552
I went to a bar
to drown my sorrows.

782
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,016
Excuse me, miss.

783
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:45,894
Hi.

784
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:50,232
I just noticed you took off
your wedding ring.

785
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,901
Looks like you have a problem.

786
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,196
It's nothing.

787
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,662
You know what, miss?

788
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,330
I have time for you.

789
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:07,666
And...

790
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,960
I'm willing to listen.

791
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,602
Miss, what happened to you?

792
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,895
Miss?

793
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,067
I was raped.

794
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,152
Who did that to you?

795
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,740
I-I don't know.

796
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,285
You don't know the name
of the guy you slept with?

797
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,872
I didn't have proof.

798
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,832
I couldn't prove it.

799
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,626
It would do more harm than good.

800
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,796
So, I dropped the case.

801
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,967
Mom, why did you hide
all this from me?!

802
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,969
Your mom did nothing wrong!

803
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:06,474
I made the decision
to hide your true identity.

804
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:13,148
I agreed to accept you
as a Cabrera!

805
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:16,234
Because that's how much
I love your mom!

806
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,906
I agreed to hide
your true identity.

807
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,575
Because I wanted
to protect this family!

808
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:29,873
Because I don't want
this tragedy to define us!

809
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,421
Now you know!

810
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,672
I do!

811
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,093
And I'm a constant reminder
of this tragedy!

812
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,097
That's how you see me,
right, Dad?

813
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,684
Now...

814
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,898
Now I understand everything.

815
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,444
Mom...

816
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:03,698
I'm so--

817
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,911
I'm sorry about
what happened to you.

818
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:13,208
I'm sorry it had
to reach this point.

819
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,837
Mommy, I'm sorry.

820
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,176
I'm sorry my existence
caused you so much pain.

821
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,263
But thank you.

822
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,103
Mom, thank you
for telling me the truth.

823
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,357
And thank you for loving me.

824
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:41,903
And now...

825
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,116
We all know the truth.

826
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,912
You don't have
to pretend anymore.

827
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:55,333
And I don't have to force myself
into this family anymore.

828
00:54:56,751 --> 00:55:00,046
Because from now on,
I'm no longer a Cabrera.

829
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,137
Vincent.

830
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:09,931
Vincent.

831
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,149
Vincent!

832
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,860
Vincent.

833
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,951
You think this is
what I wanted to happen?

834
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:33,121
Don't make your mom
feel any worse!

835
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,415
Isn't this easier for you,

836
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,335
instead of tolerating my
existence in your family?

837
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,964
After everything I've done
for you, Vincent...

838
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,675
I hope this isn't your way
of being ungrateful.

839
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,386
I'm grateful for everything.

840
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,140
Mom loves me.

841
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,684
But you?

842
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:57,479
You could never accept me
into the family.

843
00:55:57,562 --> 00:56:01,107
And not a day went by
you didn't make me feel that.

844
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,400
You know what, Dad?

845
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:06,321
Now I understand why I'm being
caught up in Walter's case.

846
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:09,783
Because I was
the easiest fall guy.

847
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,660
You're still not done
accusing me?

848
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,997
I am protecting our family.

849
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,666
I am protecting all of you!

850
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,294
With all your digging,

851
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:23,421
you've ruined us!

852
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,507
Do you understand?!

853
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,217
You've ruined all of us!

854
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,304
- You've ruined this family!
- You're ruining my life!

855
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:38,269
And even if you don't admit it,
I know everything you're up to.

856
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:43,149
All I need to know
is what Walter had on you

857
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,360
that made you do all this!

858
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,279
And I'll eventually
find that out.

859
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,620
Vincent!

860
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:12,720
Vincent.

861
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,432
Aah!

862
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,312
Vincent, Vincent, Vincent.

863
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,606
Vincent. Vincent. Vincent.

864
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,358
Vincent.

865
00:57:25,441 --> 00:57:26,985
Vincent.

866
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,156
I'm here for you.

867
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,285
You won't face this alone, okay?

868
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:56,890
Vincent.

869
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,392
Despite...

870
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,730
Despite all the bad things
in my life...

871
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:08,484
You're the only good thing
that's ever happened to me.

872
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,699
No matter what...

873
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,993
I'll never leave your side.

874
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,622
That's my promise.

875
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,082
Okay?

876
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,711
I promise you won't be alone
in this fight.

877
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,982
I know you still have
a lot of questions on your mind.

878
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,735
Of course, this is painful
for your mother too.

879
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:53,071
I hope you two
can talk again soon.

880
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,123
Vincent? Vincent.

881
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,375
Claudia?!

882
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,961
Vincent, I need your help.

883
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,462
Help me, please!

884
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:13,424
Vincent, I need your help.

885
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,550
What's going on?

886
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,636
You need to get me
out of here!

887
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,137
Please help me.

888
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,597
Help me.

889
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:29,649
Gah!

890
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:32,110
The evidence I have
is so important.

891
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,737
If Vincent finds out,
he'll never forgive us!

892
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,281
We need to find her first.

893
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:38,992
Are you sure you don't know
where Claudia is?

894
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,785
She'll eventually
come out of hiding.

895
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,996
Finding Claudia is
our top priority.

896
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,498
- She's safe.
- Where is she?

897
00:59:45,581 --> 00:59:47,500
What if she's just
deceiving us?

898
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,002
I'll tell you
everything I know.

899
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,838
We're on our way, Claudia.
Stay where you are, okay?
