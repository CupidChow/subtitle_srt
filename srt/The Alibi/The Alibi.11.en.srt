1
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,871
<i>Now, we wait
for someone to slip up.</i>

2
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,748
<i>That's why we have
to be extra careful,</i>

3
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,667
<i>so they don't find out what
we're doing from here on out.</i>

4
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,295
<i>We kept this a secret
for so long!</i>

5
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,880
<i>Vincent cannot find out
about what happened.</i>

6
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,673
<i>I will not let that happen.</i>

7
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,884
<i>It's all bank documents.
And the amounts are huge!</i>

8
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,135
<i>Everything is under
Walter's name.</i>

9
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,888
<i>Why would Walter have
your mom's picture?</i>

10
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,014
<i>I don't know.</i>

11
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,265
<i>I wonder what connection
she had with Walter.</i>

12
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,392
<i>I don't know what family
means anymore.</i>

13
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,560
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

14
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,645
<i>What do you know
about Walter's death?</i>

15
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,606
<i>Who really killed him?</i>

16
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,984
<i>I couldn't tell you who your
father is because I don't know!</i>

17
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,153
<i>Because I was raped!</i>

18
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,071
<i>Mom, why did you hide
all this from me?!</i>

19
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,073
<i>Your mom did nothing wrong!</i>

20
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,075
<i>I agreed to accept you
as a Cabrera!</i>

21
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,455
<i>Because I don't want
this tragedy to define us!</i>

22
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,582
<i>Despite all the bad things
in my life...</i>

23
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,251
<i>you're the only good thing
that's ever happened to me.</i>

24
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,462
<i>I'll never leave your side.</i>

25
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,797
<i>That's my promise.</i>

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,256
<i>Vincent, I need your help.</i>

27
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,634
<i>You need to get me
out of here!</i>

28
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,011
<i>Please help me. Help me.</i>

29
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,889
You need to get me
out of here!

30
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,682
Please.

31
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,684
Please help me. Help me.

32
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,562
Your Dad is out to get me.

33
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,440
And he'll frame me
for Walter's death!

34
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,360
Why would they do that to you?

35
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,779
Can you stay out of this?
I'm not talking to you!

36
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,614
Calm down, Claudia.

37
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,282
Wait, are you high again?

38
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,117
No, Vincent!

39
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,994
You have to believe me!

40
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,330
Then why would
he do that to you?

41
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,790
I-I don't know!

42
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,125
I don't know!
But he seems so desperate.

43
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,962
He wanted to close
Walter's case!

44
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,672
I don't know what's happening!

45
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,926
This is the evidence.

46
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,719
What's in that?

47
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,930
This holds what truly happened
with Walter's death.

48
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,104
But I'll only give it to you
if you'd help me.

49
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,647
And why would I help you?

50
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,859
You think you're to be trusted
after what you did?

51
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,611
Vincent, you don't have
any other choice!

52
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,780
If you want them
to stop suspecting you,

53
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,240
you have to trust me

54
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,075
that I'm telling you the truth!

55
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,536
Because this will finally prove
your innocence.

56
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,579
Hold on.

57
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,621
What about Bea?

58
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,373
- Shit!

59
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,708
Bea! My daughter.

60
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,084
No, I'll take care of it.

61
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,752
I'll look after Bea.
Go ahead without me.

62
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,754
- With her?
- Let's talk about it later.

63
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,214
We'd run out of time. Come on.

64
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,340
Stella, look after her.

65
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,675
Text and call, okay?

66
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,968
Come on. Let's go, Claudia.

67
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,304
Go get Bea. Call us, okay?

68
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,555
Let's go.

69
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,140
Hurry.

70
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,975
Be careful.

71
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,712
Daddy, where are we going?

72
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,049
Where are you going?

73
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,427
Bea will be staying with me.

74
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,220
Where's Claudia?

75
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,348
Why is she not here?
Does she know about this?

76
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,184
I've been calling her
and she's not picking up.

77
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,727
Do you know where she is?

78
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,271
- Nope.
- Did something happen?

79
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,943
Something happened to Mommy?

80
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,449
Bea will be staying at my house.

81
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,575
She's my responsibility

82
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,577
I don't want to entrust her
to other people.

83
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,287
Say goodbye to Grandpa.

84
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,413
Goodbye.

85
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,399
Jacqueline...

86
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,908
Arthur...

87
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,119
I can't get tired.

88
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,287
We need to do what's right.

89
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,124
I need to talk to Vincent again.

90
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,084
Just give him time.

91
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,671
Don't think of anything else.

92
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,923
Rest.

93
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,468
How can I rest when these things
are happening in our family?!

94
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,762
We should've...

95
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,393
we should've told Vincent
the truth a long time ago.

96
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,063
We've agreed on this
a long time ago.

97
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,109
And we both made that choice.

98
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,820
It's all my fault!

99
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,113
It's my fault!

100
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,659
Don't just blame yourself.

101
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,079
A big part of it is my fault,
too, Jacqueline.

102
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,914
I am to blame.

103
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,170
All of this
wouldn't have happened

104
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,298
if I hadn't gotten Rebecca
as a whistleblower.

105
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,301
<i>Don't worry.</i>

106
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,720
<i>You're safe here. I got you.</i>

107
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,056
<i>Thank you, Arthur.</i>

108
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,850
<i>I should be the one to thank you
because you trusted me.</i>

109
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,606
<i>Are you sure it's him?</i>

110
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,068
<i>Mayor Naval Reyes.</i>

111
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,662
<i>No.</i>

112
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,916
<i>I'm never going to forget
his face.</i>

113
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,586
<i>He raped my friend.</i>

114
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,799
<i>He attempted to abuse me
but I escaped.</i>

115
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,342
<i>That's why, Arthur,</i>

116
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,010
<i>promise me</i>

117
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,221
<i>that we'll get justice.</i>

118
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,139
<i>We need to plan this out
thoroughly.</i>

119
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,391
<i>We're fighting
against someone big.</i>

120
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,520
During moments
when I need validation,

121
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,147
she was there to listen.

122
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,857
I gave in to temptation.

123
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,111
<i>Did you and Jacqueline
fight again?</i>

124
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,407
<i>I'm tired
of proving myself worthy</i>

125
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,867
<i>to Jacqueline's family.</i>

126
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,956
<i>They're rich but they're not
the ones feeding me.</i>

127
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,126
<i>I know that she fought for me
when she married me.</i>

128
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,710
<i>But is that how far it goes?</i>

129
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,421
<i>When her dad speaks ill of me,</i>

130
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,965
<i>she can't speak up.</i>

131
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,424
<i>For god's sake,
I'm a journalist.</i>

132
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,761
<i>And I can't even stand up
for my own family.</i>

133
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,518
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

134
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,688
<i>For always venting out to you.</i>

135
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,316
<i>Hey. It's okay.</i>

136
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,526
<i>I understand.</i>

137
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,735
<i>Just eat.</i>

138
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,196
<i>Wait!</i>

139
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,657
<i>Who is it?</i>

140
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,992
<i>- Wait.
- Who is it?!</i>

141
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,619
<i>- W-Wait, Jacquel...
- Arthur?</i>

142
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,996
<i>Jacqueline, wait!</i>

143
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,914
<i>How dare you, homewrecker?!</i>

144
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,753
<i>Rebecca.</i>

145
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,591
<i>Arthur... Arthur...</i>

146
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,177
<i>Arthur...</i>

147
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,889
<i>Arthur...</i>

148
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,855
<i>Excuse me, miss.</i>

149
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,239
<i>Jacqueline...</i>

150
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,659
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

151
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,453
<i>I know what I did was wrong.</i>

152
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,830
<i>I will leave Rebecca,</i>

153
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,248
because you're the one...

154
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,791
<i>I love.</i>

155
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,503
<i>So please forgive me.</i>

156
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,800
<i>Jacqueline, please.</i>

157
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,636
<i>Please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

158
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,679
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

159
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,306
<i>Please.</i>

160
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,643
<i>Please talk to me.
Forgive me, Jacqueline.</i>

161
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,894
<i>Please.</i>

162
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,521
<i>Jacqueline, what's happening
to you?</i>

163
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,066
<i>Please, talk to me.
Jacqueline, please!</i>

164
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,609
<i>Please!</i>

165
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,860
<i>Please.</i>

166
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,404
<i>I was raped, Arthur!</i>

167
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,950
<i>Someone took advantage of me!</i>

168
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,702
<i>Someone took advantage of me, Arthur!</i>

169
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,704
<i>Someone took advantage of me.</i>

170
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,874
<i>I was raped.</i>

171
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,585
That was so long ago.

172
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,047
It's all in the past now.

173
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,593
We already corrected
our mistakes.

174
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,178
We need to move on.

175
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,847
How could we move on
when the past keeps haunting us?

176
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,350
Just like how

177
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,936
Walter used our past

178
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,521
to blackmail us.

179
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,815
And that's why
we're in this mess.

180
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,484
Our family even got involved.

181
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,742
And Stella just had to force
her way into our lives!

182
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,494
What matters is...

183
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,914
Rebecca is gone now.

184
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,625
We can move past
Walter's case, too.

185
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,502
We'll be at peace eventually.

186
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:50,423
Why does it feel more like a lie
than a promise?

187
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,552
Trust me.

188
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,220
We can overcome all of this

189
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,097
as long as we're together.

190
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,506
Are you even sure
that we're safe here?

191
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:38,179
Vincent said this
is the safest place for us.

192
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,765
Am I that unlucky

193
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,850
that I was saved by you
of all people?

194
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,188
Why? Do you have other choices?

195
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,397
You don't, right?

196
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,191
You're welcome, by the way.

197
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:53,277
Just be grateful.

198
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,279
Whatever.

199
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,073
You know what?
Just buy me new clothes,

200
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,783
shampoo... I don't know.

201
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,077
If you can put up
with the dirt and smell,

202
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,453
well, I can't!

203
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,039
I guess you're used to trash,
so you're fine.

204
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,083
You're so rude!

205
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,710
Vincent told me not
to leave you here.

206
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,296
Then call him again
so you can leave.

207
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,131
I only want to be with him
right now.

208
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,174
Well, ma'am,

209
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,635
I know that you hate me.

210
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,012
I don't like you either,
you know.

211
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,556
I'm just helping you out
because we need you.

212
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,225
And Vincent told me to.

213
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,893
What do you have anyway?

214
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,354
Why is Vincent's father
after you?

215
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,524
Why would I even tell you?

216
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,610
I don't trust you ever since.

217
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,404
So whatever you do,

218
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,156
it won't change
the way I see you.

219
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,284
You're still
a homewrecker... bitch!

220
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,622
"Bitch," whatever.

221
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,417
You're not just a crackhead,
you're also crazy.

222
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,001
My gosh!

223
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,302
Damn it!

224
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,725
Dad?

225
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,811
What happened?

226
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,362
There's something I want you
to do.

227
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,990
There's something I want you
to do, Matthew.

228
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:31,208
Oh my goodness,
I have an adorable visitor!

229
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,587
I'm not a visitor, Uncle George.

230
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,089
I'm going to live here
with Daddy from now on.

231
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,925
What?! Then I won't be
the only cute one living here.

232
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,969
There will be two of us now!

233
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,013
Bea?

234
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,890
Stay with Uncle George, okay?

235
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,850
Daddy needs to go somewhere.

236
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,186
Okay, Daddy.

237
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,771
But don't take too long.

238
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,774
Let's sleep beside
each other, Daddy.

239
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,858
Okay, sweetie.

240
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:58,986
Give Daddy a kiss.

241
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,239
Okay.

242
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,533
George, all her stuff's here.

243
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,495
- Clothes, toys, everything.
- Okay, bro.

244
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,039
Captain,
Claudia only left a while ago.

245
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,957
<i>She couldn't have gone far.</i>

246
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,876
My men are already
looking for her.

247
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,170
But I need your help.

248
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:22,760
Chairman,
that's not part of the deal.

249
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,136
That's not a problem!

250
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,515
I will pay you more, just
do what I'm asking, Captain!

251
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,599
Okay?

252
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,144
I feel so sorry for you,
Vincent.

253
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,482
That explains everything.

254
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,028
Why Dad treated you like that.

255
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,906
You don't have to
feel sorry for me.

256
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,283
This won't define my life.

257
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,328
But you've always been that way.

258
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,289
No circumstances
can bring you down.

259
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,958
The way Dad treated you.

260
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,919
Your identity.

261
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,256
But how come you gave up
on our marriage so quickly?

262
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,931
You know why.

263
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,103
Now, I just want to
make things right.

264
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,438
And I hope you can help me.

265
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,317
What's inside that flash drive
you took from Dad?

266
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,361
The truth.

267
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,072
The truth about what?

268
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,825
You really want to know?

269
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,121
Let me leave the country.

270
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,915
Our marriage is hopeless.

271
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,834
Vincent, I can't live like this!

272
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,128
And why would I trust you?

273
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:42,923
Vincent.

274
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,886
Dad wouldn't go after me
if what I took wasn't important.

275
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,725
I will give you the truth
that will set you free.

276
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,609
Ma? I--

277
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:12,119
Ma? Ma?

278
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:26,925
Where's my mother?

279
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,511
Sir, you have a call.

280
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,814
Hello?

281
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,319
<i>If you still want
to see your mother,</i>

282
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,695
<i>let's talk.</i>

283
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,911
Bea, come take a shower

284
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,704
so you can sleep early.

285
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,457
- Come on.
- Thank you, Auntie Stella.

286
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,417
But I might catch a cold.

287
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,835
It's freezing!

288
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,838
Don't worry.

289
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,716
I prepared warm water for you.

290
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,221
I've taken care of
cute kids like you before.

291
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,182
I'm the one
who looks after my siblings.

292
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,351
Why?

293
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,478
You don't have a mommy?

294
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,649
No.

295
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:27,361
I became the mother
to my siblings.

296
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,866
Hey, what's wrong?

297
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,035
Where's Mommy?

298
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,413
She's not here again.

299
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,455
Um...

300
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,708
She and your dad
are doing something.

301
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,752
They'll be back
as soon as they're done.

302
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,925
Hey, you okay, Bea?

303
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,343
I'm okay.

304
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,846
I'm used to it.

305
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:59,184
While they're gone,
I'll take care of you, okay?

306
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:03,021
Sleep next to me again,
Auntie Stella.

307
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,149
Be my mom for now.

308
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:09,653
Please take care of me
like you do your siblings.

309
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,948
Can I hug you?

310
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,628
Andres!

311
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,882
You're lost in thought again.

312
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,427
What's on your mind?

313
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,387
Don't overthink it.

314
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,181
Just do it.

315
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,100
Life is already hard
as it is.

316
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,352
Don't be a hero.

317
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,732
I'll be off now, sir.

318
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,775
By the way,

319
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,360
orders from above,
in case you haven't heard.

320
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,740
Our priority is to
find Claudia ASAP.

321
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,450
If you do find her,

322
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,245
hit me up first.

323
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,747
After that,

324
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,209
wait for further instructions.

325
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,213
And kid,

326
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,133
prove to me you've got this.

327
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,635
I believe in you.

328
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,014
We're all here
for the same thing.

329
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,142
To do what's right.

330
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,230
For our families.

331
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,651
For our families.

332
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,537
This is what implicated Leon.

333
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,996
He's definitely going to jail.

334
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,669
Did he say
who told him to do it?

335
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,922
Or anything related
to Walter's case?

336
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,968
He doesn't want to talk.
His lips are sealed.

337
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,595
But thank you.

338
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,723
One less person
to worry about.

339
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,600
We can investigate freely.

340
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,234
I heard something
about you guys.

341
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,778
Claudia's missing?

342
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,699
Is she with you?

343
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,576
Don't worry.

344
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,953
She's okay.

345
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,205
Where is she?

346
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,499
I can't tell you.

347
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,546
She doesn't trust me yet
because...

348
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,839
Because what?

349
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,967
She has evidence
related to Walter's case.

350
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,469
But I haven't seen it.

351
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,847
She won't show it to me.

352
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,308
She has a bunch of conditions
before she'll let me see it.

353
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,351
Well, do you need help?

354
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,604
No.

355
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,272
I've got this.

356
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,786
What are you doing here?

357
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,458
I brought food for Bea.

358
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,796
I thought you're here
to check if Claudia's here.

359
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,675
Vincent, not today, please.

360
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,511
What happened in the mansion?

361
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,264
Why is Claudia suddenly missing?

362
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,808
I have no idea.

363
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,520
You know Claudia.

364
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,230
She's very unpredictable.

365
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:36,944
I'm worried she might relapse.

366
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,907
U-Uh, let's not let
the food get cold.

367
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,201
They're cooking already.

368
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,870
What do you mean?

369
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,374
There, that's good.

370
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,460
Okay, very good, Bea.

371
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,795
- Bea?
- Wow!

372
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,673
- Grandma!
- Hi!

373
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,176
I brought your favorite food.

374
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:04,513
But Auntie Stella and I
cooked already.

375
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:09,101
That's not good for her.

376
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:15,148
I requested chicken nuggets,
Grandma.

377
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,865
What's the update, Andres?

378
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,202
I confirmed from Vincent
that he is hiding Claudia.

379
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,246
So, where is Claudia?

380
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,164
He won't tell me.

381
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,501
I have to work on
gaining his trust.

382
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,004
Given the situation,
he's being extra careful.

383
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,966
You'll gain his trust, right?

384
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,013
- So, what's your next move?
- I won't wait for him to talk.

385
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,889
I have connections with telcos.

386
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,307
I'll have Claudia's
number traced

387
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,686
so we'll know her location
if she tries to call anyone.

388
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,438
We have to make sure.

389
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,858
What if she doesn't have her
phone with her wherever she is?

390
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:01,987
If it turns out that's the case,
I have another plan ready.

391
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,864
But I'll be needing help.

392
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,575
Sure.

393
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,076
Tell me what you need.

394
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,746
Just make sure you keep
your end of the bargain.

395
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,790
You won't hurt my mother.

396
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,065
Sir Arthur.

397
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,488
I thought I could talk
some sense into Claudia.

398
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,909
She had her chance.

399
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,078
What do you want us to do, sir?

400
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,706
It's time to pull the trigger.

401
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,153
<i>Vincent?</i>

402
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,952
I'll be off now.

403
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,341
What's inside the paper bag?

404
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,845
Oh, it's the food Bea
and Stella cooked.

405
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,055
She had it packed
for me to take home.

406
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,895
Are you still upset with me?

407
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,278
If you really want to
make it up to me,

408
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,739
tell me the truth
about Walter.

409
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,200
There's only one thing
you need to know.

410
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:17,539
There's nothing I won't do
for you, my sons.

411
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,042
You already know
everything you need to know.

412
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,462
Maybe it's time we fix things...

413
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,591
...so we can be
one family again.

414
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,264
I'll get going now.

415
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,859
Vincent, you need to see this.

416
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:52,449
<i>According to the
evidence we have</i>

417
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:57,204
<i>after extensive and
thorough investigation,</i>

418
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,790
<i>our men have made
great progress.</i>

419
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,376
We've reclassified
a person of interest

420
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,629
as our prime suspect

421
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,340
to the murder of Walter Cunanan.

422
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,717
It's no other than...

423
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,679
Ms. Claudia Cabrera.

424
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,976
We've also arrested
her accomplice.

425
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,312
We're just waiting
for his arrival.

426
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,731
- He's here!
- Sir! Sir!

427
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,149
- Sir! Sir!
- Your comment, sir?

428
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,984
Calm down, everyone.
One at a time.

429
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,861
Is it true that
you're Claudia's accomplice?

430
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,949
Claudia Cabrera ordered me
to kill Walter Cunanan.

431
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,325
What was her motive?

432
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,244
She didn't make it clear.

433
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,912
But from what I gathered,

434
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,706
Walter was about to
come clean about their affair.

435
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,458
Ms. Claudia didn't want to get
in trouble with her husband

436
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,584
so she had Walter killed.

437
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,253
- Sir, how long have--
- That's enough for today.

438
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,004
<i>You'll have another chance
to ask questions.</i>

439
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,839
<i>Take him inside.</i>

440
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,598
Claudia.

441
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,101
Hide here for now.
It's safer here.

442
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,104
What do you mean?

443
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,814
Time is running out!

444
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,732
What happened to our agreement?!

445
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,317
Can you just cooperate?

446
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,486
Our enemy is no ordinary man.

447
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,654
Whatever.

448
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,781
You have fix my flight with Bea.

449
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,533
I'll give you a day.

450
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,659
Tell this to Vincent.

451
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,829
- Alright, alright.
- Don't forget, I have evidence.

452
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,330
Yes, I'll tell him.

453
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,416
Just keep your end
of the bargain.

454
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,928
What's your assessment
of the situation?

455
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,725
I don't know, but I'm sure
that Claudia's panicking.

456
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,644
She'll come out eventually.

457
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:56,906
Dad!

458
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,997
Why is Claudia being dragged
into Walter's case?

459
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,624
Did you have something
to do with this?

460
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,917
Why are you asking me?

461
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,669
Aren't you the one
investigating?

462
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,214
And weren't you separating
from Claudia?

463
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,301
Why are you
still concerned for her?

464
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,887
She's still
the mother of my child.

465
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,349
Let's talk in my office.

466
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,118
<i>Walter was about to come
clean about their affair.</i>

467
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,620
<i>Ms. Claudia didn't want to get
in trouble with her husband,</i>

468
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,038
<i>so she had Walter killed.</i>

469
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,415
What the hell?!

470
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,767
Hello, Vincent?

471
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,560
Hello, Claudia?

472
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,065
Matthew?

473
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:15,693
Yes, hi.
Uh... Where are you?

474
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,487
I'm worried about you.

475
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,242
Wait, why do you have
Vincent's phone?

476
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,995
I took it from him
without him knowing.

477
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,707
Why?

478
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,001
To warn you.

479
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,339
I've been trying to contact you,
but I couldn't reach your phone.

480
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,299
I just needed to warn you.

481
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:43,972
Don't you ever trust Vincent.
He'll get you in trouble.

482
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,269
What do you mean?

483
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:52,313
He wagged
the dog again, Claudia.

484
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,275
The press conference
was his idea.

485
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,404
Why should I believe you?

486
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,699
Come on, Claudia.
Don't be so naive.

487
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,077
Did you think that Vincent
would actually help you?

488
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:10,415
He won't let you take Bea, okay?

489
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,209
<i>Let the police handle Claudia.</i>

490
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,879
Let them do their job.
Stay out of it.

491
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,465
The police are the problem, Mom.

492
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:23,470
How could I trust the police
if they keep acting against me,

493
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,681
Stella, and now, Claudia?

494
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,601
Even Walter's autopsy is wrong.

495
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,936
It feels like someone's
pulling the strings.

496
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,688
It's not about justice.

497
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,857
It's not about
who's right or wrong.

498
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:39,360
It's about someone
trying to cover for their sin.

499
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,406
Why don't you just say that
you're accusing me, Vincent?

500
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,366
Claudia was in the villa, too.

501
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,869
She had motive
and the opportunity.

502
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,206
Didn't you say that the cause
of death was poisoning?

503
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,333
Isn't that what it says
on Walter's re-autopsy?

504
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:57,712
Would that have been done
by someone Walter trusted?

505
00:29:57,795 --> 00:30:01,424
Someone like his own mistress?

506
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,677
Hold on.

507
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,891
How did you know...

508
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,477
the results of Walter's
re-autopsy?

509
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,063
It's Claudia!

510
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,814
She told me!

511
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:21,194
Who do you think
she'll go to first

512
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,197
after you accused her
of killing Walter?

513
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,741
That's the problem
with you, Vincent.

514
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:29,577
You're full of speculations when
you should just be satisfied!

515
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,580
You should be happy that
Walter's case is being resolved.

516
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,582
We'll finally have some peace!

517
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,338
<i>Do you really think
Vincent will still fix</i>

518
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,715
whatever his dealings
are with you?

519
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,177
Claudia, you're the number
one suspect.

520
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,512
No.

521
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,930
No.

522
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,349
No, that's not...
That's not true.

523
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:55,353
Power trumps the truth
every single time, Claudia.

524
00:30:55,436 --> 00:31:01,401
At this point, I'm your last
link to my family's power.

525
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:05,238
So don't you let
Mighty Matthew help you out?

526
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:09,033
Tell me where you're hiding.

527
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,661
Come on, Claudia. Face reality!

528
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,080
I'm your only way out of this.

529
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,915
No.

530
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,750
No!

531
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:29,304
Tell me, what does
Claudia have on you?

532
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,724
I don't know why you keep saying
Claudia has something on us!

533
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,183
What proof do you even have?

534
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,060
I don't know what she has.

535
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,313
I don't know what
you think she has!

536
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,649
You yourself aren't
even sure of what you're saying.

537
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,320
So why do you have to take
words from someone who is

538
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,697
a cheater and a drug addict?!

539
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,908
You haven't seen it with
your own eyes, Vincent.

540
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,662
For once,
Vincent, listen to us.

541
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,873
Claudia has caused you
problems for so long.

542
00:31:56,956 --> 00:32:00,460
Won't it be better if
you get away from her?

543
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,755
If you want me to help you
look for Claudia...

544
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:08,176
Then tell me everything
about Walter.

545
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,388
What does he really
have on our family?

546
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,724
What you know is
everything we know.

547
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,435
Even if you hang us
upside down, Vincent,

548
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,854
we'll still tell you
the same thing.

549
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,488
I'm glad you're here
with me, Stella.

550
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:35,203
Our people are so busy
with our restaurant.

551
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,997
I'm sorry, Mama Mona, because

552
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,125
I can't always be there
to help you.

553
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,253
Hey, it's fine.

554
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,551
I know you and Vincent are
going through a rough patch.

555
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,180
How are you both?

556
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,473
We're doing okay.

557
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,684
But...

558
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:03,022
I'm just worried about Vincent's
relationship with his parents.

559
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,943
I heard in the news that...

560
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:10,988
Claudia is now the suspect
behind Walter's death.

561
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:15,702
Yes, but I'm sure his father
is behind this again.

562
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:21,290
I'm getting worried about you

563
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,252
because the situation
you've gotten into...

564
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,797
just keeps getting worse.

565
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:33,678
Think well about
your relationship with Vincent.

566
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:37,765
Why are things getting worse
when you're together?

567
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,512
- Alexis.
- Yes, Sir Vincent?

568
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,599
- Have you seen Matthew?
- Just a moment, sir.

569
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,852
You dropped your phone earlier.

570
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,771
It's a good thing
the janitor found it.

571
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,246
- Miss, excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am?

572
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,583
Did Sir Walter Cunanan
work here?

573
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,085
Yes, ma'am.
Why do you ask?

574
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,338
Who can I talk to about him?

575
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,382
You can talk to me, ma'am.
How can I help you?

576
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:57,678
Sir Walter left a patient
in our care.

577
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,349
The patient's bills have been
piling up since his death.

578
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,809
They haven't been settled.

579
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,521
What's the name
of the patient?

580
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,730
Rebecca.

581
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,567
Please follow me.
Let's talk over there.

582
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,362
Wait. Are you going
to settle the bill?

583
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,864
I'll take care of it.

584
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,791
Hello?

585
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,751
<i>Stella, where are you?</i>

586
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,045
<i>I'll pick you up.
We need to go somewhere.</i>

587
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:38,719
Dad, Vincent was at the front
desk talking to a woman

588
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,930
who was looking for Walter.

589
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,890
What did she need?

590
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,768
I don't know.
I didn't hear too many details,

591
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,063
but it was about a patient
named Rebecca.

592
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:52,024
That's all I heard when
she was talking to Vincent.

593
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,612
What is it, Dad?

594
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:57,864
Do you know her?

595
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,824
Who is she?

596
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,792
Did you tell anyone else
about this?

597
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,544
No.

598
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,755
No one else can know.

599
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,299
Not especially your mother.

600
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,478
You wanted to show me
something, Bob?

601
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,948
Elardo Caring
Facility Home, sir.

602
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,474
- Stella.
- Come in.

603
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,812
Stella?

604
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,988
What's going on here, huh?

605
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,824
You're still alive?

606
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,117
My dear...

607
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,495
Really?

608
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,206
Now you remember
that you have a daughter?

609
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,085
Stella, my dear,

610
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:19,463
p-please let me explain.

611
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,842
What explanation can you give?

612
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,762
You have the nerve
to ask me that?

613
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,516
Answer me!

614
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,061
What reason can you
possibly give

615
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,148
for what you did to me
and my siblings?

616
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,358
Come on, drop the act.

617
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,651
Stand up!

618
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,195
Come on!

619
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,450
Did your man leave you?
Do I have another sibling?

620
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,704
Dear, no...
That's not it, my daughter...

621
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:56,667
Don't you dare call me that!

622
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,837
Stella! Stella...

623
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:06,761
My dear... I know I wasn't
a good mother to you.

624
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:10,347
But I swear to you,
I didn't want to--

625
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,517
You didn't want to do what?!

626
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,852
Which part?!

627
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:20,733
You chose to leave us!
You chose to abandon us!

628
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:24,403
You chose to leave with
any man who would have you!

629
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,989
My dear, please forgive me...

630
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,449
Forgive you?!

631
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,160
I wish it were that easy!

632
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,038
I wish your apology
could make me forget

633
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,208
everything you did to me
and my siblings!

634
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:42,755
I had to sell my body
to raise my siblings.

635
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,550
I went to prison.

636
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,222
While I was in prison,

637
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,558
Aunt Linda mistreated
Katherine and Joseph.

638
00:39:56,435 --> 00:40:00,606
She sold Joy to Walter,
and I couldn't do anything!

639
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:03,442
Joseph almost died,

640
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,402
and you weren't there
to take care of him!

641
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,029
- Where were you?!
- My dear...

642
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,908
I had to be a mother to them
because you weren't there!

643
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:15,246
My dear, I never wanted
any of that to happen!

644
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,541
Really?!
Which part, huh?!

645
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:19,750
My dear...

646
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,794
I had to take on
your responsibilities.

647
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,004
I didn't know what to do!

648
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,341
I was a wreck! Did that ever
cross your mind?!

649
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:30,386
- Please believe me--
- Did you ever consider that?!

650
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,222
- You're a worthless mother!
- Stella. Stella!

651
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,892
- Stand up and defend yourself!
- Nurse!

652
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,478
- Stella! Nurse!
- Stand up!

653
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,525
She's paralyzed.

654
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,776
What?

655
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,738
How did that happen?

656
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,872
This is Arthur Cabrera's fault.

657
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,085
What did Arthur Cabrera do?

658
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,880
He caused all of this.

659
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:15,639
He asked me to testify
against Manuel Reyes.

660
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:21,604
I witnessed Manuel
rape my friend.

661
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,732
He hid me somewhere safe.

662
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:29,862
He was going to use
my testimony in his story.

663
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,949
We fell for each other.

664
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,619
We started a relationship,

665
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,996
but his wife found out.

666
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,165
<i>- You homewrecker!
- I'm sorry!</i>

667
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,708
<i>You're a whore!</i>

668
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,212
<i>Arthur?</i>

669
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,797
<i>Arthur?</i>

670
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:50,883
<i>Art--</i>

671
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,844
<i>- Yes?
- Rebecca Morales.</i>

672
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,222
<i>You are under arrest
for theft.</i>

673
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,723
<i>You have the right
to remain silent.</i>

674
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,059
<i>Anything you say can
and will be used against you</i>

675
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,269
<i>- in a court of law.
- Wait, wait, wait.</i>

676
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,064
<i>Where's Arthur?</i>

677
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,399
<i>I know Arthur. He would never
accuse me of stealing.</i>

678
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,776
<i>Take that with you and leave.</i>

679
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,695
<i>Leave! Leave--
I'm innocent!</i>

680
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,574
<i>- I'm innocent! Call Arthur!</i>
- After going to prison,

681
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:20,704
<i>- I didn't steal anything!</i>
- I left Arthur in the past.

682
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:27,002
I accepted that
he didn't choose me.

683
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:32,424
I never thought
that my love for him

684
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,552
would cause me
so much suffering.

685
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:39,473
<i>- I was locked up, you know.
- What happened to you, Rebecca?</i>

686
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:41,308
<i>Can't sell your body anymore?</i>

687
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,979
<i>That's what you get for letting
multiple men knock you up!</i>

688
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:49,316
I didn't hear from him
after that.

689
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,443
My life was ruined.

690
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,153
<i>Rebecca!</i>

691
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,447
<i>Hey. What is it?</i>

692
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:59,493
<i>You need to go home.
Joy has a fever. Come on.</i>

693
00:42:59,576 --> 00:43:01,287
<i>- Come on!
- I heard you!</i>

694
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,123
<i>You should be at home
taking care of your kids!</i>

695
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,461
<i>Ma, let's take Joy
to the hospital</i>

696
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,547
<i>before her condition
gets worse.</i>

697
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,299
<i>My goodness.</i>

698
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:17,803
<i>Do you think I've been
working my butt off for nothing?</i>

699
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:22,141
<i>My goodness.
I'll handle it, alright?</i>

700
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,393
<i>Just let me work at the bar.</i>

701
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:29,398
<i>The money I earn as a dancer
will help us.</i>

702
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,150
<i>I'll talk to Mama Mona.</i>

703
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,527
<i>I said...</i>

704
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,612
<i>No.</i>

705
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,283
<i>Why won't you let me?</i>

706
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,869
<i>You sell your body anyway!</i>

707
00:43:55,424 --> 00:44:01,680
<i>I'm doing everything I can
to provide for you</i>

708
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,600
<i>so you don't end up like me.</i>

709
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:11,148
<i>If I could find
another job, I would.</i>

710
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:13,108
<i>But you can't.</i>

711
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,818
<i>Because you messed up.</i>

712
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,990
<i>You'll never get a proper job
because you went to prison.</i>

713
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:23,869
<i>Will you keep depending on men
in order to feed us?</i>

714
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:28,832
<i>Let me find a way
to help my sister</i>

715
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,377
<i>because I won't let
anything happen to Joy!</i>

716
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,920
<i>Stella-- Stella!</i>

717
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,344
<i>You have such a big heart,
Sir Manuel,</i>

718
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,638
<i>for our fellow countrymen.</i>

719
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,390
<i>What message would you
like to share?</i>

720
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:47,393
<i>You know, if you dedicate
your life to public service,</i>

721
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,061
<i>you don't need
to win an election</i>

722
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,647
<i>to do good for the people.
Am I right?</i>

723
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,150
<i>I agree. I'm sure
you'll win, Sir Manuel.</i>

724
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,985
<i>Thank you for the support.</i>

725
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,613
<i>- Thank you very much, sir.
- Appreciate it.</i>

726
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:02,366
<i>This is Arthur Cabrera,</i>

727
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,535
<i>champion of truth.</i>

728
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,206
<i>You evil bastard!</i>

729
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,584
<i>Good thing you got paid.</i>

730
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,545
<i>You were able to buy
Joy's meds.</i>

731
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,798
<i>I'm just glad I found a way.</i>

732
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,800
<i>I already took her
to a doctor.</i>

733
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,721
<i>Oh. It's your mom!</i>

734
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:25,931
<i>Ma?</i>

735
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,309
<i>Oh, excuse me.</i>

736
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,855
<i>Stella, my dear.</i>

737
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,443
<i>While I'm struggling to find
money for Joy's medicine,</i>

738
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,486
<i>you're out here
flirting with men?</i>

739
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,488
<i>Keep it down, dear.</i>

740
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,365
<i>That's Romy.</i>

741
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:48,287
<i>I'm trying to borrow money
from him for Joy's medicine.</i>

742
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,497
<i>Don't bother.
I took care of it.</i>

743
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,040
<i>Just enjoy yourself.</i>

744
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,543
<i>That's all you're good for
anyway, flirting with men.</i>

745
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,420
<i>Stella, don't disrespect me.</i>

746
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,755
<i>What's so respectable
about what you're doing?</i>

747
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,801
<i>I bet you'll come home
pregnant again.</i>

748
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:05,804
<i>Stella.</i>

749
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,433
<i>Stella.</i>

750
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:13,479
I understood why
you resented me, Stella.

751
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:17,065
So, I made up my mind

752
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:20,360
to make Arthur pay
for what he did to me.

753
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,905
<i>Thank you all very much!</i>

754
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:27,075
<i>I know I wasn't
a popular candidate.</i>

755
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,911
<i>- Come with me.
- But as your elected</i>

756
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:32,498
<i>public servant,
this is my promise to you.</i>

757
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,667
<i>We will have a bright future!</i>

758
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,461
<i>- Cheers!
- Cheers!</i>

759
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:38,795
<i>You bastard!</i>

760
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,215
<i>Don't cause a scene.</i>

761
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,300
<i>We're over.
That's all in the past!</i>

762
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:47,179
<i>Get over yourself.
I don't want you back!</i>

763
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:50,057
<i>You didn't hear a peep from me</i>

764
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,560
<i>even after what you
and Jacqueline did to me!</i>

765
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,606
<i>Because I know
I'm partly to blame.</i>

766
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,192
<i>But look at you now,
you bastard.</i>

767
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:05,697
<i>While I'm out there struggling,
you're here living large!</i>

768
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:11,662
<i>How much did that
Manuel Reyes pay you?!</i>

769
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:14,915
<i>I don't accept bribes
from anyone, Rebecca.</i>

770
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,500
<i>This is none of your business.</i>

771
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,627
<i>None of my business?!</i>

772
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,380
<i>Don't I deserve
a piece of the pie?</i>

773
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:24,675
<i>Hey, I want my money too!</i>

774
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,261
<i>- Be quiet. You want money?
- Yes.</i>

775
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:30,472
<i>Lots and lots of money
to shut me up</i>

776
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,808
<i>about everything you've done!</i>

777
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,726
<i>I want my share!</i>

778
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,895
<i>- Agh!
- There's your money.</i>

779
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,358
<i>Don't ever bother me again.</i>

780
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:44,403
<i>Stay far away, alright?</i>

781
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,072
<i>Don't cause any trouble for me.</i>

782
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:50,075
<i>This is the last time.
I never want to see you again!</i>

783
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:05,841
I met Walter.

784
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,426
<i>What do you want?</i>

785
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:14,016
<i>I want Arthur Cabrera to pay
for everything he did to me.</i>

786
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,438
<i>The money he gave me
is nowhere near enough.</i>

787
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,231
<i>Fine.</i>

788
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,858
<i>I'll help you,</i>

789
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,610
<i>as long as you help me.</i>

790
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:29,740
<i>Tell me what you know.</i>

791
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,417
<i>You better make Arthur pay.</i>

792
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,002
<i>Don't worry.</i>

793
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,504
<i>I will make sure
you get a lot of money.</i>

794
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,884
<i>You'll lift your family
out of poverty.</i>

795
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,353
<i>Rebecca?</i>

796
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,564
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

797
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:08,153
<i>Don't worry. I have no plans
of stealing your husband.</i>

798
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,698
<i>I came here for a debt.</i>

799
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,617
<i>What debt?</i>

800
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,496
<i>I let you fix your relationship
with your husband</i>

801
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,666
<i>because I knew
I was in the wrong.</i>

802
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,417
<i>I was the mistress.</i>

803
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:25,712
<i>Then I found out</i>

804
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:30,342
<i>that your husband has been
working with a monster.</i>

805
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:31,927
<i>We've done nothing wrong.</i>

806
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,596
<i>I don't know where these
accusations are coming from.</i>

807
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,806
<i>Prove it!</i>

808
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,100
<i>Or else,</i>

809
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:43,105
<i>I'll tell the whole world
what your husband's been up to.</i>

810
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,774
<i>You will not ruin my family.</i>

811
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,777
<i>I won't let you tear
my family apart again!</i>

812
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,654
<i>You think I'm scared of you?</i>

813
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:53,323
<i>If you don't give me
what I want,</i>

814
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:57,202
<i>I will ruin your family.</i>

815
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,121
<i>You think I'll let you
do that?</i>

816
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,039
<i>We'll see about that.</i>

817
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,208
<i>I'll do anything for my family.</i>

818
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,085
<i>This ends here.</i>

819
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,673
I was scared of what
Jacqueline might do.

820
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:10,799
<i>Rebecca!</i>

821
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,677
I left before she could do
anything to me.

822
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,851
But she followed me.

823
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:26,606
At that moment,
I feared for my life.

824
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,747
<i>Rebecca.</i>

825
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,667
<i>Rebecca!</i>

826
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,112
<i>Don't forget our deal.</i>

827
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,993
<i>- Here's her bag.
- Thank you.</i>

828
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:51,274
<i>Sir, I don't want to.
Please, don't! Ah!</i>

829
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,445
<i>Are you okay?</i>

830
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,907
<i>- I'm Walter.
- Stella.</i>

831
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,620
<i>Are you okay, ma'am?</i>

832
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,288
<i>I'm fine.</i>

833
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,581
<i>Thank you.</i>

834
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,876
<i>Miss, please wait outside.</i>

835
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:15,715
<i>Rebecca.</i>

836
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,804
<i>Get ready.</i>

837
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,389
<i>For what?</i>

838
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:26,476
<i>The time has come
to bring down Arthur Cabrera.</i>

839
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,690
<i>What?</i>

840
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,821
<i>I don't want to.</i>

841
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:43,535
<i>I can't. I'm scared.</i>

842
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:46,913
<i>You saw what he did to me,
didn't you?</i>

843
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,334
<i>I don't want him
to come after my kids too.</i>

844
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,502
<i>No.</i>

845
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,464
<i>I'm the one you should be
scared of!</i>

846
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:03,555
<i>This is your daughter, right?</i>

847
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:06,641
<i>Do as I say, or she gets hurt,
understood?!</i>

848
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,977
<i>Please, no...</i>

849
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,647
I thought he just wanted
to help me.

850
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:17,611
I didn't know he had a grudge
against the Cabreras.

851
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,906
- I was helpless against him.<i>- Don't hurt my kids!</i>

852
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:27,329
Little did I know,
I would never see him again.

853
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,664
<i>No!</i>

854
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,881
My dear...

855
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,543
Sir, the place is empty.

856
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,591
Doc.

857
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,887
Doc, thanks again
for admitting her.

858
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,847
We'll take care of Rebecca.

859
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,517
Doc, I just have one request.

860
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,811
Please don't tell anyone
that she's here.

861
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:35,271
Don't worry.
She'll be safe here.

862
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,649
She'll get the care
she needs here.

863
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,694
Thanks again, doc.

864
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,070
You're welcome.

865
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,537
Thank you.

866
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,966
You have many shortcomings
as a mother.

867
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,638
But despite it all,

868
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:53,016
you don't deserve this.

869
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:57,228
You didn't deserve
to be treated this way.

870
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,523
And most of all...

871
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,486
Walter shouldn't have
dragged you

872
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:08,364
into his plans
against the Cabreras.

873
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,283
I'm sorry, Ma.

874
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:11,785
I didn't know.

875
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,498
I didn't know...

876
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:23,630
- I'm sorry, Ma.
- My dear...

877
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:29,219
- I'm sorry...
- I didn't know, Ma...

878
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,513
Stella...

879
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,937
I just have one request.

880
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:43,691
Can I see your siblings?

881
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:52,283
Can I... Can I see them?

882
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,914
- Thank you, my dear.
- Ma...

883
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:02,335
Thank you, my dear.
Thank you...

884
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:05,607
<i>After years of staying
behind the camera,</i>

885
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:10,528
<i>our circumstance forced me
to step forward.</i>

886
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,408
<i>My own daughter-in-law,</i>

887
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:18,453
<i>Claudia Cabrera,
is a murderer.</i>

888
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,121
<i>It pains me to say this,</i>

889
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:24,209
<i>but the evidence
speaks for itself.</i>

890
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:27,128
<i>She now evades justice</i>

891
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,422
<i>and is considered dangerous.</i>

892
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:34,719
<i>So, as a father and a leader,</i>

893
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,056
<i>I will do everything</i>

894
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:40,642
<i>to protect my own family</i>

895
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:43,811
<i>and this company
from her betrayal.</i>

896
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,648
Claudia, where are you?

897
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,235
I'm done hiding, Vincent.

898
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,655
I'll tell you
everything I know.

899
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,492
<i>I'll give you all of
the evidence I have.</i>

900
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,995
Let's do that interview
for your channel.

901
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,749
Because I'm going
to fight fire with fire!

902
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,172
<i>No one can know
about Rebecca.</i>

903
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,258
<i>Too much is at stake.
Many lives would be ruined.</i>

904
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:18,972
<i>I won't let them do to Stella
what they did to me.</i>

905
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:22,100
<i>I'll find a way
to fight back.</i>

906
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:25,103
<i>You're full of lies!
Your time has come.</i>

907
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:28,147
<i>This is all your fault!
You should've died! Aah!</i>

908
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,818
<i>That slap is nothing compared
to what you did to us.</i>

909
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,821
<i>I will make sure
that you rot in hell!</i>

910
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,531
<i>Stella's house is on fire!</i>

911
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,992
<i>Help! There's a fire! Aah!</i>
