1
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,287
<i>This is the evidence.</i>

2
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,164
<i>This holds what truly happened
with Walter's death.</i>

3
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,623
<i>And why would I trust you?</i>

4
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,668
<i>Dad wouldn't go after me
if what I took wasn't important.</i>

5
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,879
<i>I will give you the truth
that will set you free.</i>

6
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,840
<i>I thought I could talk
some sense into Claudia.</i>

7
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,885
<i>- What do you want to do, sir?
- It's time to pull the trigger.</i>

8
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,597
<i>We've identified Claudia Cabrera
as the main suspect</i>

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,099
<i>in the murder
of Walter Cunanan.</i>

10
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,852
<i>Vincent was talking
to someone at reception.</i>

11
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,522
<i>I couldn't hear much, but it's
about a patient named Rebecca.</i>

12
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,484
<i>No one can know about this,
not especially your mother.</i>

13
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:11,988
<i>You have many shortcomings,
but despite it all,</i>

14
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,948
<i>Walter shouldn't have
involved you</i>

15
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,618
<i>in his plans against
the Cabreras.</i>

16
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,162
<i>I'm sorry, Ma.
I didn't know.</i>

17
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,664
<i>Claudia Cabrera is a murderer.</i>

18
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,874
<i>Claudia, where are you?</i>

19
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,960
<i>I'm done hiding.
I'll tell you everything I know.</i>

20
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,963
<i>'Cause I'm going
to fight fire with fire.</i>

21
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,281
Stella, you still haven't
answered my question.

22
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,659
Where are we going?

23
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,662
That's right, Stella.
Is there a problem?

24
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,205
What are we doing here?

25
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,999
Before we go inside,

26
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,294
I want us to be
on the same page.

27
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:14,551
We all want our family
to be complete, right?

28
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,095
Wait, Stella.

29
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,472
Have you found Joy?

30
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,477
It's Mama.

31
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,066
What? Since when?

32
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,236
Earlier today.

33
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,282
I just found out today
what really happened to her.

34
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,993
- Joseph, let's go.
- Wait!

35
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,788
- I know you're mad at her.
- And you're not?

36
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,001
Out of us three,
you're the one who suffered

37
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,170
- and was hurt the most!
- Katherine, I know.

38
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,134
I cursed Mama's name every day
for abandoning us.

39
00:02:56,217 --> 00:03:00,138
Stella, she was gone
for six years.

40
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,182
She's the reason our life
was ruined.

41
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,143
I know that. I know!

42
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,898
We looked for her for years,
but we never found her!

43
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:13,026
Katherine, if there's someone
who understands exactly

44
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,320
how you feel, it's me.

45
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:19,324
But don't forget
that she's still our mother.

46
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,410
Just because she was
a bad mother to us,

47
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,538
doesn't mean we have
to treat her the same way.

48
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,125
Is there a reason why
she left us?

49
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,502
You've been asking me
those questions for years.

50
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,757
Now it's time to...

51
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,052
...ask her those
questions yourselves.

52
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:43,014
If you still hate her
afterwards, I'll understand.

53
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,433
But I won't deprive you...

54
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:50,313
...of the truth.
It's your right as her kids.

55
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,981
I want to see her, Stella.

56
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,775
Joseph, stop it!

57
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,530
I won't stop you from treating
her the way you want to.

58
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,825
I won't deprive you of that.

59
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,452
But as your sister,

60
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,788
I don't want you
to miss the opportunity

61
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:11,709
to at least meet her
and hear what she has to say.

62
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,587
So please, talk to her.

63
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,631
Katherine.

64
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,178
Come here. Come.

65
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,348
Come here.

66
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,022
- Ma.
- Ma?

67
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,360
Joseph.

68
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,947
Rebecca?

69
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,533
Rebecca, what happened to you?

70
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:48,246
Ma, Stella already told me
what happened to you.

71
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,457
Katherine.

72
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,174
We'll find justice
for what they did to you, Ma.

73
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,969
They're going to pay.

74
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,574
Andres,
I've been waiting for you.

75
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,243
Ma.

76
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,165
How did you get here?

77
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,916
It's so beautiful here.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,295
It's nicer, brighter.

79
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,464
And the food tastes so good.

80
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,551
Look at that park, it's huge.

81
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,263
I want to stay here.

82
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,682
Who brought you here?

83
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,602
He said he's your friend.

84
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,687
Such a kind person.

85
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,147
My friend?

86
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,567
Who?

87
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,238
There, look.

88
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,656
That's him.

89
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,210
I'll shoot you right now
if you don't tell me

90
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,836
why you transferred my mother.

91
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,005
Wait, sir.
I'm just following orders.

92
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,216
Well...

93
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,054
...answer it.

94
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,188
Who's this?

95
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,857
Just think of me
as a friend.

96
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,946
<i>Aren't you happy with
how your mom is doing now?</i>

97
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,032
<i>The hospital we moved her to...</i>

98
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:52,203
...is clean and well-managed, right?

99
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,913
Why are you doing this?
Who ordered you?

100
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,456
Is it the Cabreras?
Which one?

101
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,792
That's not what's important.

102
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:03,172
If I were you,
this is what matters...

103
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,175
<i>we'll give you a chance...</i>

104
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,304
<i>...to extend your mother's life.</i>

105
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,266
<i>Take the offer.</i>

106
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,102
But you have to follow
everything we want.

107
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,312
I can't do that.

108
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,314
Come on, Andres.

109
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,608
There's no place
in this world anymore

110
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,277
for your so-called principles.

111
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:31,617
We both know you
have nowhere else to go

112
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,661
<i>because you don't have money.</i>

113
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,248
<i>You're drowning yourself
in alcohol</i>

114
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,292
<i>so you can forget everything.</i>

115
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,044
<i>But...</i>

116
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,715
...will you let
the only thing you have

117
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,550
be taken away from you?

118
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,262
Get the pouch...

119
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,347
<i>...and look inside.</i>

120
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,016
You'll see...

121
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:01,189
...you can get anything
you want from now on.

122
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,357
And that's just the start.

123
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,026
<i>More is coming.</i>

124
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:10,698
You just have
to follow

125
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,827
everything we tell you to do.

126
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,497
<i>But if you refuse,</i>

127
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,584
your mother's life
will be shorter.

128
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,629
<i>Remember that.</i>

129
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,881
<i>If it's not me...</i>

130
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:32,553
<i>If it's not me,
someone else will do it.</i>

131
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:37,266
There are many ways, Andres.

132
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,444
I'm on my way.

133
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,198
I texted you the location.
Meet me there.

134
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,409
<i>It's close to where you are.</i>

135
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:40,121
Vincent, just make sure
we're safe there.

136
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,748
Don't tell Stella anything
about our plans.

137
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,544
Claudia, I guarantee
that place is safe.

138
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:51,132
Like we agreed,
I'm going there alone.

139
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,341
<i>I'll see you there.</i>

140
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,063
Hello, Captain?

141
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,733
I know where Vincent
is hiding Claudia.

142
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,902
Then text me the exact address
where she is.

143
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,738
I'll take care of it.

144
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,573
Vincent is still there.

145
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:19,118
I'm sure he'll do everything
to protect Claudia.

146
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,786
We need a distraction.

147
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,414
We need Vincent out of there.

148
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,958
Copy that.

149
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,132
Hey, I heard the mayor's
giving out aid at the plaza.

150
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,092
Hurry, it might be cash!

151
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,635
Let's go! Hurry!

152
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,328
Stella, I'm here.

153
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,081
Alright, take care, okay?

154
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,708
I hope Claudia
doesn't cause trouble.

155
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,335
I hope she talks.

156
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,798
And I brought supplies for her.

157
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,842
If you need help, just tell me.

158
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,052
Anytime.

159
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,762
No, I can handle this.

160
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,223
How long is Claudia
staying there?

161
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,933
I don't know yet.

162
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,644
<i>We'll just see what she says.</i>

163
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,648
Uh...

164
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,150
Uh, what did you say again?

165
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,777
I said let's just see...

166
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,570
<i>...what she has to say.</i>

167
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,201
Wait...

168
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,994
It smells like
something's burning.

169
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,207
Fire!

170
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,875
<i>- Fire!</i>
- What?

171
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,711
Katherine! Joseph!
Hurry, wake up!

172
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,839
The house is on fire, help!

173
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,006
Stella, what's happening?

174
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,508
Here, cover your nose.

175
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,592
Go, go!

176
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,803
- Help!
- Somebody help us!

177
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,555
- Here, hurry! Come on!
- Help!

178
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,597
Help!

179
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,849
Hey!

180
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,058
Stella!

181
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,338
- Vincent?
- Just give it back

182
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,590
if you don't want trouble.

183
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,427
I don't have time.
I want this done now!

184
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,012
I don't know
what you're talking about!

185
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,054
Let go of me!

186
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,932
Just give back the flash drive
so this ends.

187
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,809
Stop making it harder
for yourself!

188
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,853
You're really a dog
of the Cabreras!

189
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,030
Ouch!

190
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,331
- It won't open!
- Help!

191
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,374
Let's go around!
Come on!

192
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,752
Aah!

193
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,253
- This way, hurry!
- Stella!

194
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,338
Help us!

195
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,757
- Help!
- Help!

196
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,258
Stella's house is burning!

197
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,010
- Aah!
- There's a fire!

198
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,637
- Fire!
- Help!

199
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,482
Find Bubbles!

200
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,360
Stella, we're coming!

201
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,446
Bubbles! Bubbles!
Stella's house is on fire!

202
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,739
- Where?
- Hurry!

203
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,115
- Fire!
- Oh my--

204
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,117
- Fire! Hurry!
- Fire!

205
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,869
This way, come on!

206
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,496
Aah!

207
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,165
- Help!
- Help! Help!

208
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,125
- Stella, we're here!
- Push!

209
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,794
Call for help!

210
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,712
- Fire!
- Call the fire department!

211
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,005
You had your chance, Claudia.

212
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,723
- One... Two... Three!
- Two... Three!

213
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,016
Help!

214
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,435
- Oh no!
- Aah!

215
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:58,022
- Hurry!
- Ma! Let's go!

216
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,774
Stella!

217
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,776
One, two, three!

218
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,240
Isn't anyone calling
the firefighters?!

219
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,451
One more! Harder this time!

220
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,830
There they are!

221
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:16,874
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

222
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,126
- Stay here!
- I'm glad you made it out.

223
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,087
Katherine, are you okay?!
Joseph, are you okay?!

224
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,132
Joseph?!

225
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,842
Wait! I need to go back in!

226
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,719
Huh?! Are you out of your mind?!

227
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,763
No, Stella!

228
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,641
Stella! Stella!

229
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,942
Call the firefighters already!

230
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,836
Aah! Aah!

231
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,423
The fire's
getting bigger! Help!

232
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,635
Hurry and
get some water!

233
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,761
Water!

234
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,179
Katherine! Joseph!

235
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,390
Vincent! Vincent,
Stella is still inside!

236
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,849
Vincent, my sister...

237
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,646
Hey, Vincent!
Vincent, are you insane?!

238
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,730
Vincent!

239
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:23,982
Hey, Vincent!

240
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,322
- Stella?!
- Aah! Aah!

241
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,827
Stella, take this!

242
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,253
Aah! Aah!

243
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,714
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Aah!

244
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,217
- Hurry!
- Vincent!

245
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,927
- Stella!
- Wait!

246
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,804
- Stella!
- Leave it!

247
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:54,930
- Help!
- Stella!

248
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:56,014
Aah!

249
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,433
Vincent!

250
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,283
Vincent, stand up!
Vincent!

251
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,911
Help!

252
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,371
Stella!

253
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,165
We need to treat
the wound immediately!

254
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,083
Charlie, bring him
to the ambulance!

255
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,586
Stella!
Are you okay?

256
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,047
I'm okay!
Just take care of this.

257
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,132
Don't let anyone
touch it, okay?!

258
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,633
You hold that for now, okay?

259
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,515
Miss Sonya,
I'm sorry for what happened.

260
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,185
Joseph, are you okay?

261
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,188
Uh, nurse, can you please
check on my brother?

262
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,397
Katherine, take care of it.

263
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,863
Vincent, how are you?

264
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,284
Thank you for saving me.

265
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,414
I need to leave.

266
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,000
Sir, I still need
to treat your wound.

267
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,293
You can't leave yet,

268
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,961
they're still treating
your injuries.

269
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,964
I need to find Claudia.
What she's holding is important.

270
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,800
Vincent, you're not well yet.

271
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,511
I'll take care of Claudia.
I'll go to her.

272
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,388
We'll wait for you there
until you're okay.

273
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,557
- Okay--
- Stella.

274
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,393
Let's not argue
about this anymore.

275
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,479
Just stay here.

276
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,980
We'll wait for you there.

277
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,206
Claudia?

278
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,794
Claudia?!

279
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,845
Claudia?

280
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,603
Claudia?!

281
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,018
Matthew did this to me.

282
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:52,733
And we both know...

283
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,862
...that he wouldn't make a move
without you knowing.

284
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,906
Claudia, believe me.

285
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,867
I did not tell Matthew
to hurt you.

286
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,368
I only asked him to find you

287
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,329
so I could take back
what you stole.

288
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,582
And once that happens,
we can go back to normal.

289
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,876
Be a family again.

290
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,879
Family?

291
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,218
A real family doesn't do this.

292
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,179
I was almost killed!

293
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,014
You know, Claudia...

294
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:28,393
Every problem is just
a scrambled cube.

295
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,022
It's dizzying, chaotic...

296
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,442
sometimes it makes you
lose your temper...

297
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,861
but everything has a solution.

298
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,154
As long as you have patience,

299
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:41,657
and you know how
to move things around...

300
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,992
...the right way.

301
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:50,791
Even the worst mess
has a pattern.

302
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,044
You just have to look for it.

303
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,090
That reaction is understandable.

304
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,224
Where are you going, sir?

305
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,850
Where's Dad?
I want to talk to him.

306
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,935
He's not here, sir.

307
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,562
Is he really not here,
or just hiding from me?

308
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,814
He's really not here, sir.

309
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,941
We were instructed
not to let you in.

310
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,030
I don't know where
the flash drive is anymore.

311
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,534
Dad, I would do anything...

312
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,745
I would do anything,
just let me go.

313
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:29,913
Anything?

314
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,668
Dad, I have one request--

315
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,295
You're not in the position
to make demands, Claudia.

316
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,548
I just want to talk
to my daughter.

317
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,479
Where's Dad?!

318
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,690
We haven't seen Arthur
the whole day.

319
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,914
- Ma?
- Stella.

320
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:15,667
Where's the nurse?

321
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,627
Uh...

322
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,088
They might still be
attending to something.

323
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,758
That's why I haven't eaten yet.

324
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,885
Oh...

325
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,814
Are you feeling any pain?

326
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,232
No, none.

327
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,153
I was just thinking about...

328
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:48,450
...the last time I fed you.

329
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,161
I'm such a worthless mother,
aren't I?

330
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,080
If this didn't happen to me,

331
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:56,458
I wouldn't have accepted
all my mistakes.

332
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,836
Don't think about
that anymore, Ma.

333
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,131
Because of everything
that happened,

334
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,258
time has also made me stronger.

335
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:10,222
I'm just worried about
my siblings.

336
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,101
They're getting dragged
into my mess.

337
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:30,700
I would like to assure
our dearest employees

338
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:36,957
that CGC is still strong
and stable

339
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,252
despite the challenges
and the controversies

340
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,379
we are currently facing.

341
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,132
And just like the ones before,

342
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:51,513
we can overcome the challenges
our company is facing

343
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:57,227
all thanks to our
united actions.

344
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,980
Liar!

345
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,608
You are all liars!

346
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,319
What's the meaning of this?

347
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,113
What are you doing here?!

348
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,657
You've hurt our family
more than enough.

349
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,869
It's time for payback.

350
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,792
All of you know me

351
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:24,129
for all the crimes
being pinned on me.

352
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,840
But do you really know
this man?

353
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:32,512
Does anyone here know
the real Arthur Cabrera?

354
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,306
- Guard! Guard!
- Don't listen to her!

355
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,600
- She's a liar!
- Stop right there!

356
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,728
Carla Hernandez!

357
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,773
Do any of you know her?
No, right?

358
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,610
Because she was a victim!

359
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,654
A victim who was silenced

360
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:55,952
after Arthur Cabrera
buried everything about her!

361
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,080
This is absurd.
Stop this, whoever you are!

362
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,875
This is Rebecca.

363
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,835
She is my mother.

364
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:09,174
Arthur Cabrera convinced her
to pose as witness

365
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,761
for Manuel Reyes's rape case
against her friend.

366
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,139
And Manuel Reyes paid
Arthur Cabrera

367
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,767
to cover up the truth

368
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,061
and to throw my mother
under the bus.

369
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,229
Shut up.

370
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,147
- Shut up!
- Why?

371
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,149
Aren't you allies of truth?

372
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:30,654
Why don't you tell everyone here
the whole truth?

373
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:34,908
That Manuel Reyes is
your company's biggest investor

374
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,368
who brought you millions

375
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:40,205
in exchange for burying
the truth about his case!

376
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,792
- That's the truth, isn't it?!
- Stella, stop this nonsense!

377
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,335
"Nonsense"?

378
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,589
None of us are clean.

379
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,466
Especially you.

380
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,177
You have a grudge
against my mother, right?

381
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:58,390
Because she had an affair
with your husband.

382
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:02,394
That's why you tried
to kill her!

383
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,603
It was you!

384
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,189
It was you, Jacqueline,
who ran me over

385
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,983
that's why ended up like this!

386
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,151
And Walter knew all about it!

387
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,154
- He knew!
- No, no, no... No! No!

388
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,323
- No! No! No!
- Enough!

389
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,533
- No! Ah!
- Enough!

390
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,910
This is all your fault!

391
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:23,540
Whatever happened to you,
you deserve it!

392
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,875
You should be dead by now!
You should've been dead!

393
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,335
- Ow! Ahh!
- Die!

394
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,545
- Let go!
- Stop, Jacqueline!

395
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,255
Stop! Enough!

396
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,048
- Ah!
- Jacqueline!

397
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,883
- Stella!
- That's not enough...

398
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,593
...for all the suffering
you caused us!

399
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,137
Now, tell me.

400
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,306
Who among us has the motive
to kill Walter...

401
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,558
- Take her away.
- ...given what he knew?!

402
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,018
Stop it!

403
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,937
Guard, take this woman outside!

404
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,188
Send her away!

405
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,816
- Let go!
- Press! Where are the press?

406
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,067
Let me explain.

407
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,861
This is just a circus!

408
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,487
This is a setup!

409
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,489
She only made that up!

410
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,825
I know who did this!

411
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,036
I know who's behind this!

412
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,085
Everyone!

413
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,556
<i>Ah!</i>

414
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,976
<i>Arthur! Arthur!</i>

415
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,394
<i>Arthur! Arthur!</i>

416
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,271
<i>- Arthur!
- Why? What is it?</i>

417
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,025
<i>Arthur, Arthur...
Something horrible happened!</i>

418
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,360
<i>It's Rebecca!</i>

419
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,737
<i>What happened to Rebecca?</i>

420
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,506
<i>Rebecca's body
has already been buried.</i>

421
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,174
<i>But everything was clean.</i>

422
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:59,511
<i>No records, no police reports.</i>

423
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,972
<i>She just disappeared
into thin air.</i>

424
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,810
<i>Just make sure everything
stays clean.</i>

425
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,270
<i>I'm just worried
about Jacqueline.</i>

426
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,941
<i>She shouldn't be suffering
because of my sins.</i>

427
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,528
<i>And she shouldn't be paying
for Rebecca's death.</i>

428
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,862
<i>She's dead...</i>

429
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,197
<i>She's dead.</i>

430
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,449
<i>Rebecca's dead.</i>

431
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,558
<i>Jacqueline...</i>

432
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:49,185
<i>Don't do this to yourself.</i>

433
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,229
<i>Is Rebecca really dead?</i>

434
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,152
<i>No one and nothing
can point to you.</i>

435
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,736
<i>I made sure of that.</i>

436
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,574
<i>You don't have anything
to worry about.</i>

437
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,702
<i>You can erase everything,
but you can't erase the fact...</i>

438
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,203
<i>...that I killed someone.</i>

439
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,788
<i>I'm a murderer.</i>

440
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,331
<i>I'm a murderer!</i>

441
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:14,752
<i>I'm a murderer...
I'm a murderer!</i>

442
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,388
<i>- Jacqueline?
- Hmm?</i>

443
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,142
<i>Jacqueline?</i>

444
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,568
<i>Please, be gentle with her.</i>

445
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,447
<i>- Why?
- They are doctors.</i>

446
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,491
<i>They're here to help you.</i>

447
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,909
<i>You need help.</i>

448
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:52,332
<i>Please,
do this for me, Jacqueline.</i>

449
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,006
<i>Take her.</i>

450
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,802
<i>But make sure no one else
ever finds out about this.</i>

451
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,141
<i>Give her everything she needs.</i>

452
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,186
<i>Make her well.</i>

453
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,816
<i>I'll visit you.</i>

454
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,277
<i>Everything will be fine.</i>

455
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,154
<i>You will be fine.</i>

456
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,368
<i>You'll come back to me.</i>

457
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,388
Jacqueline.

458
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,515
Jacqueline...

459
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:51,891
Jacqueline.

460
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,810
Jacqueline.

461
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,980
I thought Rebecca was dead?!

462
00:30:57,063 --> 00:31:01,067
You told me and confirmed
that she was dead!

463
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,528
That's what I thought too.

464
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,572
I ordered Walter.

465
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,866
He told me Rebecca was dead.

466
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,952
I didn't know
she was still alive.

467
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:15,707
He used Rebecca's case
to blackmail me.

468
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,875
How can you keep something
so important from me?!

469
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,379
All this time,
I didn't know she was alive.

470
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,679
I don't want you to go through

471
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,848
everything you went
through before.

472
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,852
I don't want to lose you again.

473
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:40,064
We need
to face this together.

474
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,733
Now--

475
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:46,988
Now, our problem is bigger.

476
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,659
It's no longer just Stella
we're up against...

477
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,455
...but also Rebecca.

478
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:59,751
I'm not a bad person!
I'm not a bad person!

479
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:04,213
But because of my love for you,
I did something terrible!

480
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,758
You turned me into a monster!

481
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:39,248
A huge mess broke out
at the shareholders' meeting.

482
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,085
Oh! That was nothing.

483
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,879
Cabrera News
is handling the spin.

484
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:47,715
So you don't have anything
to worry about.

485
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,844
Because the share price
won't be affected.

486
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,138
I don't care about money.

487
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,810
Keep my name
and family out of it!

488
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,486
You should've let me
finish first, buddy.

489
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,155
Because part of the spin
we're doing

490
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:16,911
is exactly to keep you out
of Rebecca's accusations.

491
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,588
I have to protect
our partnership.

492
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,091
We're friends, aren't we?

493
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,598
That's why we're not
the enemies here, buddy.

494
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,313
Let's stop letting Rebecca
get to us.

495
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,982
She's just a dirt.

496
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,985
She has nothing on us.

497
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,903
But we...

498
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,198
We can destroy
each other, buddy.

499
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:58,870
So it's better if we continue
helping each other

500
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:04,167
because it has paid off for
both of us all these years.

501
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:08,087
You know how I move, Arthur.

502
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:11,090
And the shadows
keep it that way.

503
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,595
And I'll continue to give you
the protection you need.

504
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,888
Yeah...

505
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,933
Only Stella Morales
is a thorn to us now.

506
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,394
But once I send her to jail...

507
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,148
...we won't have
a problem anymore.

508
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:32,111
Buddy, people still
forget easily.

509
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,489
Just pour in a lot of money,

510
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:38,951
and you'll still win
the next election.

511
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,829
Make sure of that, Arthur.

512
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,956
- Make sure of that.
- Yeah, of course.

513
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,835
Let's stop
with the threats, buddy.

514
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,087
We don't need that.

515
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,881
Enjoy your steak.

516
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,348
Thank you, Bea.

517
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,692
Bea?

518
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,820
Your mom needs to rest.

519
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,115
Get well soon, Mommy, okay?

520
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,328
Drink your medicine.

521
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,831
Yes.

522
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,917
So once I'm better,
we'll be together again.

523
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,837
Don't forget your toy.

524
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,631
- Bye, Mommy.
- Mm.

525
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,928
We'll visit you again.

526
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,513
Let's go.

527
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,851
Ma...

528
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,728
Thank you.

529
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,361
Let's go.

530
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,035
I'll just go to the restroom.

531
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,620
Oh, do that later.

532
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,459
We still have
something to do, right?

533
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,590
You saw it yourself...

534
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,092
I kept the promise
I made to you.

535
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:21,053
So now you keep
your promise to me.

536
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,431
Didn't you say
you'd do everything

537
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,182
so we could make peace?

538
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,063
Read it.

539
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,649
And say everything
written there.

540
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:40,323
Are you having
second thoughts, Claudia?

541
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,199
You don't want to anymore?

542
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,911
Remember,

543
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:48,414
it's not just you I can hurt.

544
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,459
Bea too.

545
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,302
You're evil!

546
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,804
Bea is your granddaughter!

547
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,848
How can you hurt her!

548
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,143
Granddaughter?

549
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:11,520
Maybe you're forgetting...

550
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,023
I'm not related to any of you.

551
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:17,360
Not Vincent, not you,
and definitely not Bea.

552
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,822
I'm only protecting
my own family.

553
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,625
Nanny, take Bea to her room.

554
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,793
Be careful, dear.

555
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,923
Ma!

556
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,384
Vincent,
what are you doing here?

557
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,510
Where's Claudia?

558
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,137
Your dad thinks it's better
to keep her safe.

559
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,014
Safe from what? From me?

560
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,141
You're the ones
she's running away from!

561
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,476
What are you talking about?

562
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,479
How long will you pretend
not to see anything?

563
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,190
Just because you choose
not to know the truth

564
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:58,776
does not mean you're not
complicit in what's happening!

565
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,153
Do you really think
we'd hurt Claudia?

566
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,406
What's something Dad can't do?

567
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,533
Did you already forget
what happened to Walter?

568
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,160
To Dr. Castro?

569
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,954
Now tell me where Claudia is.

570
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,455
I want to see her!

571
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,752
I'll talk to Claudia myself.

572
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,213
I'll ask her if she wants
to talk to you.

573
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,306
I'm telling you again...

574
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,269
I don't know...

575
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,773
...why the police
are pointing at me.

576
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:46,574
And I don't know
who that hitman is

577
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,576
that I supposedly paid.

578
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,287
Vincent, any news about Claudia?

579
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,830
They still haven't said
anything.

580
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,832
Looks like Dad is avoiding me.

581
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,335
Bro? Stella.

582
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,211
Guys!

583
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,671
You have to watch this.

584
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,302
<i>But there's only one person</i>

585
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,929
<i>I know who could've
done this to me.</i>

586
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,267
<i>And that's Stella Morales.</i>

587
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,978
<i>My husband's mistress.</i>

588
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:21,317
<i>And she's the real one
who killed Walter Cunanan.</i>

589
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,403
I'm not perfect.

590
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:28,282
As a mother, as a wife.

591
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:30,743
I made mistakes.

592
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,871
But I'm not a criminal.

593
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,498
I'm innocent.

594
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,125
And that's why
I went into hiding.

595
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,254
<i>I don't know how,</i>

596
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:47,051
<i>but she found me
and she attacked me.</i>

597
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,554
<i>She hit me in the head.</i>

598
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,682
<i>And by the grace of God...</i>

599
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:57,353
<i>by some miracle,
I'm still alive.</i>

600
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,439
<i>And to my husband, Vincent.</i>

601
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,608
<i>I don't know
what will happen to me.</i>

602
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,777
<i>But please...</i>

603
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,906
<i>...please, take care of Bea.</i>

604
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,616
<i>After all this,</i>

605
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,284
you're the only one
she has left.

606
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,539
Hug her tight.

607
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,541
<i>And please tell her...</i>

608
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,670
<i>I love her dearly.</i>

609
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,882
<i>The stuffed toy
I bought for her,</i>

610
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,844
please don't take it
away from her.

611
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,514
<i>Ever.</i>

612
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:37,768
<i>Because she hugs it
every night before she sleeps</i>

613
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,979
<i>and it's important to her.</i>

614
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,064
I'm sorry, dear.

615
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:47,653
For my sins and
all the ways I failed you.

616
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,666
Good job.

617
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,669
I knew you had it in you.

618
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,505
Congratulations.

619
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:14,680
Now it's posted on all
your social media accounts.

620
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,390
Good job, congratulations.

621
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,313
How about the new life
you promised me?

622
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,481
Well, I've got
all your bank records.

623
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,859
I'll send it there.

624
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,944
But that will have
a paper trail.

625
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,363
I have my ways, Claudia.

626
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,407
It's just creative accounting.

627
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,202
My people will cover that.

628
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:39,038
For now, just recover first.

629
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,956
Be back to 100%.

630
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,583
You can't--

631
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,502
You can't enjoy anything
if you're not healed.

632
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:50,549
And then we'll figure out
the rest after.

633
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,180
Good.

634
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,395
Can I go to the restroom?

635
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,605
Oh, sure.

636
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,841
- Mom, we need--<i>- Vincent?</i>

637
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:33,884
<i>Claudia?</i>

638
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,469
Claudia, where are you?

639
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:38,097
I'm here at the rest house
in San Felipe.

640
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,307
Wait for me there,
I'm coming for you!

641
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,893
<i>Vincent, I'm sorry.</i>

642
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,729
It's my fault all this happened.

643
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,858
I only thought about myself.

644
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,236
I don't know how to love.

645
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,364
Claudia, don't say that!

646
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,782
Think about Bea.

647
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,703
I'll save you, okay?

648
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:04,123
Vincent, whatever happens...

649
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,958
I want you to know...

650
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,212
...I'm letting you go.

651
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,256
<i>All I want for you...</i>

652
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,926
...is to be happy.

653
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,308
Hello, Arthur, it's Jacqueline.

654
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,685
Did you see my phone?
I think I left it there.

655
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,023
I'll call you back.

656
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,612
Claudia?

657
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,364
Claudia!

658
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,992
Claudia?

659
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,119
What? What happened?

660
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,370
What did you say to him?

661
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,205
- Let me go--
- What did you say?!

662
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,498
Let go of me!

663
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,959
Help!

664
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,003
What did you say?

665
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,838
Claudia, what did you do?

666
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:53,922
You traitor!

667
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,258
Didn't I tell you
I'd give you everything?

668
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,344
Vincent knows where I am,
and he'll save me!

669
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,803
You're done, Arthur!

670
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,514
I'll have you and your
psycho son thrown in jail!

671
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,316
Claudia, stop!

672
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,112
Claudia, stop it!

673
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,864
Help!

674
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:19,907
No!

675
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,283
Claudia!

676
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,994
Aah!

677
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,792
Help!

678
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,339
Help!

679
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,383
Claudia, stop it!

680
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,551
I told you I'll give you
everything, right?

681
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,604
No, Claudia.

682
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:51,855
Don't shout, okay?

683
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:52,981
Don't shout.

684
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:03,992
Claudia?

685
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,473
Wait here.

686
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,393
Sir.

687
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,812
Let me in.
I know Claudia's in there.

688
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,063
I'm sorry, sir.

689
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,315
Ma'am Claudia said
not to let you in.

690
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:39,194
- She doesn't want to see you.
- Don't mess with me.

691
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,487
She's the one who called me.

692
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,531
Where is she?
I want to talk to her!

693
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:43,949
I'm really sorry, sir,
you can't.

694
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,050
Claudia?

695
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,553
Claudia, we have to go.

696
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,806
Come on. We'll save you
while the guards aren't here.

697
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,807
Claudia.

698
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,226
Claudia, let's go.

699
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:54,978
Come on--

700
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,359
Claudia?

701
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,568
Claudia...

702
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,403
Claudia!

703
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,311
Uh...

704
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,786
Are you sure
about what you saw?

705
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,372
Yes, Vincent.

706
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,000
Claudia is gone.

707
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,845
Vincent...

708
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,435
You don't have to always
appear strong in front of me.

709
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,449
I need to talk to Bea.

710
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:17,788
But I don't know
how to tell her.

711
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,875
I don't know how she'd take it.

712
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,799
They set this all up.

713
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,719
They know they can
fool the public

714
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:36,181
into believing that
you killed Claudia.

715
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:42,521
Whatever happens,
I'm ready to face the police

716
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,856
to tell them the truth.

717
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,316
To clear my name.

718
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,153
Stella, Arthur will use
his connection with the police.

719
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,867
You have to lie low for now

720
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,912
while I find out
what really happened to Claudia.

721
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,984
Thank you all for being here.

722
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:33,071
You know, I called you here

723
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:37,242
because of a tragedy
that has befallen our family.

724
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,912
My daughter-in-law,

725
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,958
the mother of my granddaughter,

726
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:49,796
was murdered by no other
than Stella Morales.

727
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,261
And like Claudia said,

728
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:58,013
<i>Stella attacked her.</i>

729
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:04,311
<i>And today, she was able
to finish what she couldn't.</i>

730
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,856
No. Stella can't do that!

731
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,441
I know.

732
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,151
That's why I'm here, Katherine.

733
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,697
Dad will do everything
to implicate Stella.

734
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,866
I want to help your family,

735
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,701
alongside Vincent.

736
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,208
<i>We cannot let
this injustice pass.</i>

737
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,376
<i>So to help the police...</i>

738
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,879
...find that monster,

739
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:34,132
we are offering a
10-million peso reward

740
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:39,346
for any information that
will lead to Stella's arrest.

741
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,639
Where is Vincent?

742
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:43,099
He's Claudia's husband.
Why isn't he here?

743
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:48,522
Actually, I don't want to say...

744
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,775
bad things about Vincent

745
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,530
for the sake of
my granddaughter.

746
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:01,952
But, if Vincent can
hear me right now,

747
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:08,041
I want to tell him...

748
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:12,838
Vincent, do the right thing.

749
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,174
Choose us.

750
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,552
Our family.

751
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,596
Choose your daughter.

752
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:26,434
<i>That was Arthur Cabrera's
brave statement</i>

753
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,186
<i>against Stella Morales.</i>

754
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,689
<i>We also acquired CCTV footage</i>

755
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:33,817
<i>where the suspect
Stella Morales</i>

756
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,528
<i>was seen entering
the victims' room</i>

757
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:39,239
<i>where the latter
was found dead.</i>

758
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,407
Huh?

759
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,285
H... Huh?

760
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:52,961
<i>Again, the Cabrera Family is
giving a 10-million-peso reward</i>

761
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,337
<i>in exchange for any information</i>

762
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,257
<i>that will lead to
Stella Morales's arrest.</i>

763
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:11,730
Arthur.

764
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,356
Hey.

765
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,360
Do you have everything you need
to bury Stella?

766
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,362
Yes. For now, yes.

767
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:23,700
My plans are unfolding
as expected, so...

768
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,203
Should I need anything,
I'll inform you right away.

769
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,331
Okay, just don't hesitate
to ask.

770
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,666
I have the people
and the resources to help you.

771
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,753
- Yes.
- The group's got your back.

772
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:39,466
You just need to
end this now, Arthur.

773
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,928
Things will become more
difficult for us

774
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,554
if this goes on.

775
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:49,267
We cannot let this thing
grow larger than it already is.

776
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:54,940
And I really hope we are
on the same page on that.

777
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:14,250
Why were you talking
to Manuel?

778
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,170
Did he have anything to do
with what happened to Claudia?

779
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:20,006
Manuel was just expressing
his condolences.

780
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,383
Don't lie to me.

781
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,844
You had a hand
in what happened to Claudia.

782
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,639
What really happened
in that house?

783
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:34,270
Stella was behind all this,
not me nor Manuel.

784
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,481
She's a lot of things.

785
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,233
But a murderer?

786
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,111
Don't take me for a fool.

787
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:46,241
You really don't know Stella,

788
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,243
so who are you to say that?

789
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,621
She's to blame for all this.

790
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,125
And that's what
you need to believe.

791
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,274
No one knows
about this location.

792
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,943
You'll be safe here, Stella.

793
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,574
Thank you for finding a place
for me to stay.

794
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,118
But I won't stay here
for long, Vincent.

795
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:33,079
Whatever your plan is,
I'll help you.

796
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,458
You can't, Stella.
That's why we fled, remember?

797
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:40,545
They can do worse things
than put you in jail.

798
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,089
What if you suffer
the same fate as Claudia?

799
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,008
I won't let that happen.

800
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,229
<i>The Cabrera Family is giving

801
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,773
<i>in exchange for any information</i>

802

<i>that will lead to
Stella Morales's arrest.</i>

803
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:05,153
If Dad is willing to shell out
that much money,

804
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,698
it means he's already desperate
to find you.

805
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,368
Stella, you'll be hunted
by everyone.

806
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:16,456
We can't risk
anyone finding you.

807
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:18,458
Wait here.

808
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,054
From now on, use this phone
to contact me and your family.

809
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,680
How about you?

810
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,224
Where will you go?

811
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,560
Claudia was about
to tell me something.

812
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,855
Whatever it is,
it's the reason she was killed.

813
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,900
And that's what I need to know.

814
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:46,569
I'm sure that will help
clear your name.

815
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,613
Because that will
give them motive.

816
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,491
This mess has blown out
of proportion.

817
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,079
Until when can we
keep fighting?

818
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,169
Forever, Stella.

819
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,924
As long as we're together.

820
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,635
For the rest of our lives.

821
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,606
Bro, here's some coffee.

822
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,233
You've been on your desk
for hours.

823
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,451
Bro, you've watched that
countless times.

824
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,665
<i>You're all she has.</i>

825
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:46,546
<i>Hug her tight and please tell
her that I loved her dearly.</i>

826
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,798
<i>And the stuffed toy
I bought for her,</i>

827
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,426
<i>don't ever take it away.</i>

828
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:56,097
<i>She hugs it every night
before she sleeps.</i>

829
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,640
<i>It's important--</i>

830
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,392
Hm? Why did you pause it?

831
00:57:59,475 --> 00:58:03,271
I bought Bea's stuffed toy,
not her.

832
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,694
<i>And the stuffed toy
I bought for her,</i>

833
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,946
<i>don't ever take it away.</i>

834
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:16,492
<i>She hugs it every night
before she sleeps.</i>

835
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,661
<i>It's important to her.</i>

836
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,832
It's like she's saying
something between the lines.

837
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,878
Bro, are you two the only ones
who know about that?

838
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,379
Yes.

839
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:34,219
Could she have hidden
the flash drive...

840
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,305
...in Bea's stuffed toy?

841
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,730
<i>Bring us Stella!</i>

842
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,398
<i>She has to face the law!</i>

843
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,816
<i>I didn't kill Claudia.</i>

844
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,236
<i>But 10 million pesos
is too enticing of an offer.</i>

845
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:53,571
<i>People will hunt you down.</i>

846
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,406
<i>I'm here to find
Stella Morales!</i>

847
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,701
<i>I shouldn't pay for a crime
I didn't commit.</i>

848
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,411
<i>I promised I'd protect you.</i>

849
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,288
<i>I need to get Stella
out of the country.</i>

850
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,123
<i>I have an idea where Vincent
might've hidden Stella.</i>

851
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,458
<i>Men, search the area!</i>

852
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:07,335
<i>- Stella, you have to go.
- No.</i>

853
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:08,586
<i>- They're coming.
- I won't.</i>

854
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,296
<i>- I won't leave without you!
- Sir.</i>

855
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,923
<i>- Stella...
- Morales!</i>
