1
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,246
<i>I know where Vincent</i>
<i>is hiding Claudia.</i>

2
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,040
<i>I'm sure he'll do anything</i>
<i>to protect her.</i>

3
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,584
<i>- We need a distraction.</i>
<i>- Fire!</i>

4
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,461
<i>Call for help!</i>

5
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,712
<i>Aah!</i>

6
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,672
<i>You owe us too much.</i>

7
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,340
<i>I think it's time to collect.</i>

8
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,759
<i>This is all your fault.</i>

9
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,427
<i>You should be dead!</i>

10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,262
<i>- Stop!</i>
<i>- Aah!</i>

11
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,848
<i>That's not enough for</i>
<i>everything you did to us!</i>

12
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,683
<i>I'm not a bad person.</i>

13
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,351
<i>But because I loved you,</i>

14
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,770
<i>I ended up doing</i>
<i>something terrible.</i>

15
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,521
<i>You turned me into a monster!</i>

16
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,647
<i>Claudia, where are you?</i>

17
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,524
<i>I'm here at the rest house</i>
<i>in San Felipe.</i>

18
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,901
<i>Claudia! Claudia!</i>

19
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,195
<i>- What did you tell him?</i>
<i>- Let go of me!</i>

20
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,530
<i>Traitor!</i>

21
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,656
<i>You're done, Arthur.</i>

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,909
<i>I'll put you and your crazy son</i>
<i>in jail!</i>

23
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,702
<i>Shut up.</i>

24
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,329
<i>So much has happened, Vincent.</i>

25
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,289
<i>How long can we keep fighting?</i>

26
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,792
<i>For the rest of our lives.</i>
<i>As long as we're together.</i>

27
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,877
<i>It feels like she was trying</i>
<i>to tell me something.</i>

28
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,005
<i>What if she hid the flash drive</i>
<i>inside Bea's stuffed toy?</i>

29
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,300
Good thing Stella escaped.

30
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,552
Where is she?

31
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,179
She's safe.

32
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,889
That's all you need to know
for now.

33
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,142
Hold on, Vincent, be honest.

34
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,602
Don't you trust me?

35
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,648
I just don't want you
to get involved, Andres.

36
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,691
I'm giving you
plausible deniability

37
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,943
in case things go wrong.

38
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:50,985
I don't need that.

39
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,822
I told you I'd help and I will.

40
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:57,283
If you told me about your plan,
Claudia wouldn't have been hurt.

41
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,536
I just want to help Stella.
Where is she?

42
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:11,214
For Stella's safety,
it's better if you don't know.

43
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,465
It protects you too.

44
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,804
Wait.

45
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,306
Hello?

46
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,725
<i>Sir Andres,</i>
<i>it's about your mother.</i>

47
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,811
What?

48
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,312
Alright, I'm on my way.

49
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,649
Just call me if you need
anything.

50
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,638
She passed away peacefully
in her sleep.

51
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,184
We did everything
to extend her life.

52
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,230
I'm sorry for your loss.

53
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,713
Dear...

54
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,049
I know it hurts here.

55
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:21,010
But I want you to know
I'm not leaving your side.

56
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,933
Was it really
Aunty Stella's fault?

57
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,478
Stop thinking about that.

58
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,896
Just remember,

59
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,191
you're safe here.

60
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,944
We won't abandon you.

61
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,613
I won't let anything bad
happen to you.

62
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,864
Okay?

63
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,831
Stop crying, dear.

64
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,712
Nanny, take Bea to her room.

65
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,130
Okay.

66
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,680
Oh.

67
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,758
Thank God, Jacqueline.

68
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,596
That's one problem
we don't have to worry about.

69
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,431
What do we do?

70
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,433
Destroy it right away.

71
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,726
Now.

72
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,197
Daddy?

73
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,866
Dear.

74
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:54,205
I'm sorry.
Did Daddy wake you up?

75
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:57,959
Stay here.
Don't go with Aunt Stella.

76
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,461
She might kill you too.

77
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:07,218
Dear, who told you that?

78
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,346
Aunt Stella would never
do that to your mommy.

79
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,639
That's not true.

80
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,642
- But she's bad!
- What?

81
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,728
- Bea, no!
- She's bad! She's bad!

82
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,355
She's bad!

83
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:20,690
Captain.

84
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,067
Vincent's in our house.

85
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,986
He will lead us to Stella.

86
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,702
- Bea! Bea, are you okay?
- Dear, no.

87
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:38,457
Grandma, I don't want
to see Daddy anymore.

88
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,625
But, Bea...

89
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,296
You heard your own daughter.

90
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,132
Aren't you tired?

91
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,843
Please, just let Stella go.

92
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,346
She's ruining your life.
She's ruining your family!

93
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,017
Leave, Daddy!

94
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,102
Please, just leave.

95
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,896
She's been through enough.

96
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,707
Are you following me?

97
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,916
Wait, Vincent.

98
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,088
- Did you kill Claudia?
- Wait!

99
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,549
I trusted you, you traitor!

100
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,051
I'll explain, Vincent.

101
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,013
And you think I'll fall
for your lies again?

102
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,431
Here.

103
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,807
Will you listen?

104
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,897
You bastard! I trusted you,
and you betrayed me!

105
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,275
Yes, I did! But I had to!

106
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,947
Listen to me.
I'm not your enemy.

107
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,744
They blackmailed me.

108
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,707
They followed me around
until they found my weakness.

109
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,208
Then, they took my mother.

110
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,628
They took her to another
facility without my knowledge.

111
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,593
They used her life against me.
I didn't have a choice!

112
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,514
I was hoping they'd save
my mother's life.

113
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,603
But it's all for nothing.

114
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,439
She still died.

115
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,320
They gave me no choice but
to follow their orders, but...

116
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,991
...there's no use for it now.

117
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,828
After everything
I've seen and done?

118
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,996
It's all useless now.

119
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,084
So, I figured,

120
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,713
I don't need to listen
to them anymore.

121
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,677
I'm ready to say everything
I know about them.

122
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,222
I'm ready to testify
against them.

123
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:26,936
In the right time.

124
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,481
Not now.

125
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,400
Andres, so many people
have gotten hurt.

126
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,860
A lot have died in hopes
of finding the truth.

127
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:39,031
I need you inside to know
what their next move is.

128
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,283
You were there
when Claudia died.

129
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,244
And Dad, as well.

130
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,288
Arthur Cabrera is behind
all of this.

131
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,749
Claudia's death,
Stella's accusation,

132
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,753
even with all the evidences
and CCTV footage going missing.

133
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,672
Did they find a flash drive
on Claudia?

134
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,924
No, they're still looking.

135
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,759
We'll play along, then.

136
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,889
We'll convince them that
you're still on their side.

137
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:08,102
You probably know
it isn't that easy.

138
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,272
Arthur Cabrera is backed
by the biggest names.

139
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,607
I wouldn't be surprised
if they got the police, too.

140
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,611
That's the kind of power
Arthur and his men hold.

141
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,630
This is so bad.

142
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,300
They had Sir Andres
on their side, too?

143
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,553
How can we trust him now?

144
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,889
We can't be sure of anything
right now.

145
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,850
But I've got some information
from him.

146
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,853
- What kind?
- Falsification of autopsy,

147
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,189
erasing CCTV footage,

148
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,233
and manipulating
and paying people off.

149
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,031
What if...

150
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,409
I just face them myself?

151
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,411
It's not that easy, Stella.

152
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,122
If Sir Andres
is on our side now,

153
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,583
why don't we ask him for help?

154
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,084
We can do that, right?

155
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,254
Andres is in an awkward
position now, too.

156
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,132
Vincent...

157
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,969
I know you're getting tired
of all of this.

158
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,471
Don't mind me.

159
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:28,933
You know...

160
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,604
it might be better
if I stay away.

161
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,356
It'll be easier for you.

162
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,695
Stella, I'd rather struggle
with you by my side

163
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,908
than have it easy without you.

164
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,252
I don't know
what fate's deal is.

165
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,587
Why did we have
to meet like this?

166
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:03,884
Why didn't we just meet
on a dating app instead?

167
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,102
- Then, what?
- Then, we'd start a family.

168
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:19,108
We'd live somewhere
where no one knows us.

169
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,360
We'd live happily.

170
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,320
And peacefully.

171
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,540
I'll make your dreams come true.

172
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,793
I promise.

173
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,712
I wish I could do something

174
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,549
to end all of this.

175
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,469
Anything.

176
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:53,684
I can't let anyone else get hurt
because of me.

177
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,146
I'm sorry, Vincent.

178
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:50,259
Please, Vincent. Help Stella.

179
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,011
Don't let them get to her.

180
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,849
I'm doing everything I can
to protect her.

181
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,184
If you really love my daughter,

182
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:04,398
it's not enough
that you're helping her hide.

183
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,568
You can't just
protect her forever.

184
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,698
Take her out of the country.

185
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:17,327
Take her anywhere else but here.

186
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,537
Why?

187
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,583
As long as she's here with you,

188
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,877
she's in danger.

189
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,089
Even before the accusations
against her are proven,

190
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,383
everyone else
are already judging her.

191
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,762
Her life is at stake here.

192
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,436
Vincent!

193
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,147
Vincent, I'm not leaving here.

194
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,941
This is the last time
we'll talk about this.

195
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,527
I won't leave you
and my family behind.

196
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,113
We shouldn't be fighting
about this, Stella.

197
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,948
They won't stop
until they get you.

198
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,618
If they could do it to Claudia,
imagine what they'd do to you.

199
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,746
I won't leave without you.

200
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:04,082
I won't let you handle
all the problems alone.

201
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,918
We're in this together,
remember?

202
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,754
I'm not leaving.

203
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,818
Vincent.

204
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,696
What are you doing here?

205
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,949
Uh...

206
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,953
Vincent, please.

207
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,456
Just bring Stella forward
for our family's sake.

208
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,083
For Claudia's justice.

209
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,293
I want justice, too,

210
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:52,339
but only if we put
the real criminal in jail.

211
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,717
Vincent...

212
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,345
Maybe there's a way
to end all of this.

213
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,309
Once the truth gets out...

214
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,228
that's how we'd end this mess.

215
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,482
Vincent... Vincent.

216
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,749
Just do it, Stella.

217
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,252
You won't be safe unless
you're out of the country.

218
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,840
I don't want to hide
from a crime I didn't commit.

219
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,509
Just trust Vincent.

220
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,052
He won't put you in trouble.

221
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,848
That's right, Stella.

222
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,058
They're slowly
closing in on you.

223
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,188
Just leave before they find out
where you are.

224
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,152
You know me, Mama Mona.

225
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,321
I never run away
from my problems.

226
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,159
But things are
different now, Stella.

227
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,831
Let Vincent clear your name.

228
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,793
Vincent and I are
in this together.

229
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,379
We're facing
this problem together.

230
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,964
I won't leave him.

231
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,258
No matter what you do,
I'm not leaving.

232
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,553
Stella, please!

233
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,638
Please!

234
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,642
You saw what they did
to our mother, right?

235
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,270
I don't want you
to end up like her.

236
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,314
People have already
gotten involved, Stella.

237
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,316
They won't stop.

238
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,485
Don't worry.

239
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,571
We can handle being
far from you,

240
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,032
as long as I know
you're safe.

241
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,203
Stella...

242
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,715
Hello, Arthur.

243
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,510
I have an idea
where Vincent hid Stella.

244
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,932
Everybody, step out!

245
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,435
Listen up!

246
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,732
I want you to search
the whole area!

247
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,985
Team A, you're doing the search!

248
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,946
Team B, secure all exits!

249
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,489
And follow me!

250
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,049
Stella, the plan worked.

251
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,426
They took the bait.

252
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,553
They're at the safe house
right now.

253
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,762
I'm on my way.

254
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,389
Alright.

255
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,122
Captain!

256
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,624
Negative on the perimeter.

257
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,261
Vincent!

258
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,350
Stella, you're leaving.

259
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,436
We're not arguing
about this, okay?

260
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,854
I brought the rest
of your stuff.

261
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,689
Listen to me carefully.

262
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,899
You're getting on this boat.

263
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,317
It'll take you to
the next island.

264
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,568
When you get there,

265
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,487
you'll transfer to a yacht
heading to another country.

266
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,905
I don't want to go.

267
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,199
I'm not leaving
if you're not with me.

268
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,826
Stella, you can't hide forever.

269
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,455
We'll see each other again.

270
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,457
I'll clear your name first.

271
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,168
What if
that never happens?

272
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,796
When is that even
going to happen?!

273
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,465
What if they're the ones
who win, huh?!

274
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,635
Are you just going
to let me go--

275
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,345
Stella, I'm saving you!

276
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,723
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to.

277
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,518
We need to sacrifice
for now, okay?

278
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:26,113
- Stella, you need to go. Go.
- I'm not leaving!

279
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,364
- They're coming.
- No.

280
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,616
- No! Please, come with me!
- Boss-- Stella!

281
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,742
Vincent!

282
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,245
Stella.

283
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,747
- Stella, they're coming.
- Vincent.

284
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,795
Vincent.

285
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,842
Vincent, come with me!

286
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,605
<i>If you were given</i>
<i>a fresh start,</i>

287
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,856
<i>what would you do?</i>

288
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,442
<i>I'd learn to ride a bike.</i>

289
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,194
<i>Like I told you before,</i>

290
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,779
<i>I never got to play</i>
<i>when I was a kid.</i>

291
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,115
<i>I want to be like others</i>
<i>who ride fast,</i>

292
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:56,703
<i>their hair flying in the wind</i>
<i>while they bike and laugh,</i>

293
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,122
<i>like they don't have</i>
<i>anything else to worry about.</i>

294
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,167
<i>Then add that to our list.</i>

295
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,668
<i>Uh, Vincent.</i>

296
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,838
<i>By the way, thanks for today.</i>
<i>I had fun.</i>

297
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,591
<i>We'll do this again.</i>

298
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,302
<i>I've been</i>
<i>looking for you!</i>

299
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,804
<i>I've been trying to call you,</i>
<i>but you weren't answering!</i>

300
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,389
<i>Why are you so upset?</i>

301
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,891
<i>Because I'm worried!</i>

302
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,184
<i>What am I to you, huh?!</i>

303
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,353
<i>What am I in your life?</i>
<i>Nothing, right?!</i>

304
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,563
<i>Don't you see</i>
<i>how important you are to me?!</i>

305
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,315
<i>- Then, tell me--</i>
<i>- I love you!</i>

306
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,240
<i>Stella, I'll do</i>
<i>everything to clear our names,</i>

307
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,201
<i>and the one who really</i>
<i>committed this crime will pay.</i>

308
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,955
<i>I promise that to you.</i>

309
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,832
<i>I'm scared for you, Vincent.</i>

310
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,043
<i>Vincent, you have</i>
<i>to promise me.</i>

311
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:49,506
<i>Promise me that you'll never</i>
<i>sacrifice your life for mine.</i>

312
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,757
<i>Okay.</i>

313
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,133
<i>I want to...</i>

314
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,595
<i>fulfill your dreams, Stella.</i>

315
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,806
<i>I promise.</i>

316
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,809
<i>If only</i>
<i>I could do something...</i>

317
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,688
<i>to finally end all of this,</i>

318
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,233
<i>I would do it.</i>

319
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:14,364
<i>I won't let anyone else</i>
<i>get hurt because of me.</i>

320
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,603
Vincent!

321
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,277
Stella.

322
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,698
Vincent. Vincent.

323
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,082
Wait.

324
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,044
What did you do?

325
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,338
Why did you jump?
You could've gotten hurt!

326
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,381
I'm not leaving.

327
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,384
Say whatever
you want to tell me,

328
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,595
but I'm not someone
who abandons people.

329
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:23,600
You fought for me, Vincent,
so I'll fight for you too.

330
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,686
Are you crazy, Stella?

331
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,358
If I leave,
who's going to fight for you?

332
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,692
So from now on,

333
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,904
there's nothing you can do
that will make me leave you.

334
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,907
I'm not leaving you alone
no matter what happens.

335
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:43,953
We'll face every challenge
together.

336
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,831
You're not the only one
who'll clear my name.

337
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,916
We'll both do it.

338
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,712
We made a promise, remember?

339
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,130
You and I...

340
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,802
- Forever.
- Forever.

341
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:31,000
Oh, someone already
checked on me earlier.

342
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,552
Stella?

343
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,139
My child!

344
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,724
- Ma...
- What are you doing here?

345
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,352
I thought you left already.

346
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,271
I couldn't leave, Ma.

347
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:54,357
Stella, please. I'm begging you.

348
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,943
Think about yourself for once.

349
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:01,114
You should've taken
the chance to escape.

350
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,575
Ma, after everything
I've been through,

351
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,535
I don't back down
from any fight.

352
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:09,706
Dear, if something
bad happens to you again,

353
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,459
I'll never forgive myself.

354
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,879
Please trust me and Vincent.

355
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:19,382
This is one fight
I'm not losing.

356
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,761
We'll still get the justice
we deserve.

357
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:32,103
Daddy, is Mommy in heaven now?

358
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,773
Yes, dear.

359
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,278
She's still watching over you.

360
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,531
She's your
new guardian angel, so...

361
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:49,037
you don't have to cry
and feel sad or scared, okay?

362
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,499
But I'm scared of Aunt Stella.

363
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:56,878
They said she's
a bad person.

364
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,672
Dear...

365
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,090
Look at Daddy.

366
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,638
Just listen to me for now, okay?

367
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,057
Your Aunt Stella isn't bad.

368
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,435
And she didn't do anything
bad to your mommy.

369
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,686
Someday...

370
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,398
...you'll understand everything.

371
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,691
But for now...

372
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,529
...you have to trust
Daddy, okay?

373
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,613
Come here.

374
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,792
Alright. Go to your room.

375
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:37,794
Nanny.

376
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,812
So my suspicion was right.

377
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,898
I don't know what you're
talking about.

378
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,317
You were the one
who called the police

379
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,736
to go after Stella!

380
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,697
Don't lie to me!

381
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,491
Yes.

382
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,119
Because I was trying
to save you, Vincent.

383
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,121
Stella is a criminal!

384
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,165
And who are you
to call her a criminal?!

385
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,626
Do you have proof for all
the accusations you're making?

386
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:23,047
Did you even see her kill
Walter and Claudia yourself?!

387
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,173
No, right?!

388
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,304
Because you know the truth
about how they died.

389
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,849
And you're all forcing
the blame on Stella!

390
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,310
Why do you hate her
so much, Mom?

391
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,564
Is it because she's
Rebecca's daughter?

392
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,861
Is it because they know
all your dirt and secrets?

393
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,280
Because she's the one
who can ruin you!

394
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,659
Because she's destroying
our family.

395
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,744
No!

396
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,912
It's Dad!

397
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,165
Dad and his constant need

398
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,958
to protect his power
and his legacy!

399
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,377
That's the root of why
our family's falling apart!

400
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,297
Your dad is just
protecting all of us.

401
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,299
Cut the crap, Mom!

402
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,550
Tell me.

403
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,719
If you had to choose
between me and Dad,

404
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,304
who would you choose?

405
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,143
You'll never choose
to protect me.

406
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,439
That's not true, Vincent.

407
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,941
I've always been protecting you.

408
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:28,696
Mom, if that's true,
then why am I in this mess?!

409
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,823
Stop it, Mom.

410
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:34,243
You would never choose me.

411
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,995
And I've accepted that.

412
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,914
But Stella...

413
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,583
She keeps showing me
again and again

414
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,335
that no matter what happens,

415
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,046
she will always choose me.

416
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,716
So no matter what you
say or do,

417
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,344
I'll fight for her
and protect her.

Bea?

427
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,056
Bea? Bea!

428
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,558
Nanny.

429
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,851
Have you seen Bea?

430
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,394
Wasn't she with you, ma'am?

431
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,866
Oh.

432
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,705
Vincent forgot his phone.

Daddy, I'm going to your house.

But I don't know
where I am anymore.

441
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,211
Hello, Bea?

442
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,004
This is Aunt Stella.

443
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,089
Who's with you?

444
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:37,093
I want to talk to Daddy,
not you!

445
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,054
Uh, your daddy left his phone.

446
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,597
Who are you with right now?

447
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,849
No one.

448
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:47,562
But I don't want to talk to you.
I want Daddy!

449
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,605
Uh, Bea, wait.

450
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,941
What do you see around you?

451
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,026
I'll go to you.
Don't leave that spot.

452
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,279
I don't like you!

453
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,322
Bea, wait--

454
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,082
Hello, Katherine.

455
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:11,419
Isn't there an app on the phone
that can track location?

456
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,628
How do you use that?

457
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,989
Bea!

458
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,824
Daddy...

459
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,368
Bea! Bea!

460
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,829
Why did you leave the house?!
It's dangerous here.

461
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:47,872
Come on.

462
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:51,542
I don't like you! I want Daddy!

463
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,544
Come with me.

464
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,379
Let's wait for your daddy
downstairs.

465
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,797
It's dangerous up here.
Come on--

466
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,008
- No!
- Bea!

467
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,092
Bea!

468
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,677
Bea!

469
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,679
Bea!

470
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,765
- Aah!
- Bea!

471
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:06,849
Bea!

472
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,019
Bea! Bea-- Help!

473
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,188
Help us-- Bea!

474
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,398
Bea... Bea...

475
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,984
Help! Help us!

476
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,529
Taxi! Taxi!

477
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,741
Bea, hold on.

478
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,040
Take us to the nearest hospital!

479
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,631
Mister, please hurry.

480
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:41,425
Please, let's go faster.
I'm begging you.

481
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,511
Bea...

482
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,388
Bea, Aunt Stella is here.

483
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,598
Bea... Bea...

484
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,642
I want my daddy!

485
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,895
I don't like you!
Take me to Daddy!

486
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,231
- Bea-- Please step on it.
- I want Daddy!

487
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:59,235
Daddy! I want Daddy!

488
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,242
- Daddy...
- Help!

489
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,660
- Help!
- Daddy...

490
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:08,869
What happened to the patient?

491
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,204
She was hit by a car.

492
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,456
- She has a wound on her arm.
- It hurts!

493
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,625
- Sit here.
- It hurts.

494
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,293
Bea, we're at
the hospital now, okay?

495
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,463
It hurts!

496
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,215
Are you related to the patient?

497
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,927
Uh, no.

498
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,179
I just saw her on the street,
so I helped her.

499
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,515
- It hurts!
- Alright, wait a moment.

500
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,810
It hurts! It hurts!

501
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:36,313
It hurts!

502
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,233
It hurts so much!

503
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:46,407
It hurts! It hurts!

504
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,408
Baby...

505
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,869
It hurts!

506
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:53,205
George, are you
with Vincent right now?

507
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,666
No, Stella. Why?

508
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,209
Bea was hit by a car.

509
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,503
I need Vincent here
at the hospital.

510
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,881
Vincent doesn't have
his phone right now.

511
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,257
He didn't bring it.

512
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,634
I know where he is.
I'll tell him.

513
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,180
It hurts.

514
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,059
Who's the woman
who brought you here?

515
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,603
It's Aunt Stella.

516
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,687
Stella?

517
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,441
Stella Morales?

518
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,152
Stella Morales?

519
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,907
Wait, stay here for a moment.

520
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,325
It hurts.

521
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:33,954
It hurts.

522
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,375
Hello?

523
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,711
Police station?

524
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,049
I'd like to make
a report.

525
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,226
Bea?

526
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,604
How are you feeling?

527
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,406
I already called
your Uncle George.

528
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,619
He said he and your dad
will be here soon.

529
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,129
Bea, are you mad at me?

530
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,010
Grandpa said you're bad.

531
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,639
Because of you,

532
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,517
I don't get to spend time
with Daddy anymore.

533
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,896
So, I wanted to go to him.

534
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,109
I wanted him and Grandma
to make up.

535
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,490
Bea...

536
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,785
Believe me,

537
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,414
I don't want you and your dad
to be apart.

538
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:03,043
I also don't want him
fighting with his family.

539
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:05,546
Because...

540
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,257
Because I know
what it feels like

541
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,675
to be away from family.

542
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,016
It's fine if you get mad at me.

543
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,643
Just...

544
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,730
promise me you won't
get mad at your dad, alright?

545
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,650
He loves you so much.

546
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:32,198
He's doing everything
just so you can be together.

547
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,825
Really?

548
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,916
So, get better, alright?

549
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,878
Is it okay with you if...

550
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,881
I look after you for now?

551
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,426
Okay, go to sleep.

552
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,289
Patient Bea Cabrera?

553
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,290
Over there.

554
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:33,509
What do you need?

555
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:38,055
Sir, we got an anonymous tip
that Stella Morales is here.

556
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:41,850
Do you see her?

557
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,019
No, right?

558
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,398
I'm the only one here
taking care of my daughter.

559
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,569
Sir, they said Stella
brought your daughter here.

560
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,117
From what I know,
it was just a concerned citizen.

561
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,326
Not Stella.

562
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,707
You can leave now.

563
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,251
My daughter's resting.

564
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,212
Let's go.

565
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,263
Unlock the door.

566
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,228
- W-Where's Vincent?
- He's inside.

567
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,024
Stella, good thing
the police didn't catch you.

568
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,110
Someone might've seen me.

569
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,611
Come on,
let's get out of here now.

570
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,117
Mr. Cabrera,

571
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,202
the X-ray result
for your daughter is out.

572
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:44,830
Alright, doc.

573
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:52,087
Mr. Cabrera, good news,
no fractures.

574
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,968
That's good, doc. Thank you.

575
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,471
We just need to give her
a blood transfusion.

576
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:03,015
Her hemoglobin dropped.

577
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,476
She has lacerations
on her left arm.

578
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,979
The wound's small,
but a vein was hit.

579
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,814
It'll take an hour

580
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,859
to find and prepare
compatible blood for her.

581
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,571
Uh...

582
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,783
Alright, doc, do everything
that needs to be done.

583
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,286
My daughter's blood type is O.

584
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,371
No.

585
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,623
She's Type B.
We just tested her.

586
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,501
Doc, how's that possible?

587
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,086
My wife and I are both Type O.

588
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,129
It's impossible for
our daughter to be Type B.

589
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,214
She's Type B.

590
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,801
Uh...

591
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,260
Doc, maybe you
can repeat the test

592
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,221
because that really
can't happen.

593
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,723
Okay, Mr. Cabrera.
For your peace of mind.

594
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,359
Dr. Jimenez?

595
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,277
Vincent, why did you call?

596
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,738
I need to talk to you.

597
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,410
Don't come back here
without her.

598
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,540
Hello, Dr. Jimenez?
Why did you call?

599
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,292
Vincent called me.

600
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,044
He was asking
about Bea's blood type.

601
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,587
Huh?

602
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:16,672
Why?

603
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,299
<i>He said Bea's in the hospital.</i>

604
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,301
She got into an accident.

605
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:22,928
W-Which hospital?

606
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:24,596
What happened?

607
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,891
Bea got into an accident.

608
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,018
She was taken to the hospital.

609
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,728
Get the car ready now.

610
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,813
Yes, sir!

611
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,943
Nurse?

612
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,279
They said the blood test
for my daughter,

613
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,488
Bea Cabrera, came in already.

614
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,323
Can she get the transfusion?

615
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,492
Yes, sir. She's Type B.

616
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,494
We already gave her blood.

617
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,289
Wait.

618
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,124
Uh...

619
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,168
- I'll go see my daughter.
- Okay, sir.

620
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:03,844
Bea?

621
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,221
Bea?!

622
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,266
Nurse, where's my daughter?!

623
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,370
Grandma?

624
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,915
Dear, are you hurting anywhere?

625
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:37,002
Where are we going?

626
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,087
We're going home, okay?

627
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,298
Where's Daddy?

628
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,136
Thank you so much for the help.

629
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,514
I won't forget this.

630
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,015
No problem, Chairman.

631
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,688
Dad, where's Bea?

632
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,445
Well, I spoke to the doctor,
and it wasn't that serious.

633
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,114
So, she's going to rest
at our house.

634
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,033
There's already a doctor
waiting for her there.

635
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,536
This is kidnapping!

636
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,038
Better than harboring
a criminal.

637
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,460
I know what you're doing,
Vincent.

638
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,379
Go ahead.

639
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,381
Do what you want.

640
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:26,009
Take Bea, and you'll be
the first to end up in jail.

641
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,805
We'll take sole custody of Bea.

642
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,100
What right do you have
to be Bea's parents?

643
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,062
You can't have everything,
Vincent.

644
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:41,024
It's either Stella or Bea.

645
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,651
Take your pick.

646
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,404
I don't have to pick.

647
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:50,325
Because the more time passes,
the more I uncover.

648
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:53,245
You can't hide the truth
forever.

649
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,549
Drink some water.

650
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,012
They're using my daughter
as bait.

651
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,058
If you have to choose
between the two of us,

652
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,603
I want you to choose Bea.

653
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:23,108
Stella, I don't have to choose.

654
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,446
But I also need to talk
to Claudia's OB-GYN.

655
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,950
Something's wrong with the
blood type test at the hospital.

656
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,161
What's wrong?

657
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,747
The test came out
Type B for Bea.

658
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,499
But that's impossible because
Claudia and I are both Type O.

659
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:43,879
Were you there when
Claudia gave birth to Bea?

660
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:44,963
No.

661
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,924
I was abroad.

662
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,307
It's done, ma'am.
I'll come back later.

663
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,017
- Thanks.
- I'll move you over.

664
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,977
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Ma'am.

665
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,610
Too bad Vincent's wife died.

666
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,821
She's the only one
who could explain

667
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,824
the real identity
of her daughter.

668
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,748
When will we ever be
whole again?

669
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,214
Mama, look.

670
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,053
Who's that?

671
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,723
It came from the private
investigator I hired.

672
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,977
They said this is what Joy
might look like now.

673
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,606
Will we ever see her again?

674
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,864
I'm still hoping
that we'll find out

675
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,326
where Walter took Joy.

676
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,121
I even hired
a private investigator,

677
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,873
but it didn't really
solve anything.

678
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:05,836
Why don't you ask
the investigator again?

679
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,588
What if he...

680
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,425
discovered new information
about Joy?

681
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,346
That's what
I'm curious about, too.

682
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:19,474
He suddenly
just stopped searching.

683
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:23,812
He never told me why.

684
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,357
Try calling him again.

685
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,402
Ask him what he's found out.

686
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,779
I'll do it if you can't.

687
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:37,284
Let's not give up
on looking for Joy.

688
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:39,870
Please, Stella.

689
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:41,955
Please...

690
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:55,093
Make sure you get enough rest
and eat healthy.

691
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:58,221
- We'll meet your baby soon.
- Thank you, doc.

692
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,604
Is Dr. Jimenez in?

693
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,481
She's my wife's doctor.

694
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,984
I'm sorry, sir. She just left.

695
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,113
Um... What time will she
be back? I'll wait for her.

696
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,865
Just come back another day.

697
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,117
She's done with the check-ups
for today.

698
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:20,535
Is that so?

699
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,040
Please tell her I'll be back.

700
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,124
Yes, sir.

701
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:46,728
- Hello?
- Hello?

702
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,063
It's Stella.

703
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,065
Wait.

704
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,108
Aren't you a fugitive?

705
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:55,195
I just wanted to ask you
something about my sister.

706
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,864
<i>- Can you tell me--</i>
- Ma'am...

707
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,699
I don't work for you anymore.

708
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,494
Just hire someone else.

709
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,955
Wait, why are you avoiding me?

710
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,792
Hello! Hello?

711
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,293
Come here!

712
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,462
- Ma'am...
- What are you hiding from me?

713
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,172
Wait. What do you want from me?

714
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:22,550
Don't move!
Tell me what you know.

715
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:23,927
What did you find out?

716
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,887
And why are you
hiding it from me?

717
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,681
- Tell me!
- Ma'am...

718
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,557
Tell me before you get hurt.

719
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,937
- Ma'am...
- Tell me!

720
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,231
Ma'am, it's over.

721
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,317
She's dead.

722
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,320
Let me go, please.

723
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,571
What do you mean?

724
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,657
Who's dead?

725
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,075
Who are you talking about?

726
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,661
- Tell me!
- C-Claudia.

727
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,956
Claudia Cabrera.

728
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,625
She paid me a huge
amount of money

729
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,170
and told me to stop
the investigation.

730
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,798
She ordered me to stop
looking for your sister.

731
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,217
B-But I don't know why.

732
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:06,511
Claudia?

733
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,180
Why?

734
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,062
This is not Bea's birthday.
It's off by a month.

735
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,609
I found something, too.

736
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,610
What is it?

737
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,863
Remember the private
investigator I hired?

738
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,866
The one who was looking for Joy?

739
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:29,909
Yeah.

740
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:34,497
He said Claudia paid him off
to stop the investigation.

741
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,667
Why would she do that?

742
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,294
What does she know
about my sister?

743
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,547
S-Stella, I need to talk
to her doctor.

744
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:46,134
Only she can tell me
what's going on.

745
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:49,679
To conclude, reproductive
health is important

746
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,890
to our overall well-being.

747
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,684
With the right knowledge
and responsible choices,

748
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:58,480
we can build a safer and
more prepared community.

749
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:01,441
I hope you bring
our lessons with you

750
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:05,403
so we can build a better future
for everyone and ourselves.

751
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:10,283
- Thank you, Dr. Jimenez.
- Thank you.

752
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:13,244
Now, for the Q&A portion
of our program.

753
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,954
Does anybody have questions?

754
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,333
Any questions for Dr. Jimenez?

755
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,376
There we go! Wait there, sir.

756
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,464
What would you like
to ask the doctor?

757
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:31,221
Uh, doc, what can you say
about malpractice?

758
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:32,764
Uh...

759
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,518
In the span of your career,

760
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:41,856
have you experienced
a moral dilemma, just like...

761
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,401
I don't know.
Let's say, taking bribes?

762
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,156
No.

763
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:54,577
Uh, sorry, I have...
I have an emergency.

764
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,246
So... thank you so much.

765
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,705
- Okay, doc. No problem.
- I'm so sorry.

766
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:00,416
Let's give her another round
of applause.

767
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,545
For our next speaker,
let's all welcome Dr. Mark...

768
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,341
Doc!

769
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,761
- Oh, wait.
- No, no, no. I'm in a hurry.

770
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,929
Miss, no, no, no.

771
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:13,972
Just wait a bit.

772
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,851
Vincent, what do you
want from me?

773
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,439
Tell me the truth.

774
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,108
What happened to my baby
with Claudia?

775
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,152
What are you saying?

776
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,154
Claudia delivered
a healthy baby girl.

777
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,239
Stop lying to me. Look at this.

778
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,617
This isn't
my daughter's birthday.

779
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:38,246
And Bea's blood type
is different from ours.

780
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,709
I can find out anything I want.

781
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,170
If you don't tell me the truth,

782
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:47,714
you won't just lose
your license,

783
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,841
I'll also make sure
you rot in prison!

784
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,052
Vincent...

785
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,679
Claudia lost your baby.

786
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:59,017
She delivered it too early.
It was a stillbirth.

787
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,395
So, who's Bea?

788
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,857
W-Who's the child
you gave them, then?

789
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:09,944
I-I don't know!

790
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,863
Claudia found another baby.

791
00:58:12,488 --> 00:58:15,074
I was a struggling doctor then.

792
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:19,913
They said they'd hurt my family
if I didn't do what they want.

793
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:23,708
I was forced to forge documents
for your fake daughter.

794
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:27,003
Where did that child come from?

795
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,379
Tell me the truth.

796
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,758
I really don't know!
I'm telling the truth!

797
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,343
Maybe you should ask your mom.

798
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,430
Mom?

799
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,224
<i>Once I clear my name</i>

800
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,685
<i>after all the crap</i>
<i>you did to my family,</i>

801
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:26,062
<i>I promise</i>
<i>I'll make you pay!</i>

802
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:29,357
<i>Do everything to find</i>
<i>Rebecca and Stella.</i>

803
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,402
<i>The time has come to catch</i>
<i>the mouse from its hiding place.</i>

804
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,320
<i>All I did was protect</i>
<i>this family.</i>

805
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,698
<i>We should be punishing</i>
<i>those who make mistakes,</i>

806
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,157
<i>not protecting them!</i>

807
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,159
<i>I'm sorry, I thought I had</i>
<i>everything sorted out.</i>

808
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,911
<i>That's why I did it</i>
<i>to Claudia.</i>

809
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,538
<i>Matthew, what happened</i>
<i>that night?</i>

810
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,540
<i>Was Dad the one</i>
<i>who killed Walter?</i>

811
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:47,041
<i>I know you're dying</i>
<i>to tell me.</i>
