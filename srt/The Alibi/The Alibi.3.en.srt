1
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,079
<i>What do you know</i>
<i>about what happened to Walter?</i>

2
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,080
<i>I don't know anything.</i>

3
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,832
<i>A desperate man</i>
<i>can do anything.</i>

4
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,752
<i>You can call me desperate,</i>
<i>but I'm not evil.</i>

5
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,712
<i>- That's not what I need.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

6
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,380
<i>I need to clear my name.</i>

7
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,257
<i>I'm a suspect</i>
<i>in a murder case.</i>

8
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,925
<i>I need you to be my alibi.</i>

9
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,928
<i>How dare you drag</i>
<i>our family into this filth!</i>

10
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,096
<i>Stop acting innocent!</i>

11
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,806
<i>I know you and Walter</i>
<i>had an affair.</i>

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,308
<i>Are you really</i>
<i>my son's girlfriend?</i>

13
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,517
<i>Yes, Madam.</i>

14
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,895
<i>- You don't know us.</i>
<i>- You don't know me either.</i>

15
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,938
<i>That Stella Morales...</i>

16
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,940
<i>She can't be part</i>
<i>of Vincent's life.</i>

17
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,485
<i>We need to get rid of her.</i>

18
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,278
<i>Aah!</i>

19
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,279
<i>Let go of me!</i>

20
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,655
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

21
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,908
<i>Who are you?</i>
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

22
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,743
<i>You bastards!</i>

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,299
Hello?

24
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,802
Hello, Vincent? Where are you?

25
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,261
I'm at home.

26
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,263
You need to come here
right now.

27
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,266
Let go of me!
What's wrong with you?!

28
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,643
I said let go of me!

29
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,437
Let me go!
What's your problem?!

30
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,481
Ouch!

31
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,610
You again?!

32
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,613
You?

33
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,448
What's the meaning of this?!

34
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,201
You went through all that
just to talk to me?!

35
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,578
You didn't have to kidnap me!

36
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,996
I thought I was
going to die!

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,331
You could've just texted me.

38
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,416
Or better yet, you should've
done what your wife did

39
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,918
and talked to me at the bar!

40
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,170
I'm sure you'll have
fun there!

41
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,673
Okay, let's get down
to business.

42
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,882
Business! Business!

43
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,342
What do you need?!

44
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,679
I found out you're still
taking care of your siblings.

45
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,222
Where's your mother?

46
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,932
What do you care
about my mother?!

47
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,602
Why are we digging
into my life here?

48
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,812
What do you really want?

49
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,605
Break up with Vincent.

50
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,190
How much do you want?

51
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,359
You'll pay me to break up
with your son?

52
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,529
Yes. Name your price,
whatever it is.

53
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,619
Wait!

54
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,787
Wait, wait!

55
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,289
What's the meaning of this?!

56
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,041
Hey.

57
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,502
No need to get hysterical.

58
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,004
We're just talking.

59
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,881
Your name has been
damaged enough.

60
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,674
We're just trying
to fix everything.

61
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,427
Did I ask for your help?

62
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,179
Stella will not be part
of your mind games!

63
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,140
She's just using you
and your money,

64
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,641
and you're letting her
fool you!

65
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,270
I love Stella.

66
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,856
This is crazy.

67
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:10,899
Love?

68
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,984
How can you love someone
like that?

69
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,796
Stop this indecency!

70
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,548
This is highly inappropriate!

71
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,050
Inappropriate?!

72
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,721
I didn't know this family
knows that word.

73
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,349
So what do you call what
you're doing to Stella now?!

74
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,392
Don't you dare go near
Stella again!

75
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,894
And no one touches her!

76
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:48,978
Ever!

77
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,730
Let's go.

78
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,610
Hurry.

79
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,954
Wait!

80
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,166
Why did you kiss me?!

81
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:12,251
That wasn't part of the deal!

82
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,712
Stella, I had to do
what I needed to do.

83
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,132
They're already suspicious
about our relationship.

84
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,927
So I just shocked them
to shut them up, okay?

85
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,179
I don't care what they say.

86
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,682
Because whatever I do,
they'll still pay me anyway.

87
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,558
I could've gotten a huge money
from your dad,

88
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,601
but you stopped me.

89
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,520
Why do you always
meddle with what I do?!

90
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,106
- I'm going back to them.
- Stella!

91
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,190
What?!

92
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,484
- That's my dream!
- Your dream?

93
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,611
To be slapped with money!

94
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,613
I always see that
in drama series.

95
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,615
But I won't do
what the leads do

96
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,033
who turn down the money.

97
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,202
Then I'll just match
their offer.

98
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,705
Stella, you can't break
our deal.

99
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,331
The police are
still questioning me

100
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,833
about Walter's death.

101
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,001
I still need you.

102
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,460
I need money!

103
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,712
Is money all you care about?

104
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,754
Yes!

105
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,881
Because I'm not rich
like you.

106
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,842
Money might not mean
anything to you,

107
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,677
but for people like us
who do everything,

108
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,303
including
selling ourselves,

109
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,763
money means everything!

110
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,141
Just so I can give
my family a better life!

111
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,977
There are things
more important than money!

112
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,186
Damn it!

113
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,815
You only say that because
you already have everything!

114
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,066
You're on top, right?

115
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,360
So don't you dare lecture me
about my life

116
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,280
because you have no idea
what I'm going through!

117
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,282
And you don't know
what I'm going through either!

118
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,159
You don't know me!

119
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,660
Daddy!

120
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,912
I missed you, Daddy.

121
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,125
I missed you too, baby.

122
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,835
Who is she?

123
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,589
Uh, her name is Stella.

124
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,757
She's my friend.

125
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,675
So...

126
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,261
You're Stella.

127
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,807
It's nice to finally meet
Vincent's friend.

128
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:50,892
Claudia.

129
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,896
Not in front of Bea.

130
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,119
Stella.

131
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,499
Stella!

132
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,834
I've made up my mind.
I'm done!

133
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,130
Stella, if we stop now,
they'll suspect me even more.

134
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,299
Then let's just say
we broke up.

135
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,467
Don't worry,

136
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,760
I'll still stand by my story

137
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,136
that we were together
that night,

138
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,387
but that's all.

139
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,181
I don't want to lie anymore.

140
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,433
- I know, but--
- I put up a front

141
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,726
inside the bar,

142
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,021
now I even have to act like
your mistress in public too?

143
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,190
Everyone already sees me
as some evil woman

144
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,109
who destroyed a family.

145
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,028
But I'm not
that kind of person.

146
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,072
Because I'm not
that kind of woman.

147
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,534
You put me in a situation
I never wanted.

148
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,285
Yes, fine, I'm grateful

149
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,204
I was able to pay
for my brother's surgery

150
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,372
because of your help,

151
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,374
but that's probably
where it ends.

152
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:03,172
What can you say about
your sister's relationship

153
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,799
with Mr. Vincent Cabrera?

154
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,175
I don't know.

155
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,802
I don't even know him.

156
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,095
Why don't you know anything?

157
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,514
My sister never
introduced him to us.

158
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,808
She never even
talked about him.

159
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,270
I only found out
when everyone else did,

160
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,147
because of their video.

161
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,690
Katherine?

162
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,774
Stella.

163
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,489
Go see Joseph in his room.

164
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,574
Go on.

165
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,411
Uh, sir, what's this about?

166
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,246
With all due respect,

167
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,331
I won't allow you
to drag my sister

168
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,250
into your questioning.

169
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,211
If you have any questions,
ask me directly.

170
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,672
Uh...

171
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,549
Why doesn't she know
about your relationship

172
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,009
with Cabrera?

173
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,222
No reason.

174
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,102
She's really negative
when it comes to guys,

175
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,896
especially the ones I date.

176
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,647
She knows that
because of my job,

177
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,566
no one really
takes me seriously.

178
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,276
So whenever that
topic comes up,

179
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,153
we just avoid it.

180
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,655
Hold on.

181
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,617
Why am I even answering
all your questions?

182
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,412
Didn't I already finish
your little Q&A session?

183
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:18,331
We're just confirming
everything.

184
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,791
We got new information.

185
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,421
Someone saw
Mr. Vincent Cabrera

186
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:28,299
that night at Cunanan's villa.

187
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,595
So, who's telling the truth
between you two?

188
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,601
Those cops
are really something!

189
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,853
They just won't stop, huh?!

190
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,147
How can they stop when they
haven't solved the case yet?

191
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,485
As of now, Vincent's still
their main suspect.

192
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,029
Especially since another
witness saw him there.

193
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,782
That's why they're still
targeting you.

194
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,450
Because you're involved!

195
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,993
You're his alibi.

196
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,955
What if the police find out
you lied?

197
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:00,957
Yeah, right!

198
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,000
Didn't you already
end the deal?

199
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,293
He's not your boyfriend
anymore.

200
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,212
Maybe you should
take that back.

201
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,297
Stick to your story again.

202
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,590
Make him your boyfriend again.

203
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,634
That'll only drag me deeper
into his mess.

204
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,221
I don't want to go through
what happened before.

205
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,598
It's hard when you've got
no one on your side.

206
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,892
Vincent's rich.

207
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,770
He can easily fix any problem.

208
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,106
And he can
protect you too.

209
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,429
You're really persistent, huh?

210
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,180
I'm not someone
who gives up easily.

211
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,808
Look.

212
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,269
I don't want to drag
this transaction any longer.

213
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:08,316
I want to clear my name
as soon as possible.

214
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,400
Just...

215
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,486
Just stay.

216
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,281
I also need to talk
to you seriously.

217
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,824
Listen carefully.

218
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,454
The cops
won't leave me alone.

219
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,165
They interrogated
my sister too.

220
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,209
I've changed my mind.

221
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,588
I'll agree to what you want.

222
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,300
But I have rules.

223
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,510
Rules?

224
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,387
Rule number one...

225
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,014
You're not allowed
to ask anything

226
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,891
about my personal life,

227
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,810
especially about my family.

228
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,187
And what's rule number two?

229
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,523
We don't throw each other
under the bus.

230
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,779
We'll do everything
to keep each other safe,

231
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,989
no matter what happens.

232
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,284
Okay, no problem.

233
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,912
Deal.

234
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:07,958
Above all...

235
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,921
I need ten million pesos.

236
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,552
My and my siblings'
lives are on the line here.

237
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,096
That money is my insurance

238
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,806
for the chaos
I'm about to step into.

239
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,432
Did I say no?

240
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,186
I agree to your terms.

241
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,071
Deal.

242
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,627
What?!

243
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,088
You paid Stella
to be your alibi?!

244
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,716
She's the only one
I can trust.

245
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,927
Fair enough.

246
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,388
So they won't pin it on you.

247
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,639
But, bro...

248
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,308
How sure are you that you
can really trust Stella?

249
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:12,022
George, I didn't have
a choice.

250
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,819
<i>For</i>
<i>everybody's peace of mind...</i>

251
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,363
<i>I admit...</i>

252
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,532
- What's going on?
<i>- ...it was my fault.</i>

253
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,201
What?!

254
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:28,205
<i>I'm the one who killed</i>
<i>Walter Cunanan.</i>

255
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,915
Who did this?!

256
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,292
Are you the ones behind this?!

257
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,668
We're still finding out, sir.

258
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,879
But the video's already been
passed around.

259
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,380
It'll be hard to trace.

260
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,840
It's all over social media.

261
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,758
That's not me!

262
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,719
I want this taken down now!

263
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,305
Now! Get out!

264
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,140
Hurry!

265
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,311
Stella, what now?

266
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,770
Even if that video's fake,

267
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,355
a lot of people online
believe it.

268
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,941
They really think
he's the killer.

269
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,235
I'm sure Vincent's already
fixing the problem.

270
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,570
He works in media, right?

271
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,780
But what effect will
this have on the case?

272
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,407
What if the police believe it?

273
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,992
You might get dragged into it.

274
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,952
Didn't you two already talk?

275
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,662
Did you accept
his offer again?

276
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,872
Yes.

277
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,540
For a larger amount.

278
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,084
Don't worry about it.

279
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,046
I already prepared
for this kind of situation.

280
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,256
When I made my decision,

281
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,467
there was no turning back.

282
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,469
He better keep
his word though.

283
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,304
Especially with
10 million pesos on the line.

284
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,388
If he doesn't,

285
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,474
he'll see what Stella's
really capable of.

286
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,939
I've been searching
for my sibling for so long.

287
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,982
I don't want all this
to be for nothing.

288
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,319
My siblings and I
will be reunited someday.

289
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,115
And that money will help me
continue my search.

290
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:54,959
<i>I'm the one</i>
<i>who killed Walter Cunanan.</i>

291
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,087
I'll prove that video's fake.

292
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,631
I've already spoken to a
legal team and a tech expert

293
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,799
to handle this.

294
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,260
The damage is
already done, Vincent.

295
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,012
You're trending on every
social media platform.

296
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,432
This is
character assassination!

297
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,477
We need to find whoever made
that video!

298
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,729
Can you do that
quickly, Vincent?

299
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,357
Can you even
find out right away

300
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,025
who's behind this, huh?

301
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,444
And even if
you prove it's fake,

302
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,654
it won't really matter.

303
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,282
It's like poison you've already
poured into the sea.

304
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,576
You can't stop it
from spreading anymore.

305
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,411
What do you want me to do?
Do nothing?!

306
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,037
- Shut it down!
- It's deliberate attack--

307
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,123
I told you to shut it down!

308
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,918
You're so stubborn.

309
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,629
Cabrera News
is already worthless,

310
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,757
now it's the one destroying
everything I've worked for,

311
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,301
for my family and
my reputation?

312
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,011
I won't let that happen!

313
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,722
I will not let the
Cabrera name be ruined

314
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,098
because of this.

315
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,788
What the hell?! Let go of me!

316
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,916
- We have a deal, right?
- Yes!

317
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,877
But part of that deal
didn't include you

318
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,253
messing with my work.

319
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,672
Because you
don't own my life!

320
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,675
Unbelievable!

321
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,385
Does everyone really think

322
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,262
I can't do anything
right anymore?

323
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,683
What really happened?

324
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,103
Is this about your video?

325
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,230
My video?

326
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,567
My video?! That's not even me!

327
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,987
Haven't any of you heard
of deepfakes, huh?!

328
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,532
You believe that crap,
everyone does!

329
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,701
Even my own family
believes it,

330
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,162
and they just want me
to turn myself in!

331
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,247
Is it that hard to believe
that I'm innocent?!

332
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,499
Hey! Hey! Hey!

333
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,043
You don't have to shout.

334
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,921
There's no need to be angry
all the time.

335
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,715
Is this how you deal
with your problems?

336
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,759
You're a smart guy, Vincent.

337
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:13,722
You can fix all your problems
if you just calm your mind.

338
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:19,061
Have you found out
who's behind that video?

339
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,694
This whole thing started
because of Walter's death.

340
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,196
I swear I'll find
that bastard...

341
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,491
who did that to him!

342
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,122
When you find out
who killed Walter,

343
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,665
your problem's solved.

344
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,126
But for now,

345
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,545
while there are still
no other suspects,

346
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,797
you'll never be able
to clear your name.

347
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,512
I have to go.

348
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,722
Hey.

349
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,848
Where are you going?

350
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,808
I need to go somewhere
right now.

351
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,268
Hey! Hey, where are you--

352
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,477
Vincent!

353
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,938
You're seriously
driving drunk?

354
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:04,690
- Give me that.
- I'm not drunk.

355
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,442
I'm just tipsy.

356
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,236
- I'll drive.
- You know how to drive?

357
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,864
Come on, get in.

358
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,088
We're here.

359
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,261
Hey, are you okay?

360
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,554
Uh...

361
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,556
What are we doing here?

362
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,266
Are you sober now?

363
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,809
I'm okay.

364
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,478
And I told you, didn't I?

365
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,230
You didn't have to come
with me here.

366
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,982
We have a rule, Vincent.

367
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,942
We can't put each other's lives
in danger.

368
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,862
If I let you drive while drunk,
and something bad happens,

369
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,655
I'd feel guilty.

370
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,073
Who's that?

371
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,158
Where?

372
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,326
Who's that?

373
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,954
Where? Hey!
Why do you have a gun?!

374
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,164
Hey! Vincent!

375
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,374
My siblings are too young!
I can't die now!

376
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,585
Stay here.
Don't get out of the car, okay?

377
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,379
- Vincent, hang on!
- Don't go out. Stay here.

378
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,589
But-- Vincent!

379
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,424
- Stay there.
- But--

380
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,295
Aah!

381
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,797
Son of a gun!

382
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,382
What the hell, Vincent?!

383
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,967
I'm going to die
of a heart--

384
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,094
- I told you to stay--
- It's dangerous out--

385
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,138
Get in. Hurry.

386
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,891
Don't go out. Don't go out.

387
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,643
- Vincent--
- Don't go out!

388
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,784
Put your hands up!

389
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:08,910
Or I'll shoot you!

390
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,078
Don't move!

391
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,457
Don't move!

392
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,499
Who are you?!

393
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,668
Who are you?! Put your hands up!

394
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,636
Argh!

395
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,021
- Vincent!
- Claudia?

396
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,109
What are you doing here
at Walter's house?!

397
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,947
What's on your back?

398
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,075
What's on your back?!

399
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,701
G-Give it to me!

400
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,454
Vincent, please.
Just give it to me, please!

401
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,414
You're using drugs?!

402
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,083
Answer me!

403
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,668
Vincent, please.
Just give it to me, please!

404
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,004
So all this time,
you've been taking this?

405
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,048
Please! I'm begging you!
Please, Vincent!

406
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,092
Just give it to me!

407
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,302
- Give it to me!
- So Walter...

408
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,722
Walter has been supplying
you with this?

409
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,807
What?

410
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,103
- You know what...
- What are you doing?

411
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,147
Please! Please! No! No! No!

412
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,524
No!

413
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,900
No!

414
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:22,943
You want it?

415
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,611
- There!
- No!

416
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,613
No...

417
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:27,864
Enough of this, Claudia!

418
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,699
I'll bring you
to a facility, okay?

419
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,535
No! Vincent, I'm telling you--

420
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,537
Claudia, you need to be
in the rehab!

421
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,997
I'm not going back
to that hell hole!

422
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,668
I'll kill myself
if you bring me back there!

423
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,546
Your child will lose her mom!

424
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:46,883
And your conscience
would eat you forever!

425
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,468
Claudia...

426
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,637
Claudia, I'm doing this for Bea.

427
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,764
I'm doing this for our daughter!

428
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,641
Think of Bea, okay?

429
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,143
Think of Bea.

430
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,728
I'm so sorry.

431
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,440
I'm so sorry!
I'm just too desperate. Please!

432
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,568
- Just give me one!
- Claudia, you need help.

433
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,777
Just give me one!

434
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,862
No, you need help.

435
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,114
You need to go
to the facility, okay?

436
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,784
Claudia--

437
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,786
Claudia.

438
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,292
Claudia!

439
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,544
Hey! Claudia!

440
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,673
Sir, the assessment came out
for the bullet shot

441
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,009
on the wall of Cunanan's villa.

442
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,177
The report states that

443
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,388
it's possible that it came
from a .45 caliber gun,

444
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,806
based on its impact mark.

445
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,394
Cunanan's autopsy and toxicology
report also came out.

446
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,814
There's drug in his system.

447
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,816
And based on the record
of the crime scene,

448
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,612
there were no traces of drugs
found in his villa.

449
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,864
So he was a drug user.

450
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,075
Or it could be
blunt force trauma

451
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,577
that caused his death.

452
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,078
That seems odd.

453
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:01,124
If his killer had a gun,

454
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,709
why didn't that person
just shoot him?

455
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,838
Or was the gun used to hit him?

456
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,256
Could be.

457
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,507
You know what...

458
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,678
there are lots of things that
aren't adding up in this case.

459
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,352
Are you okay?

460
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,979
Claudia!

461
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,105
Claudia.

462
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,150
Claudia! Claudia! Claudia!

463
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,568
She's experiencing withdrawal.

464
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,695
The people I'd been with
in prison do that.

465
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,322
They were drug addicts.

466
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,406
Claudia!

467
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,077
Hey! Anyone in there?!

468
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,328
- <i>Hello?!</i>
- Oh no!

469
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,746
- Claudia!
- Vincent!

470
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,581
Vincent, there are people!
We need to go!

471
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,624
Come on! Hurry!

472
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:43,917
Claudia! Claudia!

473
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,753
Vincent! They can't know
that we're here!

474
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,046
Let's go! Hurry up!

475
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,256
Vincent!

476
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,992
Careful.

477
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,744
You okay, Claudia?

478
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,329
Hold on. Where's the bathroom?

479
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,164
Right there.
The door at the front.

480
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,376
Okay. Hold her.

481
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,756
Claudia, hang on.

482
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:34,926
Okay.

483
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,975
Here.

484
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,646
Stella, you don't need to--

485
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,731
It's fine.

486
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,232
- I'll handle this.
- Go on.

487
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,359
Damp it a little
so she can sober up.

488
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,778
And put this here
so if she vomits again---

489
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,740
I can take it from here.
You don't have to do that.

490
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,283
Mommy?

491
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,414
Stella, can you
take care of Claudia?

492
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,415
Bea can't see her--

493
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,667
Don't worry.
I'll take care of the kid.

494
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,752
Go on.

495
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,925
Hi, baby.

496
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,011
Come on.

497
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,358
Sir, we didn't see anyone.

498
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,973
We'll play again
next time, okay?

499
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,059
- Okay.
- Go to sleep.

500
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,894
Bea?

501
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,271
Your daddy is here.

502
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,525
How is she?

503
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,276
She's okay.

504
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,198
Is mommy okay?

505
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,743
Mommy is sick, but
she's going to be fine, okay?

506
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,621
Why aren't you asleep?
It's late.

507
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,081
Go to sleep now, okay?

508
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,333
Okay. Good night.

509
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,418
Okay.

510
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,795
Good night, Daddy.

511
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:40,885
You heard your daddy.
Your mommy is okay.

512
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:44,514
I'm still scared.

513
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,182
Why?

514
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,561
Because every time
Mommy is sick,

515
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,063
she doesn't wake up right away.

516
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,650
I thought something bad
had happened to her.

517
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:56,776
Uh...

518
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,903
it's nothing.

519
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:02,198
Adults are just like that.

520
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,701
Sometimes,
when we're super tired

521
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,870
or we're not feeling well,

522
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,456
we fall too deeply
into our sleep.

523
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,332
But don't worry.

524
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,835
Your daddy is taking good care
of your mommy.

525
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,921
How about when Daddy
isn't around?

526
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,592
What if he doesn't answer
my calls?

527
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,761
Daddy sometimes does that.

528
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,390
Um, okay.

529
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,892
Here's what we're going to do.

530
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,895
If your daddy doesn't
answer your calls--

531
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,314
I'll give you my number.

532
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,192
Call my number instead.
Is that okay with you?

533
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,443
Yes.

534
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,446
All right.
Don't be scared anymore, okay?

535
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:45,074
I'm here.
I'll wait till you fall asleep.

536
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,451
Okay?

537
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,744
Come on.

538
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,291
Coffee.

539
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,336
Thanks.

540
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,506
Thank you for...

541
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,091
helping me with Claudia.

542
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,428
And for keeping Bea company.

543
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,349
Don't mention it.

544
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:15,355
After everything
that happened...

545
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,066
it feels good to breathe.

546
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:21,528
You don't have to take me home.

547
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,446
Just drop me off
at the nearest terminal.

548
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,572
I'll be fine.

549
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,950
I know you're tired.

550
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,451
You still have to go back home.

551
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,830
I don't live there anymore.

552
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,958
What?

553
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,669
When Claudia learned about us,

554
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,171
she kicked me out.

555
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,091
Why did you just let her?
That's your house too.

556
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,926
I don't want any more fights.

557
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,137
Besides, I don't want my child
to see us fighting often.

558
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,472
I see.

559
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,974
You compromised.

560
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,684
What about your daughter?

561
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,477
She asks a lot of questions.

562
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,355
Is she aware of what's happening
to her mom?

563
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,023
As much as possible...

564
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,735
I try to shield her
from everything.

565
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,697
I'm doing my best
to protect her.

566
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,955
I'm sorry.

567
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:16,958
Why?

568
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,169
I was wrong.

569
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:23,047
I thought you were selfish.

570
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:26,217
Turns out you're not.

571
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,261
You don't need to flatter me.

572
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,306
I'm doing all of this
for my daughter.

573
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,142
I don't want her to experience
the same things I did.

574
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,226
Like what?

575
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,228
Like growing up alone.

576
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,856
I'm adopted, Stella.

577
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,526
That makes sense.

578
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,822
Because I've been thinking about
how your family is so rich,

579
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:50,825
and helping you would be
so easy.

580
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:52,535
It makes sense now.

581
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,663
But good thing you're rich.

582
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,791
You have no idea.

583
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,126
You know what,

584
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:03,421
somehow, I can say
that I can relate to that.

585
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:07,383
Because I grew up as if
my parents weren't there.

586
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,887
I never met my dad.

587
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,474
My mom left with no trace.

588
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,601
I was left to take care
of my siblings.

589
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,439
I'm not even sure
if I have a memory of playing

590
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,815
when I was a child.

591
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,611
Then we're no different at all.

592
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:32,575
Hold on. You broke your rule.
No personal questions, remember?

593
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,578
Oh, please.
I was caught in the moment.

594
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,080
Here. Cheers.

595
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,375
It's good paired with coffee.
It'll wake you up.

596
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,669
The things you've found out,

597
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,587
I hope you can just keep them
to yourself.

598
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,672
Which one?

599
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,341
That Claudia is an addict?

600
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,425
Cheers.

601
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,642
Come on, come on, come on!

602
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,655
Aah!

603
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,400
Why was Claudia
at Walter's house?

604
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,653
Does that mean...

605
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,323
Walter was Claudia's
drug supplier?

606
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,243
All the while, he was pretending
to be our friend.

607
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:00,371
And he's not only
supplying drugs to Claudia.

608
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,959
They were also having an affair.

609
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:06,961
Really?!

610
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,963
Why am I telling you this?

611
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,882
We can't meddle into
each other's personal li--

612
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:14,093
It's not forbidden.
This isn't gossiping, Vincent.

613
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,386
This is a part of it.

614
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,847
I need to know all these

615
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,224
because they're connected
to your case.

616
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,811
But...

617
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,396
hold on.

618
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,816
If Walter was having
an affair with your wife,

619
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,401
that means...

620
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,362
there's a possibility that--

621
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,702
T-That you killed him.

622
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,667
Is that what you think of me?

623
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:53,090
Isn't my word that
I'm not his killer enough?

624
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,470
Look.

625
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,639
I hope you understand
where I'm coming from.

626
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,892
I don't trust anyone easily
these days.

627
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,687
I've been burned
way too many times

628
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,022
by trusting the wrong people.

629
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:11,025
So you can't expect me
to take your word for it.

630
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,488
But I hope you'll give me
a chance.

631
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,575
I'm not like the others.

632
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,375
I'm staying here
for the meantime.

633
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,169
This place is nice.
It's quiet.

634
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,713
Far from the hustle and bustle
of the city.

635
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,720
I've got a shift later tonight.

636
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,810
We have a deal, remember?

637
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,104
Why are you still holding on
to that job?

638
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,148
If I leave the club,
they'll start hounding me

639
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,276
with endless questions about
where I'm getting my money.

640
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,111
Honestly, I can't deal
with that.

641
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,904
They're just too slow
to understand.

642
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,615
And besides, you still haven't
given me my money.

643
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,618
I haven't forgotten
what we talked about.

644
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,371
But right now,
things are way too messy.

645
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,498
Best to lie low for a while.

646
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,293
Your job's not exactly
the safest.

647
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,170
I don't care.

648
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,798
I've got bills to pay
and mouths to feed.

649
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:21,178
Leave that club for now
so you can avoid trouble.

650
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,181
Don't worry. I've got you.

651
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,517
What, for free?

652
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,103
Fine, I'll pay you
for your time.

653
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,482
You're asking me to trust you
with my life?

654
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,444
Stella, you need to trust me.

655
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,528
Well, I'm sorry,

656
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,947
but I don't trust anyone
just like that.

657
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,242
Especially after learning
so much about you.

658
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,620
Actually, I don't know
if I can trust you.

659
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,330
Because once things go south,

660
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,831
I'm sure you won't have my back.

661
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,458
You're going
to save yourself first.

662
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,835
- You see me that way?
- Yeah.

663
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,629
All rich people are the same.

664
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,005
Bunch of selfish pricks.

665
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,302
That might be my order.

666
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,513
Wait for me.

667
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,232
What are you two doing here?

668
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,693
<i>I know where Vincent is.</i>

669
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,613
<i>I got a look</i>
<i>at his secretary's phone.</i>

670
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,825
Are you spying on me?

671
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,119
We just have a question.

672
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,329
What?

673
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,919
We've learned that you're
a gun owner, Mr. Cabrera.

674
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,634
I am.

675
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,220
I've had it for a long time.

676
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,014
It's registered,
and I have a permit to carry.

677
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,725
But right now, it's missing.

678
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,311
I've already asked my lawyer
to submit

679
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,980
all the necessary paperwork.

680
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,400
We found a bullet
at Cunanan's house.

681
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,486
A .45 caliber round.

682
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,698
And so?

683
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,787
Wait.

684
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,872
Are you trying
to imply something?

685
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,126
Do we really have to beat
around the bush, Mr. Cabrera?

686
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,420
Where were you keeping it?

687
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,798
Follow me.

688
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,166
Someone stole my gun.

689
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,543
Any clue who took it?

690
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,794
Beats me.

691
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,798
Maybe they took it to frame me
for all of this.

692
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,227
Don't you find it
all too convenient?

693
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,524
Right when it was discovered
the same caliber round

694
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,694
tied to your gun was used
in the crime,

695
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,656
it disappeared without a trace.

696
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,994
I don't know what else
to tell you.

697
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,705
Sure, the gun was registered
under my name.

698
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,415
But let me ask you.

699
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,334
Was that bullet fired
from my gun?

700
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,544
You got any proof?

701
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:45,216
Was Walter's
cause of death a gunshot?

702
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,513
The gun could've been used
to bash in his skull.

703
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:03,317
This document proves that
we filed a police report

704
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,404
within 24 hours of discovering
the gun went missing.

705
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,406
We also submitted
an affidavit of loss.

706
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,117
We followed the right process,

707
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,785
and we cooperated
with the police

708
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,245
right from the very start.

709
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,830
At this time,

710
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,915
what you're doing
looks like harassment.

711
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,877
That's not
what's happening here.

712
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:26,757
We're simply following
the trail of evidence.

713
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,093
But where's the evidence?

714
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,013
Sir.

715
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,934
I've got the blood test results.

716
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,728
The blood from your shirt

717
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,690
matches the sample found
at Walter's house.

718
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,734
Where we also discovered a round
matching the caliber

719
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,444
of your registered gun.

720
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,698
What happened
that night, Vincent?

721
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,324
Admit it.

722
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,036
You broke into Walter's house.

723
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,124
Seriously?

724
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,918
I already told you. I don't know
anything about Vincent's gun.

725
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,254
What about the break-in
at Walter Cunanan's house?

726
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,132
Well, how would I know?

727
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,925
According to a witness,

728
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:13,429
Cabrera was at your club
that night,

729
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,763
and you were seen together.

730
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,016
Obviously! He's my boyfriend.

731
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,143
He dropped by my workplace,

732
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,520
gave me a few kisses and hugs.
Nothing unusual.

733
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,940
You were seen leaving
the club together.

734
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,151
Where did you go next?

735
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,403
To--

736
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,322
To the--

737
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,867
There's something you should
know about my husband.

738
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,207
Well?

739
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,500
Don't keep us waiting, Vincent.

740
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,168
Yes.

741
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,921
I was inside Walter's house.

742
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,255
You're admitting that?

743
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,050
After Stella and I parted ways
for the night,

744
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,677
Walter's house caretaker
gave me a call

745
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,095
and asked me

746
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,139
to see if anything was missing.

747
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,642
You can reach out to them
to confirm my story.

748
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,693
Of all people...

749
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,279
why did they ask you
for the job?

750
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,281
Have you forgotten?

751
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,993
Walter was my best man.
My kid's godfather.

752
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,704
Or did you manipulate them?

753
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:26,961
You've got quite the reputation
of twisting news stories.

754
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,921
Remember your report
on the landslide?

755
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,089
I saw it.

756
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,385
It was all over social media.
Pretty emotional stuff.

757
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,304
We actually got
to talk to your reporter.

758
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,474
They said you were forcing
some of the victims to act

759
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:42,643
just so you could have
something to show.

760
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,771
That line of inquiry
is immaterial!

761
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:49,775
How is Vincent's job
connected to Walter's case?

762
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:52,903
But it says a lot
about his character.

763
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,993
Sir, it's confirmed.

764
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,620
Walter's family
reached out to Vincent.

765
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,666
Tell me the truth.

766
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,003
Why did you fire a gun?

767
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,632
When I entered the house,

768
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,970
burglars had broken in.

769
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,888
They were armed,
and I had to fight back.

770
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,849
Why didn't you ask
the police for help?

771
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,644
Because my life was in danger!

772
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,521
Besides, you're already
piling on me!

773
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,441
My client
is going through a lot!

774
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,234
He's in a state of shock.

775
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,403
The Revised Penal Code
does not impose

776
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:38,032
a general obligation on
private individuals to report.

777
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:42,494
Remaining silent or passive
generally isn't penalized.

778
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,374
Sir, someone just came
by the station.

779
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,335
She was hoping
to speak with you.

780
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,344
What's that?

781
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,389
It's my child's toy.

782
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,937
There's a hidden camera.

783
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,607
That's from Vincent.

784
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,192
Nanny cam?

785
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,945
I think he used that...

786
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,324
to spy on me.

787
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,993
Why would he do that to you?

788
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,415
To prove...

789
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,211
that I was having
an affair with Walter.

790
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,922
Were you?!

791
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,675
Yes!

792
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,473
Vincent neglected me.

793
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,104
And Walter saved me.

794
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,483
I got tempted!

795
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,528
I was vulnerable!

796
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,696
We had an intimate moment.

797
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,199
And he managed to record it?

798
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,283
Mm?

799
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,743
Most probably.

800
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:06,703
I checked.

801
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,372
The SD card's empty now.

802
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,749
I think Vincent
has already kept it.

803
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,835
So, before Walter died,

804
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:14,878
Vincent already knew

805
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,755
you and Walter
were having an affair.

806
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,382
I think so.

807
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,093
That's his motive.

808
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,763
That's why my fingerprints
were found in the villa.

809
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:30,185
I didn't just
visit Walter there.

810
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,770
We had an intimate moment.

811
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,480
And Vincent?

812
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,024
You know what he told me?

813
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,904
He saw the two of us together.

814
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,115
Why are you only
saying this now?!

815
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,367
Do you think...

816
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,830
it was easy for me to admit...

817
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,959
that I was having an affair?!

818
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,378
How can I be sure...

819
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,299
...you had nothing to do with
what happened to Cunanan?

820
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,220
We...

821
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,307
made love...

822
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,808
that night!

823
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,896
How could you say...

824
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,107
I killed him?!

825
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,529
I was so confused.

826
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:27,910
I was terrified
when Vincent found out!

827
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,330
I didn't know what to do.

828
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,211
I don't know...

829
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,464
what Vincent...

830
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,175
is capable of.

831
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,602
Your wife brought this.

832
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,395
She's here.

833
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,314
Is this familiar to you?

834
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,987
So, you caught
your wife's lover with this?

835
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,697
You know who that was?

836
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:09,034
- Sorry?
- Who could that be?

837
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:12,204
It's none other
than your best man!

838
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,872
Walter.

839
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,707
So...

840
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:19,628
Did you record them
having sex at your house?

841
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,505
Were you that angry?

842
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,131
She had an intimate moment

843
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,593
with Walter
in his villa that night!

844
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,136
You lost control.

845
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,138
He took everything from you,

846
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,016
including your job promotion
and your wife!

847
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,561
Stop playing innocent.

848
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,438
Why did you say before
that they were just friends?

849
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,233
A .45 caliber was found
at the crime scene

850
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,235
at Walter's house.

851
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:47,489
And a gardener witness
saw you storming into the villa.

852
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,701
You've known for some time

853
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:54,329
that your wife was having
an affair with Walter.

854
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:58,292
You had the motive
and opportunity to kill him.

855
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:02,629
Now, Vincent Cabrera,
I'll ask you again.

856
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:09,469
Did you kill Walter Cunanan?!

857
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,347
Vincent, confess now
while it's not too late

858
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,350
so everyone can find peace.

859
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,394
That includes you,

860
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,354
your company,

861
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,107
and, most importantly,
your child.

862
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,111
Now, tell me.

863
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,822
What really happened
that night?!

864
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,294
- Mr. Cabrera!
- I killed him!

865
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,555
Is that what you want to hear?

866
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,642
Is that it?!

867
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:01,480
Claudia said I caught her
and Walter in the act, right?

868
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,400
And you know what the law says:

869
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,778
If I catch them
cheating in the act,

870
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,863
I could kill them...

871
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,784
without liability.

872
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:18,955
But I didn't do it.

873
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:25,212
I didn't do it
because I'm innocent!

874
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:28,715
And I'm not a murderer!

875
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,557
If you have concrete evidence,

876
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,184
arrest me!

877
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,978
But if you can't prove it to us,

878
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,647
then we're done!

879
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,161
Vincent.

880
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,664
Attorney, kindly handle
the details.

881
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,127
Claudia.

882
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,503
Let's talk.

883
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,426
What did you do?

884
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,012
I just told them what I know.

885
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,390
Because I can't take it anymore!

886
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,434
Or you just don't want
people to find out

887
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,352
about you and Walter,

888
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,020
so you chose to get ahead of me?

889
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,188
Vincent.

890
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,691
I have nothing left to hide.

891
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,944
After all this,
I'll be completely ruined.

892
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:34,531
Just because you don't want to
admit what you did to Walter...

893
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,742
Just admit what you did!

894
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,869
Why are you trying
to pin on me a crime

895
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,954
I didn't do?!

896
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,749
And I can't do that
because I'm not like you.

897
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,542
All I care
is our child's welfare.

898
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,221
<i>Come on, Vincent.</i>

899
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:03,101
<i>No matter what you do,</i>
<i>I'll always be better than you.</i>

900
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:08,648
<i>And your family</i>
<i>will still side with me.</i>

901
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,320
<i>Come on.</i>

902
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:20,345
Do you even think about
the trauma Bea would suffer

903
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:21,888
if she finds out her mother

904
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,807
was having an affair
with her godfather?

905
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,183
You liar!

906
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,269
You know Bea loves you so much.

907
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:30,063
She looks up to you
as her mother.

908
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:33,483
She'd be devastated if she finds
out everything you've done.

909
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:38,196
And I didn't tell anyone
because I wanted to protect you.

910
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:41,449
Too bad I can't expect
the same courtesy from you.

911
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,076
How dare you!

912
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,370
Do you want me
to list down all your lies?

913
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:48,957
You only act like a mother
when it's convenient for you

914
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,208
because you always think

915
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,711
about what people
will say about you.

916
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,673
You think you can
control everyone, right?

917
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:57,757
That's not true.

918
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,927
You're just proving
I made the right decision.

919
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,847
I was right to push through
with the annulment.

920
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:08,643
Claudia, I will not leave Bea
to suffer with you.

921
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,359
Haven't you noticed?

922
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,195
This all feels like a setup.

923
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,280
You're right.

924
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,616
It's like someone's framing me.

925
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,700
Some...

926
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,995
unforeseen hand
manipulating everything.

927
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:30,874
There's a good chance
the person behind this

928
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,168
is also involved
in Walter's murder.

929
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:35,921
Do you think...

930
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,758
Do you think it's Claudia?

931
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:43,887
It's possible, but you saw
how distraught she was.

932
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,306
What if she was high
when she did it?

933
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,308
Or maybe she had an accomplice.

934
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:03,823
It's been a long day.

935
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,743
But I think it's all worth it.

936
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,913
It looks like Vincent
will take the fall.

937
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,463
Thank you, Claudia.

938
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,968
<i>I'm the one who killed</i>

939
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,886
Walter Cunanan.

940
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:30,809
<i>Hello?</i>

941
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,185
<i>Yes, yes. I've seen it.</i>

942
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:33,728
<i>It's hilarious.</i>

943
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:38,441
<i>Go ahead and spread it online</i>
<i>ASAP.</i>

944
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,111
<i>Once I become the CEO</i>
<i>of Cabrera News</i>

945
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,198
<i>I will give you a high position.</i>

946
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,412
<i>Shit.</i>

947
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,544
<i>Shit.</i>

948
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,212
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>
<i>- Oh my god.</i>

949
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:02,966
<i>Look at you looking</i>
<i>like you lost your supplier.</i>

950
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,384
<i>Get out!</i>

951
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,844
<i>Whoa. Geez, Claudia.</i>

952
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,220
<i>Calm down.</i>

953
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:09,431
<i>I have something to say.</i>

954
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,390
<i>What do you want?</i>

955
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,308
<i>What do you want?!</i>

956
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,854
<i>Let's just say I know</i>
<i>what you're going through.</i>

957
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:18,273
<i>You obviously have the symptoms.</i>

958
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,651
<i>I said get out!</i>

959
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,654
<i>Okay, but I can help you.</i>

960
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:25,864
<i>I can help you,</i>

961
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,158
<i>but we have to help each other.</i>

962
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,828
Do we really have
to go this far?

963
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:35,832
Yes.

964
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,418
And it's a good start.

965
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,045
More to come, of course.

966
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,965
Are you that desperate
to get Cabrera News?

967
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,302
You're willing to send
your own brother to jail

968
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,013
for a crime
he didn't even commit?

969
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:52,932
Correction,
he is not my brother.

970
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:56,686
That bastard has done nothing
but take what's rightfully mine.

971
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,897
This just happened to be
the perfect opportunity

972
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,482
to get rid of him.

973
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:03,068
So I can finally reclaim
everything he took from me.

974
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:07,989
But Walter's death only
created more problems.

975
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,951
Claudia, are you new
to this family?

976
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:17,373
Covering up a scandal
is our specialty.

977
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,085
Which is what will happen
to Vincent.

978
00:57:49,465 --> 00:57:51,718
<i>This must be my lucky night.</i>

979
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,848
<i>What's so funny?</i>

980
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,016
<i>Stella...</i>

981
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,727
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Didn't you miss me?</i>

982
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,688
<i>Don't be a stranger.</i>

983
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,734
<i>You told me you love me,</i>
<i>remember?</i>

984
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:11,487
<i>I regret saying that</i>
<i>till this very day!</i>

985
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,281
<i>You're a shameless bastard!</i>

986
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,991
<i>You're crazy!</i>

987
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,242
<i>Ouch!</i>

988
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,369
<i>Aah!</i>

989
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,165
<i>Let me go!</i>

990
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:28,755
<i>- You love me.</i>
<i>- You're an evil monster!</i>

991
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:32,050
<i>Get away from me,</i>
<i>you evil monster!</i>

992
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,347
<i>Come back here!</i>

993
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:41,309
<i>Let me go! You're a monster!</i>

994
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:04,249
<i>We've confirmed he was</i>
<i>with two women that night.</i>

995
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:07,752
<i>No one should know about</i>
<i>my connection with Walter.</i>

996
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:12,257
<i>I've confirmed that Claudia</i>
<i>is in cahoots with Matthew.</i>

997
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,550
<i>Here's an invitation</i>
<i>to the investors' ball.</i>

998
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,302
<i>Why don't you show our family</i>

999
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,804
<i>what kind of person</i>
<i>you truly are?</i>

1000
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:22,475
<i>You are playing a game</i>

1001
00:59:22,558 --> 00:59:24,435
<i>you've already lost!</i>

1002
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,604
<i>You coming here</i>
<i>is not of any help.</i>

1003
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:27,647
<i>Just go home.</i>
