1
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,871
<i>She's just using you</i>
<i>and your money,</i>

2
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,164
<i>and you're letting her</i>
<i>fool you!</i>

3
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,373
<i>I love Stella.</i>

4
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,375
<i>How can you love someone</i>
<i>like that?</i>

5
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,795
<i>You paid Stella</i>
<i>to be your alibi?!</i>

6
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,047
<i>How sure are you that you</i>
<i>can really trust Stella?</i>

7
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,883
<i>I didn't have a choice.</i>

8
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,593
<i>- What?!</i>
<i>- I'm the one...</i>

9
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,887
<i>who killed Walter Cunanan.</i>

10
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,929
<i>Who did this?!</i>

11
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,139
<i>We're still finding out, sir.</i>

12
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,974
<i>It's all over social media.</i>

13
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:03,646
<i>Vincent Cabrera,</i>
<i>did you kill Walter Cunanan?!</i>

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,106
<i>I'm innocent!</i>

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,567
<i>And I'm not a murderer!</i>

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,320
<i>Haven't you noticed?</i>
<i>This all feels like a setup.</i>

17
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,197
<i>It's like someone's framing me.</i>

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,323
<i>Do you think it's Claudia?</i>

19
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,908
<i>Or maybe she had an accomplice.</i>

20
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,620
<i>Covering up a scandal</i>
<i>is our specialty.</i>

21
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,705
<i>Which is what will happen</i>
<i>to Vincent.</i>

22
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,780
Hi, Daddy.

23
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,451
<i>Rawr!</i>

24
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,955
<i>Oh, baby, why are you crying?</i>

25
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:49,168
<i>Stop it or Daddy Vampire's</i>
<i>going to bite you!</i>

26
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,463
Daddy, you're so silly!

27
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:57,010
I miss you, Daddy!

28
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,428
<i>I miss you too, sweetie.</i>

29
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,556
<i>Go on, play over there.</i>

30
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,809
<i>Daddy's just going to watch you.</i>

31
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,980
<i>Look, Daddy! This is Meow Meow!</i>

32
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,755
Wow, Stella!

33
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,841
Before, only old men
waited for you at the bar,

34
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,509
now it's the media!

35
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,762
You should try
to chill sometime, Stella.

36
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,014
You've been working
nonstop your whole life.

37
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,515
Learn to rest once in a while.

38
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,601
What do you want me to do?
I'm not tired,

39
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,728
but my siblings and
I have nothing to eat!

40
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,855
But things are different now.

41
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,942
You've got a boyfriend,
a fair-skinned sugar daddy.

42
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,235
Vincent won't let you down,
right?

43
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,487
Charlie!

44
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,572
- Charlie, son, come here!
- Just a minute.

45
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,616
- Charlie!
- Mama needs me.

46
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,700
I'm coming, Ma!

47
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,412
Stella.

48
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,916
What have you
gotten yourself into?

49
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,294
What if Vincent
really killed Walter?

50
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:17,298
Aren't you scared you're
just being played by fate?

51
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,929
<i>- Wow!</i>
<i>- Whoo!</i>

52
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,014
<i>- Keep going!</i>
<i>- Yes!</i>

53
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,350
<i>Wow! Whoo!</i>

54
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,185
<i>- Whoo!</i>
<i>- Let's go!</i>

55
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,647
<i>- Look at that move!</i>
<i>- What a show!</i>

56
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,774
<i>- No! Sir!</i>
<i>- You dance so stiff!</i>

57
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,567
<i>Sir, please, no.</i>

58
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,653
<i>- I'll take you home!</i>
<i>- Sir Please, don't.</i>

59
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,531
<i>- Sir, please, stop!</i>
<i>- You're feisty! I like it!</i>

60
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,408
<i>No, please! Sir!</i>

61
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,994
<i>That's enough, sir!</i>
<i>You're drunk, stop it!</i>

62
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,787
<i>Mind your own business!</i>

63
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,497
<i>Hey... Sir, please...</i>

64
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,125
<i>Sir, please...</i>
<i>I'm begging you. Oh!</i>

65
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,508
<i>Are you okay?</i>

66
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,142
<i>Oh.</i>

67
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,148
<i>Thank you for driving me home.</i>

68
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,191
<i>Thanks for the flowers, too.</i>

69
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,530
<i>I just wanted to make sure</i>
<i>you'd get home safely.</i>

70
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,285
<i>I feel worried and shy</i>

71
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,954
<i>because I know</i>
<i>you still have work later.</i>

72
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,498
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

73
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,791
<i>And from now on,</i>

74
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:39,088
<i>I'll drive you home every night</i>
<i>to make sure you'll be safe.</i>

75
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,512
<i>Uh, I'm sorry about our house.</i>

76
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,224
<i>You see, this is all I can</i>
<i>afford since our mom left.</i>

77
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,478
<i>But I'm saving up so we can</i>
<i>move to a bigger one.</i>

78
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,314
<i>You know what? I'll help you.</i>

79
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,442
<i>I'll cover your down payment.</i>

80
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,612
<i>Oh.</i>

81
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,782
<i>This is my baby sister Joy.</i>

82
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,035
<i>And these are</i>
<i>Katherine and Joseph.</i>

83
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,370
<i>We take turns</i>
<i>taking care of Joy.</i>

84
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:16,417
<i>You see, our mom left us</i>
<i>right after giving birth to Joy.</i>

85
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,878
<i>Wait, I'll just prepare</i>
<i>some milk for her</i>

86
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,338
<i>so she'll stop crying.</i>

87
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,733
<i>It's okay. I've got you.</i>

88
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,202
<i>I really thought...</i>

89
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,745
Walter was <i>the one</i> for you.

90
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,249
I thought he'd be our ticket
to a better life.

91
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,586
Fine, scratch that.

92
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,629
Let's not talk about it.

93
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,465
Bubbles...

94
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,134
Remember what we discussed.

95
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,261
Yes, I'll keep your secret,

96
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,971
even from Charlie.

97
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,598
Thank you.

98
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,724
But you know what?

99
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,685
It's like fate is
playing with you.

100
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,019
I mean, who would've thought...

101
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,356
that your ex-boyfriend Walter

102
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,192
was related to
your fake boyfriend Vincent?

103
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,403
My goodness, Stella.

104
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,321
Do you believe in coincidence?

105
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,080
No one should know...

106
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,125
about my connection with Walter.

107
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,268
What's going on with you,
Katherine?

108
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,394
It's like you're
getting possessed.

109
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,562
Read this.

110
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,024
I received this text message
just now.

111
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,943
I finally landed a job

112
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,529
at The Fides Hotel,

113
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,032
which is a really fancy hotel.

114
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,117
Are you sure about this,
Katherine?

115
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,369
Of course.

116
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,456
I'll push through with it.

117
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,166
Even though I didn't have
any job experience,

118
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,459
they accepted me.

119
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,339
Who do you seem upset?

120
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,883
When I get paid,

121
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,219
I can help out
with our expenses.

122
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,262
I can finally buy what we need.

123
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,432
And I can treat you
to some snacks.

124
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,934
What about your studies?

125
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,896
Stella will be furious
if she finds out.

126
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,273
Let's just keep this
between us for now.

127
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,026
I want to prove first

128
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:50,196
that I can juggle work
and my studies fine.

129
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,990
You'll just end up
fighting again.

130
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,409
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a pessimist!

131
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,996
Vincent.

132
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,206
Bro.

133
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,251
You have a visitor.

134
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,605
W-Why are you here?

135
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,899
Uh...

136
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,860
Excuse me.
I still have work to do.

137
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,738
- Thanks.
- Okay.

138
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,240
You haven't answered
my question.

139
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,908
Why are you here?

140
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,159
For work.

141
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,829
I want to work.

142
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,833
I'm itching to work. I'm not
used to just sitting around.

143
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,586
Didn't I say you don't have
to go back to work?

144
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,713
I'm not planning to
return to the bar.

145
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,006
Then where?

146
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,008
At your house.

147
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,467
What?

148
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,345
What will you do
at my house?

149
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,140
Plenty. Seems like it hasn't
seen a broom in years.

150
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,892
I can clean, cook, do the
laundry, iron clothes...

151
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,102
Everything.

152
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,939
Just give me the keys
and I'll make your floors shine.

153
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,775
I didn't hire you as a maid.

154
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,111
You don't have to do all that.

155
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,281
I know.

156
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:22,121
But I would rather work
for everything I have

157
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,791
because I don't want
to end up owing anyone.

158
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,713
It's a debt not easily repaid.

159
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,923
In case you've forgotten,

160
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,134
nothing's free in this world.

161
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,559
Keys?

162
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,646
I'm a good cook.

163
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,192
Sweet, spicy, sour...
Whatever you like.

164
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,234
So, keys.

165
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,903
That shade is very tacky!

166
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,364
My god!

167
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,032
Mrs. Cabrera.

168
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,534
Aside from you,

169
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,578
did Walter have
any other woman?

170
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:05,664
As far as I know, no.

171
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,625
But I can't claim
that we're exclusive,

172
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,251
given our situation.

173
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,753
But knowing Walter,

174
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,464
I wouldn't be surprised
if there was someone else.

175
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,632
Why do you say so?

176
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,509
Because he's a sweet-talker.

177
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,885
You could not trusted him.

178
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,595
And I learned that the hard way.

179
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,514
What kind of person was he?

180
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,183
You know what?
Honestly, I don't know anymore.

181
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,352
He can be anyone
you want him to be.

182
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,686
He's a psychopath.

183
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,109
I have to go. Excuse me.

184
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,199
If the lipstick wasn't hers...

185
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:44,120
It's possible Walter was with
another woman before he died.

186
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,458
This is new.
Your partner's MIA.

187
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,252
He had to take a call.

188
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,795
What is it this time?

189
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,382
If you're going to blame me
for Walter's death again,

190
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,134
you're just wasting your time.

191
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,760
We just want to know

192
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:03,639
if you know anything about
Walter Cunanan's lovers.

193
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,433
You already know
the answer to that.

194
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,393
You've already talked
to my wife, right?

195
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,727
Is there anyone else?

196
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,650
We confirmed
that it wasn't blood.

197
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,611
It was from a lipstick.

198
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,739
But that style and shade
don't match

199
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,409
Mrs. Cabrera's lipstick.

200
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,911
Unbelievable!

201
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,873
Walter really was quite
the playboy.

202
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,750
So that means he was with
two women that night?

203
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,513
Walter didn't
tell me anything.

204
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,976
Do you remember

205
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:53,022
any woman he talked to
or was with at that party?

206
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,692
Or maybe in the days
before he died?

207
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,196
He talked to and mingled with
a lot of people that night.

208
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,072
I didn't know everyone there.

209
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,117
Besides, we had a guest list
that night.

210
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,994
Why don't you just talk
to the event manager?

211
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:11,415
Anyone on that list you think
seemed suspicious?

212
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,252
I didn't know Walter
was going to die that night.

213
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,713
Like I said,
we had a guest list.

214
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,632
Or do you want me
to get it myself

215
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,425
and do your job
for you?

216
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,802
You know, it's strange, sir.

217
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,805
You said before that
you and Walter were close,

218
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,309
but now you can't give us
any details about him?

219
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,937
You know, people would
often say

220
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,147
that false assumptions
can kill people.

221
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,942
If we'd take it literally,
I'd be dead by now.

222
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,445
I thought I knew
everything about Walter,

223
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,322
but it turns out
I was wrong.

224
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,367
I'm sure you found that out
in your investigation.

225
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,869
So why don't you get
more information about Walter

226
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,872
and maybe then you'll find out
who really killed him?

227
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,166
Try to focus your investigation
on others.

228
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,209
Mr. Cabrera--

229
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,586
Don't you get it?

230
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,673
Walter was not
an innocent victim.

231
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,966
He was a monster.

232
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,811
Alright, team?

233
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,606
We have a new part-time staff
joining us, alright?

234
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,900
She's actually
a working student.

235
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,653
Her name's
Katherine Rose Morales.

236
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,904
- Hello.
- Hello.

237
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,155
Okay!

238
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,242
She'll be assigned here at
the restaurant as a waitress.

239
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,620
So I expect everyone
to help and guide her.

240
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,706
You know what to do, okay?

241
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,082
Now go back to your posts.

242
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,794
Hey! Working students like you
are very hardworking.

243
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,045
Thank you.

244
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,342
Good luck on your first day.

245
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,468
Thank you.

246
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,772
Katherine!

247
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,942
I just need to grab some
orders from the kitchen.

248
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,903
But one of our
regular VIPs just arrived.

249
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,071
Room 2.

250
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,656
You think you're ready
for a VIP?

251
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,741
VIP?!

252
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,826
Why me?

253
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,828
I'm new here.

254
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:15,372
Well, everyone's busy
right now.

255
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,916
And we can't keep that guest
waiting too long.

256
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,460
Just take her order,
that's all.

257
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,878
You can handle that, right?

258
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,922
Alright! I got this!

259
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,091
Her name is Mrs. Dellosa.

260
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,217
Go!

261
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,308
Hey!

262
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,478
Why'd you send Katherine
to Mrs. Dellosa?

263
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,979
You handle that VIP, right?

264
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,359
Fresh meat for the beast.

265
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,819
Welcome to The Fides,
Mrs. Dellosa!

266
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,906
Are you new here?

267
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,115
Yes.

268
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,909
Can I take your order, ma'am?

269
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,202
Listen carefully,

270
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,454
because I don't want
to repeat myself.

271
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,083
I want my coffee black,
not burnt.

272
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,628
French press.
No espresso machine.

273
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,381
Brew it at exactly four minutes.

274
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,384
How many minutes again, ma'am?

275
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:12,805
Didn't I just say I don't want
to repeat myself?

276
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,848
Pay attention!

277
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,684
Don't be stupid!

278
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,228
Now...

279
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:23,190
I want my water
at room temperature.

280
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,983
Glass only.

281
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,779
With a slice of lemon
on the side, not in.

282
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,490
Okay, ma'am! Got it!

283
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,325
Wait.

284
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,745
Aren't you even going
to take my order?

285
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,873
Alright.

286
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,418
Hold on, ma'am. Sorry.

287
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,628
Hold on--

288
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,441
Here.

289
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,736
Take it before it melts.

290
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,913
How did you know
I like ice cream?

291
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,460
I didn't know. I just noticed
you like sweets.

292
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,628
You know, when I was a kid,

293
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,630
I never got to eat ice cream.

294
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,967
Every time I asked my mother
to buy me one...

295
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,679
she'd always say
it's a waste of money.

296
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,974
I mean, we didn't even know
if we'd have food that day.

297
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,398
I can't even remember if
I ever got to play as a kid.

298
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,568
All I remember is...

299
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,279
helping my mother out.

300
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,657
She didn't earn enough
as a waitress.

301
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,743
You know what
my dream is?

302
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,954
To be a professional dancer.

303
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,790
Like those who dance on TV.

304
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,460
I somehow achieved
that dream.

305
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,005
I did become a dancer.

306
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,468
My siblings and I
all have different fathers.

307
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,140
People used to say
my mother was flirtatious,

308
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,391
wild,

309
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,269
a loose woman.

310
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,938
They would also say,

311
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:29,775
"Stella will turn out
just like her mother."

312
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,319
Imagine that.

313
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,321
Those idiots really
spoke it into existence.

314
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,408
You were the one
who raised your siblings?

315
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,620
No one else would do it.

316
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,706
I didn't want them
to go through what I did.

317
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,166
That's why I'm doing this.

318
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,211
I don't want
the day to come...

319
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,256
when they won't know
if they'll get to eat.

320
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,050
When they get sick,

321
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,553
I don't want to worry
about buying medicine.

322
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,972
Or when they
can't defend themselves

323
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,974
if someone tries
to hurt them.

324
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,560
That's why I just endure
everything

325
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,353
people say about me.

326
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,107
That I'm a slut...

327
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,150
That I'm cheap...

328
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,987
But that doesn't mean
I don't feel hurt.

329
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,075
I am hardworking,

330
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,955
but that doesn't mean
I don't get tired.

331
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,456
I entertain people,

332
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,336
but that doesn't mean
I don't feel lonely.

333
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:38,886
Look at me.

334
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,805
Hey!

335
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,475
Ugh!

336
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,437
This ice cream...

337
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:50,272
Makes you cry?

338
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,537
What are you doing?

339
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,914
I'm helping you.

340
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,333
I don't need your help!

341
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,043
I might get
in trouble again.

342
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,669
I was just trying to help you.

343
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,963
If you've already
handled the VIPs,

344
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,715
then you can handle
any customer.

345
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,800
Just admit it,
you did that on purpose!

346
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,010
You were enjoying it

347
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,054
while I was being humiliated
in front of the VIP!

348
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,181
That's what you call "help?!"

349
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,189
Excuse me!

350
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,691
Oh, so that's how
you get shy, George?

351
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,901
I'm sorry, Stella.

352
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:36,944
Thank you!

353
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,487
- You ate a lot.
- Well...

354
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,530
It's just that
your cooking's really good.

355
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,991
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

356
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,034
I'll go wash the dishes.

357
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,702
- I'll help you.
- No, it's fine.

358
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,954
Really? Thank you!

359
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,707
Bro...

360
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,209
I thought you were
just pretending

361
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,335
to be in a relationship?

362
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,753
Why does it look real now?

363
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,713
This is all just
for show, George.

364
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,590
How would people believe it

365
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,550
if she didn't
come here, right?

366
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,969
Oh, okay.

367
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,261
She's been coming here a lot.

368
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,766
Look at your house,
it's fancy and clean.

369
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,644
Stella's just not used
to doing nothing.

370
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,606
I told her to stop working
at the bar.

371
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,983
You know it's too risky.

372
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,026
The people trying to ruin me
still haven't stopped.

373
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,987
Okay.

374
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,530
Well...

375
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,032
They're also going
after Stella.

376
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,492
What do you mean?

377
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:36,294
Here.

378
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,588
Look at this.

379
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,048
I saw this earlier.

380
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,925
Good thing it hasn't gained
much traction yet.

381
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,177
I already had our IT team
take it down.

382
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,096
<i>They call her Alegria.</i>

383
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,557
<i>She invited me</i>
<i>to go to a motel.</i>

384
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,809
<i>I agreed to go with her</i>
<i>because I was drunk.</i>

385
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,603
<i>When we got there,</i>
<i>she made me drink something.</i>

386
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,771
<i>It was beer.</i>

387
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,065
<i>Then I suddenly</i>
<i>felt dizzy and I blacked out.</i>

388
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,944
<i>When I woke up, she was gone,</i>
<i>and so was my wallet.</i>

389
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,279
<i>She stole it.</i>

390
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,994
That's not true.

391
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,170
You don't have
to explain anymore.

392
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,883
Why would you even believe me?

393
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,385
Because I know
you're telling the truth.

394
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,806
And you've never done
anything for me to doubt you.

395
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,145
Someone wants
to take me down.

396
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,522
It's someone...

397
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,609
Someone powerful.

398
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,653
No decent person would ever
do something like this.

399
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,824
Bro, excuse me.

400
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,954
What if Walter's death
was connected to drugs?

401
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,207
And they're
the ones behind this?

402
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,583
To frame you for it.

403
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,293
There's only one person
I know

404
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,670
who was connected to Walter
when it comes to drugs.

405
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,007
It's Claudia.

406
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,727
I just had a thought

407
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,271
about what the
investigator said.

408
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:22,359
He said they found red lipstick
on Sir Walter's hand.

409
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,739
Does that mean Sir Walter
had another woman?

410
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,950
But wasn't he so in love
with you?

411
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,535
- Watch your mouth!
- Ow!

412
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,746
Don't hit my lips,
I just had them done.

413
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,958
Walter had another woman.

414
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,292
And Vincent...

415
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,504
got involved
with a hospitality girl!

416
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,923
What the hell!

417
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,759
It's their loss, Ma'am Clau.

418
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,149
Why?

419
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,530
Call from hell?!

420
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,128
Uh, Ma'am Claudia,
where are you going?

421
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,546
Do you want me
to accompany you?

422
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,464
No, I can handle this.

423
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,341
- Okay, take care!
- Excuse me.

424
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,806
Bye! Take care.

425
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,476
<i>Walter's phone?</i>

426
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,630
Damn it!
I'm telling you the truth!

427
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,841
Walter called me using
his other phone!

428
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,346
Are you high?

429
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,723
I'm sober!

430
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,643
So what do you want
to happen now?

431
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:05,188
Dig his grave to prove
that he's still there?

432
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,275
What? Can we do that?

433
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,985
Are you serious?

434
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,113
Fine.

435
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,698
What else did that person
tell you?

436
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,199
That's it. It got cut off.

437
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,411
I tried calling again,
but no one answered.

438
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,871
Well, that can't be Walter.

439
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,416
He's dead. He even underwent
an autopsy.

440
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:28,920
So who could've gotten
Walter's phone?

441
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,596
Vincent.

442
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,040
What are you doing here?

443
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,419
I'm hoping to talk to Mom.

444
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,176
Am I not allowed here anymore?

445
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,094
Am I not a part
of this family anymore?

446
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,179
Really?

447
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,474
Did you ever consider us
your family?

448
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,101
Despite everything...

449
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,103
yes.

450
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,069
By the way,

451
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,530
there will be
an investor's ball.

452
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,741
- I assume I'm invited?
- Of course.

453
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,451
That'll be
your perfect opportunity

454
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:44,579
to find someone
who'll save Cabrera News.

455
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:47,082
And if you fail to do it
by that time,

456
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,209
I'll shut it down.

457
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,141
What do you need?

458
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,727
Hey, I come in peace.

459
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:11,731
I just want our family
to be fine.

460
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,484
Our family?

461
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,736
Since when did you treat me
as family?

462
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,160
What's this?

463
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,247
An invitation
to the investor's ball,

464
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,042
one of the biggest events
of the Cabrera group every year.

465
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,337
I'm surprised that Vincent
didn't invite you.

466
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,755
Are you out of your mind?

467
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,258
Why would I go there?

468
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,510
Because you’re
his little cutie princess.

469
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,388
You're his significant other.

470
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,391
Anyway, everyone in the family's
going to be there.

471
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,393
So let's make it official.

472
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,437
We want to get to know you.

473
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,690
Why don't you be my plus one?

474
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,358
You really think
I'm coming to that?

475
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,236
I can't even stomach
going to your house.

476
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,822
And now you're asking me
to suck up to your family?

477
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,282
All night?

478
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,992
You've got to be kidding me.

479
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,870
Look, we're not as bad
as you think.

480
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,830
Some of them were just shocked
by the situation.

481
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,039
You can't blame them.

482
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,958
You came out of nowhere.

483
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,418
All this time, we didn't know

484
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,628
that he and Claudia
were having problems.

485
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,840
Then, we'd find out
that you're a part of his life.

486
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,636
Why are you doing this?

487
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,184
I know that Vincent
and I are not close.

488
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,729
But there's one thing
Dad has taught us.

489
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,273
It's the importance of family.

490
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,108
Vincent is my brother.

491
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,737
So whether you like it or not,
you're now a part of our family.

492
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,573
And also, I just want peace.

493
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,118
It doesn't help
that people think

494
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,661
our family's a big mess.

495
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,247
And hey,

496
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,832
you look like a nice girl.

497
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,169
Vincent wouldn't like you
if you're not, right?

498
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,922
So why don't you show our family

499
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,798
the kind of person
you truly are?

500
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,552
Give them a chance
to get to know you.

501
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:09,849
Thanks.

502
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,560
But if I'm going to be there,

503
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,313
Vincent should be the person
inviting me.

504
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,567
Okay, okay. Here.

505
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,652
Take this one.

506
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,029
Think about what I've said.

507
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,994
Call me.

508
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:07,282
<i>Hey, love.</i>

509
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,908
<i>You're here.</i>

510
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,034
<i>Let's go.</i>

511
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,661
<i>Hold on.</i>
<i>I'll just fix my things.</i>

512
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,205
<i>Uh, I-- I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>I have to--</i>

513
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,540
<i>I have to go.</i>

514
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:19,294
<i>There's an emergency at work.</i>

515
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,045
<i>They need me there.</i>

516
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,423
<i>Oh. Too bad.</i>

517
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:26,968
<i>I even told Mama Mona</i>
<i>that I'll go home early.</i>

518
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,387
<i>What do I do now?</i>

519
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,848
<i>Look, what do you</i>
<i>want me to do?</i>

520
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,017
<i>That's work.</i>

521
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,769
<i>Of course, I'd put that first</i>
<i>instead of you.</i>

522
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,360
<i>Love.</i>

523
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,653
<i>I'm sorry, okay?</i>

524
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,864
<i>I'll make it up to you.</i>

525
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,619
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

526
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,123
<i>Uh...</i>

527
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,959
<i>I'll just call you.</i>

528
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,044
<i>Okay?</i>

529
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,673
<i>I-I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I really need to go.</i>

530
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,510
<i>I'll see you later, okay?</i>

531
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,678
<i>Okay?</i>

532
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,728
<i>Katherine, take care</i>
<i>of them, okay?</i>

533
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,104
<i>Auntie Linda!</i>

534
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,023
<i>Please look after Joy!</i>

535
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,400
<i>- Sir, please!</i>
<i>- Don't worry, I'll come back!</i>

536
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,362
<i>Stella!</i>

537
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,946
<i>Stella!</i>

538
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,908
<i>Stella!</i>

539
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,412
<i>Thanks for the tip.</i>
<i>We caught Stella Morales.</i>

540
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,676
<i>We've confirmed it.</i>

541
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,927
<i>That's not blood.</i>

542
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,388
<i>That's lipstick.</i>

543
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:58,351
<i>But that isn't the shade</i>
<i>of Mrs. Cabrera's lipstick.</i>

544
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:01,437
<i>It could mean that he was</i>
<i>with two women that night.</i>

545
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,022
<i>Can't you see it?</i>

546
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,024
<i>That was suspiciously</i>
<i>intentional.</i>

547
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,527
<i>It seems like</i>
<i>I'm being framed by some...</i>

548
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,322
<i>unforeseen hand</i>
<i>manipulating everything.</i>

549
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:15,201
<i>And there's a huge possibility</i>
<i>that whoever's doing this</i>

550
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,495
<i>has something to do</i>
<i>with Walter's death.</i>

551
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,331
<i>Do you think it's Claudia?</i>

552
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,499
<i>I found something.</i>

553
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,627
<i>I got that the night we went</i>
<i>to Walter's house.</i>

554
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,295
<i>Walter had a lot of money.</i>

555
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:30,466
<i>He had many transactions with</i>
<i>different people and companies.</i>

556
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,759
<i>It's possible</i>

557
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,928
<i>that if he was</i>
<i>Claudia's drug supplier,</i>

558
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:36,889
<i>that could mean he also</i>
<i>supplied a bunch of people.</i>

559
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,490
I need to know the truth.

560
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,720
- Sir.
- Vincent.

561
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,013
Congratulations. Nice party.

562
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,347
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

563
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,640
Thank you for coming, ma'am.

564
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,436
- Hello, ma'am. Thank you.
- Congratulations.

565
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,479
I'm glad you made it.

566
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,397
- Nice setup.
- Thank you. Thank you.

567
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,776
It's nice seeing you here.

568
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,652
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you.

569
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,070
Thanks.

570
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,364
Sir, how are you doing?

571
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,491
Mr. Moreno.

572
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,201
- How are you doing?
- All good.

573
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,286
Actually, I've been meaning
to talk to you, sir.

574
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,998
I heard you're interested
in media.

575
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:47,085
As you know, we're looking for
new investors for Cabrera News.

576
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,837
Wow, congratulations,
Mr. Cabrera.

577
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,339
Yes. Hello, hello.

578
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,841
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you for coming.

579
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,092
See you later.

580
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,429
Where's Edward?

581
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,350
- I'm here, Dad.
- Hi.

582
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,352
- Hi, Mom.
- You're late.

583
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,645
I'm sorry, Dad.

584
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,563
I needed to do something
at the hotel.

585
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,983
I'm so glad that you're taking
this job very seriously, Edward.

586
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,318
Of course, Mom.

587
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:16,572
Well, I want to know your plans
to improve that restaurant.

588
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,951
You surely didn't work there
to be a waiter, no?

589
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,410
Sure, Dad.

590
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,871
Mr. and Mrs. Cabrera!

591
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,748
- Hello!
- Hey!

592
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,458
I'm glad you made it.

593
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,876
- How are you?
- Hi.

594
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,049
Hey, Katherine!
What are you doing? Hurry up!

595
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:36,134
Yes, I will.

596
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,514
Vincent?

597
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:53,818
You go ahead.

598
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,539
You okay?

599
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,832
Of course.

600
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:08,916
I'll follow.

601
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,371
Let's party!

602
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,374
Follow me.

603
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,634
Thank you.

604
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,721
Thank you. Thank you.

605
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,391
Well, you know...

606
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,310
I now stand before you,

607
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,773
not just as a chair

608
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,819
of this group of companies.

609
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:04,824
But as someone
who has witnessed first hand

610
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:09,328
the power of unwavering
determination

611
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,998
and collective strength.

612
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:16,502
As we celebrate
our success tonight,

613
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:21,590
we also recognize
our strong foundation.

614
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:26,387
It is built from each
and every one's dedication.

615
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,807
It's all your blood,
sweat, tears,

616
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,644
and your steadfast values

617
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,689
and conviction
in seeking the truth.

618
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:53,664
And also part of the success

619
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,209
were the misfortunes
we went through.

620
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,545
There were challenges.

621
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,297
We were maligned.

622
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,758
We were straight-up defamed.

623
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,926
There were betrayals.

624
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:06,927
Doubts.

625
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:11,891
Some bet against
this group of companies.

626
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:18,064
There are people who want
to crush and ruin everything.

627
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,107
But no one,

628
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,192
nothing

629
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,111
can bring us down!

630
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,699
For those who are hoping

631
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:32,620
and trying to bring us down,

632
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,955
you're only wasting your time.

633
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,085
Because even before
you think of a plan

634
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,795
to take us down,

635
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:47,468
you are playing a game
you've already lost!

636
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,252
Oh, sir.

637
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,920
Uh, Vincent,
regarding the pitch.

638
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,171
Yes, ma'am. Uh...

639
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,091
Yeah. As you know, we're looking
for investors for--

640
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,425
Can you calm down?

641
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,927
Are you insane?!

642
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,513
I thought you were trying to get
your dad's good side?

643
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,098
- Yeah.
- What?

644
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,016
Why is she here?
Why is Stella here?

645
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,479
I promised
that I'd get rid of Stella.

646
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,273
And that's exactly
what I'm doing.

647
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,318
Oh, please!
Can you tone it down?

648
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,279
Be a victim!

649
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,780
Help me out here, Claudia.

650
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,366
Their relationship

651
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:55,286
needs to be so indefensible
to the point

652
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,914
that they'll have no choice
but to abandon each other!

653
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,583
And you think that will work?

654
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,376
Do you?

655
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,045
She's a stripper.

656
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:08,674
Don't tell me you're going
to let her outsmart you.

657
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,206
There you are.

658
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,333
Just so you know,

659
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,085
this is the highlight
of the evening.

660
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:46,962
Dancing.

661
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,340
But it's more like
ballroom dancing.

662
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,092
Not the kind you do at the club.

663
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,307
That's not the only kind
of dance I can do.

664
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,643
Oh, really?

665
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,686
Okay. Let's prove it.

666
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,357
May I have this dance?

667
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,151
Find your own partner.

668
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:12,029
Hey, come on.
It's only right that we dance.

669
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,697
You're my plus one.

670
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,970
Vincent, I've been looking
all over for you.

671
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,474
What are you doing here?

672
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,936
Matthew invited me to come.

673
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,813
Didn't you see my texts?

674
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,190
I had a very busy day.

675
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,526
Do you know why
this event is happening?

676
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,614
It's a special night for all the
investors of Cabrera News.

677
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:25,454
I realized we could use this
to our advantage.

678
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,956
Gather real evidence
for your case.

679
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,083
Stella.

680
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,126
And then, just a while ago,
I saw something.

681
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,338
Matthew and Claudia were
having a conversation.

682
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,840
- They were talking--
- Stella, listen.

683
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:44,223
You have to understand
the importance of this night.

684
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:47,935
Stella, this is my last chance
to save Cabrera News.

685
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,938
A lot of people
could lose their jobs

686
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,816
if I fail to do exactly that.

687
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,609
At this moment,

688
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:59,905
Claudia and Matthew can talk
all night for all I care.

689
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:00,989
Okay?

690
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,163
Are you upset?

691
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:09,915
Go home.

692
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,293
Your presence isn't
helping anyone.

693
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,025
- Matthew.
- Hmm?

694
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,986
- Mr. Mariano, excuse us.
- Sure thing.

695
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:43,699
Hey, look at you! Dancing king!

696
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,492
What are you up to?

697
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,911
Why did you bring Stella here?

698
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,037
Bro, look--

699
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,248
I was just being a good brother.

700
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,126
I thought it would be
the perfect opportunity

701
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:57,129
to officially introduce Stella
to the family.

702
00:45:57,212 --> 00:46:00,048
Plus, it would show everyone
that what you have is real.

703
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,426
You can't fool me.

704
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:05,304
Bro, I'm not doing that.

705
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,306
You know what?

706
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,641
You should be grateful.

707
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:12,811
Matthew.

708
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,022
You may be my brother,

709
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,024
but that doesn't mean
I trust you.

710
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,152
So back off from Stella.

711
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,238
Okay.

712
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,164
We need to talk.

713
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,044
Dad, if this is about Stella--

714
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,629
It wasn't me
who brought her here.

715
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:41,215
You know what's your
biggest problem, Vincent?

716
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:45,010
Letting that woman
into our lives.

717
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,137
Dad, why are you blaming me?

718
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,389
I know how important
this night is.

719
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,141
It was all Matthew's fault!

720
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:55,771
It doesn't matter whether
it was Matthew's fault or not.

721
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:59,233
Everyone's talking about
your relationship with her!

722
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,901
Arthur, calm down!

723
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,236
Stella went home already.

724
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,279
Why don't we just enjoy
the party?

725
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,117
Alegria?

726
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,829
It really is you.

727
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,122
What's up?

728
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,835
You know I'm crazy about you.

729
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,420
Of course it's you!

730
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,756
- Let me go!
- This must be my lucky night!

731
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,008
I said, let me go!

732
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,428
Get your hands off me!

733
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,264
How about we make it real
this time?

734
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,975
- Let me go!
- It's been forever!

735
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,018
Let's go somewhere!

736
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,771
We can do it in my car.

737
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:38,897
- What?
- Leave me--

738
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,816
I said, leave me alone!

739
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,115
You crazy--

740
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,241
Ah!

741
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,123
Vincent. Come.

742
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:03,714
I've lined up the meetings with
all the potential investors.

743
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:06,925
And um...

744
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,887
You know, we should definitely
make this night special.

745
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:13,890
Okay?

746
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:15,767
Remember?

747
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,312
I told you we need to talk.

748
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,190
But not just about
the company...

749
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,027
But about us.

750
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,529
And...

751
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,616
we can do more than just talk.

752
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,161
I have something else in mind.

753
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,122
Claudia.

754
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,709
I'd like to have the talk.

755
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,961
The room is just waiting.

756
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,298
- Let's go to the room.
- It's not what you think.

757
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,094
Claudia, thank you for arranging
things with the investors,

758
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,804
but you didn't have
to do all that.

759
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,014
But you--

760
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:00,937
Vincent.

761
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,399
You promised me that
we were going to talk.

762
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,525
Right?

763
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,446
I'm doing everything for you,

764
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,239
for us,

765
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,367
so we can fix things
between us

766
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,285
and have a fresh start.

767
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,789
But look at what is
happening now.

768
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,500
You're picking that woman?

769
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,127
Are you that stupid?

770
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,678
Claudia, you know I'm done
with this marriage.

771
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,847
I don't want to give you
false hope,

772
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:39,393
because we'd only keep
hurting each other.

773
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,269
And what makes you think...

774
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,606
that woman wouldn't hurt you?

775
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,530
Your life would be a living hell
with her.

776
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,864
Believe me, Vincent.

777
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,243
I'd rather live in hell,

778
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,495
than live a life with you.

779
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,335
Claudia!

780
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,503
Claudia...

781
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,715
- What?
- You know what?

782
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,759
You look tired.
Go rest in the room you booked.

783
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,095
Stella.

784
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,639
You're still here.

785
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:06,897
May I just ask?

786
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,316
Why did you really come here?

787
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,943
I mean, we were all shocked.

788
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,487
Including Vincent.

789
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,990
And you were with Matthew?

790
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,828
Surely you can't fault us
for believing...

791
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,623
you only bring trouble.

792
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:35,300
Before I even came
into the picture,

793
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,637
your lives were already a mess.

794
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,263
Oh, yes.

795
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,350
Our family is far from perfect.

796
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,520
But do you really want
to be the reason

797
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,940
it breaks even more?

798
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:52,484
It's so easy to blame me.

799
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,489
Perhaps the time has come
for you to face the truth.

800
00:51:58,782 --> 00:51:59,991
Sometimes,

801
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,953
you have to choose your battles.

802
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,579
When to fight, and how.

803
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,791
Not every battle is
worth fighting for.

804
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:15,882
Sometimes, the best thing to do
is stay quiet.

805
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,927
Accept things as they are.

806
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,887
Not just for your sake,

807
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,306
but for everyone you hold...

808
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,059
close to your heart.

809
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,581
Ah!

810
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,919
I'm going to get Vincent back.

811
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,463
He's mine.

812
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,382
- Right?
- True.

813
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:03,096
Hell would freeze over before
that woman ever beats me.

814
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,016
Mark my words.

815
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:10,312
I won't end up alone
when all is said and done.

816
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,814
Mm-hmm.
I'll remember those words.

817
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:13,982
But for now...

818
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,276
You're clearly drunk,
Ma'am Claudia.

819
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,402
Let's head out.

820
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,154
Are you kidding me?

821
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,906
You're going to drink with me!

822
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,867
You're going to order
another bottle for yourself

823
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,535
and get more glasses.

824
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,997
- Okay. Yes, ma'am.
- See you.

825
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,458
The boss gave the order.

826
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,543
If she wants us to keep
drinking, we'll keep drinking.

827
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,628
Miss!

828
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,005
Miss! Miss!

829
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:38,840
Yeah, you.

830
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,092
One bottle of champagne.

831
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,761
Okay?

832
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,476
What exactly is Edward doing?

833
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,856
He's obviously talking
to Ma'am Claudia.

834
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,025
But why?

835
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:58,902
What do you mean?

836
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,529
He's a person with a mouth,

837
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,823
and he's using it
to say whatever he wants.

838
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,618
That's not what I meant.

839
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,287
Why is he talking to a guest?

840
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:13,208
He's way too casual
with Ma'am Claudia.

841
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,584
He's just a waiter.

842
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,336
Ma'am Claudia is a Cabrera.

843
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,546
Girl!

844
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,423
I like you!

845
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,883
You're a little crazy!

846
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,970
Edward is a Cabrera, too.

847
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:29,015
He's the youngest child,
the heir to the company!

848
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,018
Just a waiter?

849
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,812
How?

850
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,732
It's been a while.

851
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:41,069
Looks like you've been busy
expanding the company.

852
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,404
- Shit!
- Oh my god!

853
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,156
- Fuck! Arthur!
- Is that blood? What happened?!

854
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,408
Arthur!

855
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,536
Mr. Lim, what's wrong?

856
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,829
What are your guests?!

857
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,081
Somebody get the doctor!
What happened?

858
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,583
- She did this to me!
- Who? Did you see her?

859
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:58,962
My goodness!

860
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,631
- Watch where you're going!
- It's her!

861
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,508
She did this to me!

862
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,343
That whore!

863
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,678
Call the police!

864
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,805
No way I'm letting that
woman walk free!

865
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,766
I just defended myself
from a jerk like you!

866
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,268
She's lying!

867
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:17,105
She's a prostitute!

868
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,315
She was selling
her services to me!

869
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,234
And when I refused,

870
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,569
she became violent!

871
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,612
- Liar--
- Not another word from you!

872
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:27,115
Was bringing shame not enough?

873
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:29,325
You had to stir up trouble
and scandal too?

874
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,869
Take this woman away!

875
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:31,911
- Now!
- Yes, sir.

876
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,288
- You're lying!
- Escort her.

877
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:35,540
- You're a liar!
- Don't make a scene, ma'am.

878
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,418
- Come with us, ma'am.
- Let's go.

879
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:40,879
Is he okay?

880
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,505
Everyone!

881
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:43,715
Okay.

882
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,508
Everything is under control!

883
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,094
Okay? Let's go!

884
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,850
Everything is fine.

885
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,189
Katherine.

886
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,858
Do you need anything, sir?

887
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,943
Just a moment, sir.

888
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,696
I'll just wrap this up.

889
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,615
Are you mad at me?

890
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:16,748
What's your deal?

891
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:19,459
A Cabrera with a hobby
for waiting tables?

892
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,128
I didn't hide it
from anyone, Katherine.

893
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,172
I just don't want people
treating me differently

894
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,299
because of my surname.

895
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:29,135
You should have told me
so I could adjust.

896
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,638
Why? What does it matter?

897
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:36,851
Katherine, I won't stop
until you answer me.

898
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,146
Vincent's your brother, right?

899
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,190
Stella's my sister.

900
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,904
It hurts! Get off me!

901
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,115
I'm leaving anyway!

902
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,033
- You're hurting me!
- Stella!

903
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,993
Ma'am, please calm down.

904
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,703
That whore!

905
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,956
I've been trying to find you.

906
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,499
Where do you think
you're going?!

907
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,042
Ow!

908
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,546
That's what you deserve, Stella.

909
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,755
The audacity!

910
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,258
How dare you come to this party!

911
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:12,011
You're hitting on Matthew
after Vincent?!

912
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,601
Where are you going?!
I'm not done with you!

913
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,396
I won't let you leave
without teaching you a lesson!

914
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,481
Get off me! Don't touch me!

915
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:25,692
Well?!

916
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,987
You know,
Vincent and I were okay.

917
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:32,031
We had a complete family
before you came into his life!

918
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,784
You homewrecking bitch!

919
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,203
Just admit your family
was already broken

920
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,663
before I came into his life!

921
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,456
Are you that delusional?!

922
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,375
- Ah!
- What did you say?!

923
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,552
Well?

924
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:56,306
Did you turn modest
all of a sudden?

925
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:11,362
<i>Stella, you shouldn't</i>
<i>have come here.</i>

926
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,114
<i>I'll never put you</i>
<i>back in a position</i>

927
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,365
<i>where you'll be humiliated.</i>

928
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,783
<i>This is where it all ends.</i>

929
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,410
<i>He sided with his woman!</i>

930
00:58:17,493 --> 00:58:19,913
<i>He doesn't care</i>
<i>about our family and reputation.</i>

931
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,789
<i>All he cares about</i>
<i>is his own interests!</i>

932
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,208
<i>We're prisoners of our name!</i>

933
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,168
<i>Our name is not our prison;</i>
<i>it's our protection!</i>

934
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:29,130
<i>I want Vincent Cabrera</i>
<i>out of this company immediately!</i>

935
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,381
<i>I'm Detective Tolentino,</i>

936
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:32,884
<i>newly assigned</i>
<i>to Walter Cunanan's case.</i>

937
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,136
<i>Don't lie to me.</i>

938
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,596
<i>What were you doing</i>
<i>at his villa?</i>

939
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,097
<i>Do you know each other?!</i>
