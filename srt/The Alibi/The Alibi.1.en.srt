1
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,960
<i>Upholding the truth</i>
<i>requires courage.</i>

2
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,046
<i>It means speaking up</i>
<i>when you see falsehood...</i>

3
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,550
<i>...even when it's unpopular</i>
<i>or inconvenient.</i>

4
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,304
<i>That is what</i>
<i>Cabrera News is all about.</i>

5
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,015
Even when it's unpopular
or inconvenient.

6
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,350
That is what
Cabrera News is all about.

7
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,698
Our contact's getting scared.

8
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,117
<i>He's exposing</i>
<i>very powerful people.</i>

9
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,161
<i>If he reveals the truth,</i>

10
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,121
<i>he might get harmed.</i>

11
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,832
Well, our whole exposé
rests on him.

12
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,793
He's the whistle blower.

13
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,878
I don't care what he does,

14
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,923
but I want an
exclusive interview today.

15
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,758
Okay, Sir Vincent.

16
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,134
<i>We'll try our best.</i>

17
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,303
I don't want your best.

18
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,555
I want results.

19
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,225
Will the announcement affect
our upcoming articles?

20
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,693
- Wait for the announcement.
- George, call for a team huddle.

21
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,987
We'll talk about
the presentation for investors.

22
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,655
It's good you're finally here.

23
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,365
Walter has an announcement.

24
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,660
No other news channel
knows about this.

25
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,829
Okay.

26
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,998
- But this won't do.
- Noted, sir.

27
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,667
Yeah, change that.

28
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,168
- Walter.
- Thank you.

29
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,880
Vincent. Good, you're here.

30
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,049
I didn't want to make
the announcement without you.

31
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,052
What announcement?

32
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,848
Well, it's about the
closure of Cabrera News.

33
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:05,018
- Be quiet.
- Look, you know the situation.

34
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,980
I'm already talking to
potential investors.

35
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,232
Cabrera News will
continue to operate, Walter.

36
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,692
I'm just following orders.

37
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,777
And we've exhausted
every possible venue.

38
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,740
I mean, we've cut costs,
we've restructured.

39
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:19,949
But in the end,

40
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,327
the financial losses are
just too deep to recover from.

41
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,870
Then, just give me more time,

42
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,331
and I'll give you
the improvements you need.

43
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,790
I have a presentation prepared

44
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,959
for major potential
sponsors this week.

45
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,545
Time is also money, Vincent.

46
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,713
You know that.

47
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,215
And like I said,
I'm just following orders.

48
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,884
Don't make the announcement.

49
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,595
I'll talk to the higher-ups.

50
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,766
We're friends, Walter.

51
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,977
Just give me this.

52
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,147
I can't believe you're pulling
the friendship card right now.

53
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,149
You know, Vincent,
you need to accept

54
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,943
the situation we're in.

55
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,613
Look, you're just prolonging
the agony for everyone.

56
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,281
The closure of Cabrera News

57
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,284
isn't a reflection
of your work, okay?

58
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,453
Or failure.

59
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,746
You know what?

60
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,915
Cabrera News
is not shutting down.

61
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,970
You're closing down Cabrera News
without even telling me?!

62
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,680
When a king
makes moves, Vincent,

63
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,307
does he need to tell
his subjects first?

64
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,184
So you just
see me as a subject?

65
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:29,560
I'm the Chairman, Vincent.

66
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,479
I can do whatever I please.

67
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,022
I own everything
in this building,

68
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,024
down to the nails and cement.

69
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,317
You're wrong, Dad.

70
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,820
This company was built off
the employees' blood and sweat.

71
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,822
I have no time
to argue with you.

72
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,325
Dad, so many employees
are relying on Cabrera News.

73
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,995
We're not running
a charity here.

74
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,287
Look, Vincent.

75
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,916
If you think we haven't
tried everything

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,210
to save Cabrera News...

77
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,632
Truth isn't important
to people anymore, Vincent.

78
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,010
Nowadays, people choose
to believe in

79
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,636
whatever they want to.

80
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,974
What happened to you, Dad?

81
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,519
Weren't you
a journalist before?

82
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,730
"The Nation's Ally."

83
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,273
Isn't that your moniker?

84
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,651
You of all people should
want to save Cabrera News.

85
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,528
I'm a former journalist.

86
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:25,074
No one wants to read serious
journalism now, Vincent.

87
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,327
So what's the point
of our digital channel?

88
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:34,876
People nowadays choose
to believe in fake news.

89
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,503
Have you seen
your numbers, Vincent?

90
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,713
Trash!

91
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:43,009
But what about our
responsibility to the people?

92
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,554
People who don't watch us.

93
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,140
So, what obligation
are you talking about?

94
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,227
Our loyalty is
with our shareholders.

95
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,355
So, you'll shut down
Cabrera News just like that?

96
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,191
Dad, I worked so hard
to build this channel,

97
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,276
from publishing
to what it is now.

98
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,531
Not everything you work hard for
will stay forever.

99
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,492
You need to go with the flow,

100
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,202
or you'll drown!

101
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,291
That is your truth.
Not mine.

102
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,544
I'd rather go down fighting.

103
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,089
Just because you're
a Cabrera,

104
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:25,885
that doesn't mean you are
entitled to everything.

105
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,596
Just give me six months.

106
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,973
I have a big exposé.

107
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,601
The kids of the
biggest names in society,

108
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,520
they're involved in
raping and drugging women.

109
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,272
And they share it all
in an exclusive chat group.

110
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,774
This is big news.

111
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,277
Do we have friends in that list?

112
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,368
I'll show you the list.

113
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,664
I'll make the numbers
of Cabrera News go up.

114
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,000
And if I can't,
I'll shut it down myself.

115
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,253
Time is money, Vincent.

116
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,296
Okay, give me three months.

117
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,924
But if I save Cabrera News,

118
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,467
make me the new CEO.

119
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,969
You can't handle it.

120
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,345
Watch me.

121
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,312
You know what
you remind me of, Vincent?

122
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,566
A fucking sewage rat.

123
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,360
Already on the brink of death,

124
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,613
but it continues to fight back.

125
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,741
I'll take that as a compliment.

126
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,756
George.

127
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,634
Landslide?!

128
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,145
My son! My son!

129
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,106
- Sir, please hurry!
- Ma'am, we've got it.

130
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,900
Son, don't give up!

131
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,569
- Keep fighting for Mama!
- What happened here?

132
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,906
What happened?
Can you tell us what happened?

133
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,699
Ma'am, what happened?

134
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,826
- Son! My son!
- What happened, ma'am?

135
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,123
Ma'am, can you
tell us what happened?

136
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,834
No! My son!

137
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,171
My son!

138
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,842
You're late.

139
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,387
Too bad you didn't
get here on time.

140
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,223
See you. We'll pull out now.

141
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,896
What happened?

142
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,484
You stubborn girl!

143
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,777
You already took a bath!

144
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,363
You're filthy again! Huh?!

145
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,407
You were already clean earlier!
You just took a bath!

146
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,994
Wait here.

147
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,913
Look at what you've done!

148
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,332
- I'm so tired of this!
- Ma'am.

149
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,626
Uh, I'm with Cabrera News.

150
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,003
Our cameras are over there.

151
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,631
Uh, while your
daughter's crying,

152
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,050
can we shoot some footage
of her crying?

153
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,719
We'll relate it
to the recent landslide.

154
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,722
She can seem like
one of the victims.

155
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,350
Is that okay?
I'll take care of you.

156
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,851
Oh, all right.

157
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,396
May I put some dirt
on your daughter?

158
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,147
All right.

159
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,986
- There.
- What's Sir Vincent doing here?

160
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,862
He doesn't need
to be on the field.

161
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,325
Sir Vincent wants
everything to be perfect.

162
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,120
He doesn't mind doing the work,
as long as it's perfect.

163
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,621
What's he planning?

164
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,710
Watch and learn.

165
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,004
Okay, Mike. Go, interview.

166
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,214
<i>Now, we're talking to...</i>

167
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,341
- Zoom out, George.
<i>- ...the landslide victims.</i>

168
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,845
I don't understand
why this happened to us.

169
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,054
Focus on the mom!

170
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,432
- We lost our home.
- <i>Focus on the mom!</i>

171
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,101
- We lost everything we have.
- Okay, close up on the girl.

172
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,228
-<i> What will you do now?</i>
- George.

173
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,272
We don't know where to go.

174
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,107
Zoom out. Mike, act like...

175
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,525
<i>...you feel sorry for them.</i>

176
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:11,610
<i>Keep crying. Very good.</i>

177
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,404
Three, two, one, cut!

178
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,273
Oh, sir, you're home already.

179
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,400
Sorry, I was just
putting Bea to sleep,

180
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,277
but I ended up
falling asleep, too.

181
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,236
It's fine.

182
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,946
Where's Claudia?

183
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,615
She's not home yet, sir.

184
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,789
Does Bea still have a fever?

185
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:05,956
Yes, she still does.

186
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,293
Alright, I'll take care of her.

187
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,590
Where have you been?

188
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,177
Have you forgotten?

189
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:23,265
I'm in charge of the venue
for your dad's birthday.

190
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,351
Bea still has a fever.
Touch her.

191
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,649
She didn't have a fever
when I left.

192
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,405
You shouldn't have left.
Our daughter has a fever.

193
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,781
Have you been drinking?

194
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,244
You know...

195
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,578
I did some food tasting
and whatnot.

196
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,168
Claudia, all I'm saying is that
you shouldn't leave Bea alone.

197
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,962
- She has a fever--
- Shh, shh, shh.

198
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,715
Sorry.

199
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,301
I'm not Mother Theresa.

200
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:04,098
I'm just the one entrusted with
organizing your dad's birthday.

201
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,017
Where's your wedding ring?

202
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,983
It's in my bag.
I know it's here.

203
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,444
It's here.

204
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,866
- Oh my god. I'm so sorry.
- I'll get it.

205
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,579
Why do you keep taking it off?

206
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,872
It's loose.

207
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,084
You know, wine has calories.

208
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,294
It fits perfectly.

209
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,471
I missed you.

210
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,315
Bea, wait for your mom
before going down, okay?

211
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,533
Careful, Bea.

212
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,619
Don't get your dress dirty.

213
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,621
Fiona, is everything ready?

214
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,914
Yes, Ma'am Claudia.

215
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,041
Everything is ready
for the event.

216
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,376
Even the villas
for the guests are ready.

217
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,295
I'll also handle
their check-in process.

218
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,755
Bea!

219
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,257
- Bea!
- Uncle Walter!

220
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,884
Mm...

221
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,552
Let's see.

222
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,346
Wow, you look so beautiful.

223
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,015
Thanks, Uncle Walter.

224
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,517
Bea, come here,
let's take a selfie.

225
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,603
- Come here.
- I'll do it, ma'am.

226
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,313
- Thank you.
- Vincent.

227
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,524
Okay, smile!

228
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,005
Engineer Chua, Engineer Chua!

229
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,089
You know what?

230
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,049
I've worked with a lot
of talented people,

231
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,177
but seeing my own son Matthew
step up as the new COO

232
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,973
of Cabrera Land
has been extraordinary.

233
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,685
He is not just my son.
He earned his place there.

234
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,565
And it's not just him
holding Cabrera Land.

235
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,776
His leadership is driving
our biggest subsidiary.

236
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,652
I'm a proud father!

237
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,323
Well, who else
would I take after?

238
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,034
Man, looks like Edward's
the next in line.

239
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,745
Of course, that's why
I've been bugging Dad

240
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,246
to let me help in the company.

241
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,624
Uh, are you sure about that?

242
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,000
We all know Dad.

243
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,252
He's not going
to go easy on you.

244
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,920
I'm willing to start
from the bottom.

245
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,464
Just like Vincent.

246
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,219
I think Vincent has
been doing a great job lately.

247
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,930
Their news about the landslide
went viral.

248
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,809
Even that exposé about
the nepo-kids in the group chat?

249
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,979
Wow! Everybody's
been talking about it.

250
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,483
Arthur, you should
be proud of Vincent.

251
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,068
Even if he's adopted,

252
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,737
he has proven his worth
as a Cabrera.

253
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,448
You know, my problem
with virality is that

254
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:53,952
it doesn't guarantee
lasting impact or true value.

255
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,788
Even if you're
extremely popular today,

256
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,707
you can be forgotten tomorrow.

257
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,877
And Dad's right.

258
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,046
Viral moments come and go.

259
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,255
But...

260
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,009
they can spark conversation
and raise awareness.

261
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,680
Sometimes,
that's all we need for change.

262
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,390
Uh, is the cake ready?

263
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,309
The program is about to start.

264
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,477
Let's go?

265
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,650
You know, I started as a young,

266
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,695
stubborn investigative
journalist.

267
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,989
And my goal was to be
the voice of the poor

268
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,449
and the oppressed.

269
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:37,037
I have faced a lot of
threats and hardships.

270
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,874
Countless doors
slammed in my face,

271
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:46,797
but every truth we exposed
made it all worth it.

272
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,927
I was branded
as an ally of truth,

273
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,181
and Cabrera News was born.

274
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,812
From there,
we dared to dream bigger.

275
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,066
And the Cabrera Group
of Companies was built.

276
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,862
Cabrera Bank, Cabrera Land,

277
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,865
Cabrera Protect,
and so much more.

278
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,660
Tonight is not only about
looking back at the past.

279
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:20,247
Tonight is also about
passing the torch.

280
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,166
You know...

281
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,668
...it is time for me
to step down

282
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,713
as the CEO of Cabrera News.

283
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,632
But wait...

284
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,593
I won't be gone at all.

285
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,095
I will continue to serve

286
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,224
as the CEO of
Cabrera Group of Companies.

287
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:46,732
But Cabrera News
needs fresh energy...

288
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,233
a new leader.

289
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,780
Leadership is not
just about bloodline.

290
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:56,784
It is also about heart,
commitment, and vision.

291
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:02,873
Knowing that my legacy
will be continued.

292
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,833
Now, not only did I train
this person myself,

293
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,293
I practically raised him.

294
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,255
He's someone I see myself in.

295
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,883
He has my drive and fire

296
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,845
to build something
for the future.

297
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:21,308
So, friends,
ladies and gentlemen,

298
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,560
with great pride,

299
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:29,650
I officially name the new CEO
of Cabrera News...

300
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,780
Walter Cunanan!

301
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,930
Sir, uh... thank you so much.

302
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:03,392
I promise you,
I won't let you down.

303
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,893
Let's give him a big hand!

304
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,316
And let's greet Sir Arthur
a happy birthday!

305
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,069
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

306
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,180
Excuse me.

307
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,982
You're a mess.

308
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,446
We had a deal.

309
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,033
I don't take orders from you,
Vincent.

310
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,409
Did I promise you anything?

311
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,541
So, all this time,

312
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,294
you were planning on
appointing Walter as CEO?

313
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,633
After all that I did?

314
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,885
I covered up for Cabrera Land.

315
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,595
I protected your friends.

316
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,431
I sacrificed my dignity
to protect you!

317
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,099
All for Cabrera News!

318
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,435
Did I tell you to do that?

319
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,519
Huh?

320
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,605
Did I, Vincent?!

321
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,277
You did all those on your own.

322
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,696
And you did those
because you knew

323
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,657
you would gain
something out of it!

324
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:43,951
Right?

325
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,494
You are not righteous, Vincent.

326
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,703
You are selfish!

327
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,121
Those are different.

328
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:53,710
Just accept that Walter
is a better choice than you!

329
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,878
I am better than him.

330
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,256
You know it, and
everyone here knows it!

331
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,050
I can run Cabrera News better.

332
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,426
Sleep it off!

333
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,138
You should be grateful

334
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,683
I've given Cabrera News
a second life!

335
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,606
Be grateful?

336
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,610
I worked hard
for everything I have.

337
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,945
But you know what?

338
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,822
No matter what I do, it's never
going to be enough for you!

339
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,906
I've given you my name.

340
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,200
You never treated me
like your son!

341
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,498
You want to talk
about being selfish?

342
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,419
Why did you even adopt me

343
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,171
if you could never
treat me like you own?

344
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,591
- Arthur, Vincent, enough!
- Why give me your surname...

345
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:45,220
if I have to beg my whole life
to be treated like family?

346
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,349
Enough! Enough!

347
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,519
Enough.

348
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,448
Vincent.

349
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,158
Vincent, please.

350
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,285
Vincent, please. Let's talk.

351
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,579
I know this is
hard for you, son.

352
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,789
Please.

353
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,753
Believe it or not,

354
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,130
he sees you as his own son.

355
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,675
You know how your dad is.
He's just being tough on you.

356
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,260
He just wants you to learn.

357
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,264
You know what, Mom?

358
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,351
Most of the time...

359
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,231
the lie we tell ourselves is
the lie that hurts us the most.

360
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,455
Vincent.

361
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,831
Hey.

362
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,541
No hard feelings, okay?

363
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,212
Your dad's decision
surprised me too.

364
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,301
What's your plan
for Cabrera News?

365
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,806
Well, um...

366
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,683
You know how
Cabrera News is going.

367
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,979
Yes, it's been improving a bit
these past weeks, but...

368
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,106
it's still the bastard child

369
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,899
of the Cabrera Group
of Companies.

370
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:25,070
It's a far last.
It's nothing special.

371
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:30,242
So sadly,
we'll have to downsize.

372
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,618
We have to cut our losses.

373
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,245
We barely have people left.

374
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,080
Is it really
just about the money?

375
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,375
My loyalty is with the company.

376
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,212
Stop treating public affairs
like a business.

377
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,716
It's the employees
who's lifting up Cabrera News.

378
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,260
And let's be real.

379
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:52,055
We both know the other
Cabrera businesses benefit

380
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,640
because of Cabrera News.

381
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,894
You know, Vincent...

382
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,107
There's a reason I...

383
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,484
...was promoted to CEO.

384
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,069
Because if it were you,

385
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,197
you'll run it with emotions

386
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,824
and the company will suffer.

387
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,244
Now, I have to make
tough decisions.

388
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,330
And you need to accept...

389
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:18,790
...that you failed.

390
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,084
Who do you think you are?

391
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,629
You're just my father's scholar.

392
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,507
His so-called protege.

393
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,261
And yet, you strut around
like you're blood.

394
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,264
You want the truth, Walter?

395
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,976
To him, you're nothing
but a lapdog.

396
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,395
What makes us so different?

397
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,732
You're a Cabrera and I'm not?

398
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,818
What good is that name

399
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:50,780
if all your life, you've had
to beg for what you want?

400
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,410
Hey! Hey!

401
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,828
Hey! Chill!

402
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,997
- Vincent!
- Chill! It's Dad's birthday!

403
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,665
Don't ruin his night!

404
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,879
This is why Dad trusted
Walter instead of you!

405
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,434
Enough.

406
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,733
Calm down, Vincent.

407
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,068
Relax.

408
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,779
Go back to the party, Edward.
I don't need a babysitter.

409
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,281
Vincent...

410
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,533
I know it's hard to accept,

411
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,662
but I'm sure Dad had
his reasons for his decision.

412
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,331
You don't have
to be upset at Walter.

413
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,542
You don't need to keep
defending him, Edward.

414
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,503
I'm not defending him.

415
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,549
Leave this problem
to us, Edward.

416
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,885
Just go back to the party.
I'll be okay.

417
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,428
Vincent!

418
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,721
I just heard what happened.

419
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,057
Did you really have
to throw hands?!

420
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,518
My god, how embarrassing!

421
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,186
I'm fine, by the way.

422
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,188
Come on.
Let's go back to the villa.

423
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,148
Thank you, Edward.

424
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,529
Wait.

425
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,698
Hello?

426
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,324
<i>Good news, sir.</i>

427
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,659
I talked to the lawyer

428
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,412
representing someone
from the nepo kids group chat.

429
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:23,748
<i>They want an exclusive</i>
<i>interview to share their side.</i>

430
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,458
Okay, good.

431
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,584
<i>But, sir...</i>

432
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,295
they're only available tonight.

433
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,880
<i>It'll be at their office</i>
<i>on Bonifacio Avenue.</i>

434
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,844
Alright. Call Mike
and George right away.

435
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,512
I'm going to meet
them there, okay?

436
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,890
- I have to go.
- Why?

437
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,351
Emergency interview.

438
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,437
Maybe that's all for the best

439
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,063
so you don't make
a bigger mess.

440
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,440
I'll just check on Bea.

441
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,456
"Sir, they got cold feet and
backed out. Interview's off."

442
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,973
Claudia?

443
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,561
Claudia?

444
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,740
I'm on my way.

445
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,800
Daddy, where's Mommy?

446
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,555
Dear...

447
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:36,399
Let's go, dear. Daddy will
walk with you to the villa.

448
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,026
Where have you been?

449
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,656
Mom and Dad needed
some help at their villa.

450
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,076
I thought you were going
to cover an interview.

451
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,494
It was called off.

452
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,790
When we get home...

453
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,250
...apologize.

454
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,460
To Walter too.

455
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,807
What?

456
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,392
Are you taking their side too?

457
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,186
I'm not taking
anyone's side, Vincent.

458
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,021
I just want peace!

459
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,898
Can you stop being a sore loser?

460
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,734
What? Are you angry?

461
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,152
Did I say something wrong?

462
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,988
Everyone thinks...

463
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,031
you're a loser, Vincent.

464
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:11,452
That's why even your dad
has no trust in you.

465
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,626
You're nothing,
you know that?

466
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,088
It's all just bravado.

467
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,133
That's why you're so desperate

468
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,175
with Cabrera News.

469
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,845
You're so desperate
to prove yourself, right?

470
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:32,140
That you're worthy
of your family name?

471
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,770
Cabrera News practically
became your mistress.

472
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,982
That's why I filed for
an annulment before, remember?

473
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,360
I can take bullshit
from everyone,

474
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,862
but not from you!

475
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:49,032
You're supposed to be my family.

476
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,952
I did everything I could
to fix our marriage.

477
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:58,082
Well, you can't fix
everything, Vincent.

478
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,293
You need time alone.

479
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,712
Think for once in your life.

480
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,386
And I'm leaving with Bea.

481
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,804
I'll pack our things.

482
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,599
I'll just wait for the driver.
Stay here if you want.

483
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,101
Well, babe?

484
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,937
Ready for round two?

485
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,983
You've got a lot
of explaining to do.

486
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:22,417
- Hey! Hey, uh...
- Miss.

487
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,377
- Move out of the way, please.
- Can I hitch a ride?

488
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,880
I just need to leave this resort
and I can't get a cab.

489
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,215
Please.

490
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,634
- Come on.
- Hey!

491
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,344
- What are you doing?!
- It'll just be a short ride.

492
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,471
I just really need
to leave right now.

493
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,639
What's up with this?

494
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,766
Why is the seatbelt stuck?

495
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,309
Don't tug at it like that.

496
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,644
See?

497
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,646
Come on, let's go.
Chop chop.

498
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,859
Just until the exit.

499
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,823
Hey! What's that for?!

500
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,909
I'll send it to my friends.

501
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,704
You're a stranger. You might
do something to me.

502
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,622
Let's go.

503
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,674
<i>Pablo,</i>
<i>a guest is complaining</i>

504
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,427
<i>about the loud music</i>
<i>coming from Villa 4.</i>

505
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,845
Copy, sir.

506
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,062
Sir?

507
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,231
Good evening, sir.

508
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,110
Sir, your music is too loud.

509
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,237
We got a complaint from a guest.

510
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,532
Sir, we're coming in.

511
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,518
Pull over.

512
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,648
I'll get off here.

513
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,150
Thanks for the ride.

514
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,912
Driver, to the Basement, please.

515
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,377
<i>This just in:</i>

516
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,171
<i>A body was found</i>
<i>at an exclusive resort</i>

517
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,090
<i>in the town of San Rafael.</i>

518
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,883
<i>According to our source,</i>

519
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:36,968
<i>a man was found dead</i>

520
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,887
<i>and covered in blood</i>
<i>in one of the villas.</i>

521
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,557
<i>We're still verifying</i>
<i>the identity of the victim,</i>

522
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,016
<i>but according to</i>
<i>our informant...</i>

523
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,409
Welcome, sir!

524
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,537
Are you interested
in any of our girls?

525
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,623
How about a drink?
Are you hungry?

526
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,126
We have special champagne
for first timers.

527
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,880
Whiskey, neat.

528
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,506
Right away, sir.

529
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,726
Please welcome
the star of the night!

530
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:12,605
The beautiful, the sexy,
the mesmerizing...

531
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,232
The one and only, Alegria!

532
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,033
- Hey! Hey!
- What happened?!

533
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,905
- Hey, Sugar!
- What?!

534
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:08,948
You're late again!

535
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,866
Well of course,
I had some drinks.

536
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,868
You always say yes

537
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,328
when customers offer
you drinks.

538
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:15,746
If I don't accept,
they get mad.

539
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,206
And you, Anika!

540
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,749
Your hair color
looks terrible!

541
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:22,086
I'll fix it.
I haven't gotten my salary yet.

542
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,671
I'm just waiting for payday.

543
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,135
Sis.

544
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,970
Sis, what happened to you?

545
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,054
Are you okay?

546
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,808
- It's just a case of bad luck.
- Huh?

547
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,726
Wait, did you get
in trouble?

548
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,146
I don't have time
to talk to you two right now.

549
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,314
I need to make money.

550
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,524
I'm okay.

551
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,279
She's in a bad mood again.

552
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,573
Who took my makeup again?!

553
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,700
Don't blame us.
We didn't take it.

554
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,451
You're the only ones
who'll take it.

555
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,162
Where is my makeup?!

556
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,705
You're being ridiculous.

557
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,998
Oh, I'm ridiculous, huh?!

558
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,249
- Give me that.
- Hey!

559
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,501
- This is what's ridiculous!
- My phone! That's new!

560
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,919
- Witch!
- What?!

561
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,338
- Oh, you want a fight, huh?!
- Aah!

562
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,382
- Aah!
- Where's my makeup?!

563
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:09,800
- Where is it?!
- Here! Here!

564
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,052
- Aah!
- Where's the rest?!

565
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,513
- Hand it over!
- Anika, don't move!

566
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,725
- Ouch! Aah!
- Fine, here! Here's more!

567
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,560
- Pathetic!
- You witch! Come here!

568
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,729
- You're so arrogant!
- Go ahead!

569
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,980
Who do you think you are?!

570
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,023
Take her outside first.

571
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,734
Come on! Calm down.
Calm down!

572
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,444
Exactly, sis. That's enough.

573
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,196
The customers don't like
moody girls.

574
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,323
What's going on here?!

575
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,742
What is it, Stella?!
Why are you so hot-headed?!

576
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:39,747
You know I hate it when others
make a fool of me, Mama Mona!

577
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,874
Don't tell me
you're going to pick fights

578
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,250
with your customers too!

579
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,752
You know how I am.

580
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,378
I can adjust.

581
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,630
Just like this.

582
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,882
Hi, handsome.

583
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,717
You're so sexy.

584
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,011
I already assigned
your customers

585
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,512
to Anika and Sugar!

586
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,098
Wait a second!
I think that's unfair.

587
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,725
I'm at a disadvantage here.

588
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:03,062
What do you expect?
You charge too much!

589
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,564
What do you think
we're doing here, Mama Mona?

590
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,815
We're trading our dignity!

591
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,485
What am I?
Sold by the kilo, huh?!

592
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,904
No discounts! No freebies!

593
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,573
I save every cent
I earn here

594
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,659
because I won't be here
forever.

595
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,203
There you go again!

596
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:23,540
You always talk about this
far-fetched dream of yours.

597
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,252
I'll get out of here.

598
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,255
I'll find a decent job
and go to school.

599
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,590
My goodness!

600
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:35,177
A lot of girls
told me the same thing.

601
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,553
And what happened to them?

602
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,431
Didn't they just
come back here?

603
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,642
Well, it's possible.

604
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,144
You have other options.

605
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:49,275
First is if you win
the lottery.

606
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:54,029
Second, if you meet a man
who truly loves you

607
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,824
and takes you away
from this place.

608
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,786
Third, if you die!

609
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,746
I'll leave this place.

610
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,623
I promise you that.

611
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,625
- Hmph.
- I will get out of here!

612
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,173
Where have you been?!

613
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,216
Why did you just get home now?

614
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,052
What happened to you, huh?!

615
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:10,647
Are you still mad about what
happened at the party?

616
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,192
Oh my god.

617
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:17,071
All this over a promotion?!

618
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,704
Do you really think
that's the only reason?

619
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,081
Why?

620
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,665
Isn't it?

621
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,708
If you--

622
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,593
- What?!
- Yes, Fiona?

623
00:44:39,676 --> 00:44:41,595
What?

624
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:43,889
What happened to Walter?!

625
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,863
How were you connected
to Walter Cunanan?

626
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:01,990
We were colleagues.

627
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,951
Based on our intel,

628
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,120
your relationship
went deeper than that.

629
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,330
He was the one who trained you.

630
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,415
Yes.

631
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:12,209
He joined Cabrera News
before I did.

632
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,169
After Dad recruited him.

633
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,422
Actually...

634
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:20,300
Walter was a smart
and resourceful kid.

635
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,054
He grew up in an orphanage.

636
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:27,141
Unfortunately, the family that
took him in didn't give him

637
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,976
the life he deserved.

638
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,061
That's why he worked hard.

639
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,730
I even sent him to study
in America.

640
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,148
He was my scholar.

641
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,567
Ever since then, he always said

642
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,027
he owed us a great debt

643
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,946
and that he would
devote his life

644
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,448
to the Cabrera Group.

645
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:43,907
Walter is--

646
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:45,993
was...

647
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,246
a vital part of the
Cabrera company.

648
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,542
He was very loyal to us.

649
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,752
We considered him family.

650
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,921
All the important events,

651
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,631
birthdays, anniversaries...

652
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,050
You name it.
He never missed anything.

653
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,386
He was always there
to support me.

654
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,433
He was the one who helped me
during my internship

655
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,934
at Cabrera News.

656
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,982
It was through him that
I met my husband.

657
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,987
And I consider him the reason
for our family.

658
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,033
He was a very good friend
of mine,

659
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,870
and whenever we needed him,

660
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,581
he was always there.

661
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:33,916
He was your
child's godfather.

662
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,375
The best man at your wedding.

663
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,377
Are you sure you were
just colleagues?

664
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,047
Numerous witnesses
saw the altercation between you.

665
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,721
Look.

666
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,139
We were both drunk,

667
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,724
caught in the heat
of the moment.

668
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,393
It was about work.
Nothing personal.

669
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,522
Vincent can be
short-tempered at times.

670
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,525
We used to fight
all the time as kids.

671
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,319
Actually, he's the complete
opposite of Walter.

672
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,613
Walter always knew his place.

673
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,823
Walter was the peacekeeper.

674
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,450
So,

675
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:11,370
it doesn't take much
to get you all worked up?

676
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,496
Is that it?

677
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,916
Where were you on the night
Walter Cunanan died?

678
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:20,837
Wait. Am I considered a suspect
in what happened to Walter?

679
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,256
Because if yes,

680
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,258
then I will need my lawyer.

681
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:29,263
How does it feel
to be under fire?

682
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:33,725
Because police officers like us
don't get much of a choice

683
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,435
when we're the ones
under scrutiny.

684
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,937
Mmm. Okay.

685
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,940
So, this is personal.

686
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,025
Be honest.
Is this on the record?

687
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,654
We're not done--

688
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,948
Do you have reason to detain me?

689
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,450
Because if not, I'm leaving.

690
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,203
This is just an invitation
for questioning, right?

691
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,454
And according to the law,

692
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,872
you're not legally allowed
to detain someone

693
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,833
without a warrant of arrest.

694
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,752
You don't even have
any evidence against me.

695
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,004
I know my rights.

696
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,256
Calm down, Mr. Cabrera!

697
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:07,843
You won't get anything from me
until I have a lawyer present.

698
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,061
<i>The life of a Christian</i>

699
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,439
<i>Is truly joyful</i>

700
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,357
<i>Truly joyful</i>

701
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,942
<i>Truly joyful</i>

702
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:28,322
<i>The life of a Christian</i>
<i>Is truly joyful</i>

703
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,366
<i>Truly joyful</i>

704
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,493
We who are here on earth

705
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:37,331
should live upright
and honorable lives

706
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,708
so that we may reach heaven.

707
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:43,545
Our bodies are temples of God,

708
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,715
which is why
we must respect them

709
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:49,968
and do what brings glory to Him.

710
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,388
Don't you agree, Stella?

711
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,098
Oh. Uh--

712
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,184
G-Good morning, Miss Sonya.

713
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,268
Good morning.

714
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,937
Someone looks really tiny today.

715
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,022
Huh?

716
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,649
You're on a diet, huh?

717
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,734
Thank you.

718
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,611
I cut down on rice.

719
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,112
Oh, by the way--

720
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,197
Here.

721
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:14,326
My rent payment,
plus electric and water bills.

722
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:17,162
I added a little extra
for your snacks.

723
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,830
- That's all. Thank you.
- Thanks.

724
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,499
- Stella.
- Yes?

725
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:23,460
Aren't you even a bit disgusted
by what you do?

726
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:26,088
It's a sin. You won't enter
the gates of heaven doing that.

727
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,798
The Lord does not approve.

728
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,300
Why should I be disgusted,
Miss Sonya?

729
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,427
I don't steal from anyone.

730
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,137
Let alone take someone's life.

731
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,597
In fact,

732
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,225
I bring joy to people.

733
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,143
Doesn't the thought

734
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,230
of your soul burning
in hell scare you?

735
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,233
I'm leaving everything to God.

736
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:51,029
The God I know isn't judgmental.

737
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,032
He doesn't condemn.

738
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,451
He's very forgiving.

739
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,162
And who knows, Miss Sonya?

740
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,456
Maybe we'll see each other in--

741
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,167
- Where?
- In...

742
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,087
In the store over there.

743
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,338
- Ah.
- See you around.

744
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,549
- Ma. Ma, let's go.
- Hang on.

745
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:11,842
- They're probably hungry.
- Stella.

746
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,553
- Your prayer meeting's waiting.
- He's right, Miss Sonya.

747
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:17,097
They can't wait
to try your specialty.

748
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,810
We're going to pray for
the salvation of your soul.

749
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:24,938
By the way, Charlie,
ask the people in your office

750
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,773
if they have any openings.

751
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,359
Maybe she could become
a real-estate agent like you.

752
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,944
That's honorable work.

753
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:33,572
Selling houses is not my thing.

754
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:36,450
But I can sell an hour
of happiness like a pro.

755
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:40,036
Know any would-be customers?
I'm available.

756
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,039
I'll be praying for you!

757
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,208
- Thank you.
- Show some respect to God!

758
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,211
Give her some food
to take home.

759
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,672
Her siblings need
something to eat.

760
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,610
Hi there.

761
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,904
Your sister's home.

762
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,501
Seriously, Katherine?

763
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,338
I got home before you.

764
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:35,008
Didn't you hear me say not
to go to that party?

765
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,593
I just bought something
around the corner.

766
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,720
While wearing
a jacket and pair of jeans?

767
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:39,971
I'm not stupid.

768
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,057
This house is a disaster.

769
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,226
Do I have to do everything
around here?

770
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,437
Come on now.
Not the full-on mom rant.

771
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,649
What, am I supposed to act
like everything's okay?

772
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,734
You seriously can't expect me
to do that.

773
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,237
How about I don't give you
your allowance for the week?

774
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,072
After all, I'm just your sister.

775
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,660
Whoa.

776
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,119
Is that what you want?

777
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,247
I can be childish, too,
you know.

778
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,624
Let's toss everything
in this house!

779
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,334
Don't give me that attitude!

780
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,253
I'm running on zero sleep.

781
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,964
Why do you have to be so strict?

782
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,007
Because I don't want you
to end up like me!

783
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,050
Stella.

784
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:19,511
Who'd even want your job?

785
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,555
If it weren't for my job,

786
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,431
you wouldn't have
anything to eat.

787
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,100
We wouldn't have a roof
over our heads.

788
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:28,395
You wouldn't be studying
at a good school.

789
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,230
If there were another job
I could take,

790
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,439
I would've done it already.

791
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:34,276
But how can an ex-con expect
to land a decent job?

792
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,780
I'm sorry.

793
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,368
Sure, your sister made
a mistake in the past.

794
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:46,079
But I'm trying my best to get
our lives on track, right?

795
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:50,000
You're acting
like you had it worse.

796
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,545
When you went to prison,
our whole world fell apart.

797
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,797
Every day, we feel ashamed
for having a sister

798
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:56,965
with a criminal record.

799
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,134
Why do you care what
other people say?

800
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,303
When they ask me
what you do for a living,

801
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,846
I can't give them an answer.

802
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:06,349
Just tell them that
I'm some goddess.

803
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,184
A goddess!

804
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,396
Your sister's a goddess
who makes miracles happen.

805
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:12,480
- Okay?
- Stella.

806
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,942
Stella, that's enough.

807
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,780
Why do you care
what other people say?

808
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,283
Are they the ones
feeding you, huh?

809
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,455
Stella, please, enough.

810
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,831
You, Joseph...

811
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:30,999
Katherine...

812
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:38,757
Everything I'm doing
is for you two.

813
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,345
Even if I have to sell my body
day and night, I'll do it.

814
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,014
I'll do it for you two.

815
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,724
I'll do it so you can live.

816
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,145
So, don't ever think about

817
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:54,230
what other people
have to say about me.

818
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:58,485
They can insult me all they
want because I can take it.

819
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,824
I'll do it so we
can have a life.

820
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,039
Joseph?!

821
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,958
Joseph! Joseph!

822
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,501
Joseph! Joseph!

823
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,044
Get him on my back!

824
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,177
How is Joseph doing?

825
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:28,473
It'd be best if we can schedule
the test as soon as possible.

826
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,433
All right.

827
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,978
Just tell me
what else I should do.

828
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,480
Are you Joseph's guardian?

829
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:38,274
- He's my brother.
- What about your parents?

830
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:41,319
They're not here.

831
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,780
It's just us siblings.

832
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,199
Just check
with the nurse

833
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:48,493
for the prescription
and doctor's orders.

834
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,329
Thank you, Doc.

835
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,171
What did the police want?

836
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,048
They're looking for
someone to blame.

837
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,259
Vincent.

838
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,929
Did you do it?

839
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,389
What did you just say?

840
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,809
You were drunk that night.

841
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:14,686
You assaulted him.

842
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,604
You were gone the whole night.

843
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:20,066
Walter had no known
enemies but you.

844
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,610
And you've been clawing
after that CEO position

845
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,654
like a desperate animal.

846
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,323
What? You couldn't accept

847
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:31,661
that he deserved that
promotion more than you?

848
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,039
Vincent, you were
furious that time.

849
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,501
And we both know what you
can do when you're that mad.

850
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,171
Are you serious right now?

851
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,631
It's a yes or no question,
Vincent.

852
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:46,301
I didn't kill him!

853
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,344
Then where were you
that night?

854
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,763
What were you doing?

855
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,473
And why can't you answer me?

856
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,892
Vincent, hey! Look at me!

857
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:55,977
Answer me!

858
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,353
Just tell me
the truth, Vincent!

859
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,938
You're my wife!

860
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,942
You're my wife, but you're
the one doubting me?

861
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,071
I just want to know the truth.

862
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,783
Walter getting the CEO position
isn't reason enough

863
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,326
for me to kill him!

864
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,205
Wha-- Now, you tell me...

865
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,625
Why are you
so affected by this?

866
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,796
Walter was
a close friend of ours.

867
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,964
And he was important
to the company.

868
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,966
Have you forgotten that?

869
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,219
You know,
with the way you're acting,

870
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,429
you're just making yourself
look even more guilty.

871
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:03,563
I need to earn more money
for Joseph's tests.

872
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,274
It seems his asthma attacks
are getting worse.

873
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,442
Alegria?

874
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,654
What is it?

875
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:15,992
Let's talk for a bit.

876
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,411
Please.

877
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,334
You two can go ahead inside.

878
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:25,668
I'll be fine.

879
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,045
All right.

880
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,880
Let's go.

881
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,096
Well?

882
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,016
I need your services.

883
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,354
I already have a customer.
Go look for another girl.

884
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,147
It's your services
that I need.

885
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,614
Are you looking for trouble?

886
00:58:56,449 --> 00:59:00,078
Look, I'm not looking
for any trouble.

887
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,413
Like I said,
I just need your services.

888
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,250
I'm willing to pay.

889
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,174
One million pesos.

890
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:24,060
Is that amount enough for you?

891
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,819
<i>You want me</i>
<i>to tell the press</i>

892
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,529
<i>you were with a prostitute</i>
<i>the whole night?</i>

893
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:37,448
<i>Who would believe</i>
<i>a woman like me, huh?</i>

894
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,451
<i>How dare you drag</i>
<i>our family into this filth!</i>

895
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,578
<i>We both know you're</i>
<i>not so innocent either.</i>

896
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,997
<i>Are you jealous?</i>

897
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,499
<i>If your spouse cheats on you,</i>
<i>would you even know about it?!</i>

898
00:59:46,582 --> 00:59:48,293
<i>A desperate man</i>
<i>can do anything.</i>

899
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,753
<i>You can call me desperate,</i>
<i>but I'm not evil.</i>

900
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:54,132
<i>If you really didn't kill him,</i>
<i>why do I have to go here?</i>

901
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:55,383
<i>That Stella Morales...</i>

902
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,719
<i>She has to disappear</i>
<i>from our lives.</i>

903
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:00,054
<i>Aah!</i>
