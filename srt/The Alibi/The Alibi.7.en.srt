1
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,495
<i>For our first episode,</i>

2
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,581
<i>we start with the death</i>
<i>of Walter Cunanan.</i>

3
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,708
<i>We will uncover every detail</i>

4
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,335
<i>and make sure the culprit</i>
<i>faces the consequences.</i>

5
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,670
<i>You guys started</i>
<i>having conflicts,</i>

6
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,714
<i>that's why you had</i>
<i>to kill Walter!</i>

7
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,174
<i>You better keep</i>
<i>your mouth shut, Stella,</i>

8
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,050
<i>if you don't want</i>
<i>to end up like Walter!</i>

9
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,260
<i>Are you threatening me?!</i>

10
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,595
<i>Yes, I am!</i>

11
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:54,554
<i>Bingo.</i>

12
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:55,680
<i>That's from</i>
<i>a woman's accessory.</i>

13
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,098
<i>It was found</i>
<i>at Cunanan's villa.</i>

14
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,976
<i>All the evidence we have</i>
<i>right now points to Stella</i>

15
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,812
<i>possibly being involved</i>
<i>in Walter's death.</i>

16
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,272
<i>I trusted you.</i>

17
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,899
<i>I thought we were</i>
<i>on the same side.</i>

18
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,275
<i>Let go of me!</i>

19
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,152
<i>Did you kill Walter?</i>

20
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,077
You still have time
to tell me the truth.

21
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,372
Why don't you want to tell me
your connection with Walter?

22
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,957
If you have nothing to hide,

23
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,168
you'll tell me
who you met at the resort.

24
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,003
I told you,
you don't know him!

25
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:31,591
Then tell me!
Is he tall? Fair-skinned? What?!

26
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,385
So I can verify
who you actually went to meet!

27
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,678
Vincent!

28
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,682
Just tell me who you met
at the resort.

29
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,227
Why are you keeping it from me?

30
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,525
Look at this.
Explain this to me.

31
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,402
Explain this to me.
Look at it!

32
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,449
The police found both of these
at Walter's villa.

33
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,080
Answer me!

34
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,791
Will you tell me
what really happened

35
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,001
or should I tell the police
what I know?

36
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,545
You can explain
yourself to them.

37
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,131
Is that what you want, huh?
Should I tell them?

38
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,425
Yes! Okay? Yes!

39
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:19,597
I went to see Walter
the night he died!

40
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,224
I was there at the villa!

41
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:30,441
I kept it from you
because I was scared.

42
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,778
If the police find out
about my connection with Walter,

43
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:37,866
they'll easily pin the blame
on me.

44
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,993
- Vincent, I can't go to jail.
- That's why--

45
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,580
That's why you just let
everyone blame me?!

46
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,708
So you just used me, huh?!

47
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,503
You used me as your alibi!

48
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,047
No! No!

49
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,591
When you made me your alibi,

50
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,886
I didn't even know that
Walter was the victim.

51
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,387
But when I found out,

52
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,639
I just went along with it
because I had no choice!

53
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,766
So why did you go
to see Walter?!

54
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,268
Why did you visit him?!

55
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,897
Because he knew
where my sister was!

56
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,152
He knew where Joy was.

57
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,409
Wait, so you actually
knew each other?

58
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,078
He wasn't just
some random customer.

59
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,205
When I was in jail,

60
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,207
he took my sister.

61
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,960
When I got out,
I looked for him

62
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,546
to ask where he took her.

63
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,632
But he said he'd tell me
for a price.

64
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,218
When I was ready to pay,
he just raised the price.

65
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,429
He fooled me, Vincent.

66
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,099
Why didn't you tell me
all of this?

67
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,643
Because I was hoping

68
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:51,940
your investigation about Walter
would lead me to my sister.

69
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,276
That's it.
I didn't kill Walter.

70
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,987
Believe me, Vincent.

71
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,658
I'm not the killer.
I didn't kill him.

72
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,832
<i>Vincent? Stella?</i>

73
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,381
Is anyone hurt?

74
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,178
Stella's just in shock.
Give us a little more time.

75
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,973
We'll wait outside.

76
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,624
Where the hell is he?!

77
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,126
He should've been here by now!

78
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,961
What if he got caught?
What do we do?!

79
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,171
Can you stop panicking?

80
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,341
Stop overthinking.
Just relax.

81
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,385
My god!

82
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,596
What took you so long?!

83
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,808
Get out!

84
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,059
See?

85
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,485
Only my phone
got stolen.

86
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,904
Why would they take that?

87
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,907
It's just a cheap phone
with a broken screen.

88
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,954
- Get them something to drink.
- Okay, Stella.

89
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,749
Did your phone have
anything important in it?

90
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,837
There's nothing important
they can get from me.

91
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,380
Or from my phone.

92
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,632
Nothing else was stolen?

93
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:45,845
When the commotion started,
the thief ran off.

94
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:49,682
Maybe he realized there was
nothing valuable to take.

95
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,400
Your brother said he didn't
recognize the thief.

96
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,279
- Did you?
- Me neither.

97
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,198
Everything happened so fast.

98
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,910
What's important is that
my siblings and I are safe.

99
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,537
Thanks to Vincent.

100
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,624
So, are we good?

101
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,556
<i>Only Matthew and</i>
<i>Walter stole from the company!</i>

102
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,185
<i>You know that and</i>
<i>you covered for them until now!</i>

103
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,311
<i>Yes!</i>

104
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,479
<i>You better shut--</i>

105
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,272
<i>you better keep</i>
<i>your mouth shut, Stella!</i>

106
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,108
<i>If you don't want</i>
<i>to end up like Walter!</i>

107
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,527
<i>- Are you threatening me?!</i>
<i>- Yes!</i>

108
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,904
Are you really going
to turn me in?

109
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,531
I'm sorry!

110
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:47,698
I got too emotional!

111
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,617
You can't be
this reckless, Claudia!

112
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,744
I'm not being reckless!

113
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,204
Stella's just being a snitch!

114
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,290
We are not playing chess
by the rules here!

115
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,753
Next time you go
near Vincent and Stella,

116
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,963
be careful.

117
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,007
Vincent is already doing
his own investigation.

118
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,343
We're basically dead meat!

119
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,553
I'll handle it.

120
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,680
Maybe I can dig up
more dirt on Stella.

121
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,598
Go!

122
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,164
Vincent!

123
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,711
Vincent, where are you going?

124
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,045
What are you going to do?

125
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,884
I know you've learned a lot
about me,

126
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,514
but I'm not a bad person.

127
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,349
I hope you believe me.

128
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,189
Come with me.

129
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,065
You still have a lot to explain.

130
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,320
Didn't you notice him earlier?

131
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,114
Vincent was quiet, not a word.

132
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,701
Yeah.

133
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,995
Strange.

134
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,122
Maybe he's just tense.

135
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,999
He used to be defensive
about Stella.

136
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,419
Earlier he just let her
answer our questions.

137
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:26,839
Maybe the information
we gave him got to him.

138
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:32,887
About Stella's possible link
to Walter Cunanan's case.

139
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,806
Maybe he's suspicious too.

140
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,857
Wait, wait--

141
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,609
what is that on your face?

142
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,528
It's nothing, Mom.
Don't worry about it.

143
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,030
What do you mean nothing?

144
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,240
Is that a bruise?

145
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,618
How did that happen?

146
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,538
Will you tell me
what really happened to you,

147
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,790
or do I have to investigate?

148
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,584
Mom, I just helped a friend.

149
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,419
Someone broke into their house.

150
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,046
A friend? Which friend?

151
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,214
Katherine, Mom.

152
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,883
My coworker from Fides Hotel.

153
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,551
I drove her home.

154
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,428
There was an intruder
at her place.

155
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,847
Luckily Vincent was there.

156
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,432
Wait.

157
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,810
Why was Vincent there?

158
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,022
Because...

159
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:29,527
...Katherine is Stella's sister?

160
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:37,576
Don't tell me you're copying
your brother.

161
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,454
Are you involved with
those siblings too?

162
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,790
This has to stop, Edward!

163
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,167
Mom, Katherine
is just my friend.

164
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,878
There's nothing wrong
with helping her.

165
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,714
No.
Stay away from her.

166
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,216
I'm sure she's no different
from her sister.

167
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,467
Look at what happened to you!

168
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,012
- Mom--
- I'm serious, Edward!

169
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,065
Vincent, wait.
It hurts!

170
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,277
Sit down.

171
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,042
How did you get a copy of this?

172
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,716
I'm the one asking
the questions.

173
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,429
I had no idea

174
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,639
the key to Walter's death
was sitting next to me.

175
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,315
This is your chance to tell
everything you know.

176
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,240
All of this was seen
at the crime scene.

177
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,201
And it all connects to you.

178
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,579
You told me Walter
had something to do

179
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:05,039
with your sibling's
disappearance.

180
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,751
How did that happen?

181
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,719
Walter Cunanan is my ex.

182
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,934
I met him at a bar.

183
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,774
He was my customer.

184
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,195
Until it turned into
a relationship.

185
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,659
But he just played me...

186
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:45,704
because I'm sure he's the one
who planted the drugs in my bag,

187
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,164
that's why I got arrested.

188
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,045
And after that...

189
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,672
he took my sister.

190
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,801
And how would you even
know that if you were in jail?

191
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,471
When I got out, I went
straight to Auntie Linda.

192
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,057
<i>Auntie Linda, where's my sister?</i>

193
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,768
<i>What are you doing</i>
<i>here again, Stella?</i>

194
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:12,148
<i>I won't stop coming here until</i>
<i>you tell me where my sister is!</i>

195
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,568
<i>You're so annoying.</i>
<i>I told you, she's gone!</i>

196
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,028
<i>I don't know. Someone</i>
<i>took her from this house.</i>

197
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,907
<i>Gone? Your neighbors said</i>
<i>you gave her to some guy</i>

198
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,242
<i>in exchange for money.</i>

199
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:27,121
<i>My sister's not missing,</i>
<i>you sold her!</i>

200
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,914
<i>We'll stop bothering you</i>

201
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,791
<i>only if you tell us</i>
<i>where Stella's sister is!</i>

202
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,294
<i>What part of "I don't know"</i>
<i>don't you understand?!</i>

203
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,879
<i>What do you mean</i>
<i>you don't know?!</i>

204
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,882
<i>Don't lie to me! Where's</i>
<i>my sister? Where's Joy?!</i>

205
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,508
<i>Oh, really?</i>

206
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,261
<i>You think your sister's</i>
<i>even worth anything?</i>

207
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,848
<i>Your mom left you.</i>
<i>You're all worthless!</i>

208
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,559
<i>Oh, really? Worthless, huh?!</i>

209
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,811
<i>I've been holding it in</i>
<i>for too long.</i>

210
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,564
<i>You want me to forget</i>
<i>we're even related?!</i>

211
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,317
<i>- Stella, calm down!</i>
<i>- Let go of me.</i>

212
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:02,281
<i>Well? Are you going to</i>
<i>tell me where my sister is,</i>

213
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,743
<i>or do we all have</i>
<i>a family reunion in hell?!</i>

214
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,120
<i>I just got out of prison,</i>
<i>Auntie Linda.</i>

215
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,664
<i>You don't know the kind</i>
<i>of people I met there.</i>

216
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,541
<i>Soulless people.</i>

217
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,628
<i>And you have no idea</i>
<i>who my connections are.</i>

218
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,129
<i>Stella, calm down.</i>

219
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,591
<i>Stop it, Stella!</i>
<i>Think about your siblings!</i>

220
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,137
<i>Let's go!</i>

221
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,266
<i>We're not done yet.</i>

222
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,189
<i>Stella wouldn't leave me alone.</i>

223
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,817
<i>She kept showing up,</i>
<i>threatening me.</i>

224
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,819
<i>You know she came from prison.</i>

225
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:45,491
<i>Who knows what she might do if</i>
<i>I don't tell her where Joy is?</i>

226
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,291
<i>And you actually believed her?</i>
<i>Of course she won't hurt you.</i>

227
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,502
<i>You're just wasting my time.</i>

228
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,547
<i>- Walter, wait!</i>
<i>- What?</i>

229
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,924
<i>That hassle you caused me,</i>
<i>add that to your payment.</i>

230
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,846
<i>Fine. I'll send it.</i>

231
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,849
<i>Just make sure</i>
<i>you don't say anything.</i>

232
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,149
<i>- 100,000 pesos?</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

233
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,612
<i>Give me that money if you want</i>
<i>to know where your sister is.</i>

234
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,364
<i>You're so evil!</i>

235
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,786
<i>- Where's my sister?!</i>
<i>- What will you do?</i>

236
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,288
<i>- Where is she?!</i>
<i>- Do it.</i>

237
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,373
<i>You're going to kill me?</i>

238
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:38,210
<i>You're just burying</i>
<i>any chance of ever finding her.</i>

239
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,712
<i>Kill me.</i>

240
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,135
<i>Walter,</i>
<i>I just got out of prison!</i>

241
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,887
<i>Where the hell am I going</i>
<i>to get that much money?!</i>

242
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,347
<i>You heartless bastard!</i>

243
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,849
<i>I don't care!</i>

244
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,309
<i>Is that my problem?</i>

245
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,603
<i>What if I report you</i>
<i>to the police?</i>

246
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,731
<i>Fine. Come on.</i>

247
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,940
<i>Do it.</i>

248
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,568
<i>It's the world against mine.</i>

249
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:07,114
<i>And do you honestly think</i>
<i>they'll believe a...</i>

250
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,408
<i>...hooker and an ex-convict?</i>

251
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,660
<i>Fuck you!</i>

252
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,372
<i>You're heartless!</i>

253
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,667
<i>You're heartless!</i>
<i>You're a monster!</i>

254
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:26,383
<i>Make sure you bring me my sister</i>
<i>once I give you what you want!</i>

255
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,639
<i>You might have forgotten.</i>

256
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,099
<i>I spent six years in prison.</i>

257
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,186
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>who you're dealing with.</i>

258
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,482
<i>And you don't know</i>
<i>what I can do for my sister.</i>

259
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,400
<i>You bastard!</i>

260
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,402
<i>Enough with your nonsense!</i>

261
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,612
<i>Get out of here!</i>

262
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,697
<i>You bastard! You're heartless!</i>

263
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,533
<i>Come on, just leave!</i>

264
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,578
<i>Let go of me! Don't touch me!</i>

265
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,413
<i>You bastard! You're a monster!</i>

266
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,667
<i>Don't ever come back</i>
<i>until you bring what I want!</i>

267
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,632
And that's the reason
I went to the resort.

268
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,677
I came to pay him.

269
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,012
But he didn't honor our deal.

270
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,182
Instead of telling me
where my sister is,

271
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,102
he demanded even more money.

272
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,108
<i>Must be my lucky night.</i>

273
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,360
<i>I now have the money</i>
<i>we agreed on.</i>

274
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,699
<i>One hundred thousand pesos.</i>

275
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,755
<i>What's so funny?</i>

276
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,301
<i>Uh, I just never expected you</i>
<i>to come up with the money.</i>

277
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,095
<i>Walter, just stop it.</i>

278
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,097
<i>Come on. Don't you miss me?</i>

279
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,100
<i>I mean, we had</i>
<i>good times together, right?</i>

280
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,312
<i>Didn't you even say</i>
<i>you loved me?</i>

281
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,399
<i>And to this day,</i>
<i>I still regret it!</i>

282
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,192
<i>Where's my sister, huh?!</i>

283
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,652
<i>Where's Joy?!</i>

284
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,160
<i>That's not enough.</i>

285
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,579
<i>I changed my mind.</i>

286
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,039
<i>What do you mean?</i>

287
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,005
<i>I want half a million now.</i>

288
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,674
He wanted
half a million, Vincent!

289
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,260
Where would I get
that much money?

290
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,180
He also tried to
take advantage of me that night.

291
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,726
There's no way I'd let
that happen, so I fought back.

292
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,644
Is that why you killed him?

293
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:56,450
Send to the police the CCTV
footage of Stella at the resort.

294
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,585
I said I didn't kill him!

295
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,087
It wasn't me!

296
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,967
But I'll admit I fought back.

297
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,719
We had a scuffle.

298
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,096
That's probably how
my dress got ripped.

299
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,434
<i>Come here!</i>

300
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,562
I hit him in the head
so I could get away.

301
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,363
He chased me after that,
so I know I didn't kill him.

302
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,948
He was alive when I left.

303
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,658
<i>You bitch!</i>

304
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,295
<i>Stella!</i>

305
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,881
Then I saw you on the beach.

306
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,931
<i>Damn it!</i>

307
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:06,061
<i>I can't find it</i>
<i>when I need it the most!</i>

308
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,981
<i>You've got to be kidding me!</i>

309
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,658
Why didn't you say that
to the police?

310
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,494
That information
could help solve the case!

311
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,745
And then, what?!

312
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,331
They'll suspect me even more!

313
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,878
And who would believe me?

314
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,339
What Walter said was true.

315
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:38,635
Who would ever believe
someone like me?

316
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,263
They would've thought
I was making things up.

317
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,561
I was put in jail for a crime
I didn't commit before.

318
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,273
Do you think I still
believe in the law?!

319
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,616
It's been sent
to the police already.

320
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:05,454
The CCTV footage of Stella
at the resort?

321
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:09,041
For everyone's sake,
Vincent can't go to jail.

322
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,794
It's Stella that should
go down for this.

323
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,756
And I've got something
juicier to pin on her.

324
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,053
Ooh, now that deserves
a drink.

325
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,847
Cheers.

326
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,349
Cheers.

327
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,230
Vincent, please.

328
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,107
Please believe that
I'm telling you the truth.

329
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,027
Forgive me for
lying to you before.

330
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,615
I'm telling you
the truth now.

331
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,033
I don't want to go to jail.

332
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,160
I've got young siblings
to take care of.

333
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:46,912
Please believe me.

334
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,705
I'm telling you the truth.

335
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,881
Vincent, please...

336
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,257
Sir Andres.

337
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:06,640
Are you with Ms. Morales?

338
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,183
I was hoping to reach her,

339
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:11,937
<i>but we don't have her number.</i>
<i>We need to talk to her.</i>

340
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,899
Yes, I'm with her.

341
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,151
What is it about?

342
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,988
It would be better if
we could talk in person.

343
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,073
<i>Can we meet at the station?</i>

344
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,164
Uh, hello, Mr. Cabrera?

345
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,750
Okay.

346
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,421
I'll bring her
to the station myself.

347
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:05,741
This is proof that you were
at the resort that night.

348
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,702
It's timestamped at 12:30AM,

349
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,662
which contradicts
your initial statement

350
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,999
that you were in the club
with Mr. Vincent Cabrera.

351
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,293
Why did you lie,
Ms. Morales?

352
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,795
What were you doing
in the resort?

353
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,589
The more important
question is...

354
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:25,761
...did you have anything to do
with Walter Cunanan's death?

355
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,806
Ms. Morales, Mr. Cabrera,

356
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,476
I think it's time
you told us the truth.

357
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,273
That night...

358
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,236
I was lost.

359
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,709
My clients are done here.

360
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:01,880
Attorney, haven't you
heard the news?

361
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,465
But don't worry.

362
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,718
I'll show you all the pieces
of evidence we gathered.

363
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,304
Just like this.

364
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,104
That still doesn't prove
that she killed Cunanan.

365
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,606
Where's the murder weapon?

366
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,650
And what's her motive?

367
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,486
That's what I'm asking.

368
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,532
Like I said, my clients
are done here.

369
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:33,411
All you have is
circumstantial evidence.

370
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,663
They're free to leave.

371
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,667
You can't leave until
Stella answers my question.

372
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,795
Stella, would you like
to make things harder,

373
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,463
and face more charges?

374
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,674
Just tell me.

375
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,262
You want to know her motive?

376
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,430
I know...

377
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,438
...she had no motive.

378
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,734
She had no reason
to kill Walter.

379
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,948
What does this video prove?

380
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,075
Do you see her killing him?

381
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,910
No, right?

382
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:17,706
So you don't have any reason
to accuse Stella of anything.

383
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,499
And one more thing,

384
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,001
where's the rest of the footage?

385
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,211
Why do you only have this clip?

386
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,215
- Sir.
- Hmm?

387
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,717
You need to see this.

388
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,392
All right, just explain this.

389
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:52,073
What does this picture prove?

390
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:57,412
It says here you two were
in a relationship, Ms. Morales.

391
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,582
Shouldn't you be more concerned

392
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,876
about the person
sending you these?

393
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,461
And why wasn't that included in

394
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,171
the initial evidence
you showed us?

395
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,924
Why are you only getting
all these now?

396
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:15,013
Whoever's doing this
obviously wants to frame Stella.

397
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,730
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

398
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,318
I thought--

399
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,446
I could've told them
everything I know about you.

400
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,741
But you didn't.

401
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,244
Why didn't you?

402
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,331
Vincent, you had every reason
to tell them what you know,

403
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,457
but...

404
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,717
Because I choose
to believe in you.

405
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,306
Why?

406
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,397
Because I know you're innocent.

407
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,487
You're not perfect.

408
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,781
They can fault you
for many other things.

409
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,286
But you're not a murderer.

410
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,915
Ever since I met you, Stella,

411
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,919
I've learned to
listen to my heart more,

412
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,005
not just my brain.

413
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,552
I can feel that
you're not a bad person.

414
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,513
And I'm holding on to that.

415
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,729
Vincent, thank you.

416
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,318
I did complicate your life.

417
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:58,074
Yes, you lied to me,
and that made me feel bad.

418
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,869
But I caused you
even more pain and trouble.

419
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,209
When I accepted your offer,

420
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,087
I was prepared for
the consequences.

421
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,799
But you shouldn't be punished
for a crime you didn't commit.

422
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,802
And the same goes
for me, Stella.

423
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,978
Stella, I'll do everything in
my power to clear our names.

424
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,274
And whoever's responsible
for this crime will pay.

425
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,445
I promise you that.

426
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,451
Thank you.

427
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:01,012
What did your sister
say about Walter?

428
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:05,809
We were all shocked
to learn they had a past.

429
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:10,438
But that doesn't mean
my sister killed him.

430
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:14,192
Yes, he hurt and
treated my sister badly.

431
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,861
But she's not capable
of killing anyone.

432
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,990
There are also lots of things
we didn't know about Walter.

433
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,535
There are some we're only
hearing about now.

434
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,412
It's actually making me worried.

435
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,913
How come?

436
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:31,334
Because we don't know what
other secrets Walter was hiding.

437
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,838
And these secrets
can affect everyone.

438
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,386
Edward, Katherine?

439
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,139
We have an emergency.

440
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,141
I just got a call
from our client.

441
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,935
And they're expecting a lot more
guests for the prom tonight.

442
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:52,564
- So, we need extra hands, okay?
- Okay, ma'am.

443
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,236
So that's why everyone in
the kitchen's stressed today.

444
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,697
The prom's tonight.

445
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,575
That's pretty cool.
Good for them.

446
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:06,369
Don't you have prom
at your school?

447
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:10,123
We do, but prom is only
for the rich kids

448
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,585
who can spend on gowns
and makeup.

449
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,795
The food's pricey as well.

450
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,089
I don't want to bother
my sister with all that.

451
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,300
You know, sometimes,

452
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:24,012
I wonder what it feels like
to go to prom.

453
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,725
Where everyone's carefree
and beautiful...

454
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,644
...just for one night.

455
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,442
Hey, be careful.

456
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,569
Watch your step.

457
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,947
If this is a prank,
you'll be in trouble.

458
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,784
Stay put, okay? Don't move.

459
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,415
Don't move.

460
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,919
Surprise!

461
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,838
Oh, shucks.

462
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,594
What is all this?

463
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,889
This is for someone who hasn't
experienced going to prom.

464
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:20,360
You're crazy.

465
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,983
What is this you sent me?

466
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,778
Sir Edward set up a
mini-prom on the rooftop

467
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,322
to surprise Katherine.

468
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,830
Ever since I was a kid,
Dad always told me

469
00:31:55,913 --> 00:32:00,335
when I get older, I'm going
to handle our businesses

470
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,295
and that's when
I started working here.

471
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,716
But is this really
what you want to do?

472
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,305
I guess I just got
used to the idea

473
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,390
of becoming a businessman.

474
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,518
So, what do you
really want to be?

475
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,229
Hmm.

476
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,356
To be honest,

477
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,443
I wanted to take up
journalism in college.

478
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,820
I want to be like Dad.

479
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,741
And because I idolize
my brother, Vincent.

480
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,869
So, why didn't you pursue it?

481
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:37,705
Dad said no.
He said it's dangerous.

482
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:42,960
He said he prefers me handling
our businesses instead.

483
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,713
You know, it's not too late.

484
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,591
You can still
take up journalism.

485
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,385
I don't think I have the time.

486
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,930
And with what's happening
with my family right now,

487
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,849
I don't want to cause
any more friction.

488
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,645
Hey, pursuing a dream
doesn't have a timeline.

489
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:04,315
What's important is you're sure
about what you're doing.

490
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,068
You know, you're the only one
who's ever told me that.

491
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,822
Sorry, I'm just
a little opinionated.

492
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:19,330
You know, I think you'd be
a great journalist one day.

493
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,916
So don't be afraid.

494
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,378
Your surname doesn't define you.

495
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,928
Shouldn't that Stella Morales
be in jail already?

496
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:35,096
<i>You know, sir,</i>

497
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,307
if we were only
talking about Stella,

498
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,893
<i>we could find a way</i>
to put her in jail.

499
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,856
But your son, Vincent,
is protecting her.

500
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:49,986
That video is solid evidence.

501
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,029
No matter what Vincent does,

502
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:55,742
if your men just did their job,

503
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,827
Stella should be
behind bars already!

504
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,496
If you can't control your men,
give the case to someone else.

505
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,040
Give it to somebody
you can hold by their throat.

506
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,751
All right, sir.

507
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,627
We'll try to look for someone.

508
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,379
Don't try, just do it!

509
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,965
You wouldn't want me
to talk about you

510
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:13,134
on Cabrera News, right?

511
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,065
Oh, thank you.

512
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,195
Oh, you need to
pay for the coffee.

513
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,530
We just want to
talk to you again.

514
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,241
Sir, I already told you
about everything I know.

515
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:42,789
You said the CCTV camera
was destroyed by a storm.

516
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,250
So, how could
someone send us this?

517
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,009
I don't know
anything about that, sir.

518
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,015
You know, if we find out
you're hiding something,

519
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:04,143
we can charge you with
obstruction of justice.

520
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,269
Would you want that?

521
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,438
Sir, do what you need to do.

522
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,148
I'll face it.

523
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,942
But I really
don't know anything.

524
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:11,984
Now, go away.

525
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,402
- You can't be here.
- Wait.

526
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,279
You have no authorization!
You can't be here!

527
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,531
Don't push me!

528
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,285
Just get out of here.
Get out.

529
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:24,080
I've been looking
for you all evening!

530
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,082
Where have you been?!
We couldn't find you!

531
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,084
I had instructions for you
for tomorrow.

532
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,545
- I'm sorry.
- Your shift's not over yet!

533
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,796
It's my fault.

534
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,427
You're just a
probationary employee, right?

535
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,972
Pack your things.

536
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,431
Today's your last day.

537
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,850
You're fired!

538
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,852
- What?
- Now, go!

539
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,189
Katherine.

540
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,025
I'll be fine, Edward.

541
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,569
Don't follow me.

542
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,329
Stella.

543
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,293
This is a replacement
for your stolen cellphone.

544
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:12,879
Huh?

545
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,339
Why did you buy me this?

546
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,341
Because you need it.

547
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,763
Thank you.

548
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,724
Vincent?

549
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,393
You have a <i>visitor</i>.

550
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,897
- I mean...
- It's Claudia.

551
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,398
...you have a visitor.

552
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,067
I got it, I got it.

553
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,072
Vincent.

554
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,659
I see that you're busy.

555
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,369
What is this story about?

556
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,746
Confidential.

557
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,041
Confidential?

558
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,293
Big word for you.

559
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,755
Can you even keep up
with what they're doing?

560
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,591
Stella is an important
part of our team.

561
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,052
I trust and believe
in her capabilities.

562
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,013
You still trust this woman?

563
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,308
You know, Claudia,
you're distracting us.

564
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,311
We have a lot to do.
We're covering another story.

565
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,146
Can you please leave?

566
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,774
Or do you just want to know
what story were doing?

567
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,278
It's the story of a rich addict
who broke into the house

568
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:23,157
of a poor prostitute
just to get an old cellphone.

569
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,575
I don't know what
you're talking about.

570
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,370
Stop playing dumb.
I know you're somehow involved.

571
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,164
You even dragged my siblings,
and Vincent, into that mess.

572
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,541
Claudia, I'm not done
with you yet.

573
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,378
Don't ever forget
to look behind you

574
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,005
because you don't know
when I'll get back at you!

575
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,472
What, you're going to leave?

576
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:48,683
I knew you were a coward.

577
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,614
Mm, you thought I'd forget you?
I've got you now.

578
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,199
Oh, hey...

579
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,159
Sir Matthew.

580
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,328
- You need to see this.
- Yeah, wait, wait, wait...

581
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,247
No, no, no, no, no...

582
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,749
- Sir, it's important.
- Ugh.

583
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,002
I lost my match.
Come on.

584
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,461
Why, what is that?

585
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,302
<i>Like most crimes,</i>

586
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,973
<i>this story begins</i>
<i>and ends with money.</i>

587
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,602
<i>For this episode,</i>
<i>we will follow a money trail.</i>

588
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:39,734
<i>A money trail that started at</i>
<i>the hands of CFO Walter Cunanan,</i>

589
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:45,281
<i>and how he took money out of</i>
<i>the Cabrera group of companies</i>

590
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:49,410
<i>with the help</i>
<i>of its current CEO...</i>

591
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,496
<i>Matthew Cabrera.</i>

592
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,715
<i>The discovery</i>
<i>of this money trail</i>

593
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:06,385
<i>is the reason why I was</i>
<i>fired from Cabrera News.</i>

594
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,930
<i>But the more</i>
<i>important question is...</i>

595
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,477
<i>Is this money trail</i>
<i>somehow connected</i>

596
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,938
<i>to the death of Walter Cunanan?</i>

597
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,653
This is Vincent Cabrera,

598
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,405
<i>breaking my silence.</i>

599
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,990
Stella.

600
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,827
I wish to talk to Vincent alone.

601
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,235
Did things really have
to come to this?

602
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,697
How could you do that
to your brother?

603
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,449
I didn't want things
to come to this.

604
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,869
I just want to know the truth.

605
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,163
And shouldn't you be asking

606
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:00,040
if Matthew really is
involved in that mess?

607
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,334
Unless, you're aware of
everything that he's doing

608
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,919
and you're covering for him.

609
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,462
You'll destroy
your brother and yourself

610
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,256
because of what you've done.

611
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,717
You're just making
your dad angrier.

612
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,261
You didn't even think
about how I would feel

613
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,471
as your mother.

614
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,890
I'm sorry, Mom.

615
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:21,228
But if Matthew is innocent,
you have nothing to worry about.

616
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,606
Vincent, your brother's
not perfect, but--

617
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,567
Shouldn't he learn that instead?

618
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,028
Let him learn to take
responsibility for his actions.

619
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:32,615
Mom, he admitted to me
that he stole from the company,

620
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,950
but it was Dad who fired me
from Cabrera News.

621
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,452
And I accepted that.

622
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,122
I accepted it
as you stood by and watched.

623
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,127
You think I just
stood by and watched?

624
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,964
Do you have any idea
how hard I fought for you?

625
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,299
But it's out of my hands.

626
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,551
I'm not the only one
making decisions.

627
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,473
Your removal from Cabrera News
was out of my hands,

628
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,475
but I can fight
for your place in our family.

629
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,560
But what you did
isn't helping your case.

630
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,813
I'm doing this
to protect myself.

631
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,107
I'm doing this
to prove my innocence.

632
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,277
And just like what
I told Dad, now...

633
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,696
There are no more restrictions.

634
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,574
Mom, I've done countless
cover-ups in Cabrera News

635
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,118
to protect our family.
But this time, it's different.

636
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,120
Do you even still
see us as your family?

637
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,292
You're still my mom.

638
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,837
Even though most of the time
I feel like I'm an outsider,

639
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,090
you still make me
feel like I'm family,

640
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,925
like I'm still part
of this family.

641
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,510
You're the only reason why

642
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,845
I haven't fully turned
against the family.

643
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,599
Then do this for me.

644
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,061
Take back your statement
against Matthew.

645
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,272
Let us be one family again.

646
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,441
Mom, it's too late.

647
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,569
I can't take back
all those things I've said.

648
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,573
Now, will they still
see me as family?

649
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,033
Especially Dad?

650
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:04,456
Your dad loves you, Vincent.
Please believe me.

651
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,672
Maybe so.
Maybe he did love me...

652
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,800
But not in a way
that I understand.

653
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:44,872
This is all Vincent's fault.
He's going against us.

654
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,959
Matthew...

655
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,046
Vincent wouldn't
have been able to do this

656
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,215
if you weren't
a fool and a half.

657
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,344
He wouldn't have known anything
if you hadn't been negligent.

658
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:05,976
But the ratings of
Cabrera News went up.

659
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,311
They went up?

660
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,856
The ratings of
Cabrera News went up?

661
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,110
That's because
of Vincent's video!

662
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,322
And because people
are waiting for

663
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,824
what will be the statement
of Cabrera News.

664
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,659
But that is bad publicity.

665
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,954
Bad publicity
is still publicity.

666
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,248
Do you really
not know anything?!

667
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,835
Do you even review the
performance of the CGC?

668
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,295
Our stocks are falling.

669
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,757
That means people's trust
in us is diminishing

670
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,759
and that's all because
of Vincent's actions.

671
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:42,805
And worse, all this could lead
to legal action against you

672
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,681
and against our company!

673
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,234
Dad...

674
00:44:56,568 --> 00:45:00,739
What if... we shut down
Cabrera News?

675
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,666
Argh!

676
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:17,881
Yes, Cabrera News
was hanging by a thread.

677
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,717
And things worsened
when you took over.

678
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,137
And you're even
worse than Vincent!

679
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,721
Vincent kept fighting.

680
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,558
He wouldn't have stopped,
not until we fired him.

681
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,976
Because he had a plan.

682
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,061
He had principles.
He was resourceful.

683
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,147
But you... You're always
missing when there's trouble.

684
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,982
You're such a spineless coward!

685
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,150
Dad...

686
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,277
Dad...

687
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,447
You've made too big of a mess.

688
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,701
You may be my son,
Matthew,

689
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,911
but I won't let you
ruin my name.

690
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,455
Get out of here!

691
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,915
- Dad--
- Get out!

692
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,169
Out... Get out!

693
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,905
- Matthew?
- How'd you get in here?!

694
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,781
- Damn you!
- Hey! What gives?!

695
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,450
- Don't get involved!
- Wait a second!

696
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,410
You've always been
jealous of me!

697
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,078
And why would I be
jealous of you?

698
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,580
Because you have nothing!

699
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,165
You should be thankful
you were adopted.

700
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,710
And now this...
This is how you repay me?!

701
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,879
Take back those lies
you said about me!

702
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,297
I'm not taking anything back.

703
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,716
Just prove that everything
I said is wrong.

704
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:44,635
Oh, I'm going to prove
something, all right.

705
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,678
- Don't start trouble, Matthew!
- We're not done here!

706
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,514
I'm not done with you!
We need to talk!

707
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,641
If you're going to start
trouble, do it outside!

708
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,559
- He's the one at fault!
- That's enough!

709
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,561
- I said enough!
- What the-- Wow...

710
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,022
I told you to leave!
Don't start any trouble here!

711
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:00,859
Really? Who even are you?
You're telling me to leave, huh?

712
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,070
- Vincent, come down here--
- Enough!

713
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,905
I understand you, okay?

714
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,740
What?

715
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,952
If you're telling the truth...

716
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:13,664
It's hard to prove the truth
when you're being accused.

717
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,791
What kind of sick joke is this?

718
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,584
You know,
all of this will only end

719
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,128
if we find out what
happened to Walter.

720
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:23,507
So tell us what you know.

721
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,386
You'll clear your name
if you tell us the truth.

722
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,140
We are not your enemies here.
We are your allies.

723
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:56,832
Dad?

724
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,720
I need you to file
your resignation.

725
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,764
Why?

726
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,684
For damage control.

727
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,060
W-What...

728
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:22,190
What's going on?
Why are my bags out here?

729
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,988
Dad...

730
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,282
Please.

731
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,784
Please don't do this.

732
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,705
Dad, please.
Please don't do this to me.

733
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,249
Please, Dad. Come on...

734
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,460
I'm doing everything
you want me to, Dad.

735
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,920
I'm doing everything I can.

736
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,797
I'll make it up to you. I--

737
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,591
I'll find a way
to fix this, Dad.

738
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,177
Please don't do this to me.

739
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:54,056
I need this place.
I need to stay here.

740
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,643
Dad, please...

741
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,605
I suggest you look for
a place to stay, Matthew.

742
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,982
Dad...

743
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,026
Time to step up to the plate.

744
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:09,529
Dad...
Don't, Dad. Come on...

745
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,615
I can do this.
I know I can do this.

746
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,659
I'll fix-- Please, Dad.

747
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,911
I'll do anything, Dad. Please!

748
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:19,164
I'll make it up to you.
I'll do everything! Please!

749
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:21,291
Please forgive me.
Just one more chance.

750
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,584
Anything?

751
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,504
- Anything.
- Anything?

752
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:26,672
Yeah.

753
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,727
Dad... Dad!

754
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,786
Can't you do anything
to change Dad's mind?

755
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,208
His mind's made up.

756
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:07,462
I suggest that you stay
at our rest house for now.

757
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:11,341
I'm scared that I won't be
able to recover from this.

758
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,970
I'll always be
a failure in his eyes.

759
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:23,103
You're not a failure.
Maybe this is what you need.

760
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:28,984
You need to take
control of everything.

761
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:34,197
This is your chance to
prove yourself to your dad.

762
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,511
Looks like Matthew was
hit hard by what you did.

763
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,389
Matthew will fold soon.

764
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,517
His whole life, he never
learned to take responsibility.

765
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,187
Why is that?

766
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,314
Because they always
cover up for him.

767
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,193
That's a shame.

768
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,570
I shouldn't have told him
to leave earlier.

769
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,740
Why are you all of
a sudden nice to him?

770
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:19,618
Come on. He was
very emotional earlier.

771
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:22,412
That was my chance
to make him tell the truth.

772
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,415
I could've pushed a little more
to get him to speak.

773
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,375
You never know, right?

774
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:31,129
He might have information
that we don't know about.

775
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,424
Right?

776
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,675
<i>Daddy! Daddy!</i>

777
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,595
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>Please answer my call.</i>

778
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,181
Dear?

779
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:45,352
Dad, can you come to the house?

780
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,146
Of course, dear.
Is something wrong?

781
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,574
Is there a problem?

782
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,828
I need to go see Bea.

783
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,377
Matthew's not answering.

784
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,466
- Hi, Dad. Hi, Mom.
- Oh!

785
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,094
- Hi. Mm...
- Hello.

786
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,303
- Hi.
- Hi.

787
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,721
- How's dinner?
- Mmm!

788
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,140
- Good.
- It's very, very good.

789
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,809
And I must say...

790
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,228
I'm really impressed with the
way things are going on here.

791
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,647
Especially you.
You make us so proud.

792
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,148
Aww... Thanks, Mom.

793
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,359
I've actually been
working really hard,

794
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:37,529
and I've been working here
for a long time as well.

795
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,531
I think I've proven myself.

796
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:42,200
I also had a good
performance evaluation.

797
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,035
- Mm-hmm.
- So good in fact that...

798
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,121
I think I deserve a promotion.

799
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,373
I am ready to take on
a managerial role.

800
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:51,877
Well... It's about time.

801
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:57,549
You were the one who insisted
on starting from the bottom.

802
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,926
Well, you did not disappoint.

803
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,345
And I think you
deserve that promotion.

804
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,222
So, starting tomorrow,

805
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,558
you'll be the manager
of this restaurant.

806
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,059
- Wow!
- Yes!

807
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,436
Thank you, Dad.
Thank you, Mom.

808
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,188
I promise you,
you'll be proud of me.

809
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,440
For sure.

810
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:19,905
And they lived
happily ever after.

811
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,365
That was beautiful, Daddy.
Thank you.

812
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,619
All right, dear.
Time to go to sleep.

813
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,704
I don't want to
sleep yet, Daddy.

814
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,749
Can you read me another story?

815
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:34,628
Huh? But look at how
sleepy your eyes are.

816
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,379
I don't want to sleep yet.

817
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:40,425
Because when I wake up,
I'm sure you'll be gone again.

818
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:44,512
I wish you were here
all the time.

819
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:51,686
Daddy, am I hard to love?

820
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,065
Uh...

821
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,274
Hold on.

822
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,944
Is it hard to love you?

823
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:02,322
Hm? It's so easy
to love you. Okay?

824
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:07,035
Dear, why do you ask that?

825
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16,711
- Is that guy still breathing?
- Of course, he is.

826
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,546
But he can't walk right now.

827
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,632
You know what,
let's just carry him.

828
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,050
Let's get him a taxi.

829
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,010
Hey, you two over there,
help us with him.

830
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,387
Come help us carry him.

831
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,806
- No, thanks!
- You can do it!

832
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,975
I swear, those two...

833
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,104
- What's with those two?
- Where do we even start?

834
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,064
- Look at this guy-- Oh!
- Hey!

835
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,440
Look at him!

836
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,068
Turns out, he can't
hold his liquor.

837
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,070
He just kept drinking
until he turned out like this.

838
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:44,406
He almost went into
hysterics earlier. Hmph!

839
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,241
- What do we do with him?
- Huh?

840
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:47,575
Wait, let me call someone.

841
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,205
Stella.

842
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,542
<i>Vincent, your brother's here.</i>
<i>He's knocked out drunk.</i>

843
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,669
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>what to do with him.</i>

844
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:58,795
<i>Look.</i>

845
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,258
All right, I'll be there.

846
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,177
<i>Huh? Where will you take him?</i>

847
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,805
He was thrown out
of your family's home, right?

848
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,890
<i>I'll take him to</i>
<i>my apartment for now.</i>

849
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,851
Huh? Why?

850
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,812
<i>I'll explain when I get there.</i>

851
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,576
Aren't you going
to sleep here?

852
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,372
Vincent.

853
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,843
What sort of ideas are you
putting in the girl's head?

854
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,596
What do you mean?

855
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,767
She asked me
if she was hard to love.

856
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,477
No child would ever think that.

857
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,312
Vincent, I have no idea.

858
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,481
Maybe that's just
how she feels.

859
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,862
Claudia, I know we're not
perfect parents.

860
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:12,619
But let's not turn our child
against each other.

861
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,996
If you don't want things
to get worse between us,

862
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,791
leave Bea out
of our problems.

863
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:47,445
You know, it's a good thing
you came to the bar.

864
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,405
We didn't know
what to do with him.

865
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,199
He just showed up tonight.

866
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,203
Thanks.

867
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,789
Please thank Mama Mona for me.

868
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,749
Tell her I'm sorry
for the trouble.

869
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,254
Hey, your brother
is so lucky to have you.

870
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,922
Even though you're not
on good terms,

871
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,466
you're still taking
care of him.

872
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,593
You could've just left him
at the bar.

873
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,431
I'm adopted, but he's
still my brother.

874
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:20,061
So, even though we're
constantly fighting,

875
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,523
I try to understand him.

876
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:28,695
Because his whole life, he had
to share everything with me.

877
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,414
Where am I?

878
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,293
What are you doing?
Yuck! Get away from me!

879
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:45,587
- Hey, you better stop it!
- Eww!

880
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:49,007
"Eww"? You're not out
on the streets right now

881
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,551
because Vincent
chose to help you.

882
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,761
Get that through
your thick skull.

883
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:57,056
My dad kicked me out
because of Vincent!

884
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,767
Because of that video
on your channel!

885
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,812
In case you've forgotten,
Dad kicked me out too.

886
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,105
Remember?

887
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,941
What he did to me was worse.

888
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,526
But I'm his son.

889
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,821
I'm his real son.

890
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:16,284
How could he do this to me?

891
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:20,079
Matthew, we both know Dad.

892
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,457
Nothing comes before
his reputation.

893
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,920
He puts himself first
over everyone else,

894
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,713
even his own family.

895
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:33,801
If you try to question
or go against him,

896
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,678
he gets rid of you.

897
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:36,804
Yeah.

898
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,350
That's exactly how he is.

899
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,268
Even to the most loyal.

900
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,897
Even Walter?

901
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:57,700
Vincent...

902
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,248
I'm tired of being
a scapegoat.

903
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:10,338
I had nothing to do
with Walter's death.

904
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,508
You know what? Fine.

905
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,470
I'll tell you
everything I know.

906
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,905
<i>Something horrible</i>
<i>must have broken Walter</i>

907
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,992
<i>- for him to turn into a monster.</i>
<i>- Ma!</i>

908
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,327
<i>Walter infiltrated our family.</i>

909
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,955
<i>Someone knows the truth.</i>

910
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,665
<i>We need to find that person.</i>

911
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,417
<i>Just fix this problem now!</i>

912
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,377
<i>They're closing in</i>
<i>on our secret,</i>

913
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,337
<i>and I can't let that happen.</i>

914
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,381
<i>We need to change the game.</i>
