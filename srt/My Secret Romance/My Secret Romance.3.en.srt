My Secret Romance

00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,860
Episode 3: You've Deeply Insulted Me

4
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,440
Thank you.

5
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,120
You're a bookstore owner and a well-known author.

6
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,820
Is it fun since you get to make money while playing,

7
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,010
even though I run around all day to the point that my feet hurt?

8
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,870
I envy you more than I would a silver spoon.

9
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,850
You told me you worked as hard as a palace kitchen maid.

10
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,350
You're feeling totally depressed. Should I get you a beer?

11
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,960
I stopped drinking. I shouldn't drink.

12
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,720
Why? If you drink, will you read your erotic novels out loud, Housemistress B?

13
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,850
- Don't call me Housemistress B (from "Housemistress B and the Love Letter")!
- Don't come over here.

14
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,870
I told you not to call me House Mistress! Don't call me that!

15
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,570
- Enough.
- Okay.

16
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,380
Truce.

17
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,240
Don't do this to your oppa.

18
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,970
What a devil-like girl.

19
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,300
Making lunchboxes is nothing. Let's do it!

20
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,650
I'm the super-ultra-best nutritionist in the universe after all.

21
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:47,100
Today, I prepared a bulgogi rice bowl.

22
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,160
May I expect something good today?

23
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,840
Of course.

24
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,430
Then.

25
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,230
It should be okay.

26
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,110
Nutritionist! The bananas that were missing from our order just came via quick service!

27
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,260
Okay.

28
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,770
Even if it doesn't taste good, you have to eat with your health in mind.

29
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,700
I got it. Leave it there and you can go.

30
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,740
Understood.

31
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,030
If you skip another meal again, I'll submit my resignation letter.

32
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,400
I said I got it! I'll eat, gosh.

33
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,240
The smell of food.

34
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,560
- Na Young, please come in for a moment.
- Okay.

35
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,820
And don't tell Secretary Jang.

36
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,830
He threw it out without even tasting it?

37
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,180
Are these this season's main products?

38
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,880
Yes, that's right. This is made of Tencel, a natural material.

39
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,980
And since we gave it a 3D structure, it can maintain hygiene.

40
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,370
Did you try it yourself?

41
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,470
Of course.

42
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,100
Nowadays, if it's not our product, I cannot wear it.

43
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,620
Chairman.

44
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,030
Has Hye Ri contacted you?

45
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,880
Pardon?

46
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,770
I like Hye Ri.

47
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,450
She would be perfect as a daughter-in-law.

48
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,340
She's childish, so I don't like her.

49
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,020
Then if I get you a sensible woman, will you meet with her?

50
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,440
- No.
- You need a wife—

51
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,460
so that she will make your meals.

52
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,990
I have a wife right here.

53
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,110
Has a woman ever offended you?

54
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,790
What?

55
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,290
What are you saying? I'm the one who has offended so many women.

56
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,110
Right, Secretary Jang? Right, Secretary Kim?

57
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,250
Father. Chairman. You know, right?

58
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,280
I don't think you've offended  that  many...

59
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,190
General Manager is really not in?

60
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,760
Yes, he's really not in at the moment.

61
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,930
Then can you relay a message for me?

62
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,000
What kind of message?

63
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,470
What kind of message?

64
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,450
The food that came here earlier. Please don't throw it out,

65
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,300
and tell me what's wrong with it and what you want instead.

66
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,230
If you would give me feedback, I'd be really grateful.

67
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,590
Please do this for me.

68
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,270
Let's go.

69
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,770
Resume

70
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,570
Lee Yoo Mi.

71
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,760
The art of dining well is no slight art,

72
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,230
therefore, the pleasure is not a slight pleasure.

73
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,770
Michel de Montaigne.

74
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,090
Report of Nutrition and Food Preferences of General Manager Cha Jin Wook

75
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,800
- Is this all...?
- This is all private information, so

76
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,230
this must never leave the room.

77
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:20,180
The general manager said to reflect on this report and make his meal plan based on this information, from now on.

78
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,460
A-All of this?

79
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,010
And he said that from now on if you have business with him, do not barge in.

80
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,860
Instead, contact him here.

81
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,720
- Cha Jin Wook?
- Then.

82
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,120
Good morning?

83
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,030
Good morning.

84
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,730
I'm sorry, I'm late for work!

85
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,710
Lee Yoo Mi, you've deeply insulted me.

86
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,940
Y-You didn't see the girl over there?

87
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,240
She ran away!

88
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,320
She ran away?

89
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,050
How bad must it have been for her to run away?

90
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,010
Aigoo! Aigoo!

91
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,210
That's not it! That's really not the situation!

92
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,100
- I do well. Why are you being like this? I'm not like that, really!
- What do you mean, you do well?

93
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,890
Damn, the battery ran out!

94
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,330
- That's not it.
- This isn't that!

95
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:29,480
General Manager, today's breakfast menu is a hearty steak salad!

96
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,270
Here it is.

97
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,970
Good work.

98
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:52,410
Did you not see the report? I don't like medium rare or well-done,

99
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,620
so I need something just right in the middle.

100
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,380
What are you doing? Aren't you checking the groceries?

101
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,020
Yes, yes, I'll do it now!

102
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,170
Ugh, the smell...

103
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,830
If you're blocking your nose, why did you even bring it in the first place?

104
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,910
Grilled fish? Are you kidding me?

105
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,130
The smell is all over my room, what are you going to do about this?

106
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,500
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,920
Always be on time.

108
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,600
If you're even one minute late, I will not eat it.

109
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,610
I will end this month's gross performance report here.

110
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,180
Okay. We'll stop here.

111
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,000
Good work. Good work.

112
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,580
- This is delicious, though.
- What are you eating here on your own?

113
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,910
Let me try it! Ah, perfect timing, I was hungry.

114
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,210
- Yum.
- It's good, right?

115
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,530
It tastes awful!

116
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:06,490
General Manager... The food is natural and good for your body,

117
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,860
so can't you just put it in your mouth?

118
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,880
But why? The food you make is sour in the mouth, so wouldn't it be sour for the body as well?

119
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,580
Three-meals-a-day!

120
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,790
Three-meals-a-day... You won't get away with this.

121
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,420
The enemy of my lunchboxes.

122
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,460
I'll give him tasty revenge, no matter what!

123
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,230
It seems like the general manager threw away his food once again today.

124
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,150
But about Yoo Mi.

125
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,930
Doesn't it seem like she's going crazier?

126
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,610
I feel bad for her.

127
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,480
Surely with her personality, it's hard to endure.

128
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,890
If she just loosened up a bit, like me

129
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,160
Ah, Noona. Don't do this. I'll get a nosebleed!

130
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,040
Shut up! Just eat your food.

131
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,620
You've deeply insulted me.

132
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,180
Hm? He looks familiar...

133
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,460
Where have I seen him?

134
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,230
No way. It can't be, right?

135
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,460
How funny. Who insulted whom?

136
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,680
Today gets a perfect nutritional score! Today's lunch is nutritious abalone rice.

137
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,720
General Manager Cha. Your lunchbox is here.

138
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,690
Send it back.

139
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,890
I can't do that. If you just say so, I'll immediately get a new chef.

140
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,010
- But if you throw it out again—
- I'm replacing it with nutritional supplements!

141
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,450
Don't worry.

142
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,290
I understand.

143
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,310
When should I detonate it?

144
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,080
Detonate what?

145
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,600
The lunchbox bomb.

146
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,970
- It won't do.
- Why?

147
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,390
Isn't handmade pork cutlet good?

148
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,740
It's a lot of work. It's too hard.

149
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,220
But, it's a popular dish, though.

150
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,010
You have to plan this menu again. It's not good.

151
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,130
Do all of you... agree?

152
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:25,660
This is the feedback we've received from customers after the nutritionist changed.

153
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,110
"I don't like over-fermented kimchi."

154
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,470
"Don't you have anything to eat?"

155
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,430
"Really, pickled radish? It seems that the nutritionist here takes her job very easily!"

156
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,720
"The previous nutritionist was much prettier."

157
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,320
This I have to agree with.

158
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,480
Aigoo, it seems like he threw it out again.

159
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,720
I have an abalone allergy.

160
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,540
What? It's not in the report, though. Since when?

161
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,470
- Since today. 
- This!

162
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,660
Royal kitchen's court lady. Did you fail again today?

163
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,240
It's because of that three-meals-a-day bastard. Nothing works for him.

164
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,760
Can't you make a decent meal for dinner?

165
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,220
This dog-like bastard.

166
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,560
You can go to hell!

167
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,400
You're going to eat all of that! You three-meals-a-day bastard!

168
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,670
It seems like I'm going crazy. Why did I...?

169
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,680
Why did I have to do this!

170
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,130
What's the matter?

171
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,110
I committed a mortal sin.

172
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,620
- I mean, it's a long story. Can I go in just for a moment?
- No, you cannot.

173
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,830
Let her in.

174
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,750
I'm Lee Yoo Mi, the nutritionist.

175
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,070
I came here because I thought you might misunderstand.

176
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,650
The thing is, that message was really not meant for the general manager.

177
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,890
I was... I was supposed to send it to a friend.

178
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,200
Ah! You're making meals for your friend too, huh? You must be very busy.

179
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,790
Please forgive me!

180
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:21,770
If you could let this slide for this one time, I would be infinitely grateful.

181
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,830
I made a big mistake.

182
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,340
It's funny!

183
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,740
Ha ha. That's right. It doesn't make any sense, really.

184
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,660
Those broad shoulders. Really.

185
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,730
Resort bellboy... That makes no sense.

186
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,260
You still look the same.

187
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,710
From my head to my toes.

188
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,510
I've gotten even better looking, though.

189
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,500
Should I lie down? Where am I?

190
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,200
Do I know that person? I lost my memory, so... Who am I?

191
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,230
Get a hold of yourself, Lee Yoo Mi!

192
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,670
Ah... I'm not sure what you're saying.

193
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,780
Don't you recognize me?

194
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,030
I'm not sure. You're the general manager of the company, aren't you?

195
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,090
Not that.

196
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,190
Outside of work.

197
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,040
I really don't.

198
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,200
Get in.

199
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,990
Hopping into any man's car. I'm not that kind of a woman!

200
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,400
Look at her running! So that's how she's going to act?

201
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,640
I must be crazy, seriously...

202
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,290
I mean, how could this happen...?

203
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,910
Ah, what do I do?

204
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,860
What? Do you want to know who's kissing outside?

205
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,650
- Hey, Oppa got you a present.

206
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,770
Here. "Noble, My Love"!

207
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,640
Would you put it away before I nobly hit you!

208
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,170
Hey, why are you like this? You really wanted this.

209
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,450
I had to go through so many bookstores before I found this, seriously.

210
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,340
Did I ask you to? Did I ask you to!

211
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,660
Don't treat me like I'm that desperate!

212
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,670
I guess you don't know anything about me, I'm not an average person.

213
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,690
You know there's the resort's presidents son, right? This car!

214
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,170
By chance, you didn't steal the chairman's son's car, did you?

215
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,760
He's not a bellboy, but the Chairman's son?

216
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,270
You still look the same. I've gotten much more impressive, though.

217
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,200
Ah. What do I do?

218
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,110
Get in.

219
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,200
Hopping in any man's car... I'm not that kind of a woman!

220
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,730
Let's wait and see! How long can she pretend not to know me.

221
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,470
Why, of all places... Out of all companies, out of all restaurants...

222
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,840
why does he have to be here? Ah, I'm done for.

223
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,820
I'm done for!

224
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,080
What? He said I have to start personally bringing his meals to him?

225
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,390
But I'm already really busy.

226
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,220
I don't even have time to go to the bathroom.

227
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,160
How am I supposed to go up and down every time to take him his meals, seriously.

228
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,540
Isn't it going too far?

229
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,130
These are the general manager's instructions.

230
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:02,550
Unless you want to take to the streets right now, it doesn't matter even if you exercise your veto.

231
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,180
So, when do I have to start?

232
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,370
Right. Now.

233
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,120
I can do this.

234
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,790
I can... Can I?

235
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,060
Yes. Come in.

236
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,260
Daebok interior remodelling

237
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,290
Is everything alright?

238
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,270
Wait, did you see something you weren't meant to see?

239
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,630
No. Nothing.

240
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,240
What's on the menu today?

241
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,510
There's pickled umu fruit, fried tofu rice balls,

242
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:30,840
chard sambab, myeong-i herb sambab.

243
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,830
I tried to make it a simple but hearty serving.

244
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,460
I can't wait to taste it.

245
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,000
To meet the general manager's expectations, I'm worki...

246
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,760
working hard.

247
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:09,960
From now on, day after day, day after day,

248
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,430
we'll meet like this.

249
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,770
Enjoy your meal.

250
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,780
I have to do this for three-meals-a-day,

251
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,950
every day, three times a day?

252
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,660
- Secretary Jang. Let me ask you something.
- What is it?

253
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,330
My face is not that forgettable, is it?

254
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,430
Forgettable. What?

255
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:51,810
If you're being honest, even if you saw me only once, my face is not that forgettable, right. Isn't that right?

256
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,780
If the general manager wants an estimation,

257
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,570
I'd say your face must be in the top 5% in impactfulness.

258
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,000
It has to be in the top 1%, not 5%.

259
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,200
Ah, so, anything more than a goldfish

260
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,110
would easily recognize my face, don't you think?

261
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,170
Pretending not to know me, not breaking character even when directly looking at my face...

262
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,740
Who's pretending not to know you?

263
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,500
There is someone like that. A woman who is behaving obviously.

264
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,490
One-night stand?

265
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,060
So, you're saying, a female employee with the three-meals-a-day guy?

266
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,310
Oh! That's funny.

267
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,090
It's funny?

268
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,580
Right?

269
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,230
It's funny. Just a second.

270
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,840
I need to write this chapter down before I forget.

271
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,570
Hey! You... Do you want to die?

272
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,100
I'll kill you if you put this in a book.

273
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,950
You, try to think what it's like to be that female employee.

274
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,190
Meeting a one-night stand at work,

275
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,120
how could you go around comfortably!

276
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,930
It's not a love story but a horror story, horror!

277
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,140
Why should she do anything about it? It's already in the past.

278
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,040
It's not even three days ago, but three years.

279
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,090
Just pretending not to know each other, like it never happened. That's what they should do.

280
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,390
Hey! How are they supposed to act like nothing ever happened?

281
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,750
Even if it happened thirty years ago instead of three years,

282
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,840
it's still an emergency situation. Emergency!

283
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:28,170
No way... You don't do that when you're traveling and writing your books, right?

284
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,250
No comment. Let's leave it at that.

285
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,900
- Hey! Jeong Hyeon Tae!
- What?

286
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,050
You!

287
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,030
You... You can't do that!

288
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,170
You, I can request a travel ban for you!

289
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,990
Why are you like this? Did you get drunk from just lemon soda, Lee Yoo Mi?

290
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:51,400
That's enough! Don't talk to me! You 'no comment' punk.

291
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,960
No way. That Assistant Manager B can't act shocked from that.

292
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,660
Today's dinner...

293
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,020
Make the menu so that it pairs with this wine. 
- He must be crazy.

294
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:57,450
♫  After drinking, I kissed you  ♫

295
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,880
Je T'aime - Hey

296
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,230
♫  The rain knocking on the window

297
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,230
♫  Should we go see a movie ♫

298
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:38,140
♫  We could go anywhere ♫

299
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,830
♫ The transparent distance between us  ♫

300
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:46,720
This wine and this music are perfect together, aren't they?
♫ Let's walk together ♫

301
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,870
♫  A little bit closer  ♫

302
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,390
♫  Under a small umbrella  ♫

303
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,260
Should we drink?

304
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,500
No, I can't drink alcohol.

305
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,960
Why? You seem like a good drinker, though.

306
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,730
Goodbye.

307
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,410
Turn off the song!
- I don't want to!

308
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,400
The university's cafeteria is unexpectedly good.

309
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,430
Since I keep dealing with students,

310
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,740
I feel like I'm getting younger, shall we say?

311
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,440
Unexpectedly, among engineering professors and school staff,

312
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,600
there are a lot of handsome guys. I fall for someone every day.

313
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,210
But can you compare it with Daebok Group? Isn't that right?

314
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,410
Why are you so out of it today? Are you okay?

315
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:53,270
Yeah, I'm fine. I just have a lot of things to worry about.

316
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,540
Why? Is the work really difficult?

317
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,890
There's an unbearable person at the company,

318
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:02,290
but for that unbearable person, I have to make three meal boxes a day.

319
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,670
Unbearable person?

320
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:10,510
You look like something good has happened lately.

321
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,570
Is that so?

322
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,920
It's nice since I feel like I'm seeing your old self.

323
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,990
You said you liked me because I became more sensible.

324
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:20,500
But sometimes I miss the times when you acted childish.

325
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,180
- What?
- Is it because of the nutritionist?

326
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,410
It seems that the meals prepared by the nutritionist are doing you some good.

327
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:32,070
I am eating to live. To live.

328
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,080
Hello?

329
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,830
Hi, Oppa. I just finished work and am about to leave.

330
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,180
If you have time, then let's have lunch near the company.

331
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,590
I'm busy. I'm visiting another company.

332
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,170
- Then how about dinner?
- I'm doing overtime tonight.

333
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,160
Then I can just wait until you're done.

334
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,270
Don't wait. I don't know when I'll be finished. I'm hanging up first.

335
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,040
Hello? Hello?

336
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:09,650
What's that? This person is bluntly rejecting me.

337
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,920
I'll let it go since you're good looking.

338
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,690
Are you working overtime today?

339
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,190
Earlier, you said you finished all the urgent business.

340
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,180
I have to eat dinner.

341
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,800
To eat dinner, you're working overtime?

342
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,420
Why? I can't do that?

343
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,050
It's nothing.

344
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,500
Wait, wait, wait a second.

345
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,400
Do you guys want to get chicken and beer together?

346
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,090
I'm totally depressed today. Please help me out, noonas!

347
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,970
Did you get dropped from another audition?

348
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:56,000
Sin Hwa Oppa, you still didn't give up on being a singer or whatever?

349
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,390
You know me well. Chicken and beer, call?

350
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:03,570
Count me out. My "some"-partner (some = early flirting) is hesitating, so I have to go make him decide.

351
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:06,760
Count me out. I have to go to meet my friends.

352
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,540
What about you, Nutritionist Yoo?

353
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,250
I don't really have any plans, but...

354
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,960
Just a moment, please.

355
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,920
I will do overtime tonight.

356
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,690
Dinner should be prepared by 10 pm.

357
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,830
Plans came up just now.

358
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,720
Plans?

359
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,930
Let's go together!

360
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,120
Seafood pasta.

361
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,230
With mussels and shrimp.

362
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,800
We don't have seafood.

363
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:15,350
Sea. Food. Pas. Ta.

364
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:20,060
I'll go and make it for you, bossing me around with pasta.

365
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,910
- Where are the shrimp?
- Right there.

366
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,500
- Did this just come in today?
- Yes, it's today's.

367
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,300
She's tolerating it longer than I expected.

368
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,890
I'll make you explode properly today.

369
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,330
Meal box bomb.

370
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,280
Yes, come in.

371
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,670
I've brought your seafood pasta. Please enjoy.

372
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,290
Wait a second.

373
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,380
Do you have something to say?

374
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,210
Where did I put it? Aigoo.

375
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,600
Here it is.

376
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,370
Take it.

377
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,480
The gas fee I borrowed from you on that day.

378
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:23,460
I'm paying with interest.

379
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,610
I don't know what you're saying. No, no, no.

380
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,160
Take it.

381
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,350
Why are you being like this?

382
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:44,480
Don't play dumb~

383
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,000
You're joking too much.

384
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,900
Here. Now pay up your part.

385
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:10,090
My clothes. My coat.

386
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,010
My 100% handmade wool beige coat!

387
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,430
You wore my coat and ran away that day.

388
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,950
I don't know what you're talking about...

389
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,580
You're going to pretend you don't know until the very end? Fine.

390
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,830
Then why did you come here and find me?

391
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:41,230
You probably didn't come to get the gas fee that I owed you.

392
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,960
I was transferred here.

393
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,490
I can't believe that.

394
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,760
I can't trust your words

395
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,550
or the food you make.

396
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:28,550
You keep pretending. What faith do I have in you, to trust the food that you make?

397
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,110
I don't even know what you could've done with my food!

398
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:36,490
Look here. I'm a nutritionist! I don't play around with food!

399
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,040
Then have a bite.

400
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,390
What?

401
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,160
I said, take a bite.

402
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:13,010
Happy? Can I leave now?

403
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,750
Then, sure. You can do that.

404
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:22,850
If you don't like how it tastes, then choke on this salt— Help yourself to salt.

405
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,030
Jerk!

406
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,130
Team Leader.

407
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:08,400
- When's my job rotation?
 - What?

408
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,240
Yoo Mi, you've only been working for three weeks.

409
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,220
I have my reasons.

410
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,660
Aren't you a part of Daebok Group? Everyone else is upset that they couldn't get in.

411
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,640
What are you talking about?

412
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:24,660
Exactly. So please, please switch me out with someone who's upset they couldn't get in. Please?

413
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,960
Stop whining. You'll regret this.

414
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,220
Listen to me, okay? Yoo Mi.

415
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,800
What, is there a bug? Yoo Mi—

416
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,620
Lee Yoo Mi,

417
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:52,460
you're quite the irresponsible person.

418
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,990
If you can't handle something,

419
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,000
When you can't handle them?

420
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,190
And stab others in the back?

421
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,970
What do you mean running away?

422
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,750
Well, if you weren't running away,

423
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,740
did you have your reasons?

424
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,890
Yes, I have my reasons.

425
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:23,160
I supervise a cafeteria where over three hundred people come and go each day.

426
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,730
It's nowhere near easy to take care of someone else's three daily meals on top of that.

427
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,320
Even AlphaGo needs its rest.
 (AlphaGo is a computer program that plays the board game Go.)

428
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:36,770
So you think you're not getting compensated for your workload.

429
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,000
Is that what you're trying to say?

430
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,560
Compensated?

431
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:47,060
This person, just wait and see.

432
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:52,840
Did you just talk down to me?

433
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:56,430
You planned this from the start, didn't you?

434
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,070
It's monstrous to pretend not to know, is that it?

435
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:05,140
You should try it and you'd see how hard it is, intentionally pretending and acting childishly!

436
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,970
That's right, I remember everything.

437
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:11,960
I lied saying I didn't.

438
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,480
The resort, the wine,

439
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,010
the beach, the car. I remember everything!

440
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,920
Your coat? Yeah, I took it.

441
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,830
It was too awkward to carry it around, so... I threw it in a clothing recycle bin.

442
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,200
Look, Yoo Mi.

443
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,410
Do this, do that.

444
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,510
I hate this, I hate that.

445
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,990
I'm not your dog!

446
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,630
I'm a nutritionist, not your maid.

447
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,660
Work is work, and private is private!

448
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:54,450
I'm the nutritionist, and you're the general manager who's suffering from malnutrition!

449
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,880
Just eat what I make for you without making a fuss about it!

450
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:03,000
Wait. Stop right there.

451
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,040
Let me ask you something.

452
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,030
Why did you run away that day?

453
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,550
That's what you're curious about?

454
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:27,970
Tell me the reason.

455
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,570
Because it was a one-night stand!

456
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,100
♫  Ever since the day with the unbelievable moment  ♫

457
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,680
♫  In this world that is only filled with you  ♫

458
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,160
♫  I’m just alive and breathing  ♫

459
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:14,330
♫  I’m just alive and breathing  ♫

460
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,510
♫  I’ve never forgotten you even for a day  ♫

461
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:23,420
♫  Though you get faraway like a dream  ♫

462
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,100
♫  I trying catching you then letting you go  ♫

463
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:30,460
♫  I trying catching you then letting you go  ♫

464
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:35,780
♫  Sometimes, to the point of anger, to the point of hatred  ♫

465
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:40,050
♫  Sometimes, to the point of anger, to the point of hatred  ♫

466
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,850
♫  I get exhausted with this suffocating longing  ♫

467
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:47,920
♫  Tears fall, I keep missing you  ♫

468
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,060
♫  Tears fall, I keep missing you  ♫

469
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:56,100
♫  If it’s only one, it’s you  ♫

470
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:01,030
♫  Even the second, it’s you  ♫

471
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:03,370
♫  My one and only person, do you know it’s you?  ♫

00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:49,240
I'm Nutritionist Lee Yoo Mi.

476
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,310
I came just in case you would misunderstand,

477
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:57,740
but I didn't mean to send that to you.

478
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,950
- I meant to sent it to a friend.
- Ah.

479
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:07,550
So you take care of your friends' meals, as well. You're quite busy.

480
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:16,110
Please forgive me! If you could look away just this one time, I would be infinitely grateful.

481
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,570
I made a big mistake.
 #GeneralManager #IsTheGuy #FromThreeYearsAgo?

482
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,630
Are you happy? Can I leave now?
 #JustWaitAndSee #TheCoatIsGone

483
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:04,300
Well, it's all the same for me.

484
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:09,170
If you don't like the food, just pour salt!

485
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:29,290
This isn't something a person can eat, seriously.

My Secret Romance

487
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,180
So when do you think you'll go

488
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,400
You're not saying... That vegetable pancake scrap?

489
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,600
Scr... Scrap?

490
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,390
Let me ask just one thing. Why did you run away that day? Tell me.

491
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:49,660
I'm going to marry Jin Wook Oppa basically any day now.

492
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,250
Says who?

493
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,000
I only eat her food.

494
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,840
Why do I feel like there's he has an ulterior motive for the meal boxes?

495
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,670
General Manager, it's not that—

496
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:00,270
What. What, what? With me, what?

497
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,790
- Are you saying we should date?
- Excuse me?

498
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,540
What's with this ominous exclamation mark? Don't tell me...

499
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:07,030
Is there a problem here?
