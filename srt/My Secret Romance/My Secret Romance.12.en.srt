My Secret Romance

3
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,250
Episode 12
Relationships aren't for me

4
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,480
♫ My hands ♫

5
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:35,100
♫ are filling up ♫

6
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:42,870
♫ Even my dried up heart is wet ♫

7
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,600
♫ Calling to a new season ♫

8
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,620
♫ Even though I'm waiting, as if it's the end ♫

9
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:03,550
♫ So much that it stings my heart, you descend to me ♫

10
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,600
♫ When you sigh... ♫

11
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:10,950
Enjoy it.

12
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,910
Enjoy it.

13
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,730
Enjoy it.

14
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,480
I'm sorry for relocating so suddenly.

15
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:32,090
The new nutritionist has five years of experience, so she'll be much better than me.

16
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,130
I just got used to having you around.

17
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,640
Then, I'll prep for tomorrow's meals without issue.

18
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,850
But still, it's your last day. We should have a send-off party.

19
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,070
Should we?

20
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,890
Call (deal)!

21
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,170
I have an appointment.

22
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,160
Cancel it.

23
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,530
- Cancel it.
- Cancel it.

24
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,700
- Okay.
- Good job.

25
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,320
Nothing Is Easy

26
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:22,230
♫ Why are you doing this to me ♫

27
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:29,690
♫ What's wrong with my mind ♫

28
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:37,030
♫ When I close the eyes, and when I shut down my ears ♫

29
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,320
♫ I keep seeing him ♫

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,530
♫ I walk the street quietly ♫

31
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,030
If I said to dance, you'd dance.

32
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,640
Shall we?

33
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,940
- What are you doing?
- I'm dancing!

34
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,050
Ah, how common.

35
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,170
What's wrong with you? So embarrassing!

36
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,840
Stop it. Stop, stop.

37
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,580
Stop it.

38
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,820
♫ There's no easy thing ♫

39
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,380
♫ It's not like my mind ♫

40
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:29,160
♫ Love, that's a common word ♫

41
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,800
♫ I practice it every day ♫

42
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,290
♫ The words that linger in my mind without leaving my mouth ♫

43
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,310
♫ The words "I love you" are so difficult ♫

44
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,930
I wanted to be with you, even like this.

45
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,680
♫ Even one breath ♫

46
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,730
But why is there a blanket on the sofa?

47
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,600
That? I can't sleep too well at night.

48
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,540
♫ I see you ♫

49
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,260
I don't like sleeping alone.

50
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,440
And I don't like eating alone either.

51
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,890
♫ The words I practice every day ♫

52
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,580
♫ Those words that only I can't say ♫

53
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,350
♫ Nothing is easy ♫

54
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,810
♫ You don't have the same feelings I do ♫

55
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:33,610
♫ Even though love is a common word ♫

56
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,750
♫ I practice saying it every day ♫

57
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,080
Through the end, gosh.

58
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,200
♫ The words ♫

59
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,450
♫ that linger in my mind without leaving my mouth ♫

60
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,450
♫ My feelings ♫

61
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,210
How could you keep it from us so well?

62
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,790
You know how much I like him.

63
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,590
Feel backstabbed.

64
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,050
♫ Even myself ♫

65
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,060
Don't say something so useless.

66
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,480
I'm going to.

67
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:10,560
Hey.

68
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,600
Yoo Mi, I don't like you.

69
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,320
Okay. It's the last day.

70
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,620
The mood can't be like this.

71
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,380
Party tonight!

72
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,890
♫ One, two, three ♫

73
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,430
♫ When I look into your eyes, I'm a trouble maker ♫

74
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,510
♫ When I stand next to you, I'm a trouble maker ♫

75
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,610
♫ Little by little, more more more ♫

76
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,010
♫ As we go, more more more ♫

77
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,490
♫ Now even I can’t help my heart ♫

78
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,870
♫ You can’t forget me I’ll keep being in front of you even more ♫

79
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,050
Don't be awkward and do well at your new location.

80
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,760
♫ You can’t escape me ♫

81
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,450
♫ I will steal your lips ♫

82
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,980
Chef.

83
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,270
You've had a hard time because of me, right?

84
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,490
Well, for a newbie, you've improved a lot.

85
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,380
You did well.

86
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,340
♫ Trouble maker ♫

87
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,630
Nutritionist Lee Yoo Mi

88
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,690
Croquis

89
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,120
Candied Yams

90
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,150
Abalone Porridge

91
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:22,490
My mother likes abalone porridge.

92
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,060
She liked making it, too.

93
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,760
Next time, should we go and have some abalone porridge?

94
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,330
It's okay.

95
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,420
The taste won't be the same no matter where we go.

96
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,370
Abalone Porridge

97
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,090
Please have some.

98
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:07,920
Huh?

99
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,020
You said you didn't want to eat alone.

100
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,720
I'll stay here while you eat.

101
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,080
Beer & Book

102
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,310
What's going on, out of the blue,

103
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,490
going to some far countryside.

104
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:20,410
I heard the dorms are nice, and they provide all the meals, so it's nice financially.

105
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,380
But who's going to look after Dong Goo when I go out?

106
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:31,940
Mom. Don't bother Hyeon Tae with the excuse you're going out doing TV shows.

107
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,210
And look after him well, okay?

108
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,560
Is it totally over with that guy?

109
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,060
I had a good impression of him since he was visually my type, but he's no good.

110
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,700
Because of one scandal, a grown man is that nervous?

111
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,870
I'll go throw out the trash.

112
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,310
So frustrating.

113
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:55,740
♫ My hands are filling up ♫

114
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:05,290
♫ Even my dried up heart is wet ♫

115
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,930
♫ Calling to a new season ♫

116
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:18,020
♫ Even though I'm waiting, as if it's the end ♫

117
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:25,870
♫ So much that it stings my heart, you descend to me ♫

118
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,970
♫ When you sigh ♫

119
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,640
♫  I'll feel sad ♫

120
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:46,570
♫ The days getting more and more tough ♫

121
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,210
♫ I close my eyes in front of a lie ♫

122
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,860
We've managed to prevent the gossip and rumors from spreading any further.

123
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,220
Fine.

124
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,980
Lee Yoo Mi has relocated to the dining hall at a university in Daejeon.

125
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,960
I thought you should know.

126
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,880
Address: Daejeon, Dong-gu District...

127
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,490
Tell them to bring me all the documents to sign off on.

128
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,570
I will.

129
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,340
Please take care of me.

130
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,180
But I see that all the cooks are men here.

131
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,150
It's amazing.

132
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,170
Where did you say you worked?

133
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,960
At Daebok Group.

134
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,920
Office atmosphere is nothing compared to here.

135
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,640
Do you think you can manage three meals for kids with a huge appetite?

136
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,940
I'll do my best no matter...

137
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,900
Rather than that, I'll do well.

138
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,570
The band is not good.

139
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,290
Isn't there anything else?

140
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,260
There were some opinions about a skull pattern.

141
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,070
That's better. Change it to that, and make a whole new sample.

142
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,990
- Until tomorrow morning.
- Yes, sir.

143
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,420
- Hey, Astronaut.
- Yes?

144
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,470
Any other ideas?

145
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,580
The design is very good.

146
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,420
We hired a good employee.

147
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,750
You have to collect the meal tickets here, I said!

148
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,790
I'm sorry!

149
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,800
General Manager, what about lunch?

150
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,830
I don't feel like it.

151
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,560
Okay.

152
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,250
You can't take that much.

153
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,520
I gave you my meal ticket.

154
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,580
I'll enjoy it.

155
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,960
What's the menu today?

156
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,130
I don't know. I hope it's something good.

157
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,810
Get prepared to take over my position.

158
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,190
You told me not to dare dream of it before marriage.

159
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,820
Waiting for that to happen

160
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,030
I'll be in a coffin first.

161
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,380
First, just know that the announcement will be made.

162
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,580
I'll think about it.

163
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,030
For now, I won't push you to get married.

164
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,490
But if you want to have what you want, watch your actions.

165
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,220
If you get out of line, whether it's the company or anything else,

166
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,640
I'll hand it over to a management specialist, okay?

167
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:39,320
Follow Yourself, Follow Your Heart

168
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,400
Regular visit in 2017

169
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,420
Here.

170
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,510
Yes.

171
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:33,940
General Manager, should I order the bouquet?

172
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,600
It's already that time?

173
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,800
Yes.

174
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,430
Should I prepare it the same way as last year?

175
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,700
Yes, do that.

176
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,310
I will.

177
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,400
♫ I wanna know you ♫

178
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,600
♫ Not your blood type or sign ♫

179
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,390
♫ But the real you ♫

180
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,190
Think on it well.
♫ But the real you ♫

181
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,880
Whether she will have more days of laughter

182
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,330
or she will have more days of tears.

183
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,490
Your mom was the same.

184
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,530
Because of your greed, things could become harder for her only.

185
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,430
♫ Except your first lie and first love ♫

186
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:20,860
♫ I wanna know everything ♫

187
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,980
Lee Yoo Mi.

188
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,390
I didn't eat anything all day today.

189
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,890
I starved.

190
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:48,580
Daejeon Gwangyeok-si

191
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,020
There's no way he'd call.

192
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,740
I'm so shallow.

193
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,330
Yoo Mi.

194
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,830
You must be bored staying on campus all the time.

195
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,000
It is a little bit stifling.

196
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,550
I want to go see the ocean too, at times.

197
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,850
"Boss' Explicit Taste 2" came out, and I forgot to bring it.

198
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,750
Hey, be quiet.

199
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,590
Okay.

200
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,520
I heard you have a lot of customers these days.

201
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,580
Yeah, I knew this would happen. That's why I shouldn't have gone on TV.

202
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:33,030
What a lucky problem you have.

203
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,610
Why did you come down? I'll be up on the weekend.

204
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:43,910
Just because. I was driving after closing up shop and I ended up all the way here.

205
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,310
How can you go for a drive from Seoul to all the way here?

206
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,630
You missed me that much, huh?

207
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,010
But, are you okay?

208
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,730
I will be, I'm sure,

209
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,960
when that guy's doing just fine, too.

210
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,910
I will be okay soon, too.

211
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,810
I will be.

212
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,310
It's late. Will you be okay driving back?

213
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,290
- Lee Yoo Mi.
- Huh?

214
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,540
Do you know something?

215
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:22,010
I just found out recently. I like you.

216
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,280
What?

217
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,300
I found out I like you.

218
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,380
I don't know since when...

219
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,600
But I found out much too late.

220
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:42,920
I could have maybe won you over, but I was a step too late.

221
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,400
Hyeon Tae.

222
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,930
I just thought you should know. That's all.

223
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,740
It felt unfair to have to figure it out all by myself.

224
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,550
I'm sorry.

225
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,700
It's good enough that you know.

226
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,280
Just like a mechanical pencil.

227
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,800
I'll let it go just for today.

228
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,580
I'll get going.

229
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,550
Take care.

230
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,720
Ah, say ha.

231
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,960
You're here.

232
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,420
Yeah. I heard you got me on.

233
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,890
Thanks.

234
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,750
I heard you begged to the director saying what a hard time you were having.

235
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,580
I have to help at times like these.

236
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,390
Let's do well today, okay?

237
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,350
So annoying...

238
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,890
Let's try to earn a living properly, especially now with my daughter ousted.

239
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:53,850
Jang Kyeong Ae, your scene picking up the vegetable is really popular these days.

240
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,590
Oh, really?

241
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,730
There were a lot of outtakes for that one.

242
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,440
The lettuce has to stick right to the cheek.

243
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,480
It kept falling off.

244
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,800
It has to stick, right?

245
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,530
It dropped.

246
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:14,780
Now, Miss Jo Mi Hee, how long has it been since you've been on air?

247
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:20,710
I heard that you came raring to go. Is there a special reason?

248
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,840
I have a son who I had very late in age.

249
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,380
So I have to make a living as much as I am physically able to.

250
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,420
Then how old does that make him?

251
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,540
Three.

252
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,660
You're amazing.

253
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,700
If he's three, that's almost like your grandson's age.

254
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,760
Because of that, there is a funny story related to it.

255
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,950
You know the company Daebok?

256
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,490
The company that sells underwear?

257
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,720
Am I not allowed to say things like this?

258
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,870
If it's too much, we'll edit it out.

259
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:01,100
My daughter was dating the son of that company or whatever.

260
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,850
Daebok Group? Then isn't it that person?

261
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:09,860
The one who had a scandal with a news anchor recently?

262
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,850
C?

263
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,150
Oh, you know?

264
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,570
Cha Jin Wook!

265
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,220
Are you okay?

266
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,820
I'm okay. I'm fine.

267
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,120
If you keep this up, I'm going to

268
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,350
hand in my resignation.

269
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:49,220
If he dates one more time, it'll be the death of me.

270
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,070
Calling Jin Wook

271
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,420
Cha Jin Wook

272
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:59,450
It's not good for either of us for you to go in and out of here like this, no?

273
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,410
This.

274
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,550
What's that?

275
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:14,800
I heard you don't eat these days. I wanted you to eat while working.

276
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,200
Leave it.

277
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,290
I made it for you. I didn't buy it.

278
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:28,230
If you pass out again, your father will be worried, and I will be, too.

279
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,510
Hye Ri, I told you once before but—

280
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:47,410
I know that eating this doesn't mean you'll accept me.

281
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,440
I know that.

282
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:58,290
So eat up before you work. I'm just really worried about you.

283
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,920
Hello.

284
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,320
Hello.

285
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,110
She's my daughter.

286
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,080
Hi.

287
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,460
Yes.

288
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,660
I told you about Jin Wook, right?

289
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,720
Should we eat something?

290
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,800
Yes, should I order then?

291
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,030
Okay.

292
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,590
Do you want something to eat?

293
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,890
Jjajangmyeon.

294
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:29,100
Okay.

295
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,870
How is it?

296
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,970
Honestly?

297
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,980
Yeah.

298
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,910
You'll have to practice a lot.

299
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:10,390
What? So annoying. Don't eat it.

300
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,910
Eat a lot.

301
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,620
Do you know something?

302
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:31,480
Since the first time I saw you until now, you were 100% man to me.

303
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:44,150
You'll know when you get older.

304
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:50,360
In the world, there are tons of men who are a hundred times better than me.

305
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,060
I hope...

306
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,020
I hope that's true.

307
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,000
It's good.

308
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,370
Eat a lot.

309
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,660
Hmm, pork skin is so delicious.

310
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,580
Pork skin!

311
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,430
It's unexpected. You eating something like this.

312
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,350
What's wrong with pork rinds?

313
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,650
It tastes good, and for the face,

314
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,490
it's full of collagen and good for the skin, too.

315
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,370
It's totally my soul food.

316
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:22,180
I wanted a glass of soju,

317
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,000
but there was no one else to call, so I called you.

318
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,410
It's okay, right?

319
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,960
You were rejected. Right?

320
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,080
Me? I was?

321
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,800
I think I've been rejected over a hundred times.

322
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,460
But this is really the last time.

323
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,830
It's over now. The end.

324
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,690
Here have some.

325
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,490
You did well.

326
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,780
Cheers.

327
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:08,790
I was thinking about taking this chance to go on a trip alone.

328
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,840
To where?

329
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,900
Where? Where... of course,

330
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,190
wherever there are a lot of good-looking men.

331
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,920
I want to drive a guy crazy for once.

332
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,180
Why do you look at me like that?

333
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,710
Writer, let's be honest and speak candidly.

334
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,640
You've had that happen, right?

335
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,890
On a warm trip, with many strangers surrounding you,

336
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:46,930
with a woman you just met, you...

337
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,780
You have, right?

338
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,620
No comment on that one.

339
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,790
Wow. You did?

340
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:03,180
You did. You totally did. I'm the only one who hasn't.

341
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,290
I've been living a boring life all alone.

342
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,590
I'm going to live however I want from now on.

343
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:15,460
I'm going to go astray and do whatever.

344
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,650
How am I?

345
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:26,290
Do you want to go to Hong Kong with me?

346
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,790
What?

347
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,580
Why are you so surprised? I'm asking you to go to Hong Kong

348
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,780
to eat dim sum.

349
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,910
This woman, something bad could happen to you if you travel alone.

350
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,830
Huh? Why?

351
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,150
Why?

352
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,760
What happened?

353
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,480
I'll have some more to drink. Thank you.

354
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,400
Don't you have a boyfriend?

355
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,990
Pardon?

356
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,630
No. Well...

357
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:02,120
I guess you have someone you're kind of interested in.

358
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,640
You're at the age where you should be dating a lot.

359
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,980
It's not that.

360
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,340
Yes, Cha Jin Wook.

361
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,570
He came by thinking my son was his grandson.

362
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,630
And he caused a scene.

363
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:22,360
Wanted to check to be sure, even tried to pull out hair.

364
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,680
That horse-faceed old man didn't know anything!

365
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,350
Like he was putting my uterus down or something!

366
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,220
Well, that... Yes.

367
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,210
Then your daughter and he are...

368
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,490
Well, it's over.

369
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:41,010
She got cut from her job,

370
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:45,430
and she's away in another region working in the dining hall of a university.

371
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,420
Yoo Mi!

372
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,420
Yoo Mi?

373
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,360
University dining hall?

374
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:09,440
If you look at the sales, rather than the US,

375
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,800
it's selling better in Europe.

376
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,380
Keep going.

377
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,970
Here.

378
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,370
Her mother is an erotic actress.

379
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,050
Wow, really?

380
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,330
What the...

381
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:40,310
I heard that Joo Hye Ri cried because of that woman.

382
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,770
Really?

383
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,580
Like mother, like daughter.

384
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,550
You saw, right?

385
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,490
Yeah.

386
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,750
Wow.

387
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,060
It's that woman.

388
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,850
The one who's mom is an erotic actress?

389
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,420
Ridiculous.

390
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,750
Then your daughter and heare...

391
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,980
Well, it's over.

392
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:17,780
She got cut from her job and—

393
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:21,970
Father

394
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,130
You should just go.

395
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:29,890
Secretary Jang.

396
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:34,080
I'm saying it not as a secretary but as a hyung of 10 years, Jang Woo Jin.

397
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:38,960
Go get her. Or will you lose her again?

398
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,150
People always say something about how I dress.

399
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,020
It's out of fashion and strange, doesn't suit me, I'm an idiot. Do you think I don't know?

400
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,580
I know all of it but pretend to be okay, composed, and brave.

401
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,240
You just ignore it like that. Why?

402
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,460
Because it's something I like, what I want to do,

403
00:40:54,460 --> 00:41:00,050
and what... makes me happy.

404
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,090
Cha Jin Wook. You know

405
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,830
what I'm saying, right?

406
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,500
How dare you to your superior?

407
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,000
I'll be back.

408
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,990
Be strong, Jin Wook.

409
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,110
Do you know where Nutritionist Lee Yoo Mi is?

410
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:12,270
She left without a word, so we can't get in touch either.

411
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:22,190
A Proud...

412
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,860
The phone is off, so you'll be connected to voicemail.

413
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,930
After the beep—

414
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:50,840
Where did you go, Lee Yoo Mi?

415
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,120
Hey, you bastard.

416
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:24,000
Where is she?

417
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,900
I said, where is she?

418
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:37,360
♫ If it’s only one, it’s you ♫

419
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,280
♫ Even the second, it’s you ♫

420
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:49,880
♫ My one and only person, do you know it’s you? ♫

421
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,130
♫ I’m drawing you out ♫

422
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:59,280
♫ I’m shouting from here so you can hear ♫

423
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,240
♫ My last person, it’s you ♫

424
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:16,320
♫ My last person, it’s you ♫

425
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,600
Thank you.

Director.

437
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,720
Should I order a bouquet?

438
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,260
Oh.

439
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,890
It's that time already?

440
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,630
Yes.

441
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,630
Should I do the same as last year then?

442
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,220
Yeah, do that.

443
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:38,010
Okay.

#IMissYou #WantToSeeYou

446
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,590
I didn't eat anything today.

447
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,740
I starved.

448
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,430
Episode 12 Epilogue, Only one memory

449
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:19,570
I want to keep you in my heart as one name.

450
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,130
I'm sure there will be a lot of torment

451
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:34,440
But even if that torment makes me crazy

452
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:39,010
Until I go crazy

453
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,960
As that one name

454
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,550
I want to keep you in my heart.

455
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,330
As that one...

456
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,620
Just as that one name

457
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,330
I want to be remembered.

458
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,800
Even if I can't see him ever again

459
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:10,030
Memories

460
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,410
As a longing that never leaves,

461
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,680
will deeply root those feelings.

462
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,120
Even if it rains,

463
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,600
even if it's windy.

464
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,120
As that one name

465
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:37,730
I want to be remembered.

466
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,630
Three Pieces of Truth

467
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,830
You will leave now.

468
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,590
But please leave a piece of your heart.

469
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,980
Just that one piece

470
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,890
that you considered so precious.

471
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:05,480
Instead of a promise that you will return,

472
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,700
just take a piece of my heart.

473
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,680
It's a small piece,

474
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,580
that I hope will be remembered forever.

475
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:24,370
Because it's love I've been waiting for a very long time,

476
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,820
from now on, too,

477
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,400
it will be

478
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,610
the only love.

479
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,370
That one piece of memory.

480
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,100
I think I will live

481
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,590
while keeping it forever in my heart.

482
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:49,390
Because this love wasn't in vain, even if you keep living on.

483
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:50,970
And even if I am forgotten,

484
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,610
♫  I still don't know what love is  ♫

485
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:56,120
instead of tears,

486
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,290
I will send you off with a smile.

487
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:06,900
Still... Still.

488
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:12,980
A teardrop is...

489
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:17,070
For me who can love you with all of my being,

490
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:19,490
to you who gave me the ability to feel this way...

491
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:25,710
It's just...

492
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,630
out of gratitude.

493
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,240
My Secret Romance

494
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:37,050
There's nothing between him and me.

495
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:39,500
It's was just a one-night stand.

496
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,820
Hold onto her. If you make her cry again, it won't be over with just one punch.

497
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,850
You must have liked him a lot.

498
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:50,470
Even if I've now learned how to make abalone soup well, I can't make it for him.

499
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:54,220
♫  Every time you're feeling lonely  ♫

500
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,630
♫  You don't have to fight it all by yourself now  ♫

501
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,360
♫ You're with me  ♫

502
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:05,350
♫  We all need someone  ♫
