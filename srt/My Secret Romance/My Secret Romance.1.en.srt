My Secret Romance

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,400
My Secret Romance

3
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,110
Episode 1: Prologue to the Secret Romance

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,200
I heard you come here often. Am I right?

5
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,700
- Are you here?
- Yeah.

6
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,400
The atmosphere is terrible today. What's wrong with the music?

7
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,000
The DJ left because he had another club schedule.

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's Friday, so no one is available.

9
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,900
Wow, tonight's atmosphere is a complete failure.

10
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

11
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,400
Hey! What are you going to do?

12
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,200
I played with a girl who was a DJ in Spain.

13
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,700
Hey... did you learn it then?

14
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,400
No, I've learned something, but... You can do this with a feel.

15
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,800
Hey, are you the Grim Reaper?

16
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,870
Yoo Mi, you really came to a club dressed like this?

17
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,300
I was just coming back from the interview.

18
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,600
Ah, let's drink.

19
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,270
Sorry!

20
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,300
Ah... seriously!

21
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,150
- Hey! Shall we dance?
- Hurry up!

22
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,100
Are you getting hyped up? Jump!

23
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,400
Gosh, I shouldn't have come here. I shouldn't be clubbing right now.

24
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,080
No, it's okay. I'm sure I passed my interview today.

25
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,500
The vibe is good.

26
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,200
The people here aren't too shabby looking.

27
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,600
The alcohol tastes good, too.

28
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,600
Everything is good except for me.

29
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Okay! I should dance a little...

30
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,460
♫  That's right like a mad clown  ♫

31
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay! I'll dance a little...

32
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,500
♫  We are stuck together like glutinous rice cakes  ♫

33
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,000
♫  We will never be separated  ♫

34
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,720
♫  Squished, squished tightly together  ♫

35
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,210
♫  We will never be separated  ♫

36
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,920
♫  Sticky rice cakes  ♫

37
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,490
♫  Sticky rice cakes  ♫

38
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,400
What are those people doing over there?

39
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,200
Oh my goodness.

40
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,100
The man, with his long fingers

41
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,200
held the woman's small and narrow chin.

42
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,990
"You're prettier close up."

43
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,800
It's even more obvious when I look at you up close.

44
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,140
"Your eyes, nose and lips."

45
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,100
All perfect!

46
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,400
You got your eyes done,

47
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,900
you got your nose done,

48
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,030
and you slimmed down your chin.

49
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,300
You're making me blush.

50
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,100
Still, my breasts are mine.

51
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,300
I can't stand it any longer!

52
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,200
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry!

53
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,400
I told you to learn.

54
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,300
Work hard.

55
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,430
Where are you going? Play with me.

56
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,300
Sorry.

57
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,600
I have to feed my cat.

58
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,400
Cat?

59
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,500
Cat?!

60
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Aigoo, you scared me.

61
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,700
Ma'am, please cash me out.

62
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,200
I almost fainted.

63
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,100
Here. Take it.

64
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,200
- Here.
- Thank you.

65
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,700
Who the— Why are you here?

66
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,400
I was wondering if you had fainted.

67
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,000
- What is it?
- Chairman Cha is looking for you.

68
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,200
I'm nervous...

69
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,400
The Daebok Group's Heir and His Secret Love Affair

70
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,500
"Moonlit One Night Stand", forbidden love at an Itaewon Club involving Mr. C of the D Group. Actress Na Ae Ri rumored to be dating a man who seems to be a 2nd generation chaebol.

71
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,900
I'm jealous...
I was wondering whom he was dating.
Wow, he's handsome.

72
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,700
They look good together.
Let's investigate.
I want him.

73
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,890
They created a scandal out of this, I'm flattered.

74
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,500
It wasn't enough for you to frivolously spend my money so you tainted the conglomerate's image?

75
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,800
No, your company isn't even the first or second-largest conglomerate in the business world.

76
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,400
Pack your bags!

77
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,800
No, you don't have to pack yourself.

78
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,600
Travel down to one of my resorts. Go down there and learn about the company!

79
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,400
I don't want to.

80
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,000
- Yes, Chairman Cha. 
- Come here.

81
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,700
- Get him out of here right now.
- No, forget that!

82
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,200
Why are you embarrassing me like this?

83
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,500
Fine, I'll go. I'm going.

84
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,300
Where is it?

85
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,800
Focus on the ends.

86
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,400
Yeah.

87
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,700
That's right.

88
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,800
That's good.

89
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,900
Why don't you just burn the whole place down?

90
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,500
Haven't I told you countless times that controlling the temperature of the flame is one of the basics of cooking?

91
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,600
Yoo Mi, how many times did you fail?

93
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,700
Is this your third or fourth try?

94
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,540
It's a third.

95
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,800
If you fail again, think about transferring to another cooking academy.

96
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,200
Maybe this academy isn't a good match for you.

97
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,000
We're not the only cooking academy in neighborhood.

98
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Or really seriously consider another career path.

99
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes, I like those shapes.

100
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,700
Yeah.

101
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,800
It didn't come yet.

102
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
I don't think I can go.

103
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,740
Contract Expiration in 30 Days
-Joo In Baek -

104
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,590
I don't have time to go there—

105
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:05,300
Well, who told you to get married in Gangwon? Whatever! I'm not going!

106
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,020
I'm hanging up now.

107
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,230
Husband and Wife

108
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,800
Groom: Kim Young Han
Bride: Jo Mi Hee

109
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,000
Let's go.

110
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,400
Why do I have to take the shuttle bus when I have a car?

111
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,700
It's chairman's orders.

112
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,020
You're going to come with me anyway, so why can't—

113
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:00,190
''That punk is lacking in so many ways! Cut him off from everything!''

114
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,590
"Confiscate his money, credit cards, and car! Everything he has!"

115
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,400
That's what the chairman said.

116
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,700
Give me my car keys.

117
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,300
Oh, give me my car key! Hurry up!

118
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,600
What are you doing? Huh?

119
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
- Why the hell do I have to take this bus?
- Let's go.

120
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,320
Don't come any closer. I'm not kidding.

121
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,560
Don't come...

122
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,700
Hey, let go of me while I'm asking nicely.

123
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,500
Hey! Seriously, this is not it.

124
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,800
- I'm never going to let this go.
- Please reverse!

125
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,600
What do you mean by reverse?! The bus moves in this direction.

126
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,100
Damn it.

127
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,760
There are no seats left.

128
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,900
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

129
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,800
Geez...

130
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,600
- Thanks you!
- What?

131
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

132
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:36,190
Wow, this woman is seriously... Why are you...

133
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,400
The Boss' Explicit Taste

134
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,100
- We're leaving now, please take your seats.
- Okay!

135
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,800
Dear God.

136
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,100
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

137
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,700
The bus started moving so suddenly.

138
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,600
Excuse me.

139
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,600
How long are you going to sit here?

140
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,000
Excuse me...

142
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,290
Miss. Miss?

143
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,900
We have arrived. Please get off.

144
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,200
What the hell am I supposed to do here...

145
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,900
That woman, until the very end...

146
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
So...

147
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,790
You want me to be a bellhop at this resort?

148
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,900
Me? Cha Jin Wook?

149
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,930
After you get changed, the general manager will let you know about your duties.

150
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,500
You must always put on a friendly smile.

151
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,230
He must be crazy.

152
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,620
After doing this to me,

153
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,700
Do you think you can handle the consequences?

154
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,600
That decision is always up to the person in question.

155
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,300
I'll give you ten minutes.

156
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,400
Ach, really... Why I have to wear it?

157
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,300
Nine minutes and 53 seconds, 52 seconds, 51 seconds, 50 seconds...

158
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,070
Seriously...

159
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,200
Why I have to wear it?

160
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,200
Hey!

161
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,100
''Hey''?

162
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,500
I didn't work out to use my muscles for cleaning.

163
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,870
- Go.
- Then I'll—

164
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,800
Go!

165
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,900
I'll do it myself.

166
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,700
Hey!

167
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,500
But...why aren't you cleaning?

168
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,680
Why do you keep calling me "hey"?

169
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,030
You're doing it on purpose, aren't you?

170
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,400
We're supposed to help each other, right?

171
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
I'm enjoying the sun!

172
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,600
Then rest well.

173
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,920
Geez, Secretary Jang.

174
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,500
I'm thirsty.

175
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
May I have something to drink?

176
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
I'll bring you. Coffee? Juice?

177
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,100
Juice. Freshly squeezed.

178
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,900
Yes.

179
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,900
Well... that was fast.

180
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,200
Juice!

181
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,760
General Manager!

182
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,100
Good afternoon.

183
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,800
It's time for you to work.

184
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,400
Don't you know we're hosting a wedding this afternoon?

185
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,810
Not now.

186
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,540
I'm playing a very important round.

187
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,900
Do you want me to report you to the chairman?

188
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,600
Would that make you get up?

189
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,200
Okay!

190
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,900
I'll go. I'm going.

191
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,890
Did I fail?

192
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,640
No way.

193
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,600
Can you check it again?

194
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,900
I did so well in my interview.

195
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,200
They loved me...

196
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,800
Yes. All right.

197
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,600
Yoo Mi.

198
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,000
Why do you live?

199
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,910
Let's just die.

200
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,000
Die!

201
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Really! Ah!

202
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,000
What a joke.

203
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,800
I have to find my car quickly.

204
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,700
Oh, my daughter, you're here!

205
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,400
Hey! What on earth are you wearing?

206
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,600
Is it my wedding or my funeral today?

207
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,580
You said you can't come.

208
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,100
I came here thinking it would be your last wedding.

209
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,670
I won't be at your third one.

210
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,150
I'll be around 60 years old

211
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,200
when I marry a third time.

212
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,000
I'll be sexy then too,

213
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,900
don't you agree?

214
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,200
Don't take it seriously. You're scaring me.

215
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,500
But...

216
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,100
by any chance...

217
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,700
did you come alone?

218
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,200
Didn't you have anyone to come with?

219
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,700
You should have brought Hyun Tae, at least.

220
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,230
Remarrying isn't anything to brag about,

221
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,900
and now is not the time for me to be dating, Mom.

222
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,800
Yeah, who cares if you don't have anyone? We can catch one here.

223
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,900
First off...

224
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,800
Take off that Grim Reaper's clothes.

225
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,300
- Shall we go?
- Who are you?

226
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,900
Go inside. Go on, hurry!

227
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,400
Mom... I'm suffocating.

228
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,800
A size 55 is tight on you?

229
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,090
Put up with it for a short while.

230
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,990
The ceremony won't take long.

231
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,800
Just give me back my clothes.

232
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,170
You had better not take that off.

233
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,530
You won't be my daughter anymore—!

234
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,410
We forgot the most important part.

235
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,800
Excuse me.

236
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,400
Please bring it out.

237
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
What's this?

238
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,300
The source of my confidence.

239
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,140
That's okay.

240
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,000
- Come here!
- Mom!

241
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,420
- You better not take these out!
- I won't, I won't!

242
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,500
Now, the bride and groom

243
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,700
will read their love letters.

244
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,300
Gosh, she's really getting married.

245
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,000
To my other half, Mi Hee.

246
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,700
First of all, I'd like to say thank you to all who came here all the way

247
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:26,200
to congratulate us on our special wedding day.

248
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,200
It took a lot of time to find my true love.

249
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,050
And it seems...

250
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,150
like the heavens

251
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,200
finally gave me my other half.

252
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,380
It's all still in my memory.

253
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,800
This is really good.

254
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,500
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

255
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,500
- One more plate, please.
 - Thanks to her,

256
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,250
Yes.
- Thank you. 
- my life, which was like a black-and-white movie,

257
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,360
has been upgraded to full HD color.

258
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,400
Every moment with her is so precious and happy.

259
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,760
In my life, that was barren like a desert,

260
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,190
this beautiful woman bloomed like a flower,

261
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,310
and I will love and cherish her forever. Your beauty...

262
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,200
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
 - In order to shine more

263
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,100
I will love you passionately...

264
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,600
- One more plate, please.
- Yes.

265
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,100
Excuse me.

266
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,200
One more plate.

267
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,700
She already ate three plates. Where does it all go?

268
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,500
Hey, there!

269
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,600
Take this to the kitchen.

270
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,700
''Hey, there''?

271
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,000
Go. You–

272
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,900
You'll find a car out front.

273
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,500
After you empty the tank,

274
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,200
report it to me.

275
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,170
Then what about the car keys?

276
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,330
Keep it with you.

277
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,500
Ah, and...

278
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,400
Never give it to anyone else.

279
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,120
I understand.

280
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,500
Now,

281
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,400
the bride and groom will present their special memories in a slideshow presentation.

282
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,800
Now, I want you all to look at the screen.

283
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Jo Mi Hee ♡ Kim Young Han

284
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,300
You're so cool! You look so charismatic.

285
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,500
You were beautiful too.

286
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,400
- You were so cute.
- I was?

287
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,200
The bride looked like an actress.

288
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,600
She was an actress.

289
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,500
You know, in the old days... She was an erotic actress.

290
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,880
- Really?
- Yes!

291
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,380
What is that?

292
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,160
It's Going to Explode

293
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,800
Hey, her mom is an erotic actress.

294
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,160
- What? Really?
- Wow!

295
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,400
What was the title of the movie...

296
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,100
- ''It's Going to Explode''?
- Oh!

297
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,700
But her breasts are really big!

298
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,900
Didn't you decide to take that photo out?

299
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,600
It's a shame. Those were my golden days.

300
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,900
It's okay.

301
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,020
What are you doing here?

302
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:59,920
- Pardon?
- Why aren't you working?

303
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,220
I'm working.

304
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,700
- What are you doing right now?
- Pardon?

305
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,190
The man should do it.

306
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,000
- Thank you.
- I'm working, see?

307
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,900
I know you don't want to work here, but

308
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,900
at least, you shouldn't harm anyone else.

309
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,400
I already told you,

310
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,880
it was an accident.

311
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,930
How could I dodge a woman who was running like an enraged bull?

312
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,470
Mr. Cha!

313
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,400
What...

314
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,150
Do I look like I'm kidding now?

315
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,270
No, but...

316
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,100
I fell too. My arm hurts

317
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,500
and my leg hurts.

318
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,670
Yes, yes.

319
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,200
I understand.

320
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,530
I made a mistake. Happy?

321
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,100
If you know that you made a mistake, apologize her.

322
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,700
To our customer who was mistaken for an enraged bull.

323
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,790
Wait.

324
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:21,400
Really. Why are you doing this to me?

325
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,120
I'm sure you're well aware

326
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,180
of where you'll be sent to if I fire you.

327
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,900
Then.

328
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,110
Mom, are you crazy?

329
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:45,450
It's not like you were a supermodel or Miss Korea. You were an erotic actress! Is that something to brag about?

330
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,620
Did you feel like you would burst if you didn't show off for a second?

331
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,400
If you're so proud of it, watch it by yourself.

332
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,710
No... You can watch it, on your first night with your new husband!

333
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,230
It'd be a waste for me to watch it alone! What of it?

334
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,820
Really? If it's such a waste,

335
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,260
Then, should I use a nude photo for your funeral services?

336
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,900
Look at what you're saying.

337
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,200
Why are you so desperate for your mother to die?

338
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,100
Mom, you have no idea. You don't know how much I...

339
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,810
Aren't you embarrassed at all?

340
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,750
Please act your age!

341
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,980
I want to tell you the same thing.

342
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,370
You should meet a handsome man while you're young and beautiful

343
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,530
and experience a passionate romance.

344
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:31,570
But instead, you're still making me sad.

345
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,660
This brat, really...

346
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,100
Why does she have to do this on her mother's wedding day?

347
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,120
You should be more understanding of her.

348
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,430
I understand her.

349
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,470
What?!

350
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,370
Honey,

351
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,630
it's our honeymoon today.

352
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,590
Did you forget what we planned to do?

353
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,200
I don't know.

354
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,740
I'm crazy.

355
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,700
I must have come here to torture myself.

356
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,040
Hello.

357
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,740
Come here.

358
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,490
- Give me that.
- Pardon?

359
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,940
Give it to me.

360
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,800
I can't.

361
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,300
Are you crazy?

362
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,800
- Do you want to be fired?
- No.

363
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,520
Here you go.

364
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,300
- Work hard.
- Yes!

365
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,440
- Hey.
- Yes.

366
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,190
- Take it off.
- My clothes?

367
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,100
Take it off quickly. I'm tired.

368
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,200
Who is it?

369
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,300
What is this?

370
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,540
I didn't order room service.

371
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,300
Excuse me.

372
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,190
I didn't order room service.

373
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,390
It's free.

374
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:32,880
I don't care if it's free, so can you get out?

375
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,600
You wouldn't say that if you knew how much this wine cost.

376
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,860
Get out.

377
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,350
Before I report you.

378
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,070
Fine.

379
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,690
I'm here to apologize for what happened earlier.

380
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,350
Then do it.

381
00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:00,820
You said you're here to apologize, so do it.

382
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,140
Is this what overextending one's authority looks like?

383
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:03,870
What did you say?

384
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,760
If you want my apology, you should apologize to me first.

385
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,380
Well...

386
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,360
Why should I?

387
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,070
Don't you remember me?

388
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,850
On the bus?

389
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,870
Who jumped into the cart like an enraged bull?

390
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,960
What? An enraged bull?

391
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,930
Hey, are you done?

392
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:58,600
No! I have a lot more to say. But I thought it'd hurt my mouth if I tried.

393
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,670
Then.

394
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
No, that guy really...

395
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,400
Hey!

396
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,100
Hey there.

397
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,800
You should check the rooms to see if they've been cleaned after guests have checked out.

398
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,600
Come here.

399
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:24,260
- I'm leaving early.
- Early? Are you sick?

400
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,430
Go.

401
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,600
You should rest when you're sick.

402
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,900
That... That person, what is that?

403
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,500
My car keys.

404
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,910
Who jumped into the cart like an enraged bull?

405
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,700
The more I think about it, the more annoying this gets.

406
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,360
An enraged bull?

407
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,200
Who does he think he is?

408
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,430
It's annoying.

409
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,100
I'm more annoyed because he is handsome!

410
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,200
This is good

411
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,200
''You wouldn't say that if you knew how much this wine cost.''

412
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,800
What a joke, seriously! I'll let it go,

413
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,400
because it's really good.

414
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,940
Excuse me!

415
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,970
Open the door!

416
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,900
Excuse me!

417
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,400
Save me!

418
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,800
Excuse me!

419
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,500
Excuse me!

420
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,000
Excuse me.

421
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,900
- Excuse me!
- What the hell? Hey!

422
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,850
- Give it to me.
- What else? I gave you your car keys.

423
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,340
The master key, you punk!

424
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,000
Hurry!

425
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,860
Hey, come on.

426
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,700
Hey! Look for her! Hurry!

427
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,400
Damn it. It's making me crazy.

428
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:29,850
What is it?

429
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,720
Move! Oh!

430
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,890
Blood! Blood, blood.

431
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,100
Wh-What is it?

432
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,000
What is it?

433
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,300
What is it?

434
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,100
- What the hell is this?
- Is this 911?

435
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,700
- Excuse me! Hey!
- Someone is dying here. Just come quickly!

436
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,400
Hey! Hey! Hey!

437
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,750
Lift her up.

438
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,190
- She's heavy.
- Ah, seriously.

439
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,570
Aish!

440
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,370
Open the door!

441
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,970
Please be alive.

442
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,900
Hurry!

443
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,110
- What happened?
- She collapsed on the bathroom floor.

444
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,000
Excuse me.

445
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,890
Can you hear me?

446
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,140
Are you okay? Are you okay?

447
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Excuse me. Can you hear me?

448
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Do you have feeling?

449
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,900
He flew all the way over there.

450
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,200
So embarrassing!

451
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,000
What the hell are you?

452
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,700
How many times has it been today?

453
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,470
Why do you keep approaching me?

454
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,490
Hey, when did I ever approach you?

455
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:30,560
Why were you lying on the bathroom floor like that?

456
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,430
Soap bubbles. The floor was slippery.

457
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:40,970
You should have told me you were okay when I carried you out!

458
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:44,640
I was going to tell you, but people were so desperate—

459
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,170
Okay, let's say it's embarrassing.

460
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,410
Well, you should be good at acting until the end.

461
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:53,320
You humiliated me by laughing in front of all those people!

462
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,300
Mr. Smile!

463
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,490
And what about you?

464
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,600
Why are you coming into someone else's room?

465
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,050
You asked me to help you.

466
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,590
Annoying...

467
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:13,300
Why did you bring me that?

468
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,750
Why can't I...

469
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,320
simply bathe whenever I want?

470
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,170
Why can't I...

471
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:32,000
even make Korean meatballs properly?

472
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,220
Why doesn't anything go my way?

473
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,190
Are you all right?

474
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,370
What did you say?

475
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,240
You look fine because you're a good speaker.

476
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,070
If you came here to have a good time, don't worry about others and just enjoy it.

477
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,200
Don't be so gloomy.

478
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,540
He's totally jacked.

479
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,940
He has such broad shoulders.

480
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,400
If you came here to have a good time, don't worry about others and just enjoy it.

481
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,400
Don't be so gloomy.

482
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,600
Wow, these tangerines are so perfectly ripe!

483
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,600
Thank you. Oh, well. Thank you for your hard work today.

484
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,300
Go inside. Yes.

485
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,400
Happy birthday.

486
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,400
We are not able to serve parties of one person.

487
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:24,830

Your cat? Your cat?!

00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,900
He's cute.

Blackey!

511
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,800
I told you not to come home!

512
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,600
Why, why, why...

Get a hold of yourself, Lee Yoo Mi.

521
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,600
It's not like that.

522
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,820
Good job!
