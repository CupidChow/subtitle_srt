My Secret Romance

3
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,640
♫  Love love love is so good ♫

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,510
♫  Love love love is so good ♫

5
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,910
♫  Even if you don’t say it ♫

6
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,600
♫  The sensual feeling of knowing ♫

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,540
♫  Love love love is so sweet ♫

8
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,410
♫  Love love love is so sweet ♫

9
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:03,050
♫  Milky lattes and pretty blankets that make you sleep ♫

10
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:11,310
Episode 6: I've Heard It.

11
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,700
The patterns are becoming flashier.

12
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,020
I'll take that as a compliment.

13
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,370
What is that?

14
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,490
This? I want to read this while waiting.

15
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,450
Miss Good Morning— Someone recommended it to me because it's interesting.

16
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,390
On the Road to Europe

17
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,940
On the Road to Europe

18
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,530
You are the General Manager at Yoo Mi's company right?

19
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,750
You should go back now.

20
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,680
In the neighborhood he's well known for his looks.

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,230
So he's a petty writer.

22
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,730
Is he someone you know?

23
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,550
I have made a dinner reservation after the meeting with the Royal Mall.

24
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,880
The location is at the VIP level—

25
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,890
- Cancel the reservation.
- What?

26
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,750
After the meeting, I'll come back to the company. I'm going to eat my lunchbox.

27
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,400
You should return my book before you leave—

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,150
Damn it.

29
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,150
General Manager Cha.

30
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,430
I was told he isn't having dinner today, so why this all of a sudden?

31
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,340
Dinner might be just an excuse to fulfill his real objective.

32
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,310
Nutritionist Lee, we'll be leaving first.

33
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,390
Today too you all worked hard.

34
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,780
We almost got a complaint because we ran out of pickled cucumber kimchi.

35
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,320
Where is your mind at when you're working?

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,190
I'm sick and tired.

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,210
Did something bad happen to her?

38
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,960
It must be her spinal disc again.

39
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,880
Disc?

40
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,500
It's tiring when you're standing for a long time.

41
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,280
She won't get surgery because of work, and she's the head of the household, so she can't quit either.

42
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,810
So please be understanding of her.

43
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,990
We'll head off now.

44
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,810
See you tomorrow.

45
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,430
Goodbye.

46
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,380
Bye.

47
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,820
Oh, right. The lunchbox.

48
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,130
It's rice ball filled with minced meat.

49
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,560
It was so sudden, so I used what I had—

50
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,090
Alright, I understand. You can leave.

51
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,450
Cha Jin Wook

52
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,080
It looks delicious.

53
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,020
- Yes?
- Hey.

54
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,670
I thought you got off work. Why aren't you here?

55
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,230
I'm about to go crazy because of Three Meals a Day Jerk.

56
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,730
How many times is this that he wanted me to bring additional packed meal?

57
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,900
This is the second dinner. Does this make sense?

58
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,060
Is he really human?

59
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:47,640
Anyway, I'm running late catering to his appetite.

60
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,450
I have to cancel on the Han River outing with you.

61
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,700
Then should I come to pick you up?

62
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,010
Really?

63
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,160
You'll come pick me up?

64
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,610
Um, I'll call you a bit later.

65
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,660
Is someone coming to pick you up?

66
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,460
Um, no...

67
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,880
But is there something you need?

68
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,960
I'm hungry.

69
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,930
What?!

70
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,850
For the menu...

71
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,600
I think ramen is fine.

72
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,780
Wow.

73
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,260
Yoo Mi hasn't come in yet? Weren't you three going out for fun?

74
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,820
She's busy today.

75
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,360
Is that so?

76
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,230
Then should we close the shop and have a drink?

77
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,270
I don't know if it's the cold breeze. I'm feeling a bit sentimental.

78
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,830
I'm sorry. Yesterday I drank too much with my friends

79
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,370
I'll step out to get some air for a while.

80
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,220
Okay.

81
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,010
Are they flirting with each other?

82
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,820
Jeong Hyeon Tae, why did you do that yesterday?

83
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,010
Then do you stand by and do nothing while your friend is being bothered by a guy?

84
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,230
Is that really all there is?

85
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,600
I don't know either.

86
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:45,230
I thought it was too quiet lately.

87
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:52,060
When was it that I almost got fired because all day long he wouldn't eat anything? Does he have a beggar in his stomach?

88
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,550
What did he ever do right to deserve this?

89
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,420
What am I doing right now?

90
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,750
All I have to do is make a bowl of ramen but what? beef broth?

91
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,700
Today you must have had a ton of work to do

92
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,190
seeing how your appetite is quite large.

93
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,900
I have a lot of work but I'm hungry

94
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,160
so I can't seem to focus.

95
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,660
Oh, right, the trivet.

96
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,530
Just a minute.

97
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,710
I have one. The trivet.

98
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,030
What are you doing not putting it down?

99
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,590
This book. Is this Hyeon Tae's—

100
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,930
This is my secretary's, and the thickness is just right

101
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,110
as a trivet for that pot.

102
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,420
Have a seat. Wait untill I finish eating.

103
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,550
No, I have to prepare to go home.

104
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,960
When you are done please return the dishes by the exit.

105
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,400
Have a seat.

106
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,090
You seem like you had date plans.

107
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,200
Were they ruined because of me?

108
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,760
General Manager Cha.

109
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,490
I'm asking you to just make sure.

110
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,020
Is the reason you had dinner three times today

111
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,240
because of the person who wrote this trivet?

112
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,100
Lee Yoo Mi.

113
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,620
Do I seem like someone who really doesn't have anything to do?

114
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,940
N-No.

115
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,430
The noodles will get bloated.

116
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,450
Lee Yoo Mi.

117
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,860
I have something to confirm.

118
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
What?

119
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,040
♫ It’s getting weirder, my heart  ♫

120
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,900
♫ You’re not even my ideal type  ♫

121
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:35,530
♫  It’s getting weirder, the way I see things are changing  ♫

122
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:40,200
♫  They say that’s how love comes ♫

123
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,650
Um, I need to get some water—

124
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,760
Those habitual hiccups you have.

125
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,700
I think I know what meaning they hold.

126
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,920
What are you talking about I don't really—

127
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,300
Your hiccups.

128
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,240
They only happen with me right?

129
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,340
Why? Do I make you nervous?

130
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:55,720
Hiccups are just a normal physical response when the diaphragm contracts.

131
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,750
How can someone as smart as you not know about hiccups?

132
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,900
I'm sure that's not what I'm asking about.

133
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,630
It's not because of being nervous, but it's because I'm uncomfortable.

134
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,020
Y-You are uncomfortable?

135
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,310
With what? Me?

136
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:19,320
Yes. You don't know how uncomfortable you make people.

137
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,420
When I see you, the past I want to forget keeps coming back to me.

138
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:28,460
So it's really, really— No, extremely uncomfortable.

139
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,890
Lee Yoo Mi.

140
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,300
I have given you an answer right?

141
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,190
I'll take my leave then.

142
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,960
I don't think it fits your hand.

143
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,140
Did you run away?

144
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,820
Seriously...

145
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,000
Here I found your doll.

146
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,220
Three Meals a Day Jerk is doing all kind of things to annoy you.

147
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,320
Dong Goo, wind down your playing and come up. It's bedtime.

148
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,360
Bye.

149
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,120
Boss. Who is this child?

150
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,200
Is he your nephew?

151
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,820
He's my son.

152
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,600
Isn't that right my son?

153
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,360
Your sister must be in a bad mood.

154
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,650
Won't you turn that off?

155
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:11,810
What's wrong? Those were my most brilliant years.

156
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,460
Turn it off before I burst!

157
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,020
Hey, you're old enough to face this kind of content. Why distance yourself?

158
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,590
Do you know how difficult my life was because of that?

159
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,200
What are you talking about?

160
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,390
If I told you, would you even understand?

161
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,090
Her temper is getting worse and worse.

162
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,190
It's all because she hasn't been dating.

163
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,260
Hiccups are just a normal physical response when the diaphragm contracts.

164
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,060
Whenever I see you, the past I want to forget comes to mind.

165
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,540
It's extremely uncomfortable.

166
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,000
That's what I should be saying.

167
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,750
I keep seeing it.

168
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,030
It's bitter.

169
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,270
It's the first time I'm having a drink in three years.

170
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,290
What is a nutritionist doing, just drinking alcohol by itself.

171
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,920
Eat this.

172
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,890
Sausage stick. At least eat this.

173
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,150
Try to understand your mother.

174
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,230
You know she is very different from others.

175
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,980
Until when?

176
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,240
How much more?

177
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,670
Until when and how much more do I have to understand her?

178
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,390
You know about the incident in high school.

179
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,580
From then till right now,

180
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,860
I tried so hard to understand her.

181
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,020
But my mom always did whatever she wanted.

182
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,800
She shows up out of the blue and screws everything up.

183
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,410
No matter how hard I try to understand her,

184
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,960
It's Going to Burst

185
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,100
What's with the tape when there are many video clips online?

186
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,560
It's because my Mom locked my computer from adult content.

187
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,660
Her mom's in an erotic movie.

188
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,880
I saw it. I saw it.

189
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,400
- Do you know her?
- I knew it.

190
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,320
Her mom is an erotic actress!

191
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,380
It was from that moment.

192
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,220
Whether it's my clothes or dating,

193
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,380
I am unable to do what I want

194
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,990
This is all because of her.

195
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,430
Why did it have to be that resort?

196
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:18,210
If she hadn't held her wedding ceremony there...

197
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,460
And I didn't do it anywhere else, but

198
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,450
it was in a car

199
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,720
in the middle of the night.

200
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,350
If it wasn't for my mom,

201
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,500
I wouldn't have gone that far with Three Meals A Day.

202
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,240
Hey, what the heck are you saying? You drank too much.

203
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,060
Let's go home.

204
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:56,790
If I hadn't done that, then maybe things would've been different.

205
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,190
What the hell am I doing?

206
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,510
Yoo Mi. Yoo Mi.

207
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,410
You can't sleep here.

208
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,200
Yoo Mi?

209
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,150
Hey, why did you book me for an interview?

210
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,220
I have so many meetings.

211
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,110
It was the chairman's order.

212
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,350
The chairman?

213
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,680
But this will help us promote our brand and

214
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,250
I don't think it's bad.

215
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,930
Are you feeling unwell?

216
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,710
No, I just feel stuffy.

217
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,560
- Tell them to wrap it up within one hour.
- I understand.

218
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,080
Oh, Hyeon Tae.

219
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,150
Did you get home safely yesterday?

220
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:43,720
Why would you come pick me up? Don't you work too?

221
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,000
Alright.

222
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,890
See you later.

223
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,050
General Manager.

224
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,090
Aren't you coming?

225
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,620
Go and tell the nutritionist...

226
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,260
Packed lunch for a group?

227
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,780
General Manager Cha would like you to make lunch for the broadcasting staff.

228
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,680
For ten people.

229
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,390
Why do I have to prepare lunch even for the staff?

230
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,980
"Because that's what I want,"

231
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,720
is what he said.

232
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,200
And as for the dinner, there is a meeting with the branding team.

233
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,210
So you must prepare dinner for them as well.

234
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,150
For 20 people.

235
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,760
If there are that many people you should just order delivery.

236
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,640
That's probably not possible, right?

237
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,480
Delivery probably won't be possible.

238
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,570
Yes, I understand.

239
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:57,340
The General Manager is playing the push and pull game very aggressively.

240
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,840
Joo Hye Ri, you did this, didn't you?

241
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,930
Well, I thought I needed to make at least this excuse to see your face.

242
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:19,460
But you look really good today. Just as I thought, you are my man.

243
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,470
Right?

244
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,350
What do you mean your man? I'm mine.

245
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,850
I'm here to do work so let's just get to work, Joo Hye Ri.

246
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,410
Thank you for giving us your time.

247
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:34,150
I heard that you're very busy, but you immediately cleared your schedule when Hye Ri called you.

248
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,440
But, What's the relation between you two?

249
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,330
Oh, the truth is he's my boy—

250
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,470
We're siblings.

251
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,030
She's someone who's like a younger sister to me.

252
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,620
I was really busy when she called.

253
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:55,600
Let's have a meal together after we're done, our company prepared packed lunches.

254
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,560
Company? Did you perhaps ask that nutritionist?

255
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,020
Okay, let's get started.

256
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,680
Start.

257
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:18,070
I told you very clearly in the beginning, you have to do your work yourself whether you fail or succeed.

258
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,590
Yes, that's right but...

259
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:24,980
But it'll be hard for Nutritionist Lee to make ten portions by herself.

260
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,970
Then you're saying we should stop making lunch for the employees and make lunchboxes?

261
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,520
No, we shouldn't do that.

262
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,720
I'm sorry for requesting a difficult favor.

263
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,000
I'll take care of it myself.

264
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,780
To make the best fit for men using 3D technology

265
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,490
and making the best underwear only for men.

266
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:05,120
That's our brand's motto.

267
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,450
What do you think your secret was in becoming the top brand within three years of launch?

268
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,080
Secret?

269
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,880
It was me, Cha Jin Wook.

270
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,850
I neither slept nor ate.

271
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,470
This outcome is the result of my blood and sweat.

272
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,420
Nutritionist Lee, I'm sorry I can't help you.

273
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,870
That's okay, thanks.

274
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:52,910
It's lunchtime soon, i'll be back after I deliver this.

275
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,860
Nutritionist Yoo Mi, fighting!

276
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,020
You must not have time to date as you're too busy.

277
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,030
No.

278
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:11,600
I dated a lot in my younger years so I don't miss it much.

279
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,390
I see.

280
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:18,100
But shouldn't you think about marriage at your age?

281
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,320
I'm not sure.

282
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:27,310
Cha Jin Wook, can I ask you a direct question?

283
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,690
No.

284
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,780
I'll just ask one.

285
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,230
No, don't do that.

286
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,500
I'll just ask one.

287
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,270
No, don't do it.

288
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,660
What do you think about me?

289
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,420
I told you they're dating.

290
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,320
Wow! As expected, Joo Hyeri's on another level.

291
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,900
Okay, only till here.

292
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,160
I think we have enough content for the show.

293
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,460
I think we can record my closing statement separately.

294
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,490
You worked hard.

295
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,230
Okay, let's do that.

296
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,300
All of you worked hard.

297
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,890
- You worked hard.
- You worked hard.

298
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,310
Who are you?

299
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:28,190
I came to deliver your lunches.

300
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,940
Lunch is here! That's perfect, I was hungry.

301
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,350
Lunch is here!

302
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,420
Please enjoy.

303
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,160
Yes, go ahead.

304
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,100
Please have some.

305
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,320
I want to eat this one.

306
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,760
Come here.

307
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,700
Don't eat a piece of bread when you're hungry, let's eat rice.

308
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,820
There are fruits too, how nice.

309
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,560
Nice!

310
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,030
Thank you.

311
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,170
What is this?

312
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,360
I prepared all of this.

313
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,780
This was the least I could do to thank you for making time for us.

314
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,980
You really...

315
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:00,680
Gosh, what do I do? I must have lost it. You coming...

316
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,760
I forgot about that.

317
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,780
What do I do? I'm so sorry.

318
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,190
I must've lost my mind.

319
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,820
This won't do. Let's just all eat what you brought as well.

320
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,710
It looks delicious, it must be delicious.

321
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,140
No, that's alright.

322
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,480
Then, I'll get going now.

323
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,850
You worked hard Nutritionist Lee.

324
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:33,280
If you leave like this, what about me? The PD and writer are here.

325
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,120
What will they think if you leave like this? Eat and then leave.

326
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,960
Joo Hye Ri.

327
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,040
I will let it go since this is your field but be considerate.

328
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,090
Please.

329
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,800
I'm furious.

330
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,020
It was an accident.

331
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,310
I didn't do it on purpose.

332
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,810
General Manager.

333
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,650
I'm really sorry.

334
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:27,520
What are you doing right now?

335
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,120
Let me apologize sincerely

336
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,570
for ruining your proposal.

337
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:40,150
What are you talking about? Proposal?

338
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,310
The jewelry box.

339
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:48,820
You're angry because I destroyed the present you prepared for Joo Hye Ri.

340
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:56,040
Once again, I apologize sincerely.

341
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:18,650
♫  Nothing is easy, you don't have the same feelings as I do  ♫

342
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:22,730
♫  Even though love is an easy word  ♫

343
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,920
Don't cry.

344
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,240
Don't you dare cry Lee Yoo Mi.

345
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,050
It makes it seem like I have feelings for him if I cry.

346
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:36,240
Never.

347
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,490
Not even little.

348
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,760
Not even a tiny bit.

349
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,630
Joo Hye Ri

350
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,720
General Manager.

351
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,250
What are we going to do with that?

352
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,590
You can't catch up.

353
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,500
What are you saying?

354
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,420
You should do some practice at least.

355
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,790
Oh darn.

00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,680
Weekly Meal Chart.

357
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,230
October 17, October 27...

358
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,350
Yes, I'll start preparing the lunchbox for 20 right now—

359
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,970
You need to come to the hospital this very instant.

360
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,180
The hospital? why?

361
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,490
The General Manager?

362
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,010
What is going on?

363
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,520
General Manager.

364
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,020
How did you know to come here?

365
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,070
I called her.

366
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,940
Because her lunchbox is the culprit.

367
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,230
What? my lunch?

368
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,870
Not Joo Hye Ri's?

369
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,660
I had two and a half, the general manager had three and a half.

370
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:54,030
He felt a lot of pain all of a sudden, so I escorted him to the hospital.

371
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,830
I have a meeting with the doctor.

372
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,590
If you're not leaving, have a seat.

373
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,880
It hurts to look up.

374
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:28,310
Did you really eat my lunchbox?

375
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,840
Why would you foolishly...

376
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,590
You should have just thrown it out.

377
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,580
That I've thrown them out without even touching them

378
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,280
has made you really enraged.

379
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,460
You came right to my door even.

380
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,080
It's a waste of food.

381
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,080
Don't throw it all in the trash.

382
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,890
How and why do you not like it? Just what exactly is it that you want...

383
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,760
S-So you saw that.

384
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:08,930
I saw you roaring like a bear with your nostrils flaring.

385
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,390
The more I see you, the more I realize your temperament is one of a kind.

386
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,120
It seems like you don't have any plans with your boyfriend today.

387
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:39,070
He's not my boyfriend, he's just my friend.

388
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,390
My closest friend.

389
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,810
We don't actually live together. The first floor is his store,

390
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:49,970
and I rent the floor above it.

391
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,550
You misunderstood.

392
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,720
But before, why did—

393
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,730
Because I was being made to suffer,

394
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:05,560
so he felt bad, so as a friend, he was taking my side.

395
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,610
There's no such friendship between a man and a woman.

396
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:12,650
He's not a man but just Jeong Hyeon Tae.

397
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,250
You too.

398
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,950
Don't misunderstand.

399
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:35,310
Joo Hye Ri and I are not in any kind of relationship.

400
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:41,660
Also about the jewelry box.

401
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,710
It has nothing to do with her.

402
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,400
The owner is someone else.

403
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:06,200
The owner?

404
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,950
The owner is...

405
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,010
The jewelry...

406
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,510

00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,530
I'll do it.

418
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:24,000
Your back isn't good.

419
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,550
I'm sorry for leaving without finishing off the menu plan yesterday.

420
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:41,330
The general manager asked for me urgently, so I'm very sorry.

421
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,440
You can just finish it today.

422
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,130
Yes.

423
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,120
I'm sorry about yesterday.

424
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,650
It's because of my back. I've been meaning to get surgery done,

425
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,020
but I can't seem to make time for it.

426
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,550
Please be understanding.

427
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,140
Don't mention it.

428
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,040
But today you look happy.

429
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,700
Every day you looked like you were miserable. Did you get a boyfriend?

430
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,050
What?

431
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,550
No.

432
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,230
What boyfriend?.

433
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,410
Why is she overreacting? If not, never mind.

434
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:20,540
Last time because you didn't eat enough you were admitted.

435
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,820
This time because you ate too much you were admitted.

436
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,700
Don't you dare say anything at the company. If the chairman and the board members hear about this

437
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,960
it will be tiring.

438
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,180
I understand.

439
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:35,740
It's been a long time since I've seen you sleep well through the night.

440
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,770
She watched over you until late last night before she left.

441
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,980
The nutritionist.

442
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,830
What? I didn't ask about that.

443
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:49,910
I'm going to stop at home on our way and wash up.

444
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,000
I understand.

445
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:01,580
When we get to work, the meeting that was canceled yesterday will be in one hour.

446
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,760
Tell them to prepare for it.

447
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,830
I understand.

448
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,610
She stayed until late last night?

449
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:12,090
Don't be sick.

450
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,630
Yes, come in.

451
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,900
The breakfast menu is porridge,

452
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,630
so it's more comfortable to digest.

453
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,050
Do you feel okay?

454
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,400
Yes.

455
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,340
Then I will be going.

456
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,850
Wait, have a seat here.

457
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,360
Take responsibility.

458
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,030
Excuse me? For what?

459
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:59,090
What is this?

460
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,710
For making me sick.

461
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:19,350
Therefore hugely affecting my work.

462
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:24,240
As my personal nutritionist, for failing to do your job.

463
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,650
You need to take responsibility

464
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,900
for all of them.

465
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:38,750
The jewelry box issue, too. Let's settle everything neatly.

466
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,570
How do you want me to take responsibility?

467
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:45,040
Eat with me.

468
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,480
So if I eat—

469
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,850

Epilogue 06: General Manager Cha's irrefutable proposition

486
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:13,420
For making me sick.

487
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:20,010
Therefore my work was disrupted.

488
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:24,010
For not fulfilling your duty as my personal nutritionist.

489

You need to take responsibility for all of these.

The jewelry box issue, too.

491

Let's settle everything neatly.

00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:38,880
How do you expect me to take responsibility?

493
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,400
Eat with me.

494
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,280
General Manager Cha blinded by jealousy

495
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,890
#AteDinner3Times #ButIStillWantRamyun

496
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:02,350
#YouShouldntGoWithThatGuy #WhetherItsGreedOrJealousy

497
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:13,660
#BeforeEatingRamyun #PrepareToExercise

498
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:20,340
#WhatIAmWaitingForIs #YouNotRamyun

499
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,700
General Manager Cha's Lethal Seduction

500
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:28,390
What?

501
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,600
Do I make you nervous?

502
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,680
#DontComeNear #IThinkImGoingToFallForIt

503
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:50,320
Hiccups are just a normal physical response when the diaphragm contracts.

504
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,420
How can someone as smart as you not know about hiccups?

505
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,430
What I'm asking isn't that.

506
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:57,890
♫  Never even imagined, love love  ♫

507
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:02,020
It's not because I'm nervous, it's because I'm uncomfortable.

508
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:05,730
Lee Yoo Mi.

509
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:06,460
♫ Maybe that's what it is ♫

510
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,660
You have your answer, right?

511
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,840
I'll be going then.

512
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:15,650
♫ It’s getting weirder
My heart ♫

513
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:20,420
♫ You’re not even my ideal type ♫

514
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:26,160
♫ It’s getting weirder
The way I see things are changing ♫

515
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,650
♫ They say that’s how love comes ♫

516
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,350
♫ Oh love, it's like a playground, love ♫

517
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:39,560
♫ You become a child ♫

518
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,510
♫  Laughing, crying and hanging out ♫

519
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:45,460
General Manager Cha's Instincts Regardless of Time or Place

520
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,820
That...

521
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,040
#MumbleMumble # PretendingToSleepTalk

522
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,210
That jewelry...

523
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:24,390
#HandHoldingSkills #HiccupsThatCantBeHidden

524
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:43,820
My Secret Romance

525
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:47,120
Jin Wook seems to be seeing someone. Look into it.

526
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,180
Date? What do you mean by date?

527
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,950
It's work, work, business.

528
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:51,790
Where did it go?

529
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:55,030
The nutritionist, do you know she lives together with a man?

530
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,390
You left quickly like that yesterday too.

531
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,820
Why are you avoiding me like you can't see me?

532
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,490
Business trip? Is the nutritionist going too?

533
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,630
I have some bad memories about this place.

534
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:04,400
Let's go to get some work done.

535
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,290
I couldn't even eat dinner and hid inside the wardrobe I went through all that,

536
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:08,870
but it doesn't count?

537
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:11,190
What do you think? Does it pique your interest a little now?

538
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:14,800
This woman makes it impossible to take my eyes off of her for even a moment.
