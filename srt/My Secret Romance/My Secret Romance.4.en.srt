My Secret Romance

2
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,400
My Secret Romance

3
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,630
Annoyed

4
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:10,010
Episode 4: Because We're A One-Night Relationship

5
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,020
If it doesn't suit your taste, then pour salt— Help yourself to salt.

6
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,350
What a jerk.

7
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:47,240
Team Leader, when do we rotate working locations?

8
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,860
Yoo Mi, it's only been three weeks since you started.

9
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,840
That... Something has come up—

10
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,340
Aren't you working at Daebok Group?

11
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,200
Everyone wants to work there. What are you talking about?

12
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,940
That's right. Everyone wants to work there, so please rotate me out, please!

13
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,570
Stop it. You'll regret it.

14
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,010
Listen to me.

15
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,560
Hello? Yoo Mi?

16
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,970
Lee Yoo Mi.

17
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,070
You are such an irresponsible person.

18
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,390
It's simple.

19
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,570
Are you always running away like that?

20
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,430
Stabbing people in the back like that?

21
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,520
What do you mean, running away?

22
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,420
Stop it.

23
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,220
If it's not running away, do you have any reasonable excuse?

24
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,350
Yes, I do.

25
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,610
I'm managing a cafeteria with over 300 people in and out daily,

26
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,390
so preparing three special meals a day for you is not an easy thing at all.

27
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,250
Even AIpha Go takes a break sometimes.

28
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,540
So you're paid too little for your hard work.

29
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,810
Is that what you're saying?

30
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,260
Wage?

31
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,770
You're really forcing me to be patient.

32
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,350
Did you just speak to me informally?

33
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,150
You did it intentionally from the start, didn't you?

34
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,960
You thought I knew it from the beginning and ignored you

35
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,860
and you were trying to give me payback, weren't you.

36
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,310
Fine. I remember everything.

37
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,530
I'd be lying if I said I didn't remember everything. That resort,

38
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,650
wine, the beach, in the car! I said I remember everything!

39
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,590
Your coat? Fine,

40
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,310
I took it.

41
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,350
But I felt bad so I went and recycled it.

42
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,680
Look here, Lee Yoo Mi.

43
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,920
Do this, do that. I don't like this, I don't like that.

44
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,510
It's not like I'm in a training camp.

45
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,770
I'm a nutritionist. Do you think I'm your maid?

46
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,130
Business is business, personal is personal!

47
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,850
I'm a nutritionist, and you're the manager with a nutritional deficiency.

48
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,580
I'm telling you, just quietly eat your meals!

49
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,720
Wait a second. Stop right there.

50
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,740
Let me ask just one thing.

51
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,840
That day, what was your reason for leaving like that?

52
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,110
Are you that curious about it?

53
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,470
Tell me. What the reason is.

54
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,310
Because it was a one night stand.

55
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,560
I've never done it before, so I got scared.

56
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,710
I have to forget it, but my heart is still restless.

57
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,400
Because this is not normal.

58
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,400
Manager. We've arrived.

59
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,670
Secretary Jang. Do you want to get a drink together?

60
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,820
No, sir.

61
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,620
I ordered a suit, so I have to go pick it up.

62
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,160
You're so bluntly rejecting me.

63
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,130
Has something happened?

64
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,160
Nothing happened!

65
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,430
Manager, how about taking this opportunity to change your style?

66
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,510
That tailor is as sophisticated as an Italian artisan...

67
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,070
Because it was a one-night stand.

68
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,020
How dare she say that to me.

69
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,120
If you don't like it, don't do it.

70
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,360
You said to drink together, but you don't even let me say anything.

71
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,690
You should come here by yourself then.

72
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,890
Because it was a one-night stand.

73
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,580
Because it was a one-night stand.

74
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:44,660
You're saying that I, Cha Jin Wook, was just one night stand for you.

75
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,730
Beer and Books

76
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,520
I'll get fired, won't I?

77
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,910
No way. Not over something like that.

78
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,500
I'm a nutritionist, not your maid.

79
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,920
Business is business, personal is personal!

80
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,570
I'm saying, just quietly eat your meals!

81
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,410
I'll probably get fired.

82
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,970
Good morning, everyone.

83
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,370
Yoo Mi, today, you look like shit.

84
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,530
You must've drunk too much last night.

85
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,800
No. Thank you for worrying about me, Je Ni.

86
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,690
Thank you for everything all this time.

87
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,100
Until the end, fighting.

88
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,970
What's that? How unusual.

89
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,420
Is she sick?

90
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,500
Stop chattering and start doing your work.

91
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,380
Yes, ma'am.

92
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,590
Secretary Jang.

93
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,660
He didn't even touch it and threw it all away again?

94
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,110
General Manager Cha says that it was delicious and he ate very well.

95
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,090
"Especially the breakfast, the Korean meatball with tofu, was so delicious,"

96
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,460
is what he said.

97
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,850
What? Really?

98
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,960
Three Meals a Day Jerk— I mean, the general manager said so?

99
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,390
There's no way that's possible, though.

100
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,790
It is possible.

101
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,610
W-Was there anything else he said?

102
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,720
No. Then, I'll be going now.

103
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,540
What is this? What kind of situation is this?

104
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,380
Is he just moving on like this?

105
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,340
No, there's no way that's possible.

106
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,800
Get your head on straight, Lee Yoo Mi. The moment you relax, you'll be eaten alive.

107
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,000
What the hell is this?

108
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,950
It would be good for the president to try it, too.

109
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,420
Sit down.

110
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,450
Director Maeng brought you wild ginseng.

111
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,650
Here it is.

112
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:52,970
This can't be even compared to usual ginseng, it's so valuable.

113
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,090
I don't eat things like that.

114
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,540
Don't be picky and have some.

115
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,170
It was so shocking when you collapsed from malnutrition.

116
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,980
This was difficult to obtain.

117
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,340
Isn't the general manager the future of our company?

118
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,660
Are you already thinking about the board elections for the next term?

119
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,710
What? You are sharp, indeed.

120
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,660
Did you get home safely yesterday?

121
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,150
Of course! I barely even drank.

122
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,080
You have eaten all of your meals today without any complaints.

123
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,780
I've delivered the message to the nutritionist

124
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,430
- that you ate well and enjoyed your meal.
- "Enjoyed." You've got to be kidding me.

125
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,820
What did she say?

126
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,930
What are you talking about?

127
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,670
You know, Lee Yoo Mi!

128
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,350
How did she react, when you took back an empty meal box and told her I ate well?

129
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,730
So... Did she seem happy?

130
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,750
I wouldn't say, happy... Her facial expression seemed to be saying:

131
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,850
"Oh no, why would that jerk say that? What's his ulterior motive?"

132
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,830
And no, she didn't say anything else.

133
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,750
This suit you're wearing? Is it new?

134
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,430
It is! How does it look?

135
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,790
Don't wear it ever again. I have trypophobia (fear of clusters of small holes).

136
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,250
He has no sense of fashion!

137
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,410
Really. You know I'm a man of my word, don't you?

138
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,610
Just wait a little bit.

139
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:48,380
In a month, after I get the current meal service out of here, you can fill that spot.

140
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,080
General Manager.

141
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,150
Did you just have your lunch?

142
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,430
Yes. I ate.

143
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,270
Then.

144
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,790
Yes, goodbye.

145
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,730
This is so good!

146
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,140
Noona, please feed me.

147
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,540
You eat it yourself, dumbass!

148
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,650
No. Feed. Me!

149
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,400
Teacher, hurry and eat it while it's warm. It's really delicious!

150
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,950
Before you sit down...

151
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,340
Go and take this upstairs.

152
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,750
If you bring him this, he'll probably eat it.

153
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,570
Why are you just standing there? Hurry and go.

154
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,890
Yes! I'm going!

155
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,440
So good!

156
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,750
Noonim, ah...

157
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,580
Take it away!

158
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,020
Yes.

159
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,830
Oppa!

160
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,030
What is it? You didn't even contact me.

161
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,930
Is your body feeling okay?

162
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,210
Look at this, you even have dark circles! What is this?

163
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,300
Your face is rotting away!

164
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,060
Take your hands off me.

165
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,310
What are you doing, touching my face without permission?

166
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,450
What are you doing?

167
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,790
Do you have any idea how difficult it was to get here?

168
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:33,110
I took a day off and my seniors are broadcasting some junk and saying that I barely work.

169
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,410
I've only taken five days off this month. Annoying!

170
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:41,140
Joo Hye Ri. You should learn some vocabulary. You're a news anchor!

171
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,890
Why should I?

172
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:47,650
Oppa! It doesn't matter. I'm there because of my looks and not because of my intellectual abilities.

173
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,890
When will this woman ever grow up?

174
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,690
But where would you ever find a woman as faithful as me?

175
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:59,120
From high school all the way up to this day I've only had my eyes on you. You know that right? Right, Oppa?

176
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,520
Go. Oppa's busy.

177
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,820
I don't want to. Don't you know how much I'm going to miss this?

178
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,720
What are you doing?

179
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,260
Let's go eat something delicious together, okay?

180
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,390
Let go of me!

181
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,620
I'm really sorry about what happened the other day.

182
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,360
No, no. It's better this way! Everything's cool between us.

183
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,410
That won't do.

184
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,780
We're... both intellectuals, right?

185
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,280
As intellectuals, we should handle this intelligently

186
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,940
Business is business, private is private.

187
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,210
Ah, what kind of intellectual would say nonsense like that?

188
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,950
-  Why are you smiling? Aren't you getting off me? 
- Let's go together...

189
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,620
Get off. Get off me.

190
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,530
Come in.

191
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,680
It's not an urgent matter. I'll come at a later.

192
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,010
I told you to come in.

193
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,540
- Get off me.
- I don't want to.

194
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,960
Go. Ugh.

195
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,590
What is that?

196
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,010
The kitchen staff wanted you to try this.

197
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,050
You can leave it there and go.

198
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,030
Yes. I'll leave it here and go.

199
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,040
News Anchor Joo Hye Ri?

200
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,180
I mean, she makes food and comes all the way up, just to serve this?

201
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,210
Be quiet!

202
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,940
Oppa, don't eat something like this, let's go together somewhere to eat good food.

203
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,750
"Something like this"?

204
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,550
How about we go eat the tuna that you like?

205
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,780
Honey! Where are you right now?

206
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,290
Yeah, I'm almost there.

207
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,430
Wait a little bit. Okay.

208
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,580
Oppa!

209
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,150
Seriously. Why are you doing this!

210
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,600
Just leave it there and go.

211
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,520
Mister! Wait!

212
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,290
Daebok

213
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,800
What was I expecting?

214
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,140
At least I didn't get fired.

215
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,430
My daughter. When you see this message, call me.

216
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,490
Beer in Seoul tastes completely different!

217
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,420
Pour one more mug for me. Okay?

218
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,680
Yoo Mi was exactly like that when she was a kid.

219
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,760
I guess the apple does not fall far from the tree.

220
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,080
Dong Goo, how old are you?

221
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,970
Three years old.

222
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,230
He's totally cute.

223
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,450
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the wedding back then. Yoo Mi said she'd kill me if I went, so...

224
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,640
It's fine. I've divorced many times, so...

225
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,410
But geez, the temper of that brat.

226
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,760
You're here?

227
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,330
Mom, what are you doing here?

228
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,670
Have you blocked my number? Why aren't you answering your phone?

229
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,310
Why are you here?

230
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,860
We're closed for today.

231
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,360
But don't you close at seven?

232
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,880
You haven't seen your mother in such a long time

233
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,840
and that's all you have to say?

234
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,930
I got bored.

235
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,670
I endured it for so many months but I can't take it anymore.

236
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,940
You look one way, there's the sea. You look the other way, there's the sea.

237
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,790
That seaside. It's only good for hanging out for a couple of days and nights.

238
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:33,320
You have to travel for a loooong time to find a bar that's open late like this!

239
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,830
It's just the countryside, just the countryside.

240
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,840
You said you wanted to live like Lee Hyo Ri! You said you wanted to live with nature!

241
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,820
I've had enough of it!

242
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,820
So when are you going back?

243
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,430
When are you going to leave?!

244
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,500
It's over. We broke up.

245
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,920
What? So—

246
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,590
So what? I'll just stay here for a while.

247
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,740
Says who?

248
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,460
Hyeon Tae already promised I could stay.

249
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,620
You can't! There's no way I would live with you.

250
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,240
Get out! I said get out!

251
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,430
Where will I go at this hour, taking a child with me?

252
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,300
I don't have anywhere else to go.

253
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,170
You always put yourself first.

254
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,100
Who told you to get remarried in the first place?

255
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,590
This evil girl! And you're my only daughter.

256
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:28,740
Dong Goo. When you grow up, you can't treat Mommy like that.

257
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,620
- I heard her mom's an erotic actress.
- What?

258
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,280
- Really?
- Wow.

259
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,110
It's kinda nasty, right?

260
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,460
What kind of movie title is "I'm Going to Explode"?

261
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,730
But her boobs were no joke. I was watching it, and...

262
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,170
Whether I'm at home or work,

263
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,550
he won't leave me alone.

264
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,890
I'm glad there's at least a place like this in the neighborhood.

265
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,470
Are you almost done? I'm going to be late!

266
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,160
Just a bit more.

267
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,150
A bit more.

268
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,420
- Is it not coming out?
- No...

269
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,570
Oh, no.

270
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,820
The kid can't even poop because you keep giving him the side eye.

271
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,780
Is it my fault that he's constipated?

272
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,970
I'm about to be late for work because of him!

273
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,720
Buy some baby soy milk on your way back.

274
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,770
I'll pay you back, don't worry.

275
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,530
Is that good enough for you?

276
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,880
Aw, baby.

277
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,300
Excuse me.

278
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,650
You're the one who made the Korean pancakes, right? You can hand that over to her.

279
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,620
Where's the kitchen?

280
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,020
Excuse me, is that the kitchen?

281
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,420
- Yes.
- Okay, great.

282
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,360
She's so pretty.

283
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,830
She definitely got a boob job.

284
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,590
What is all this?

285
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,860
Starting today, use this to prepare your meals.

286
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,900
It's for my oppa, so I should take extra care of him.

287
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,380
I'm sure you can tell, but I brought only the highest-quality materials.

288
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,030
Sorry?

289
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,240
So you can prepare things properly.

290
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,550
Rice cake that looks good should taste good, right?

291
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:36,210
Oh, yeah. My oppa's exclusive silverware.

292
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,640
Excuse me, I don't really know why you're doing this,

293
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,220
but I take care of his every meal by including the proper nutrie—

294
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,480
You take care of his meals? Since when?

295
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,670
Are you talking about those pancake scraps?

296
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,080
Scraps?

297
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,550
From what I've heard, I heard he's always skipping his meals because they're so bad.

298
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,810
This won't do.

299
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:09,530
From now on, please send me a picture of every meal you prepare so you can receive an evaluation.

300
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,730
Why should I?

301
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,890
So I can help you beforehand.

302
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,810
I'm set to marry Jin Wook soon.

303
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,000
Says who?

304
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,160
I only eat the food she makes.

305
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,480
She's my dedicated nutritionist.

306
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:49,730
So no one else can tell her what to do except me.

307
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,580
Oppa.

308
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,630
Let's go.

309
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,130
Where are you going?

310
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,290
Oppa!

311
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,910
This is crazy!

312
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,020
Did Joo Hye Ri just get rejected?

313
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,320
General Manager Cha—

314
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,310
What are you doing?

315
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,960
I'm not going to tear you apart, don't worry.

316
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,490
I'm busy.

317
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,880
Busier than me?

318
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,590
Just be quiet and follow me.

319
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,090
Why did you bring that with you?

320
00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:00,550
I didn't have time to process because you pulled me out all of a sudden.

321
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,430
Also, don't think about looking good with that kind of stuff.

322
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,200
Just do your job well.

323
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,100
Take off your coat, too. We're about to leave.

324
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:18,140
No, but where are you going?

325
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,410
Why are we here?

326
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,480
Think about it.

327
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,850
Why do you think the busiest person at our company would use up his precious time to bring you here?

328
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,510
This place matches the best with my palette.

329
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,180
I brought you here to taste it and learn from it.

330
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:02,670
If you thought it was because of something else, that's a misunderstanding.

331
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,080
I didn't, though.

332
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,400
Didn't you though? Misunderstand.

333
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,130
Forget it right now.

334
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,700
The chopped steak is delicious.

335
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,480
I wonder how much the unit cost is.

336
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:34,750
But that person earlier was the reporter Joo Hye Ri, right?

337
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,350
Are you seeing her?

338
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,270
If a guy and girl are together, does that mean they're dating?

339
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,320
No, I mean...

340
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,820
You guys looked like you had that kind of relationship.

341
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,760
Your imagination is extraordinary.

342
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,380
That's your type, right?

343
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,990
The Boss's Explicit Taste.

344
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,460
The book title was so blunt that I remember it.

345
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,360
Wh-Who? Me?

346
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,060
What are you talking about?

347
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,990
She's the daughter of my high school teacher. Can't you put two and two together?

348
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,900
But...

349
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:39,870
What did you mean by what you said earlier?

350
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,530
What did I say?

351
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:49,600
When you said that you'd only eat food that I made.

352
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,780
What do you think I meant? Exactly as I said.

353
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:59,260
You're my dedicated nutritionist. Right?

354
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,900
You were hired by my company. Am I wrong?

355
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,070
That's true, but...

356
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,920
Are you the type to misunderstand things often?

357
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:14,160
That's you! There was that time you called an ambulance for someone who was perfectly fi—

358
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,000
Lee Yoo Mi.

359
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,090
Let's use this opportunity to clear things up.

360
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,940
Clear what up?

361
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,650
Business is business, and personal lives are personal lives. The past is the past.

362
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:38,580
Don't form useless feelings for me just because you bring me meals.

363
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,690
Like you said,

364
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,810
we are

365
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,430
just two people who had a one-night stand.

366
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,230
MAGNUM

367
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,190
Thank you for the meal.

368
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:23,190
Now do an in-depth study of how to implement these flavors into your meals.

369
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:27,070
I want to eat good food, I beg of you.

370
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,400
Okay.

371
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:02,910
Are your eyes merely there for decoration?

372
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,420
- It's a fixed door.
- Oh.

373
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,760
You sure do hiccup a lot.

374
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,110
Wait just a little while longer.

375
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:34,710
In a month, after I get the current meal service out of here, you can fill that spot.

376
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,850
I can't let that happen.

377
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,960
I won't make it that easy

378
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,720
for you to escape my evil influence.

379
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,160
This is only the beginning.

380
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,220
I said it's not like that!

381
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,140
This isn't it! I do well!

382
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,290
Why have I kept this for so long?

383
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,600
It's not like I'm some kind of a pervert.

384
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,770
Why are we suddenly going to the in-house restaurant?

385
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,160
Well, it's just that inspecting from time to time is part of executive image management.

386
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,300
I guess the restaurant is passable.

387
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,520
But from what I've heard, the meals the nutritionist sends you aren't very good.

388
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,470
Isn't the person in charge incompetent?

389
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,020
I think it's an exaggeration to call her "incompetent."

390
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,750
Of course, it's not easy to satisfy my tastes.

391
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,870
What's going on? Why are the executives suddenly coming here?

392
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,260
You know what? It seems like they suddenly want to pretend to be ordinary people.

393
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,920
Then, let's just make Chinese food today, okay?

394
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,850
If we cook something sub-par, there will be complaints.

395
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,360
What are you going to do with today's menu?

396
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,900
Chop steak? Should we serve chop steak?

397
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,670
Where are we going to get sirloin steak?

398
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:28,400
We have pork, right? We can use that.

399
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,750
Here's the recipe.

400
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,480
Chop steak?

401
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,790
The nutritionist seems to be good at thinking on her toes.

402
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,590
Thank you.

403
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:50,790
Director Maeng? How is it? Does it suit your tastes?

404
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:54,920
Well, I'm only starting to eat.

405
00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:02,310
But... Director Maeng, about the meal service company.

406
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:06,680
I didn't know you were so concerned about it.

407
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,660
You must be terribly busy with your own work already.

408
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,710
That... What are you...

409
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,540
Well, there's just something I have heard.

410
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,750
Why did we come here?

411
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,660
Try to think about it.

412
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:21,840
Why would a busy person like me take the time to bring you here?

413
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,700
That's... It's not like it's a big deal. For the welfare of the staff—

414
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:31,130
Director Maeng, the contract renewal is next month, isn't it?

415
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:36,920
Isn't this the time to focus on getting promoted and not on the catering company?

416
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,600
That's my opinion.

417
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,940
My asthma flared up.

418
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:55,690
Did Director Maeng have asthma before?

419
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:59,290
Oh, what a shame. Does anybody else have asthma?

420
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,370
Let's eat.

421
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,170
What cologne does the general manager use?

422
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,760
He smells nice.

423
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,070
He's already with Joo Hye Ri.

424
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,050
He's taken.

425
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,840
That's not true!

426
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,020
He said she's his high school teacher's daughter. I asked him yesterday.

427
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,860
They aren't dating, those two.

428
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,990
So I still have hope?

429
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,920
You've become very close with the general manager while doing his meals, it seems?

430
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,400
That you can ask him something like that.

431
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,570
Well... I guess so?

432
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,400
I'm so jealous of Yoo Mi!

433
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,260
We worked hard today, so should we finish up quickly and go out tonight?

434
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,580
Count me out. I have a gathering to go to.

435
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,310
Count me in.

436
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,770
Deal!

437
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,340
Yes!

438
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,060
Is it your first time here?

439
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:50,570
We're the same age, and we're not at work, so I'm going to speak casually with you, okay?

440
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,210
Yeah, of course...

441
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,620
There's something going on between you and the general manager, right?

442
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,930
No, that's not it. Why would you even say something like that?

443
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:04,740
He is not the type to come down to the cafeteria. It was fascinating.

444
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:10,580
I am just asking because I thought you became close while delivering his food.

445
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,690
Or maybe I'm wrong.

446
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,330
We suffered today serving the executives,

447
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:25,070
We should party hard today! Pa, Pa, Party Tonight!

448
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,360
♫  Pa, Pa, Party Tonight!  ♫

449
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,640
Yoo Mi!

450
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,470
Hey.

451
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,730
Cha Jin Wook,

452
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,590
so that's your type?

453
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,220
Yes, Chief! I'll do it.

454
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,360
I mean, I have to do it!

455
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,370
This is delicious! Right, Dong Goo?

456
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,190
It's too spicy for you.

457
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,590
You eat this.

458
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,560
Dong Goo! Show noona some aegyo!

459
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,730
Show noona.

460
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,570
You know it's tight covering the living expenses of three with my salary, right?

461
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:46,050
Who's living off you? I'll pay back our expenses.

462
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,660
That's right you will. Even if you have to get a part-time job.

463
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,930
As long as you don't work in those movies.

464
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:54,680
Hey! Your mom is still fresh.

465
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,530
Even now, if I only eat a little—

466
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,270
Just try to do it! I'll cut you off my family register!

467
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,650
Why are you losing your temper again, you brat?

468
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,950
Your mom is an actress!

469
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,520
Of course, an actress has to act to earn money.

470
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,560
Since when did a porn star qualify as an actress?

471
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,940
That temper.

472
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,210
Hey! Do you want to know why your noona is like that?

473
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,590
It's all because she doesn't know how to flirt.

474
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,590
Flirt.

475
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,150
Jeong Hyeon Tae!

476
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,320
Want to go for a drive?

477
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,270
Not really!

478
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,020
I'm not doing this for free!

479
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,050
Owner Jeong!

480
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,580
Go faster!

481
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,090
Hey! But you're easily scared. Pretending to be strong.

482
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,380
Faster!

483
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,780
Should I really do it?

484
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,690
Hold tight!

485
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,280
Ah, I don't want to go back home.

486
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,970
It's already cramped and they're just hanging around.

487
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,850
Then, do you want to stay at my place?

488
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:11,730
I'll let you have the bed.

489
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,450
Hey! Don't be like that. Take my mom instead!

490
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:17,360
You can take care of the baby too!

491
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,710
Hey, isn't that joke a bit too cruel?

492
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,750
I mean it.

493
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,600
The night view is great.

494
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:31,360
Excuse me. You recognize me, right? I'm a regular customer.

495
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,430
Yes.

496
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,600
Can I have your phone number?

497
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,150
I'm in the middle of a date.

498
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,910
Date?

499
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:42,790
No, it's not a date.

500
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,730
Right now, you're interrupting us.

501
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,660
I'm sorry.

502
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,580
Hey! I told you not to use me like this!

503
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,120
Ahh! Friends should help each other out.

504
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,990
She's pretty though! Why didn't you take your shot?

505
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,230
You're prettier.

506
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:11,690
Hey! You look so serious but only lies come out of your mouth.

507
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,370
Is it obvious?

508
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,600
Okay.

509
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:35,750
You seem less busy today. Don't you have meals to deliver?

510
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:41,170
He's on a business trip. It's like a vacation.

511
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,370
- Nutritionist Lee! You're too much.
- Why?

512
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:47,960
General Manager Cha might skip his meals again if he is too busy.

513
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,830
What if his handsome face slims down again?

514
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,500
That can't happen.

515
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,360
Be careful of her. I'm serious.

516
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:05,040
I'm not sure if the accommodation and food were to your liking during your stay.

517
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,510
Thanks for your concern.

518
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:09,310
Rather than that, supply products without problems.

519
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,560
Of course. Don't worry.

520
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,600
We finished our contract successfully, so please help yourself.

521
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,660
How is it? Is it to your liking?

522
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,530
It's delicious.

523
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,020
Please eat.

524
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,330
Turn it.

525
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,220
Secretary Jang, doesn't it feel like something is missing?

526
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,240
Pardon?

527
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,700
I just think something's missing.

528
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,000
Thirty-two minutes ago, you had Chinese food and you said,

529
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,400
"I feel like my stomach is going to explode."

530
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,910
I did.

531
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,360
I said that, but something's missing.

532
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,080
Then would you like to go to a restaurant on your way back?

533
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,870
No, I'm not that hungry.

534
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,230
Isn't there something more simple?

535
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:11,580
Are you talking about your company lunchboxes, by any chance?

536
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,540
You're right! I could eat a lunchbox.

537
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,110
But it's the weekend. It's the first—

538
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,130
Yeah, it's me.

539
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,980
Mommy?

540
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,360
M-Mommy?

541
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,480
H-Hello?

542
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,230
Three Meals a Day Jerk

543
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,220
Hello?

544
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,590
Who was that just now?

545
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,940
Th-That was me.

546
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:47,620
I was sleeping when you called! I thought it was my mom.

547
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,760
But why did you call me?

548
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,800
I skipped some meals.

549
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,890
I'll send you my address, so come and prepare my meal.

550
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,820
What?

551
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,650
♫  I always hid this from you  ♫

552
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:12,630
♫  But I'm regretting it  ♫

553
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:19,200
♫  That fluttering feeling that day, my true feelings  ♫

554
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,200
♫  Sometimes, to the point of anger,  ♫

555
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,320
♫  to the point of hatred  ♫

556
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:35,880
♫  I get exhausted with this suffocating longing, tears fall ♫

557
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,150
♫  I keep missing you  ♫

558
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,450
♫  If it’s only one, it’s you  ♫

559
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:49,400
♫  Even the second, it’s you  ♫

560
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:57,200
♫  My one and only person, do you know it’s you?  ♫

561
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,780
Looks like drinking alone but not drinking alone,
but he looks like it.

562
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,480
#WhyDon'tYouActLikeYouKnowMe #ImWatchingYou

563
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:15,200
General Manager, why don't you take this chance to change your style?

564
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,520
How dare she?

565
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,000
If you don't want to, then never mind.

566
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,230
You asked me to drink with you, but you don't let me say a word.

567
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:31,600
You should have come alone then. You brought me here only to throw a tantrum.

568
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,150
I should've just gone home.

569
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,030
That thing Yoo Mi kept hiding for three years!

570
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,810
#Wool100%Handmade #CantKeepIt #CantThrowItOut

571
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,260
I said, what am I supposed to do?

572
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:31,980
Tossing and turning because he can't sleep

573
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,580
#PretendingNotToSee #PretendingNotToKnow

574
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:50,020
#ThreeYearsAgo #ThatUnbelievableMoment #SinceThatDay

575
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:02,980
I said that wasn't it!

576
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,400
I said I do well!

577
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,190
Damn, it's cold!

578
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,500
I said that's not it!!!

579
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:28,740
General Manager Cha Jin Wook's Four Stages of Accepting the Facts

580
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,330
She probably didn't see it.

581
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:32,510
#1stStage #Denial #SheprobablyDidn'tSeeIt

582
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,830
Style and function?

583
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:40,060
To satisfy everyone with this product—

584
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:43,450
No! That's not possible.

585
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:45,520
That's not possible.
 #2ndStage #Anger #No!!! #ItsNotPossible

586
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,670
I will do it again.

587
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,280
What? Why aren't you doing it?

588
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,950
Start.
 #3rdStage #Bargaining #StartAgain

589
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:01,170
So the result is, with style and function,

590
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:07,140
we have prepared a marketing tactic for a product that can satisfy all.

591
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,330
But...

592
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:09,630
#4thStage #Declutter #FireThatGuy

593
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:12,220
Damn, that alien...

594
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,020
Fire that guy.

595
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,580
Our malnourished general manager has changed.

596
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,250
#TurnIt #Eatstagram

597
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:26,640
Now... Secretary Jang, turn it.

598
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,550
Stop.

599
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,440
#WhatIsThisTaste? #HowDelicious

600
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,590
It's delicious.

601
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,600
Turn it.

602
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,990
#TurningTurning #MukbangBrothers

603
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,630
Turn it.

604
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:58,710
#ButWhatILikeMost #LeeYooMisMealBox

605
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:07,780
General Manager's attitude towards Lee Yoo Mi's meal box.

606
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:17,060
#YourEyesNoseLips #TooCute #Warning:HeartAttack

607
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:20,410
She's unexpectedly cute sometimes.

608
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:28,760
#WhereShouldIStart #OMGICantEatIt

609
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,750
Where should I start? Ears?

610
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,760
I can't eat it!

611
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,430
#AnywayItsMine #Flattering #IllEatYouJustWait

612
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,450
Just wait.

613
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,340
Let's eat the eyes!

614
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,150
Oh, really.

615
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:54,950
My Secret Romance

616
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,080
You opened it, didn't you?

617
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,290
You opened it and saw everything inside it, didn't you?

618
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,780
Who the hell are you? Move.

619
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:07,940
If I see you, I recall things I want to forget.

620
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,220
There's a beggar in my stomach.

621
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,970
If that jerk bothers you again, just say you have a boyfriend.

622
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:14,330
That's nothing, so I'll do it for you.

623
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:15,880
You only do this around me, right?

624
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,490
Hyeon Tae.

625
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,380
No need to pick me up.

626
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,040
Is there something between them?

627
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,820
Until when, how much do I need to look out for you?

628
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,170
Since you're so busy, you must have no time to date.

629
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,340
What do you think about me?

630
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,640
Is that really it?

631
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,760
I'll sincerely apologize for your ruined proposal.
