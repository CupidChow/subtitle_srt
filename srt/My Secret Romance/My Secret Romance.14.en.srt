My Secret Romance

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:10,930
Episode 14. The World Full of You, Tonight

4
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,730
General Manager.

5
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:51,310
No, thanks to a person named Cha Jin Wook,

6
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,440
I was happy.

7
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,060
I got to date a cool guy.

8
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,890
It was like a dream.

9
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,660
Don't say that.

10
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,850
To you, I'm not like a dream.

11
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:25,140
I have so many things I haven't done with Lee Yoo Mi.

12
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,420
I'll stay with you for a long time and we'll do it all together.

13
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,020
I won't let you go.

14
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,510
♫  I wanna know you  ♫

15
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,720
♫  Not your blood type or sign  ♫

16
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,720
♫  But the real you  ♫

17
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,160
♫  The you that no one else knows  ♫

18
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,380
♫  Will you tell me?  ♫

19
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,320
♫  Starting from your first memory  ♫

20
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,760
♫  Except your first lie and first love  ♫

21
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,560
♫  I wanna know everything  ♫

22
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:42,070
♫  My sign is the star of scars  ♫

23
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:50,300
♫  I’m shy, lonely and irritable  ♫

24
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,200
♫  I always think alone

25
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,900
♫  And get hurt alone  ♫

26
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,020
♫  A coward  ♫

27
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:37,000
♫  You're far away  ♫

28
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,280
Everything feels

29
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,760
like a dream.

30
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,580
You and me.

31
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,960
A dream only the two of us are in.

32
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,150
I only had shameful memories.

33
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,330
Now I have a good memory.

34
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,110
Thanks to you.

35
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,300
♫  I'd go anywhere  ♫

36
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,060
They shouldn't have met,

37
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,590
either three years ago or now.

38
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:21,150
♫  If only I could feel my love right now  ♫

39
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,330
It's time to wake up from the dream.

40
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,370
This is as far as we go.

41
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:42,860
♫  I will show you my love ♫

42
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,590
♫  When you're alone  ♫

43
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:02,090
♫ and you're sick of loneliness ♫

44
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,840
♫  I'll take a quiet step  ♫

45
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:18,900
♫  and I'll put it in my arms with warm ♫

46
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,980
I won't be able to do it again,

47
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,850
something like this.

48
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,300
♫  When you're crying  ♫

49
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:49,830
♫  and you're tired of despair  ♫

50
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,170
Thank you.

51
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,220
My first love and

52
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,890
last love...

53
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,460
is you.

54
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:08,230
♫  I'd appreciate it  ♫

55

♫ winter, will you return to me? ♫

60
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,560
♫  The sound of you ♫

61
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:57,320
♫  Even if you're tired ♫

62
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:06,900
♫  and you're letting me go  ♫

63
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:13,400
♫  I only remember your beautiful face ♫

64
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,700
Lee Yoo Mi.

65
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,660
Neither your name

66
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,000
nor age...

67
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,950
A woman whom I didn't know anything about,

68
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,490
I waited for, for three years.

69
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,000
♫  I only love you forever ♫

70
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,210
I'm confident.

71
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,730
Whether it's three years or 30 years,

72
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,060
I won't go anywhere but will wait for you.

73
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,760
I will wait for you,

74
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,230
whenever you return.

75
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,220
Why are you alone?

76
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,290
Did you not meet that guy?

77
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,370
I broke up with him.

78
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,660
I told him to end the relationship.

79
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,980
But it hurts so much.

80
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,330
I miss him so much.

81
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,240
So so much!

82
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,610
It's going to be alright.

83
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,400
It'll be alright.

84
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,170
Beer & Book

85
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,410
Today's weather.

86
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:00,360
It has rained for a few days, but today the sky will be clear

87
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,430
This is TBD forecaster, Kim Da Hyeon.

88
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,650
Today as well?

89
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,270
Yes.

90
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,310
That lacking kid... as a general manager.

91
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,150
Because of one girl.

92
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,750
Nice going.

93
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,420
Good morning, sir.

94
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,540
Why do you come to work when you have no work to do?

95
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,290
Tell him he no longer has the company or whatever else,

96
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,520
so he doesn't need ever to come back here.

97
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,910
He says you don't have to come back ever.

98
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,580
It wasn't that long ago he begged me to take a break while working.

99
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,590
So, when are you coming back?

100
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,090
I should go,

101
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:09,240
but I need to stop by somewhere.

102
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,490
Alright.

103
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,510
I was scared.

104
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,780
I didn't want to be seen as easy,

105
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,680
and something like that happening in my life...

106
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,860
You were the only person.

107
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:32,250
I also didn't have anyone like you in my life.

108
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,400
You are the only one.

109
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,160
I won't give up.

110
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,780
I won't give up... ever.

111
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,230
Welcome!

112
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,560
You are here, my son!

113
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,650
Yes.

114
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,560
[We Have Breakfast]

115
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:38,370
It's good to see your face. You only sent flowers every year.

116
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,620
Did you know about that?

117
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,240
Of course.

118
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,340
I knew but pretended like I didn't know. I saw but pretended I didn't see.

119
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,550
That's how I waited.

120
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,790
I was waiting for you to come see me.

121
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,570
Go ahead.

122
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,990
It's good.

123
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,360
Look how sweaty you are.

124
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,950
I feel so bad.

125
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,390
Yoo Mi.

126
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,960
Don't be sick, Yoo Mi.

127
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,300
I am sorry.

128
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,360
That nutritionist lady came over.

129
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:35,170
I knew later after seeing the article.

130
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,420
She never got the chance to make the abalone porridge you like

131
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,580
and said she couldn't make it even if she wanted to now.

132
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,870
Lee Yoo Mi.

133
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,850
Hurry up and go to her.

134
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:13,580
I want my son to be happy with the woman you like.

135
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,740
I'll come back, Mom.

136
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,160
Okay.

137
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,040
Where is he this early in the morning?

138
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,960
Sigh.

139
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,680
I should be done with all these now.

140
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,330
Sassy Relationship

141
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:27,440
Girl, Temptation, Close up

142
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,940
Sunbaenim.

143
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,360
Ten minutes before live broadcast. Please get ready.

144
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,020
Yes.

145
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,530
It's Dong Goo's.

146
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,630
You must really like the kid.

147
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,620
I mean, not really, but Dong Goo is...

148
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,520
your family.

149
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,180
Here comes Jo Mi Hee.

150
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:24,240
Right, we had her before on the show, but this time will be her solo interview.

151
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,130
And live, especially.

152
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:31,220
Yeah, Kyeong Hee Ae must be jealous.

153
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,690
This is sensitive, but we can't avoid it.

154
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,850
The scandal with Daebok Group's Cha Jin Wook.

155
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,270
But when it came to light that your daughter was the one who had the scandal with him,

156
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:47,490
there was even a bigger impact. Is it true?

157
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,610
Don't say more.

158
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,020
She was being so sensitive about the interview.

159
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,190
I mean, whether others are in a relationship or not,

160
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,500
whether it's one night or two nights,

161
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,690
why do people care so much?

162
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,770
Why? Because I am an erotic actress?

163
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,450
An actor is an actor. Why do you put "erotic" in front?

164
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,370
Erotic actors' daughter can't have a relationship?

165
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:22,520
Then can't the anchor curse or go clubbing?

166
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,360
Everyone, love can happen any time or anywhere.

167
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,770
So what if it's one night? Love can start that way too.

168
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,890
How love will start... Who decides?

169
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:48,160
Mrs. Jo Mi Hee, we are live now.

170
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:54,590
Everyone can be in a relationship, no, everyone wants to be in a relationship.

171
00:28:54,590 --> 00:29:01,260
Don't be afraid of getting hurt, don't care about others.

172
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,800
Just go for it.

173
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,030
Yoo Mi, there's nothing you did wrong.

174
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,240
Be confident!

175
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,160
Mom...

176
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:20,330
Who cares if it's a one-night stand as long as you are responsible for your behavior?

177
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,670
If you love him, go after him.

178
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,320
Just make him yours!

179
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,010
Gosh, Mom!

180
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:40,370
Yoo Mi, I love you.

181
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,150
Yoo Mi.

182
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,480
Mine.

183
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,890
Hyeon Tae!

184
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,760
Do you want to borrow mine?

185
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,210
Go slow.

186
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,180
Thank you!

187
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,120
Where are you?

188
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,890
I'm on my way to the company.

189
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:55,000
How long are you going to dilly-dally?

190
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,830
Report back to work immediately.

191
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,070
Father! I'll give up both the general manager position and being the heir.

192
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,910
As you said, my abilities are completely lacking,

193
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,730
so leave it to a professional manager!

194
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,200
What? Are you out of your mind?

195
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,080
I can give up everything, but not Yoo Mi.

196
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,970
You can always restart a business, but if I lose her this time,

197
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,040
I feel like I'll regret it forever.

198
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,160
I'm sorry. I'll be hanging up first!

199
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,080
Hey, Cha Jin Wook!

200
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,340
Nutritionist?

201
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,280
Cha Jin Wook!

202
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,230

00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,320
It felt so unfair to just end it that way.

209
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,250
We haven't even begun.

210
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,750
That's what I wanted to say.

211
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,690
Don't you dare run away again.

212
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,200
I'll catch you even if I have to put you on a wanted list.

Daebok Group's Cha Jin Wook Acknowledges His Relationship

227
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,170
Daebok Group Director Cha Jin Wook's lover from those flourishing rumors has been revealed.

228
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,450
Ms. Lee Yoo Mi, who worked as a nutritionist at a municipal cafeteria...

229
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:31,910
Chairman Cha Daebok

230
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:41,080
This is my daughter.

231
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,200
Oh! He's good looking!

232
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,860
Daebok Group, yes.

233
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,680
He's the son of the president.

234
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,860
You're sexy.

235
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,900
I'm the love messenger of those two.

236
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,550
Oh, really?

237
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,060
News is online!

238
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,070
It's like a movie.

239
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,790
It's a pretty photo of her.

240
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:24,680
♫  With that smile  ♫

241
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,600
♫  that was cold yesterday but warm today  ♫

242
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,720
♫  You confuse me  ♫

243
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,600
♫  Burning romance, what do I do?  ♫

244
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,540
♫ Every day, I miss you ♫

245
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,660
How about a drink tonight. Deal?

246
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,900
♫ I think I love you so good ♫

247
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,570
Okay, sure.

248
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:06,280
♫  I like you, the end ♫

249
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,570
Enjoy it.

250
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,820
Enjoy it.

251
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,630
Enjoy it.

252
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:22,860
Noona, was that scandal involving a chaebol really about you?

253
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,610
It wasn't a scandal. It was about devotion.

254
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:30,770
Also, it's not Noona but Nutritionist.

255
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,750
Nutritionist, we're all out of the meat patties.

256
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,510
Okay!

257
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,930
Dong Goo, why are you crying?

258
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,750
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

259
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,470
Dong Goo.

260
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:56,030
Dong Goo.

261
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,060
Dong Goo.

262
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,390
Are you Yoo Mi's mother's husband?

263
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,660
Dong Goo.

264
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,560
It's your dad.

265
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,570
Dong Goo.

266
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,620
Dong Goo.

267
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,640
Are you happy being back at work?

268
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,790
Yes.

269
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,290
Terrible kid.

270
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:37,790
You said you'd quit but took your whole team away.

271
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
I need a bullet, too.

272
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,980
But I see you more often now than when I was at the company, and we eat together. Aren't you happy?

273
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,370
Happy, my butt.

274
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,670
Should I not come then?

275
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:53,160
Come home at least once a month.

276
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,800
I'll bring Yoo Mi, too, next time.

277
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,390
Where?

278
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:01,590
If you want to cut off our relationship, I dare you to.

279
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:14,560
Still, it's on her insistence that I keep having meals with you regularly.

280
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,600
I guess I can't do that anymore either then.

281
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,500
It hurts.

282
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,440
This punk. You're playing with me.

283
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,390
Have this too.

284
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,700
Try this.

285
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,560
Eat a lot.

286
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,890
On Vacation

287
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,050
Are you going somewhere?

288
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:48,500
On vacation. I signed on for my next book.

289
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,680
Where? For how long?

290
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,860
To South America.

291
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:58,590
I only got a one-way ticket, so I don't know when I'll be back.

292
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:03,510
How can you just leave so suddenly? I haven't gotten to go anywhere yet.

293
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:08,750
So why are you wasting time? You said you were going to Hong Kong.

294
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:12,560
I have no vacation days left to use.

295
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:19,670
You'll still be my drinking buddy even when I get back, right?

296
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,230
That time, instead of drinks...

297
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,730
Go on a date with me.

298
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,110
If you don't want to, never mind.

299
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:44,360
So hot...

300
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,170
Joo Hye Ri.

301
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,090
Come with me to South America.

302
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:00,680
Really?

303
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,320
Okay, I will.

304
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,350
Cheers.

305
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,900
Day one from today.

306
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,700
It was a dramatic way of re-establishing our relationship.

307
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,720
After seeing my morning interview,

308
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,480
he came to me in person and got on his knees and begged,

309
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,930
asking me to start over again.

310
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,280
You don't need to tell them that much.

311
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,350
He also promised to support my television career as well.

312
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:51,610
The third chapter of my life has begun.

313
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:08,870
Enter the bride and groom.

314
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:38,390
Nutritionist's mother is really beautiful in person.

315
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:41,830
Wow, she takes care of her physique amazingly well.

316
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:45,210
When I get older, I'll probably be sexy just like that.

317
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,330
Never changes...

318
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,110
What?

319
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,160
I'm just saying.

320
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,430
When you're older, you'll get short and thick. Like me.

321
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,490
Everyone, thank you for coming to our wedding like this

322
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,350
with your busy schedule.

323
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,820
We're very thankful.

324
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:20,450
I'm marrying second time with the same husband.

325
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,060
I'm still happy.

326
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,400
It's the same for you, too, right?

327
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,970
I'm embarrassed.

328
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:34,460
We'll live well.

00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,290
Yes, thank you for that.

330
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:43,910
Next will be a special video presentation of

331
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:47,510
Groom Kim Yong Han and Bride Jo Mi Hee's

332
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:51,450
childhood and their growing up process.

333
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,350
Mi Hee?

334
00:44:54,430 --> 00:45:00,230
By chance, MH is Mi Hee?

335
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,630
Jo Mi Hee, Kim Yong Han

336
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,010
No way.

337
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,180
The child is here, it won't be presented.

338
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,270
Ero movie

339
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,350
Wow that's amazing.

340
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,960
I'll be taking the photo now.

341
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,110
Please take a step back.

342
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:02,410
Now, when we take the shot,

343
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:06,990
- let's smile. One, two, three.
- When will my mom ever mature?

344
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:17,620
But... when we get married, Dong Goo is what to me?

345
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:21,400
Well, your brother-in-law?

346
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,390
Oh, brother-in-law...

347
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:39,360
Today is D day...

348
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,370
Be ready. Do you know how patient I've been for today?

349
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,700
Me too.

Do you know how long I've waited for today?

361
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,250
What are you talking about. Really.

362
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,830
You're hiccuping.

363
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,720
It's because of you.

#All #ThanksTo #YooMi

400
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,660
We had a meal together.

401
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,200
We can't do this anymore.

402
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,870
It hurts my mind.

403
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,870
You punk.

404
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:48,410
Are you making fun of your father?

No way.

419
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:23,640
The child is here, it won't be presented.

420
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,220
Mi Hee?

421
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:28,260
By any chance,

422
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,140
MH is

423
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:32,630
MH comes from Mi Hee?

That blue ocean.

432
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,330
My mom.

When exactly is she going to grow up?

435
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:24,290
But...

436
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:26,580
If we get married,

437
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,150
what would Dong Goo be to me?

438
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,170
Not sure.

439

Be prepared!

445
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,860
Do you know how long I've endured just for this day?

Go be with your wife.

Isn't being by her side for a meal part of taking care of her?

452
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,900
My wife... is right here.

453
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,720

♫  We mustn't separate  ♫

462
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,620
Pick it up.

00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,630
Hold on.

464
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,970
No, no, it's fine.

465
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,120
The menu that goes well with this wine—

466
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,860
The menu that goes well with this wine—

467
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,020
Hang on.

468
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,000
Sorry. Hang on.

469
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,030
I want to do that for some reason.

470
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,420
Cut!

471
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,200
Action.

472
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:52,890
Your habit to hic... hic... hiccup. Sorry.

473
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:53,640
Sorry.

474
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,960
I'm sorry.

475
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,100
I think I know what you mean.

476
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,770
It's not done yet.

477
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:21,790
Hold on. I'll do it again.

478
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:26,080
Don't do this, Oppa!

479
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,730
Camera rolling.

480
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:31,030
- Oh no!
- Hold on.

481
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:33,220
Cut!

482
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,130
Sorry.

483
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,600
Don't do this.

484
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,750
Cut!

485
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,840
This lady. I can't take eyes off of you, not even once.
