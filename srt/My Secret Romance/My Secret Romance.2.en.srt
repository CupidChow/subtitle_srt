My Secret Romance

3
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:10,910
Episode 2: That Person Is Closer Than You Think

4
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,050
One more time, one more time.

5
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,830
We are not able to serve parties of one person.

6
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,820
Isabu Lion Park - Jeung San - Samcheok Beach

7
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,000
Is it your hobby to look distressed?

8
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,970
Can't you just pass by as if you didn't see me?

9
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,370
Instead of picking a fight with me for no reason.

10
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,120
I thought you'd jump into the car this time.

11
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,160
What?

12
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,480
You're just like Blackey.

13
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,260
Blackey?

14
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,180
There is someone like that who I feed every day.

15
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,930
Then what about you? Rented car?

16
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,700
You didn't steal a customer's car, right?

17
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,570
I'm speechless.

18
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,760
I guess you don't know anything about me, I'm not an average person.

19
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,720
I see, is that so?

20
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,640
I didn't want to stoop to this level, but that resort over there? The chairman's son—

21
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,440
- Car.
- By any chance,

22
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,160
did you steal the chairman's son's car?

23
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,530
Never mind. Get in.

24
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,380
I'll give you a ride.

25
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,830
Don't tell me, are you worried?

26
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,120
I said I'd give you a ride.

27
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,230
I won't get arrested as an accomplice to car theft, right?

28
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,950
Don't do it if you don't want to.

29
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,780
It seems like the bus stopped running already.

30
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,830
Oh, the bus has stopped running.

31
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,740
Ahjussi, the bus stopped running, right?

32
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,190
Yes, it stopped.

33
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,590
I thought so. Oh!

34
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:23,330
I'll just consider this additional customer service.

35
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,500
Put on your seat belt.

36
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,220
Yes.

37
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,730
Oh, by the way, did you come back from an interview?

38
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:50,170
I think this suits you better than a dress. You look like a secretary.

39
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,810
What did you say?

40
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,270
Well, you're not reading it all night, are you?

41
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,810
Reading what?

42
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,770
"The Boss' Explicit Taste." The title is very provocative.

43
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,900
Th-That is not that kind of book.

44
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,710
I see.

45
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,480
But, what is that sound?

46
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,410
Secretary Jang...

47
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,410
Lend me some money.

48
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,000
Pardon?

49
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,080
He wouldn't have been able to go far away. The car doesn't even have any gas.

50
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,890
Let him go for today, as he has to go somewhere.

51
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,620
Yes, I understand.

52
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,470
He might get his act together after he sees his mom.

53
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,330
Get out.

54
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,360
Where are we?

55
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,190
Weren't we going to the resort?

56
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,390
I never said that I'd take you to the resort.

57
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,190
Aren't you getting out?

58
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,300
He said he didn't have enough gas in his car, so he made me pay to fill his tank.

59
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,480
And now he's telling me to get out as he pleases?

60
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,660
I...

61
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,870
I'll pay you back double.

62
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,190
How can I believe that?

63
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:34,520
I keep my word when I make a promise.

64
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,430
Ah, I get it.

65
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,480
I'm going to stay here a little longer, so you can find your way back on your own,

66
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,500
whether by bus or hitchhiking.

67
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,460
I don't know if that'll work out well, though.

68
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,340
What?

69
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,630
Or maybe we can have a drink together.

70
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,630
Together?

71
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,020
♫  The sound of the rain ♫

72
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,110
♫ knocking on my window  ♫

73
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,100
Neither of us are in the best mood, so let's recharge for a while.

74
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,400
♫  Makes my heart flutter before I go out to see you  ♫

75
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,630
I'm not making a move on you, so don't get too excited.

76
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,790
Who's excited?

77
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,030
If not, then whatever.

78
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,620
Give me a sip, too.

79
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,700
♫  Should we walk on the streets ♫

80
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,700
♫  That have  ♫

81
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,390
I couldn't drink wine yesterday, because I smashed it to bits.
♫  been washed?  ♫

82
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,710
Regardless, that's in the past.

83
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,770
and we're only going to see each other today. Whatever will be, will be.

84
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,520
Whatever will be, will be.
♫  I don’t care  ♫

85
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,540
♫  if my shoulder gets wet  ♫

86
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,960
Look here.

87
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,850
I found some money!

88
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,390
Wow! 1989!

89
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,610
This was made the year I was born.

90
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,920
I think I'm lucky today.

91
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,290
Huh? Wasn't it too random to be lucky?

92
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,180
Even if there are a hundred bad things,

93
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,530
if there's anything good, we're lucky that day.

94
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,070
Five-hundred won on this vast sandy beach,

95
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:36,420
and 500 won that was made the year I was born. Do you think it's normal?

96
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,210
Here, it's a gift.

97
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,370
Are you feeling pity for me because I don't have money for gas?

98
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,570
I'm just wishing you luck.

99
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,780
You looked really sad since a while ago,

100
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,100
like a cat that lost its mother.

101
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,780
A cat?!

102
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,190
Have you had a sip of this and you are already drunk?

103
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,550
I'm a heavy drinker.

104
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,820
Is it that good?

105
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,570
Yes.

106
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,450
I wouldn't be surprised if you danced.

107
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,260
Really?

108
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,590
I'm good dancer.

109
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,050
What are you doing now?

110
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,330
I'm dancing!

111
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,120
Ah, seriously. What's wrong with you? You're embarrassing me.

112
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,900
Stop it. Huh?

113
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,510
About earlier. Thank you.

114
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:52,730
Nothing has been working out for me lately, and it's been lonely.

115
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,200
It's been really hard, you know.

116
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,630
But there hasn't been anyone who has asked me if I'm alright.

117
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,370
You're the first one.

118
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,110
The first person to ask me how I'm doing.

119
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,970
It's not like it's anything special,

120
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:24,370
but those words are oddly comforting.

121
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,340
The charms of this girl...

122
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:45,410
It's not like a woman has never cried because of me, but it's the first time someone cried because I asked them if they were alright.

123
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:51,570
It's also the first time I've seen a girl who is beautiful while crying.

124
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,180
It's... It's... It's really late. I have to go.

125
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,110
♫  I wanna know you  ♫

126
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,470

♫  I wanna know everything  ♫

147
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,120
Quickly, come!

148
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,770
Aigoo, I heard you.

149
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,300
Get yourself together, Lee Yoo Mi.

150
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,340
This isn't right.

151
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:32,720
3 years later

152
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,200
Gangnam Station - building 63

153
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,100
Ajussi!

154
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,760
Ajussi!

155
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,930
Lashevan material: the optimum temperature for men's health is 33°C.

156
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,930
Lashevan material: The natural material that has been called second skin.

157
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,280
Daebok

158
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,010
Daebok

159
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,860
2013 Industry Leader Medal: rising corporation... / 2017 Korean leading trademark strategy ... functional underwear design ... OEM production

160
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:20,330
Compared to previous models the reaction is much more explosive.

161
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,980
Of course it is.

162
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,430
Lashevan

163
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,650
As you can see, in the market for men's functional underwear,

164
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,910
our brand is so known, it has become like a proper noun.

165
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,110
Domestic consumption, as well as foreign sales, increased by 19.2% last year.

166
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,480
At first in the domestic male underwear line, lingerie from Paris was the most advanced in the game.

167
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,970
"In homeshopping, one piece of this Legendary Underwear is selling every second."

168
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,320
That's what it's being called.

169
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,370
This concludes the report on Lashevan's performance for the first half of 2017.

170
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,390
I mean, how did you come up with the idea to personally be the model?

171
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,720
Your body is just...

172
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:35,720
In a crisis situation, it's the executive's job to provide a foundation, don't you think?

173
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,820
It makes me proud to see you do well in everything you put your hands on.

174
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,130
It's great.

175
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,200
I will come up with an improved business plan for overseas expansion within this week.

176
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,160
But when will you get married?

177
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,300
All of the marketing research is finished, and the marketing strategy needs to be modified—

178
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,580
When will you have children?

179
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,870
It's not in my plan for the time being. There's a mountain of work to do.

180
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,720
But you're already thirty-two. When are you going to get married? When?

181
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,050
Are you not going to give me grandchildren?

182
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,750
I told you to stop dating around so you can mature more. I didn't tell you to live your life like a monk in a Buddhist temple.

183
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,920
If you care that much, should I go to someplace to donate sperm?

184
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,660
Can't you get a grandchild that way?

185
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,240
What?!!

186
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,760
Then! Have a good morning.

187
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,560
I'll go back in to finish the meeting.

188
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,860
I-I...

189
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,010
No, no. It's fine.

190
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,670
It's fine, it's fine. Why are you making a fuss?

191
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:45,190
You know.. It's not very necessary for us to be here. I have an urgent matter, so

192
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,160
let's go!

193
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,500
Why is the atmosphere here like this? Are you half asleep?

194
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:03,340
It's not a formal place, so please eat comfortably.

195
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:08,450
By the way! This season's marketing strategy, who came up with the idea?

196
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,490
That... Our product's strengths, such as its recyclable fabric and three-dimensional design, etc will make it stand out—

197
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,010
So isn't showing the amazing functions right away

198
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,750
the ability of marketing?

199
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,570
I'll definitely keep that in mind!

200
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,860
Sorry. Please eat up. Sorry, sorry. Oh, and also!

201
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:33,190
I re-examined the whole overseas marketing strategy. Who will be the person to save Daebok Group from the crisis?

202
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,160
I will, me, Cha Jin Wook! Am I working by myself here?

203
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,220
If you're going to work so half-heartedly, don't even think about receiving your salaries.

204
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,160
Edit every single marketing strategy by tomorrow

205
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,440
and bring it to me. I better like the results.

206
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,890
What? Is there a problem?

207
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,940
Not at all!

208
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,570
You can eat up. It's not a formal place, so you can just eat

209
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,380
comfortably.

210
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,560
Thank you!

211
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,920
Enjoy it.

212
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,270
Hot dog!

213
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,980
If I'd known you'd like it so much, I would have done it more often.

214
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,710
Do it every day. Every day! Every day!

215
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,820
What to do? It's my last day here.

216
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,040
This is the last gift from me.

217
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,870
You're lying. You're lying, aren't you?

218
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,290
It's the truth. Starting tomorrow, I won't be here.

219
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,080
Even when I'm gone, don't leave any food behind.

220
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,420
Don't be picky,

221
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,780
and eat well. Got it?

222
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,050
Teacher! Don't go!

223
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,720
Teacher! Please, don't go!

224
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,700
Don't go.

225
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,850
Don't go.

226
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,780
Don't go.

227
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,220
Good job, everyone!

228
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,810
Good job!

229
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,230
Finally, we can work formally as nutritionists!

230
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,130
So where were you all assigned?

231
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,040
To university.

232
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,800
I was so worried that I'd end up in a rural area, but I'm so happy I ended up in Seoul!

233
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,900
I'm got assigned to a hospital.

234
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,330
What about you, Yoo Mi?

235
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,130
I'm in meal service.

236
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,320
Is it a company? Where?

237
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,260
Daebok Group.

238
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,040
Daebak (amazing)!

239
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,340
No, not daebak (amazing). Dae Bok (the company name).

240
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,610
Yes, Daebok!

241
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,380
Isn't that the company that's famous for its underwear? Wow.

242
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,550
Lee Yoo Mi got lucky.

243
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,630
Offices are the best!

244
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,790
You don't have to deal with children, and all of the meals are basically the same. Above all,

245
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,360
while you're working you can have a fling.

246
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,990
Raise your glasses. Today, nobody is going home!

247
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,360
Cheers!

248
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:25,600
Blackey. Blackey!

249
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,940
Blackey, what's wrong with you?

250
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:36,530
Why is your belly... Your belly... Hey!

251
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,930
Blackey, you... You're going to become a mother?

252
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:46,010
You must've found a boyfriend! You little rascal...

253
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:18,140
Now... the scent is gone.

254
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,160
Maek [Beer] & Book

255
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,750
Here is the beer.

256
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,190
Customer, you can't sleep here.

257
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,970
She's really drunk.

258
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,180
Customer, customer.

259
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,590
You can't—

260
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,910
What time is it?

261
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,640
Two in the morning, you punk! Go home. You sleep here every time!

262
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,850
And on top of that, you snore loudly.

263
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,830
It seems like I fell asleep while reading my book.

264
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,670
Hey, what kind of dream do you expect to dream after reading this? Your eyes are red.

265
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,340
Hey! Can't I dream as I please, at least?

266
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,850
But doesn't it seem like the sales are getting better?

267
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,370
There are people here even at this hour.

268
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:34,100
I'm tired.

269
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,090
- Isn't tomorrow your first day at your new job? You should head up.
- Yes.

270
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,370
Should I give you a wake-up call?

271
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,390
Thank you.

272
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,890
There's a door in front of you!

273
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,810
Daebok...

274
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:18,160
Well, I guess I'll see for myself. Whether it's amazing or it's a disaster.

275
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,630
Daebok

276
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,590
From 8:26 am till 8:52 you have a business report meeting.

277
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,930
From 9:03 am

278
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,430
- until 9:48 am—
- That's enough....for now.

279
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,710
Were you not able to sleep again?

280
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,590
You shouldn't be surprised, it's not the first time.

281
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,830
- Did you eat?
- I'll take care of it myself.

282
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:21,390
Please take care of your health. If you keep going on like this you'll really collapse.

283
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:28,050
Secretary Jang. Surely you aren't matching all the way down to your underwear?

284
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,360
If you're curious...

285
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,190
The door is closing.

286
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,490
Director?

287
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,160
Did you see that?

288
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,620
What are you talking about?

289
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,770
The woman dressed in black in the elevator.

290
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:06,020
Really, are you sure you're okay?

291
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,090
You don't have a fever, though.

292
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,570
Of course.

293
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,530
This is great!

294
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,970
Nutritionist's office?

295
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,710
Nutritionist Kim Ha Yeong

296
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,260
It's probably this, right? My place.

297
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,210
Okay. Where should I report for duty?

298
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,430
You did it, Lee Yoo Mi! I'm so proud!

299
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,820
I'm Lee Yoo Mi. Starting from today I will be the responsible nutritionist of the Daebok Group in-house meal service!

300
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,260
Please treat me well.

301
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,080
Where have you worked before?

302
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,120
I was at a school—

303
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,820
University?

304
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,520
No! Elementary school. The kids were adorable.

305
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,200
School meals and company meals are on different levels.

306
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,290
The number of staff to feed will be doubled.

307
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,790
If you don't take it seriously, you're in big trouble. Don't you think?

308
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,260
Of course! I'll work unconditionally and hard—

309
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,510
Don't work hard.

310
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,970
What?

311
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,700
Our chef here doesn't like stuff like that.

312
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,880
Newcomers try hard and have too much ambition. There are always accidents.

313
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,990
Do your own tasks properly. We know everything so we'll do all the rest.

314
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,800
Then, I... What should I do?

315
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,880
The potato order arrived late so it's coming now.

316
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,100
So I'll show you.

317
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,630
I'll go!

318
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,390
Let's go.

319
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,400
Yes, okay.

320
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,060
Then, I'll stop my inquiry! Everyone fighting!

321
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,810
Jenny Unni was supposed to peel the onions.

322
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:35,500
Once again she grabbed the chance to run away.

323
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,540
- You have to bring additional incoming ingredients directly.
- Oh, okay.

324
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,290
It seems like the Chef is quite shy.

325
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,580
After I get familiar with her she'll probably go easier on me, right?

326
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,760
No. Don't expect anything.

327
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,140
Even our previous nutritionist quit because she lorded over her.

328
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,420
Is that so?

329
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,520
But how old are you?

330
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,020
Twenty-eight years old.

331
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,300
So we're the same age?

332
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,700
Sexy!

333
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,810
Seems like he's wearing well-matching clothes once again today.

334
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,470
The person over there? But who is he?

335
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,100
He's the director's secretary.

336
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,400
That's unique. I thought all secretaries wore black suits at work.

337
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,910
Still, it's a stressful job.

338
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,090
Why?

339
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:29,790
Because the director of the company has a very bad temper.

340
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:34,280
You saw the timer that's in the kitchen, right? When that turns on, it means there's a meeting.

341
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,790
It's like some kind of time bomb.

342
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:41,600
By any chance, does the director eat in the company restaurant often?

343
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,730
No.

344
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:47,520
During the one year I've worked here, he hasn't come down and eaten there even once.

345
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,490
He doesn't even have time to eat, so he makes do with just instant food and bits of bread.

346
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,220
Only eating those wouldn't be good.

347
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,460
Despite that, his muscles and shoulders seem very fine.

348
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,190
If I could just once see him take his clothes off.

349
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,720
Daebok

350
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,080
Lashevan

351
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,200
General Manager Cha Jin Wook

352
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,230
Manager Cha, it's time for the business report meeting.

353
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,820
Oh.

354
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,860
Eun Bi, do you know where I can get my ID card?

355
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,930
You can collect it at the accounting office on the fourth floor.

356
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,910
Thank you.

357
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,820
Going up.

358
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,190
I need to take this job seriously if I want to put food on the table.

359
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,390
My coin!

360
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,240
Go on ahead.

361
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,520
Where'd my ₩500 (50¢) go?

362
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,720
Sit. Stay seated.

363
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,570
We don't have the time to stand up and sit back down, so sit down.

364
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,070
I heard that you all call this a time bomb?

365
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:53,390
I would like to hand a prize to the person who invented that nickname. The name is fantastic.

366
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,880
So let's finish this before it explodes.

367
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,210
There is still the issue of branding for the owner personally being a model to be brought up.

368
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,070
How about we hold a "free hugs from Cha Jin Wook" event?

369
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:05,110
Enough. Next.

370
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:08,150
We could host a fitting for male customers at the store

371
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,890
then measure testicular temperature to show it to them.

372
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:14,590
Sperm is most prosperous and active...

373
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:19,190
We make our product with the deotec fiber used by astronauts, so

374
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,090
we could recruit astronauts...

375
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,430
Are you joking?

376
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:24,410
Want to fight?

377
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,410
Next idea.

378
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,290
None left?

379
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,480
Is that really—

380
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,380
How many brains are in this room? And that's all you can come up wi—

381
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,980
General Manager Cha! General Manager Cha!

382
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,100
General Manager Cha!

383
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,030
What were you thinking? Health comes first.

384
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,240
Please leave the work to us for now.

385
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,460
- Now just rest for a while—
- And leave it to you?

386
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,700
Work is work, but you also have to pay more attention to eating.

387
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,320
Right! That's what I'm trying to say.

388
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,040
Right now, get a five-star chef—

389
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,970
Have you considered the costs of that?

390
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,830
Don't you know we're still in emergency management mode?

391
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:13,610
Don't spend business hours telling everyone what to do.

392
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:17,330
Just do your individual assigned work.

393
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:20,440
Yes, we should do that. Yes.

394
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,860
Please get some rest.

395
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,900
Let's go.

396
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:33,960
I will submit my resignation letter by tomorrow.

397
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,900
- What?
- It's my fault you fainted.

398
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,730
I failed to meet my responsibilities as a secretary.

399
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,390
What are you saying?

400
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,100
There's someone else who should be writing his resignation letter.

401
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,360
Thank you for everything up till now.

402
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,920
Secretary Jang. Secretary Jang!

403
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,870
Secretary Ja— Hey!

404
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,820
Hyung!

405
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,360
What do I have to do? What do you want?

406
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,010
Make sure you eat three meals a day.

407
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,340
What is he saying? He must be crazy.

408
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,140
Goodbye.

409
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,020
Okay, okay. I get it.

410
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,910
I'll just eat it. Okay?

411
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:10,450
Then I'll prepare the meals for you.

412
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,080
What? You're hiring a different nutritionist?

413
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,540
What law allows that when I just started...?

414
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,010
Hear me out.

415
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,030
I've considered hiring another nutritionist to be in charge of an exclusive task, but

416
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:27,540
I believe for our in-house nutritionist, who is responsible for the healthy diet of our employees,

417
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,040
to take charge of our general manager's healthy meals

418
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,160
would be much more reasonable and efficient.

419
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,220
I think it would be both

420
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,750
very systematic and economical.

421
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,660
So I'm not fired?

422
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,960
If you accept my offer.

423
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,560
I'll do it!

424
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,750
We'll take care of General Manager Cha's meals.

425
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:01,040
The general manager is, of course, also an employee of the company. Of course, we'll take care of it.

426
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,270
You look pissed.

427
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,370
That crazy little...

428
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,720
How can she say she'll do the job just like that?

429
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,020
So from now on, you're responsible for making General Manager Cha three healthy meals, breakfast, lunch, and dinner,

430
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,170
at the scheduled times each day.

431
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,080
All three meals, every day?

432
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,580
Is there a problem with that?

433
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,060
Ah, no. I mean, we already take care of all employees meals.

434
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,370
Of course, we can make a lunchbox for him as well!

435
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,450
Don't worry.

436
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,310
Then, for the next three months,

437
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,350
until General Manager Cha's health recovers completely.

438
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,920
I look forward to seeing your performance.

439
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,460
Goodbye, then.

440
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,980
It'll be okay, right?

441
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,000
Says who?

442
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,040
I mean, he is the company general manager.

443
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,330
He's the company general manager, so what?

444
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,790
What?

445
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,620
- What I'm trying to say is—
- Does he not have hands or feet?

446
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,230
Tell him to come eat in person.

447
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,250
He's quite the busy person, so I don't think he'll have time.

448
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,880
- Being short on ti—
- We're busy, too!

449
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,380
It's against the rules to take kitchen food outside the restaurant, but you didn't even know that, did you?

450
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,820
You don't know what you're talking about, but you didn't even discuss a word with us.

451
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,410
Is preparing food a joke?

452
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:19,740
If you threw away the menu just like that, can't you just knock up something with a hand blender?

453
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,760
Please don't get angry, Chef.

454
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,590
Chef.

455
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,560
Whether it's food or mush, you figure it out.

456
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,160
Don't think you can dump your work on us.

457
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,270
You guys just do your jobs. Understand?

458
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,650
Although it is true that proper language should be used, against newly coined words,

459
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,350
there is excessively strict and frequent resistance.

460
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:03,320
But does this bring about the best results for the quickly growing generation gap?

461
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,560
I'll take you home.

462
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,970
Operating room

463
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,000
Let's go to the company.

464
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,080
The doctor ordered quiet rest

465
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,300
- until you're stable—
- Will you listen to the doctor, or will you listen to me?

466
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,130
It's the doctor's orders. You're going home.

467
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,660
Joo Hye Ri

468
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,340
Did you tell her?

469
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:23,280
Even if I didn't tell her, she would have found out after going through every hospital in Seoul.

470
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,950
If I run into her, I'll have to be readmitted to the hospital.

471
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,620
Press it! Press it!

472
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,580
No, no!

473
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,680
Why? Why?

474
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,240
Emergency exit!

475
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:41,320
Cha Jin Wook, you rejected my call?

476
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,950
How annoying.

477
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,280
Isn't she the woman from TV?

478
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,160
Oh my.

479
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,720
Please prepare lunch immediately.

480
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,150
Sorry? Right now?

481
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,340
Yes, I understand.

482
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,790
Bye.

483
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,110
What do I do? What do I do?

484
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:06,130
If he fainted, he should get some rest. Why'd he get discharged so quickly?

485
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,990
Then this will be a thing for the next three months,

486
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:11,760
I look forward to seeing your performance.

487
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,060
♫ Fried rice, fry it, fry it ♫

488
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:22,230
♫ You fry it, I fry it ♫

489
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,360
It's burning!

490
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,660
Here you go.

491
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,060
Thank you for your hard work.

492
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,980
Hold on a second.

493
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,700
Then, goodbye.

494
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,790
I'm so nervous.

495
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,580
I wish you a speedy recovery. Enjoy!
- Nutritionist Lee Yoo Mi -

496
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,740
What is this?

497
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,320
I'm not sure. Vegetable porridge?

498
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,330
As if.

499
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,890
Does this look like porridge to you?

500
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:11,920
Dog food would be better than this. Throw it away!

501
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,630
Welcome.

502
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,910
Enjoy!

503
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,940
Yes, this is Lee Yoo Mi.

504
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,630
Sorry?

505
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,380
Make it again?

506
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:35,180
We're all out of cucumber kimchi too. What are you going to do?

507
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,990
Already?

508
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,340
What do I do?

509
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,800
General Manager Cha, your lunch is ready.

510
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,660
I'm leaving to work outside the office.

511
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,630
All of a sudden?

512
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:01,150
What do I do about dinner?

513
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,810
Yes, I'm on my wa—

514
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,490
Sorry?

515
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:12,420
General Manager Cha is getting off work and has left the office.

516
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:18,180
You should have told me earlier.

517
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:38,770
Give me some water, filled to the brim with ice.

518
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:49,140
Huh?

519
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,960
Hey.

520
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,750
You left the store and went out to play, didn't you?

521
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,820
My body felt stiff so I went to play one game of basketball.

522
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,000
Sir, would you mind signing this for me?

523
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Of course.

524
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,330
Thank you.

525
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:17,670
Boss of a bookstore, best-selling author.

526
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,320
Is it nice making money while you're having fun?

527
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,590
I'm running around all day like there's a fire.

528
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,570
You're more enviable than a person born with a golden spoon in their mouth.

529
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,350
You suffer all day long like a court lady in the royal kitchen staff.

530
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,940
That seems like a lot of pressure. Want a beer?

531
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,830
I stopped drinking.

532
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,440
I shouldn't drink.

533
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,470
Why? If you drink, you'll start reading erotic novels out loud, Assistant Manager B (the main character in the novel/drama "Assistant Manager B and the Love Letter").

534
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:41,860
Don't call me Assistant Manager B!

535
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,720
Ah. Don't come closer!

536
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,030
Ah! Don't call me that! Stop it!

537
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,960
Don't call me that.

538
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,850
Hey!

539
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,320
Let's stop it!

540
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,180
Stop. Stop it.

541
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,990
Okay. Truce.

542
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,980
Don't act up with this oppa.

543
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,560
This devil-like girl!

544
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,330
The lunch box. Let's do it!

545
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,600
I can do it.

546
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,430
Because I'm, the super, ultra best nutritionist in the universe!

547
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,800
Today, I prepared a bulgogi rice bowl.

548
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,240
Can I expect something good from you today?

549
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,500
Of course.

550
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,340
Then, goodbye.

551
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,570
It'll be okay, right?

552
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:04,800
Teacher! The missing banana order...the delivery man just arrived!

553
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,910
Okay.

554
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,410
Even if it doesn't taste good, you need it to stay healthy.

555
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,220
I get it. Leave it here and go.

556
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,290
Understood.

557
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:20,670
If you skip another meal, I'm going to submit my resignation letter.

558
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:23,090
I said I get it!

559
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,120
I'll eat it!

560
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:36,730
The smell.

561
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,740
Na Young, could you come in for a second?

562
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,080
Sure thing.

563
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,570
Don't tell Secretary Jang.

564
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:11,860
He threw it away without even tasting it?

565
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,790
This season's key products... Are they the ones here?

566
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,030
Yes, that's right.

567
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,490
The natural materials are manufactured with TENCEL fiber.

568
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:25,060
Also, because of the removable 3D structure, they are easy to keep clean.

569
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,020
Have you personally tried them?

570
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,140
Of course.

571
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,640
These days, I can't even wear anything other than our products anymore.

572
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,420
Sir.

573
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,650
Did Hye Ri not contact you?

574
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:52,520
Sorry?

575
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,310
I like her.

576
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,020
She would be perfect as a daughter-in-law.

577
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,000
I don't like her. She's too childish.

578
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,630
Then if I give you a mature woman, will you date her?

579
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:08,290
- No.
- You should have a wife!

580
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:14,090
You don't even have anyone on your side to care about your meals.

581
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:17,830
I do have a wife. Right here.

582
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,820
You, by any chance, has your heart been broken by a woman?

583
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,680
What are you talking about?

584
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,090
It's the women who get their hearts broken by me. There are a bunch of women! Ah, seriously!

585
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,660
Right, Secretary Jang? Secretary Geum?

586
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,250
Father. Sir!

587
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,850
You know, right?

588
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:47,470
I wouldn't call it a bunch.

589
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:49,790
Is General Manager really not here?

590
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:53,210
No, he's not here right now.

591
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:56,510
Then could you get this across to him?

592
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,720
Yes?

593
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:17,200
Let's go.

594
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:26,550
♫  Never even imagined, love love  ♫

595
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,850
♫  It’s in my eyes, love love  ♫

596
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:38,570
♫  Maybe it’s
Love love love  ♫

597
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:44,280
♫  It’s getting weirder
My heart  ♫

598
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:49,130
♫  You’re not even my ideal type  ♫

599
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:54,770
♫  It’s getting weirder
The way I see things are changing  ♫

600
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:58,890
♫  They say that’s how love comes  ♫

601
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:04,010
♫  Oh love, it’s like a playground, love  ♫

602
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:11,500
♫  You become a child
Laughing, crying and hanging out  ♫

603
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,840
Epilogue

604
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,720
So out of all of these advertisement models,

605
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,470
you couldn't even get one?

606
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:26,460
No. They all cost too much. We can't afford...

607
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,760
It doesn't fit our emergency budget.

608
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,740
Then, will you just let it go like this?

609
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:35,370
We have even tried finding newcomers. It seems like no one...

610
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:38,630
At the planning team, we think it would be good if you did it personally instead.

611
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:39,460
Me?

612
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:44,030
I'm sorry. The female employees are big fans of yours.

613
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,500
#Dilemma #IHaveToGetInShape

614
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,420
How am I supposed to do this?

615
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:52,460
You're speaking nonsense.

616
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,910
Advertisement shooting scene - General Manager's deadly release

617
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:02,190
#Workaholic #FlexingMyMuscles

618
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:10,420
#ThisIs #ExpertManager #CorrectPose

619
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,960
#ThisIs #Ordinary #TheGeneralManagersAbs

620
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:23,380
'The thing' that made Cha Jin Wook angry.

621
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,190
What is this?

622
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,360
I'm not sure.

623
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:31,030
Vegetable porridge?

624
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,490
#WhatIsThisDogFood #AsIf

625
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,590
As if.

626
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:39,720
Throw it out.

627
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,830
What are these mushrooms...

628
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,780
Am I Mario?

629
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,900
It seems to be porridge.

630
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:55,460
My Secret Romance

631
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,140
Sorry?

632
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,290
You're going to hire a different nutritionist?

633
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:03,380
But I just started working here.

634
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:06,820
You've deeply insulted me.

635
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,950
Out of all the companies, and out of all the restaurants...

636
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:09,750
I'm done for.

637
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:10,960
I'm done for!

638
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,120
I really have to lay down three meals every day at that rogue's feet...

639
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,020
One night?

640
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,540
So you're saying, the company's female employee, with that three-meals person?

641
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,030
