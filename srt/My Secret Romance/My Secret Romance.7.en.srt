My Secret Romance

2
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,030
My Secret Romance

3
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:09,980
Episode 07. Let's Go to Work

4
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,870
Wed. 18th: Bulgogi vegetable bibimbap, dried pollock potato soup... Thu. 19th: Rice, squid, and pork belly bulgogi...

5
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,040
Last time you didn't eat much so you were hospitalized,

6
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,950
and this time you ate too much so you were hospitalized.

7
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,610
Don't open your mouth about this at the company. If the board members or the chairman find out, it'll be tiring.

8
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,720
Yes, Sir.

9
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,860
It seems that it's been a long time since you slept so well through the night like that.

10
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,620
She returned home after watching over the room until late at night.

11
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,740
The nutritionist.

12
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,080
What? I didn't ask!

13
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,170
First let's go home so I can wash up.

14
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,070
Yes, Sir.

15
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,570
When we get to work, the meeting we canceled yesterday,

16
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,760
we'll have it in an hour, so tell them to prepare.

17
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,690
Yes, Sir.

18
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,280
He said she stayed until late at night?

19
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,210
Don't get sick.

20
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,430
Yes. Come in.

21
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,680
The breakfast menu is ginseng chicken porridge.

22
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,310
Eat it to comfort your insides.

23
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,890
Is your body feeling okay?

24
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,350
Yes.

25
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,410
Then, I'll get going.

26
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,910
Hold on. Sit here for a moment.

27
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,290
Take responsibility.

28
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,860
What?

29
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,900
What now?

30
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,640
For making me have an upset stomach.

31
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,100
Therefore, causing my work to be disturbed.

32
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,280
As my personal nutritionist, for failing to do your job,

33
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,720
you need to take responsibility for all of these.

34
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,810
Aside from the jewelry box,

35
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,560
let's settle everything neatly.

36
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,740
What do I have to do to take responsibility?

37
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,130
Eat with me.

38
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,780
So if I eat—

39
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,360
What did you say?

40
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,420
I'm saying if you're sorry then eat with me.

41
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,470
What kind of side-bursting-kimbap nonsense is that?

42
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,110
You don't want to?

43
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,420
No, it's not that. I just thought I misheard you.

44
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,810
You're saying I should eat with you?

45
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,320
I told you, I can't trust the food you made, so...

46
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,500
Let's eat together.

47
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,610
No more, no less, exactly ten times.

48
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's just say that the box that you broke was worth one million won.

49
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,700
Think of it as reimbursement of ₩100,000 ($100) per meal.

50
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,160
I'm giving you an opportunity.

51
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,500
Choose. Either take responsibility and leave the company...

52
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,630
or eat together with me.

53
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,550
What on earth? Is feeding a torture device now?

54
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,680
This is Jang Woo Jin. I was wondering if you have time for dinner tonight.

55
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,760
I have something to tell you.

56
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,820
If you're busy, maybe next time.

57
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,550
Am I dreaming? There's definitely something there. That's right.

58
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,730
Ten times is more than enough.

59
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,830
No matter how delicious it is, if you eat it more than ten times you get tired of it.

60
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,180
Even if I'm busy, no matter what, it's an okay.

61
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,910
Spoon worms and soju?

62
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,430
Today at seven o'clock...

63
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,540
At seven o'clock, have my car ready and look into delicious restaurants.

64
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,980
- Restaurants?
- What's the schedule like today?

65
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,460
I already have plans.

66
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,460
Not for you but for me. Who said I'm going to eat with you?

67
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,250
You are scheduled for a business visit, but it's not urgent.

68
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,590
Then postpone it to tomorrow.

69
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,050
I understand.

70
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,060
And it's too much.

71
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,150
What do you mean?

72
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,620
Your clothes, they're too much.

73
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,980
These clothes are my pride and

74
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,850
and my signature look. Don't mess with it.

75
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,730
As you wish.

76
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,080
That's quite an unfamiliar concept.

77
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,440
I told you, I can't trust the food that you make.

78
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,590
That's why, let's eat together.

79
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,960
No more, no less. Just ten times. I'm giving you a chance.

80
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,040
I've never been so insulted by someone asking me to eat together.

81
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,790
He sure knows how to make someone feel bad with anything he says.

82
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,670
What are you doing?

83
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,540
My mind was momentarily somewhere else.

84
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:47,790
Today at seven o'clock, meet me in front of the company.

85
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,750
- I've been thinking—
- What do you like?

86
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,510
Western, Japanese, Korean or Chinese? I made a reservation for everything.

87
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,030
Pick what you like.

88
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,020
I don't think this is right.

89
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,640
What? What's not right?

90
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,940
You said that you will take responsibility,

91
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,500
and I gave you a chance to take responsibility.

92
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,660
Exactly. I agreed to take responsibility as your nutritionist.

93
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,570
So?

94
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,380
I'll pick the menu.

95
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,400
Because I'm a nutritionist.

96
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,570
So, this isn't a date. This is related to work.

97
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,300
I mean, did anyone say it was?

98
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:56,280
Fine, Nutritionist Lee Yoo Mi, you can choose where we eat.

99
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,390
Then turn right from here.

100
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,830
Right, let's go.

101
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,920
♫ Love love love is so good  ♫

102
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,910
♫ Love love love is so good  ♫

103
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,560
My thighs surprise a lot of people.

104
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,790
Please drive carefully—

105
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,750
You're hitting me now?

106
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,800
♫ Love love love is so sweet ♫

107
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,330
♫ Love love love is so sweet  ♫

108
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,150
Is this it?

109
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,240
Even if it doesn't look glamorous, it's a famous restaurant.

110
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,900
I know what the fuss is all about. I would know that it's famous.

111
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,030
I hate unhygienic places.

112
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,530
And it looks like we have to sit on the floor.

113
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,500
But it's not my style,

114
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,930
because I have long legs.

115
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,530
Lee Yoo Mi. Lee Yoo Mi!

116
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,450
Lets go together!

117
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,390
Excuse me, a bottle of soju, please.

118
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,970
Put it around your neck like me.

119
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,840
You shouldn't let soup splash on your expensive clothes.

120
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,700
Not like I need an infant's bib. No thanks.

121
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,230
Everyone eats like this here. It's not a big deal.

122
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,780
Is this your first time eating loach soup?

123
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,940
This is my first and I think it'll also be my last.

124
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,100
Try it. There is no better food than this when you feel weak.

125
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,780
These are minced perilla seeds.

126
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,760
Add some according to your liking, I'll add a lot as I like it.

127
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,390
It's tasty right?

128
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,750
It's better than it looks.

129
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:32,510
Now, mix your bowl of rice into it.

130
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,490
And try it with diced radish kimchi, it's amazing.

131
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,370
What did you tell me to do?

132
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,330
Add your bowl of rice and...

133
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,140
Rice goes in. And then...

134
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,660
All because of, "Try it with diced radish kimchi." Seriously!

135
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,920
See? I told you to put on your apron.

136
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,350
Stay there.

137
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,870
Whoa! Ms. Lee Yoo Mi. If you do this you'll be in trouble.

138
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,450
Touching a man's chest just like that.

139
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,410
It's not that—

140
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,500
You were like that back in the car too. This woman isn't shy about physical contact.

141
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,270
When did I?

142
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,630
Very delicious.

143
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,170
Give me your hand.

144
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,650
You're very aggressive.

145
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,610
Eat this.

146
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,340
It's a palate cleanser.

147
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,300
What is that?

148
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,510
Loach soup.

149
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,630
For whom? Is it perhaps for him?

150
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,260
It's for my mom. My mom is a regular customer here.

151
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,550
Do you live with your mom?

152
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,270
Yes, it turned out that way.

153
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,040
That's a relief.

154
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,720
Pardon?

155
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,950
No, it's just... Let's go.

156
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,630
Seems like you have a good relationship with your mother.

157
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:30,780
No, we fight every day. We even fought a few days ago.

158
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,810
What about you?

159
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,690
I don't remember much about my mother.

160
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,440
My parents split up when I was very young.

161
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,930
I'm sorry.

162
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,240
My mother...

163
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,390
lives in Gangwon Province.

164
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,520
My mother enjoys eating abalone porridge.

165
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,300
She likes making it too.

166
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,300
Next time, shall we go out to eat abalone porridge?

167
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,890
That's okay, as it will never compare to my mother's porridge.

168
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,310
I wanted to take you to the front of your home.

169
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,760
I have to go to the store for Dong Goo's...

170
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:52,280
I mean, I need to buy food for my dog.

171
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,590
Okay then.

172
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,400
I shouldn't have brought up my mom.

173
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,300
Stay there.

174
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,650
Don't be sick.

175
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,970
Was it a dream? It was good though.

176
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:52,830
♫  It’s getting weirder, the way I see things are changing  ♫

177
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,700
♫  They say that’s how love comes  ♫

178
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,680
I like Jae In.

179
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,970
It's always like that at first.

180
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,000
Oh my, look at her huge breasts.

181
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,320
She got rid of her wrinkles too, she rubbed money all over her face.

182
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:13,670
But what has gotten into you? You bought the loach soup that I like and even bought snacks for Dong Goo.

183
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,010
Eat or curse at me. Choose one or the other.

184
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,490
My man is coming so...

185
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,000
That girl became an actress because of me.

186
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,550
If I hadn't gotten married because I got pregnant with you,

187
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,090
I would've starred in "It's Going to Burst 2."

188
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,620
That's how she became a star.

189
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,370
That's what I'm saying. Why did you get pregnant?

190
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,310
You should have done all the sequels to "It's Going to Burst."

191
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,800
In what way is she better than me?

192
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,890
My face and my body are superior in every way. Damn it!

193
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,460
You look beautiful today. Are you going somewhere nice?

194
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,070
I'm going to the broadcasting station to meet someone I know.

195
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,920
Hyeon Tae, can you escort me there?

196
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,600
Sure, I'll take you there.

197
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,670
Look at my hair. Don't tell Yoo Mi, okay?

198
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,800
- Yes.
- Thank you.

199
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,030
- Go in.
- See you.

200
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,740
Excuse me! Excuse me!

201
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,710
You're here from the shop right? You just have to take this and go.

202
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,980
- No, Excuse me.
- My bad, I have to pay in advance, right?

203
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,510
Here, you can have the change.

204
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,700
Excuse me, it's not that.

205
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,090
I'm sorry, I'll take a picture with you next time for sure.

206
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,370
I have to film a live show, so I have to go inside. I'm sorry.

207
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,090
Please take care of that.

208
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,100
Who is that woman?

209
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,270
Where did Mother go so early on a Saturday morning?

210
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,670
- Did you just get back?
- Yeah, because I met a weird woman this morning.

211
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,620
- A weird woman?
- Yeah.

212
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,510
- She paid me to run an errand as soon as we met.
- What?

213
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,610
A stranger paid you to run an errand?

214
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,140
So?

215
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,020
I did it. I even received money in advance. What could I do?

216
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,560
Do you want me to make you some toast?

217
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,560
What now?

218
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,090
Yes, Director Cha.

219
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,630
Let's eat.

220
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,020
What? It's the weekend.

221
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,450
Don't you eat on the weekend?

222
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,550
I do but—

223
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,090
I'll text you the address, so come quickly.

224
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,500
He always does whatever he wants.

225
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,140
Why? What did that jerk say?

226
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,580
It's nothing. It's about work.

227
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,250
I think I need to eat toast next time.

228
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,790
I'm sorry, but please look after Dong Goo. I'll be quick.

229
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,560
If something happens, call me.

230
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,100
Okay, I understand.

231
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,600
Excuse me, customer, for how many people?

232
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,130
Two.

233
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,890
I'd like a spacious window seat.

234
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,930
What's your name?

235
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,830
Cha Jin Wook.

236
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,380
I'll call you when a seat is available.

237
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,710
Thank you, bye.

238
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,510
Number nine, Jeong Seung Joo? Please go inside.

239
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:54,820
Wait a minute, if he was nine does that mean there are five parties ahead of me?

240
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,910
Yes, that's correct.

241
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,810
I'm Cha Jin Wook.

242
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,140
You just have to put your business card in that box yourself.

243
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,600
No, I'm not trying to participate in the event.

244
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,270
Do you need a tip?

245
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,780
Why are you being like this? I told you, if you wait, I'll call you.

246
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,870
We have rules.

247
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,070
We close down if we run out of ingredients for the day.

248
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:38,950
No phone reservations, everyone must wait in line, please wait.

249
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,960
What? What kind of ridiculous service...

250
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,650
Tell the owner to come out here.

251
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,670
I'm in charge here.

252
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,180
Don't lie! Seriously!

253
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,680
Director Cha, what are you doing right now?

254
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,670
I'm complaining about this restaurant's service.

255
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,580
Why are you being so embarrassing?

256
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,300
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Follow me.

257
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,660
I can buy this entire restaurant.

258
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,760
Director Cha, what are you doing in front of all those people? How embarrassing.

259
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,720
Embarrassing?

260
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,420
Yes, really, totally.

261
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,370
All of the people were waiting,

262
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,970
but you were persisting because he wouldn't let you in, and you were throwing a tantrum because he wouldn't give in.

263
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,120
How annoying.

264
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,240
Annoying?

265
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,870
If you have eyes then look over there.

266
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,930
With the person that they like,

267
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:36,650
to eat something delicious they've been waiting for since early morning.

268
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,340
How would they feel if someone cut the line?

269
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,000
They worked all week.

270
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,400
and managed to find some time over the weekend for a date.

271
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,800
But I don't even have a weekend. If someone tells me to come out I have to come out.

272
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,130
Well, you can consider this a date if you want.

273
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,270
How is this a date? This is my work to pay off my debt.

274
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,360
And you're the one who decides the time we meet.

275
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,890
Even if it is this way, I wanted to be with you.

276
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,850
I don't like to eat by myself.

277
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,010
You said this isn't date but work.

278
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,610
You're well dressed for someone who's at work.

279
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,880
It's not like that, I dress up on weekends.

280
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,640
I always dress up like this at home.

281
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,380
- Like this—
- Number 15, Cha Jin Wook.

282
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,190
Isn't that us?

283
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,830
Here.

284
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:14,650
♫  Love love love is so good  ♫

285
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,330
♫  Love love love is so good  ♫

286
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:22,050
Let's go to work.

287
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,540
♫ The sensual feeling of knowing  ♫

288
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,560
♫  Love love love is so sweet ♫

289
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,430
♫  Love love love is so sweet ♫

290
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,850
♫  Milky lattes ♫

291
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:41,850
♫  and pretty blankets that make you sleep ♫

292
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:48,870
♫  Everything is perfect, love is mint pink ♫

293
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,150
♫ Burning romance, please let it go ♫

294
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,900
♫ With that smile that was cold yesterday ♫

295
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,220
What are you doing?

296
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,160
♫ but warm today ♫

297
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,220
♫ You confuse me ♫

298
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,310
♫ Burning romance, what do I do? ♫

299
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,120
♫ Every day, I miss you ♫

300
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,720
♫ I don’t even know how I feel ♫

301
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,340
All done.

302
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,830
I could've done it myself.

303
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,830
Should I untie it again?

304
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,970
No, no need to untie what is already tied.

305
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,560
Let's go somewhere and have some tea.

306
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,630
Dong Goo.

307
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,350
No need, I have to go back home fast.

308
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:49,750
Home, why? Is there something urgent?

309
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,310
That...

310
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,110
I have to go feed my dog.

311
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,600
That is something I have heard somewhere before.

312
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,900
Then, I'll get going.

313
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,050
That's where it was, it's my dog's.

314
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:16,210
No, I have to go buy food for my dog.

315
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,420
I'm sure you can see.

316
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,600
Because I want together with you.

317
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,520
Lets go to work.

318
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,980
Is this how it feels to date?

319
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,900
How about Writer Jeong Hyeon Tae as our next guest?

320
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,500
Writer?

321
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,940
I know that person. Isn't he the one who writes travel essays.

322
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,690
He writes and takes photos himself too. He has so many followers.

323
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,260
He is handsome too.

324
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,890
Hey, it'd be amazing to have him.

325
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,960
But he doesn't appear on broadcasts so it'll be hard to cast him.

326
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,340
I've seen him somewhere.

327
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,840
Where did I see him?

328
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,460
Announcer Joo, do you know him?

329
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,640
He's not someone who I know but he looks familiar.

330
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,130
Wow, you have a large network.

331
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:42,650
First, Cha Jin Wook and now even Writer Jeong Hyeon Tae.

332
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:46,210
What do you think? Can we get your help this time too?

333
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,740
That's great, let's go for ten percent ratings!

334
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,740
Then, I'll meet up with him first.

335
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,430
Gongdeok-dong Romance

336
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,770
She became an actress because of me.

337
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,130
If I hadn't gotten married because I got pregnant with you,

338
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:19,430
I would have starred in "It's Going to Burst 2."

339
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,290
I'm so jealous.

340
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,100
Damn, my script!

341
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,790
You... Who the hell are you?

342
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:43,700
I'm sorry, you popped out so suddenly, so I didn't see you.

343
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,110
I'm sorry.

344
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:49,020
Are you implying that it was my fault?

345
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:54,860
Ma'am, I'm very sorry, please use this for dry cleaning.

346
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,060
Hey! What's your name?

347
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,610
What did you call your senior? ma'am?

348
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,550
Senior?

349
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,960
Did you have an audience role?

350
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,070
You don't know me? I'm...

351
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,550
Mi Hee, it's you, right?

352
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:17,630
Yeah, it's been a long time.

353
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,190
Nice to meet you.

354
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,460
Announcer Joo Hye Ri.

355
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,490
Hello, I'm really enjoying your drama. I'm a fan.

356
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,590
- I'm watching you too.
- Yes.

357
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,170
Is it okay for announcers to be so pretty?

358
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:34,070
You have such amazing skin.

359
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,870
Mi Hee, see you later.

360
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,000
Senior, if you are free...

361
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:55,720
What are you smiling at?

362
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,030
Me? I was smiling?

363
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:04,600
Yeah. Like this.

364
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,330
Was I like that?

365
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,790
You're acting is if you're coming back from meeting "Three Meals A Day."

366
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,940
Did something good happen? Can you stop making his meals?

367
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,460
No, I'm just in the process of paying off my debt.

368
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,260
Debt? Did you borrow money from him?

369
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,960
It's not like that. It's over after I just eat with him ten times.

370
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,930
What? What are you talking about?

371
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:30,490
Because making his food wasn't enough, you even have to eat with him now too?

372
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,390
Why would you eat with him?

373
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,810
Is that why you went out during your weekend off?

374
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,740
Hey, why are you getting so angry?

375
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,200
Hey, he's abusing his power.

376
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,570
How is it abusing his power by making me eat with him? I like it too.

377
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:53,420
I mean... I don't have to worry about cooking and I get to eat at good places.

378
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,800
And it also helps me develop my menu.

379
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,440
What? What? What? Do you know what it's like out there?

380
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,970
This is also part of work.

381
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:12,370
Fine. You don't have a reason to come down to the store tonight, do you?

382
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,740
Why? Are closing early so you can go out to have fun?

383
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,780
No, Min Go and the others are coming over.

384
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,650
I told them we can have alcohol from somewhere else,

385
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,960
but they said that they really wanted free alcohol. I'm sorry.

386
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,060
I didn't see you this morning. Where did you go?

387
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,300
Did you eat lunch?

388
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,620
I don't know! I'm annoyed so don't make me talk.

389
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,550
I wonder if she fought with someone.

390
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,410
Do you think your mother is a rooster that always fights?

391
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,310
Closed
Open: 3pm
Close: whenever

392
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,200
Is Lee Yoo Mi doing well?

393
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,120
Yeah.

394
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,670
We were pretty childish back then when we made her an outcast.

395
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,060
But Hyeon Tae made it easier for her.

396
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,440
I thought he liked Lee Yoo Mi.

397
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,650
How is it abusing his power by making me eat with him? I like it too.

398
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,510
Hello.

399
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:37,360
- Isn't this writer Jeong Hyeon Tae?
- Yes, it is.

400
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,770
Oh, yes, hello. I'm not calling too late, am I?

401
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,120
I'm Announcer Joo Hye Ri of "Celeb-Talk-Talk."

402
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,100
I see, but how did you get my phone number?

403
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,350
If you have time soon, I would like to meet with you just once.

404
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,400
And I also have a proposal to give you.

405
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,720
I don't do things like broadcasts. Bye.

406
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,270
What's with this rude jerk new guy?

407
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,310
He's just a petty writer. Wow, I'm furious again.

408
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,680
- Joo Hye Ri?
- Crazy idiot, you should just die.

409
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,790
You hung up on Joo Hye Ri first?

410
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,100
Why? is she famous?

411
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,450
You don't know?

412
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,820
The person who paid me to run an errand this morning.

413
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,440
Will this be enough?

414
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,910
You're here? You came to work early today.

415
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,650
It tastes better when it's presented nicely.

416
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,370
Yes, I'll remember that.

417
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,590
And this isn't much.

418
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:19,680
I noticed your hands are dry, this is hand cream.

419
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,840
I already had some, so use it.

420
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,710
Thank you.

421
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,580
What are you doing? Go fast, it's eight o'clock.

422
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,890
Thank you.

423
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,550
Come in.

424
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,740
I made eggs benedict for breakfast today.

425
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,350
You worked hard. You can go now.

426
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,550
What is it?

427
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,060
Have it.

428
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,780
You said that you don't like eating by yourself.

429
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:36,490
I'll stay with you while you eat.

430
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,610
Well, is this also going to minus from the number of times?

431
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,920
That would be nice.

432
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,620
No.

433
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,080
Half a meal?

434
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,420
Deal.

435
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:06,620
♫  It’s getting weirder, My heart  ♫

436
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:11,540
♫  You’re not even my ideal type  ♫

437
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:17,000
♫  It’s getting weirder, the way I see things are changing  ♫

438
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,730
♫  They say that’s how love comes  ♫

439
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,590
♫  oh love, it’s like a playground, love ♫

440
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:29,470
I feel awkward eating by myself. Let's eat together.

441
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,880
I ate a lot while making it.

442
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,630
♫  Thanks for staying by my side ♫

443
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,580
You can stop now.

444
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,120
Pardon.

445
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,770
You can stop making my meals.

446
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,450
♫  It’s getting weirder ♫

447
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:52,850
It's hard enough to eat with me, so preparing my meals,

448
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,070
I can't make you do that.

449
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,010
Really?

450
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,470
♫  The way I see things are changing ♫

451
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:04,850
Clear your schedule for tonight. I made reservations.

452
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:11,620
I think you got the order mixed up.

453
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,780
Before you made a reservation,

454
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:23,280
you should've asked me if I'm free tonight.

455
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,270
I can't today. I have an appointment.

456
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,260
Is it an important appointment?

457
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:45,630
My dog is annoyed by just staying at home.

458
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,870
I have to take him for a walk.

459
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,110
It sounds like you like your dog a lot.

460
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,300
I'm sure you know as you raise a cat.

461
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:01,420
I'm not actually raising the cat, she came in and started living there.

462
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,120
Anyway, I can't today.

463
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,480
And next time, make plans

464
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,840
one day before and let me know,

465
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,680
because I also have a schedule.

466
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,600
Yes, let's do that.

467
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:35,540
Father, with your help Jin Wook's interview was a success.

468
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,720
Thank you very much.

469
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:43,270
No need to thank me, I should support you at a time like this.

470
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,340
Didn't Jin Wook act stubborn?

471
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,720
No, he only talks like that.

472
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,430
He took great care of me on set.

473
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:57,820
He even prepared lunches for the entire staff to thank them for their hard work.

474
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,990
Really? Is he finally about to grow up?

475
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,390
By the way, when is the show airing?

476
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:10,970
Today, I took a little peek at it in the editing room.

477
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:13,280
It is totally amazing.

478
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,080
So, you surely must watch it.

479
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,230
Of course, I have to watch it.

480
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:22,500
I should watch it twice. Goodbye.

481
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,500
- Goodbye.
- Okay.

482
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,600
Punks, are you the only ones with grandchildren?

483
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,080
I will also.

484
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,570
Not much time is left.

485
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,850
- Cancel that reservation.
- Oh, that's right.

486
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,760
It was very hard to get that reservation. If you tell them to cancel it...

487
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,490
What did I tell you?

488
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:00,390
I told you to ask if they are free before making a reservation.

489
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,850
That is basic dating manners—

490
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:04,970
Date? What date?

491
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,120
This is work! Business!

492
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,920
I'm the creditor and she's the debtor.

493
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,260
You don't even know.

494
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,990
I understand. It's business.

495
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,530
I received a call from Hye Ri.

496
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,080
She said the show is airing today.

497
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,830
I'm not interested.

498
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,470
Don't put it off and secure a date.

499
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,530
It's not good manners to keep her waiting.

500
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,400
It's also not good manners to marry someone that I don't love.

501
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,170
I didn't know you were such a romanticist. Don't argue with me—

502
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:49,020
Father, you were also a romanticist at a point in your life.

503
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,070
What?

504
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,330
Even couples who love and live with each other break up.

505
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,720
With a woman I don't love,

506
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,310
how can I live with her? Am I wrong?

507
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:00,470
Am I doing this for me?

508
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:03,530
This is all for you—

509
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:08,830
If this is really for my sake, then please leave it alone. Please.

510
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,890
I'll get going then.

511
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,180
This is work! Business!

512
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,040
I'm the creditor and she is the debtor.

513
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:31,180
Three Meals A Day

514
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,390
Aren't you getting off work? There must be someone you are waiting for.

515
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:44,320
No, I still have to place some orders. You get off work first.

516
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,590
I smell something fishy.

517
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,210
No, it's nothing like that.

518
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,650
I'll get going then.

519
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,820
See you tomorrow.

520
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:23,270
Let's have dinner together. I'll wait for you on the first floor.

521
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:34,230
I knew it.

522
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:05,020
What are you looking around at, like a meerkat, before getting in?

523
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,780
To see if anyone is watching us.

524
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,320
I thought that you had to walk your dog.

525
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,750
For what reason did you change your mind suddenly?

526
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,790
I should repay my debt.

527
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,930
After I thought about it, I decided to do it.

528
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,920
To pay it back before my interest goes up.

529
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,120
And I'm sure my dog will understand too.

530
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,910
Did something happen?

531
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,810
Not at all.

532
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:41,640
But, where are we going?

533
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,490
I already canceled our reservation, so we can't go there.

534
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,300
Let's go to my house.

535
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,770
Sur—

536
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,330
House?

537
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:06,240
♫ Love love love is so good  ♫

538
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,230
♫ Love love love is so good  ♫

539
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:13,690
♫ Even if you don’t say it  ♫

540
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:18,170
♫ The sensual feeling of knowing  ♫

541
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:22,210
♫ Love love love is so sweet  ♫

542
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:25,980
♫ Love love love is so sweet  ♫

543
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,480
♫ Milky lattes ♫

544
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,370
♫ and pretty blankets that make you sleep ♫

545
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:40,130
♫ Everything is perfect, love is mint pink ♫

546
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:45,850
♫ Burning romance, please let it go ♫

547
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:49,770
♫ With that smile that was cold yesterday ♫

00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:53,740
♫ but warm today ♫

549

♫ You confuse me ♫

00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:01,790
♫ Burning romance, what do I do? ♫

551
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:05,590
♫ Every day, I miss you ♫

552
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:09,730
♫ I don’t even know how I feel ♫

553
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:13,660
♫ I think i love u so good ♫

554
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:18,530
Then, I'll get going.
Epilogue: Things are getting stranger between us.

555
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:27,990
♫ What’re you thinking about? ♫

556
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:33,270
She's not my ideal type, my heart feels odd.

557
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:38,610
♫ Half fear half excitement ♫

558
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:42,530
♫ They say that’s love ♫

559
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:45,130
♫ It’s getting weirder ♫

560
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,200
#HalfScared #Half Excited. #ThatsWhatTheySayLoveIs.

561
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:53,080
♫ You’re not even my ideal type ♫

562
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,660
♫ It’s getting weirder ♫

563
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,700
♫ The way I see things are changing ♫

564
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:03,960
♫ They say that’s how love comes ♫

565
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,990
♫ oh love, it’s like a playground, love ♫

566
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,910
Then turn right from here.
Epilogue: Going to work on a summoned date!

567
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,510
Right.

568
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,220
Right!

569
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:29,400
My thighs surprise a lot of people.
Unbelievable. When does a workaholic find time to work out?

570
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,840
Please drive more carefully.

571
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:40,230
You're hitting me now, huh?
Cha Jin Wook is joking now.

572
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,740
What did you say? turn right?

573
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,560
No.

574
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:50,330
Then U-turn?

575
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,460
I hate unhygienic restaurants.
The boss' picky preferences.

576
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,020
And it looks like we have to sit on the floor.

577
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,840
I can't do that either.

578
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,250
I have pretty long legs, you see.

579
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:11,600
Lee Yoo Mi! Lee Yoo Mi!

580
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,030
Let's go together.

581
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,130
My butt hurts and my legs hurt. This is the first time I'm sitting like this.

582
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,580
♫  I'm intimidated by the glances surrounding me  ♫

583
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,150
♫  Listen. Just like an infant cuddled up  ♫

584
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,670
♫  Head bowed into fetal position holding my breath  ♫

585
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,210
♫  I'm the owner of a bean-sized liver  ♫

586
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,590
♫  World's number one coward  ♫

587
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:27,170
♫  A kick in the air for a penalty shoot  ♫

588
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,590
♫  I'm always worried in advance  ♫

589
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:30,160
♫  My hair is thinning  ♫

590
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,630
♫  A circular balding soccer ball ♫

591
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,200
♫  Come on everybody sing ma song  ♫

592
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,650
♫  Come on everybody sing my song  ♫

593
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,680
♫  Height, height, height, height, tall, tall, tall, tall  ♫

594
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,660
♫  If I get taller, if I get taller, if I get taller,  ♫

595
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,770
It's delicious... Ugh, because you wiped it with the wet... It's... Ah!

596
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:52,140
I was already irritated! You knew that yet...

597
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,730
It's delicious.

598
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:24,080
You made it to give me digestive problems

599
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,660
so I would not be able to work,

600
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,970
so that you can't be my personal nutritionist.

601
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:39,100
For all of that, take responsibility.

602
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:47,420
As well as the jewelry box issue, let's settle everything neatly.

603
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:49,930
How can I take responsibility—

604
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:51,900
Eat with me.

605
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,350
My Secret Romance

606
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,390
What do you think? It's a little interesting now, isn't it?

607
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:01,180
This woman... Makes it impossible to take my eyes off her for even a moment.

608
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,780
Go on in before me.

609
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:06,410
Did I just get one-upped by a puppy?
