Episode 5: The Secret of a Jewelry Box

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,770
- Secretary Jang, doesn't it feel like something is missing?
- Pardon?

12
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,230
I just feel like something is missing.

13
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,930
You ate Chinese food 32 minutes ago and said,

14
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,630
"I feel like my stomach is going to explode."

15
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,010
I did. I said that, but something is missing.

16
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,860
Then would you like to go to a restaurant on your way back?

17
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,910
No, I'm not that hungry.

18
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,730
Isn't there something more simple?

19
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,820
Are you talking about your company lunchboxes, by any chance?

20
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,180
You're right! I could eat a lunchbox.

21
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,000
But it's the weekend.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,860
Yeah, it's me.

23
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,710
Mommy?

24
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,680
M-Mommy?

25
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,420
- H-Hello?
- Where did she go without her son?

26
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,080
Three Meals a Day Jerk

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,430
Hello?

28
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,750
Who was that just now?

29
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,100
That was me, I was sleeping when you called! I thought it was my mom.

30
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,320
But why did you call me?

31
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,660
I skipped some meals.

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,630
I'll send you my address, so come and prepare my meal.

33
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,880
Pardon? It's the weekend though.

34
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,420
Haven't you already had a few days off while I was on the business trip?

35
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,050
- Are you trying to slack off right now?
- Oh.

36
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,340
It's not that.

37
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,330
Don't be late.

38
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,450
I will arrive in two hours. If you don't come,

39
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,390
I'll consider it as you neglecting your duties.

40
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,700
Dong Goo, where did your mom go?

41
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,540
You better not misbehave.

42
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,820
- Be quiet and calm, and stay right by my side. Got it?
- Yes.

43
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,210
Let's go.

44
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,890
Does he sleep on the couch? Why does he act so frugal?

45
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,770
It's not like he acts humbly elsewhere.

46
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,010
I guess he doesn't have a bedroom.

47
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,460
Black pepper. Black pepper...

48
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,300
There is none. Wow, only the house is nice.

49
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,090
How can a chaebol (rich person) not have a cook?

50
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,350
Dong Goo.

51
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,020
Didn't I tell you to stay still?

52
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,970
Did the contents break too?

53
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,850
Should I open it?

54
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,430
Ring? Necklace?

55
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,070
No. There must be a different owner for this.

56
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,280
Lee Yoo Mi? Lee Yoo Mi?

57
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,420
Job complete!

58
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,850
I'm leaving first because I have something to do. Enjoy the food.

59
00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:00,390
It's not like she's a snail bride.
 (Snail bride is a Korean traditional fable about a man who marries a maiden who came from a snail shell but loses her after breaking a taboo.)

60
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,610
She said she threw this out.

61
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,530
What do I do if he wants me to compensate for it?

62
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,530
If he asks, then I should just deny it.

63
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,920
It looks expensive.

64
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,260
Because of that rascal...

65
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,750
What is this?

66
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,990
If you put a slice of bread in your mouth while cutting an onion,

67
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,430
you can cut the onion without tears.

68
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,950
- Remember this.
- Wow!

69
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,640
I'm going to learn well from you and cook something delicious.

70
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,330
For who? Your boyfriend?

71
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,360
It's a secret.

72
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,440
He said they weren't in any relationship.

73
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,030
There's definitely a diamond inside.

74
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,210
A huge diamond.

75
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,940
Joo Hye Ri's beef kebabs are done!

76
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,350
I would like someone in the audience to

77
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,570
- try this for the viewers.
- Me!

78
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,000
I volunteer to eat it.

79
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,590
Can you please help us then?

80
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,550
It's so salty.

81
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,590
It's s-salty?

82
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,380
I'm well known for being a bad cook, but

83
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,830
even I can do better than this.

84
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,570
Teacher, you are putting a lot of effort into this lunch box.

85
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,730
You went out to eat with the General Manager alone. By any chance..?

86
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,630
I sense that a lot of care and attention went into this lunchbox.

87
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,630
Care and attention? No way!

88
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:22,460
I'm just putting my conscience into his daily meal.

89
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,600
Our General Manager Cha will probably say...

90
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,780
Am I a kid?

91
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,190
That's not it, General Manager.

92
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,180
If that's not it, then what? What? What?

93
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,550
What? Are you asking me out?

94
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:45,180
What? Why are you saying that so out of the blue?

95
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,440
You see. It's not like you will make this kind of lunch box for just anyone.

96
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:58,730
- I see. This lunch box does have a meaning but—
- What?

97
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,940
That's not what I meant.

98
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,920
From now on, I forbid you from

99
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,370
making a lunchbox with faces like this.

100
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:16,140
Like I said, you should put more effort into the cafeteria meals, not these.

101
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,380
Okay.

102
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,550
- Why did you lie?
- Pardon?

103
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,170
My coat.

104
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,930
You said you threw it out.

105
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,040
The thing is, it looked so expensive that I couldn't.

106
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,090
Is that all? Because it looked expensive?

107
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,620
Yes.

108
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,620
Do you have anything more to say?

109
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,930
I'm sorry.

110
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,390
- Just know that thanks to me you weren't fired.
- What?

111
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:04,390
Do you think the executives came to the cafeteria because they had nothing to do?

112
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,700
You would have been fired on the spot if you hadn't selected the right meal plan that day.

113
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,050
I didn't know that.

114
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,090
Am I getting fired? OUT!! YOU ARE FIRED!! I'm doomed!

115
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,450
Should I beg on my knees? Should I tell him the truth? That jewelry box looked expensive. What if he asks for compensation?

116
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,950
Should I get a loan? What if I can't? Am I going to jail? I don't want to go to jail.

117
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,010
I'm so sorry.

118
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,440
I mean— thank you.

119
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,850
Did you really do something wrong to me?

120
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,720
No. I mean that from now on, I will make better lunch boxes.

121
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,390
I will do my best.

122
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,950
You can leave.

123
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,630
She had a cute side that doesn't even suit her.

124
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,100
You should try it, Father-in-law.

125
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,790
You personally made all of this?

126
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,380
Yes.

127
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,650
I recently joined a cooking program. I'm learning little by little.

128
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,690
Our Hye Ri is perfect from head to toe.

129
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,910
You are perfect as a daughter-in-law.

130
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,860
How does it taste?

131
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,930
What do you think?

132
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,600
Obviously, it's delicious since you made it.

133
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,910
That's a relief.

134
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,130
I'm worried about Jin Wook Oppa.

135
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,700
What about Jin Wook?

136
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,990
I know he's an extremely picky eater,

137
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,510
so I'm worried about the quality of the company lunchboxes he eats.

138
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,130
He eats lunchboxes as a meal?

139
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,720
You didn't know? Oh no!

140
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,300
It's good you are here. She said that you eat lunchboxes. Is that true?

141
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:38,970
Yes, she's correct. I'm eating them because of health reasons.

142
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,580
You rascal. Just get married then!

143
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,560
I'm not getting married to find someone to cook for me.

144
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,340
It's already late as it is. I want to

145
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,450
hold a sturdy grandson in my hand.

146
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,590
You're funny, Father-in-law.

147
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,920
Quit being an announcer.

148
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,960
Really? You're going to marry me?

149
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,670
You will do well if you pursue acting.

150
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,460
- Oppa.
- I'm scared of you now.

151
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,280
Me?

152
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,790
You don't get a free pass for everything just by acting cute. Don't just show up without notice and surprise me.

153
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,630
Also, don't make me into a weird person like you did last time in the cafeteria.

154
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,360
Do you have feelings for that girl?

155
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,910
What is there to feel?

156
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:35,170
You can't fool me, Oppa. I have great intuition.

157
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,570
There is something between you two, right? I can tell.

158
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,560
Joo Hye Ri.

159
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:47,300
I'm not good at playing hard to get, Oppa. No. I don't play hard to get at all.

160
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:53,310
I will act how I feel for you so don't tell me what to do.

161
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,290
I'm going to do whatever I want to.

162
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,190
Everyone can see that you're my man.

163
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,350
Why? Because I decided so!

164
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,410
When will she grow up?

165
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:24,190
I think she's sick somewhere (mentally).

166
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,990
Diamond necklace

167
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,220
I'm sorry.

168
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,330
I apologize.

169
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,670
What are you so sorry about?

170
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,370
Just this and that.

171
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:59,640
Do you still walk in and out of Jin Wook Oppa's room with those lunch boxes?

172
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,110
Walking in and out with lunch boxes is my job. That's all.

173
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,590
Fine. I will believe you.

174
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:14,430
Three lunch boxes a day, that's all. You should know your place,

175
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:19,260
Nutritionist Lee Yoo Mi.

176
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,860
Hold on a moment. Joo Hye Ri, can I get an autograph?

177
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,330
Of course.

178
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,800
- What is your name?
- It's Nam Joon Young.

179
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:15,960
I see. This lunch box does have a meaning, but it doesn't mean that.

180
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,200
No way.

181
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,500
No way!

182
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,190
Shit.

183
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,500
No way!

184
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,350
Yes? Dinner is almost ready. Why are you calling suddenly?

185
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,000
Okay.

186
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,650
Are you okay, Teacher?

187
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,060
I'm okay.

188
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,320
Why did it have to break right now? It's like a bad omen.

189
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,810
For the marketing plan for the Spring/Summer 2018 edition of Cool Bodies,

190
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,590
- if we target the men in their 20s and 30s—
- No.

191
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,820
She didn't see it.

192
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,440
If we show them

193
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,600
a famous sports team and collaboration—
- If she saw it... Well...

194
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,630
It's not that valuable. Why does it matter?

195
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,970
That pervert. Why does he have this?

196
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,890
Cha Jin Wook, don't tell me you kept this until now?

197
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:39,210
That's impossible. That's impossible. Impossible.

198
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,440
I will do it again.

199
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,500
What are you doing? Why aren't you doing it?

200
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,360
He hasn't skipped a meal for a while. Why isn't he eating today?

201
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,750
Three Meals a Day Jerk

202
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,370
You've deeply insulted me!!!

203
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,910
You've deeply insulted me!!!

204
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,530
Up until yesterday, he definitely

205
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:05,540
used an ellipses after his status.

206
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,340
Why do I get bad feelings from these exclamation marks?

207
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,300
No way. Did I get caught?

208
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,610
Why won't you personally deliver this?

209
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,190
I have a lot of things to do today.

210
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,930
Please tell General Manager that I put even more effort into it today.

211
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,610
I understand. I'm leaving.

212
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,100
You're not wearing polka dots today. It was sexy.

213
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:47,450
Do you also match your undergarments?

214
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,480
I'm curious. I want to see it.

215
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,030
What is your phone number?

216
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,530
010....

217
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,210
I said I didn't feel like eating.

218
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,910
I told her, but the nutritionist still brought it.

219
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,910
Mistake
1. Mistake. Wrong.

220
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,790
2. Misunderstood. Misjudgment.

221
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,870
Is there a problem?

222
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,160
This girl...

223
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,790
Why? Why? Why?

224
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,290
I said I didn't feel like eating.

225
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:46,720
Why did you bring it when I told you I didn't want? Are you a brick? What's with your clothes?

226
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,300
The General Manager got angry as soon as he opened it.

227
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,890
What on earth did you write on the note?

228
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,340
I'm sorry.

229
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,340
Steak

230
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,000
Steak.

231
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,860
My mistake.

232
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,990
It was just a mistake.

233
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:19,290
So don't misunderstand? Seriously.

234
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,920
Mistake?

235
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,350
So you're saying you've identified one of my flaws?

236
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,500
This. This...

237
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:47,420
This... Why in the hell did I leave this in here?

238
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,310
What is so important about this?

239
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:00,410
Oh my gosh! That scared me. Those eyes.

240
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,930
What the?

241
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,190
Whose eyes are those?

242
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,370
- It's delicious!
- Your mom is on the TV.

243
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,360
Is he sleeping?

244
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,800
Where's Mom?

245
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,390
She went out because she had an appointment.

246
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,100
Have you seen Dong Goo's rabbit doll?

247
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,060
I searched everywhere but couldn't find it. Isn't that his favorite toy?

248
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:04,110
I'll have to search for it tomorrow. Give him to me.

249
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,200
One second.

250
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,530
Hello?

251
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,400
Where are you right now?

252
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,590
I'm home.

253
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:23,400
Come out. I have something to say to you.

254
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,090
- Right now?
- This instant!

255
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,790
I can't right now. Can we talk tomorrow at work?

256
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:39,190
- You can't? Fine. I'll come to you.
- What?

257
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,250
You don't even know where my house—

258
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,780
What's wrong? Who is it?

259
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,520
The grim reaper who is coming to get me.

260
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,700
How did you know where my house was?

261
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,670
Resume.

262
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,620
I searched when I first saw you

263
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,130
hoping that I was seeing a hallucination.

264
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,130
That's my precious personal information.

265
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,530
You live at a place like this?

266
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,650
What is it you wanted to talk about, General Manager?

267
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,150
This is yours, right?

268
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:55,580
So this was at your house. It's my brother's.

269
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,260
No. It's my dog's.

270
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,400
So it was there.

271
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,790
This was in my study.

272
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,760
Did you go in there?

273
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,030
The thing is—

274
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,840
Stop beating around the bush and tell me specifically.

275
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,160
What did you see in there?

276
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,850
I'm sorry.

277
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,600
It's a jewelry box. I bought one that looks the most similar.

278
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,010
I know the one you have is worth so much more but

279
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,130
please accept this and calm down.

280
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,720
You opened it, right? You opened it and saw what was inside, right?

281
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,250
The size was pretty obvious.

282
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,180
Whoever wears something that big

283
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,910
- Will probably have neck pain!
- What?

284
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,690
Wearing?

285
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:59,420
- The bigger the better, right?
- Bigger?

286
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,910
This girl really speaks her mind!

287
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,820
You're really scary. Did you have fun? Huh?

288
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,360
Did you enjoy toying with me after you found out?

289
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,730
Toying with you? My mind was frazzled. It was a tough time.

290
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,620
You want me to believe you?

291
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,880
I know I accidentally touched something I shouldn't have, but

292
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,390
you were the one who asked me to come to your house!

293
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,250
If you hadn't asked me to come over on my precious weekend, I wouldn't—

294
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,970
Stop!

295
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,410
What? What about it? Just because I saw that,

296
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:34,010
do you think I would be taken aback? It's not even important.

297
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,770
You should stop.

298
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,640
Who are you? Move.

299
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,570
I can't. Did you not go home yet, Hyeon Tae?

300
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,550
Who is this bastard?

301
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,950
As you can see.

302
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:11,150
Is this for real, Lee Yoo Mi?

303
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,890
You are the general manager of the company where Yoo Mi works, right?

304
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,120
I don't know what the problem is but you should talk about business matters at the office.

305
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,410
You should go home now, that's enough.

306
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,730
Let's go.

307
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,870
Relax. Relax.

308
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,590
Let's go.

309
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,080
Seriously.

310
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,230
Who is this girl?

311
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,760
I found it.

312
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,380
I left this here.

313
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:50,430
- Did you come back just for your game system?
- Yeah.

314
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,220
Why were you acting like that before?

315
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,010
I...

316
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:14,200
Wasn't I really cool? Like the main character in a drama?

317
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,490
You're out of your mind.

318
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,390
You were in a tough situation.

319
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,110
Just say you have a boyfriend if he bothers you.

320
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,380
I'll be your boyfriend.

321
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,030
Forget it. It's not like that.

322
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,400
- I'm tired. I should sleep. I'm leaving first.
- Okay. Go on in.

323
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,470
Yeah, well.

324
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:02,670
There's no way she would have stayed single since then.

325
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,560
I thought she was his former teacher's daughter.

326
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,750
He told me not to get the wrong idea.

327
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:24,120
Stop beating around the bush and tell me specifically what you saw in there.

328
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,920
Why are you acting like this, Lee Yoo Mi?

329
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,160
It's not like you're in any relationship with Three Meals a Day Jerk.

330
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:39,160
Make sure to eat three meals a day with Joo Hye Ri,

331
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,420
and eat and live well.

332
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,830
Cheers, cheers!

333
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,500
I'm telling you I'm right.

334
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,340
They're really going to start dating after the drama production is over.

335
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,410
Oppa, I've had some drinks with coworkers.

336
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,040
Can you come pick me up?

337
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,380
Call your driver.

338
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,710
You're acting very arrogant, Cha Jin Wook.

339
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,820
What did you say, Hye Ri?

340
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,820
Ah, Writer! Producer!

341
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,280
Cheers!
- Cheers.

342
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,750
It's good. It's good.

343
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,500
How's the casting proceeding for the next week's interview?

344
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,130
My head hurts because of it.

345
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,460
The CEOs are all so busy.

346
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,090
- CEO?
- Yeah.

347
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,850
There is no one that is handsome,

348
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,540
capable, and eloquent.

349
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,300
I'll invite someone for the interview.

350
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,090
Really?

351
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,480
Do you have someone in mind who you can ask?

352
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,610
I do. We are very close.

353
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,210
Goodnight, Lee Yoo Mi.

354
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:19,490
You're the first person to ask me if I'm alright.

355
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,620
I have never seen a girl who cried because I asked if she was alright.

356
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:28,280
It's also a first, that a crying girl looked pretty.

357
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,890
Come in.

358
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:08,320
I have prepared a salmon steak lunch box for breakfast.

359
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,340
Take this.

360
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,820
Okay.

361
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,500
Take this.

362
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,530
Put this away immediately.

363
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,690
Also,

364
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,620
don't ever mention this to me again.

365
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,190
Do you understand?

366
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,360
Yes, I understand.

367
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,350
I think you can let go of my hand.

368
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,220
I'll take my leave.

369
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:10,750
Who was that guy yesterday?

370
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,910
Is he your boyfriend?

371
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,300
If he bothers you again, just say you have a boyfriend.

372
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:31,410
Do I have to tell you about my personal life?

373
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:35,190
Does he live there with you, by chance?

374
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:41,050
I don't have to answer this because it's a personal question, right?

375
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,720
You don't have to.

376
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:51,970
But your taste in men isn't that great.

377
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:57,950
He looked like a total slacker to me.

378
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,510
Everyone in our neighborhood considers Hyeon Tae to be a total gentleman, okay?

379
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,530
He is very caring.

380
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:08,890
He's on a different level than a certain someone who's only slick on the outside.

381
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:12,980
Who? Slick?

382
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,920
I'm busy, so I'll be leaving now.

383
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,010
That...

384
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,710
She wanted me to hear that, didn't she?

385
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,240
Who is she calling slick? This woman...

386
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:37,430
Seriously. Why do you keep making the lunch boxes look cuter and cuter?!

387
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,340
Judging the appearance of my best friend?

388
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,600
He should just treat his own girlfriend well.

389
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,590
What are you mumbling about? Are you not going to work?

390
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:04,320
There's too much work to do. Why don't you come back right away after giving his meals?

391
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,770
It's not like you're dating the general manager.

392
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:10,580
It's exciting to have an office romance. It's a turn on.

393
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,950
General Manager Cha is mine.

394
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,890
I'm sorry.

395
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,770
What is that?

396
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:26,730
Oh, this? Joo Hye Ri recommended this on "The Best Pupil of Cheongnam-dong."

397
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,730
Do you want to try? You really don't tear up.

398
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,850
I'm fine.

399
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,670
Stop talking.

400
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,240
Is there a reason for you to spit all over the food? What are you doing?

401
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,920
I'm sorry.

402
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,190
Your patterns are becoming flashier.

403
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,440
I'll take that as a compliment.

404
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,600
- What's this book?
- Oh, this?

405
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,900
I'm going to read this while I wait. "Miss Good Morning."

406
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,530
Someone recommended it to me.

407
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:06,520
On the Road to Europe

408
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,120
You must be the director where Yoo Mi works. Please go back home.

409
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,240
Everyone in our neighborhood considers Hyeon Tae to be a total gentleman, okay?

410
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,680
So he's a petty writer, I see.

411
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,270
Do you know him?

412
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:23,150
As you ordered, I made a dinner reservation at the Royal Department Store after your meeting.

413
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,270
- It's on the VIP floor–
- Cancel the reservation.

414
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,690
Excuse me?

415
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,600
I'm coming back after my meeting.

416
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,170
I'm going to eat my lunchbox for dinner.

417
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,860
Director Cha, you should return my book.

418
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,680
This f*cking guy.

419
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,380
Director Cha.

420
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:45,050
He said I didn't need to make his dinner today, so what's with this sudden message?

421
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,810
Dinner is just an excuse to fulfill his real objective.

422
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:51,850
Nutritionist Lee, we're heading home first.

423
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,870
You all worked hard today.

424
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:57,320
Someone almost filed a complaint saying that we ran out of cucumber kimchi.

425
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,640
Where has your mind been lately? Huh?

426
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,470
I'm so tired of this.

427
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,820
Did something bad happen to Chef?

428
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,420
It must be her spinal disc again.

429
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,460
Disc?

430
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:14,120
It's hard to stand for a long time. She won't get surgery

431
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,770
because of work, and she's the head chef, so she can't quit.

432
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:19,360
So please be understanding, Nutritionist Lee.

433
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,450
- I'll get going then.
- See you tomorrow.

434
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,600
- Goodbye.
- See you.

435
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,160
Oh, right. His dinner.

436
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,030
This is a Korean-style Nasi Goreng (Indonesian fried rice).

437
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:49,100
I modified the recipe to get rid of the unique scent to suit your taste.

438
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,700
Good work. You can go now.

439
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,600
Yes.

440
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,830
Do you want to go to Han River with Dong Goo tonight?

441
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:44,380
Deal! I'll be done with work soon.

442
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,820
Three Meals A Day Jerk

443
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,260
Why is the proportion so small today?

444
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,660
Prepare another dinner right now.

445
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,430
Right now?

446
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:05,480
I'm in trouble. I don't have enough ingredients.

447
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:11,110
These are rice balls with minced meat.

448
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,440
You ordered food so suddenly, I used what I had—

449
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,250
Okay, you can go.

450
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,690
Yes?

451
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:37,660
Hey, why aren't you here yet? I thought you were done soon.

452
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,200
I'm going crazy because of that Three Meals a Day Jerk.

453
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,560
He asked me for additional meals multiple times already.

454
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,860
Hey. He ate two dinners already. Does this make any sense?

455
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,910
- Is he a human?
- OMG.

456
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:57,620
Anyway, I'm running late after caring for his appetite.

457
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,470
So, we need to cancel our plans to go to the Han River.

458
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,590
Then should I pick you up?

459
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,320
Really?

460
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,070
Will you pick me up?

461
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,500
I'll call you back later.

462
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,180
Is someone coming to pick you up?

463
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,460
Um, no...

464
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,580
But, what brings you here?

465
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:44,650
- I'm hungry.
- What?!

466
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,840
I'd like...

467
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:53,390
ramen.

♫ You’re not even my ideal type  ♫

483
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:13,280
♫  It’s getting weirder, the way I see things are changing ♫

484
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,050
She's talking about me, isn't she?

485
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:19,830
She called me slick. This woman...

486
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:30,190
Seriously. And why are the packed meals getting cuter and cuter?

487
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:53,170
Huh? What's with these meals? Huh? I told you not to make me cute...

488
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,000
♫ Beautiful  ♫

♫ Beautiful  ♫

491
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,470
This is making me more full.

492
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:30,490
So what?

493
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:36,600
There was no reason for that woman to stay single all this time.

494
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,770
Yeah, that's right.

My Secret Romance

497
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:18,450
I told you I can't trust the food you make. Let's get back to work.

498
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:22,220
I've never been insulted by an offer to eat together.

499
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,990
What? Why would you eat with him?

500
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:27,500
Just ten times. No more, no less.

501
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,970
Do you know how it is out there? This is also a part of my duties.

502
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:33,570
You've gotten the wrong idea.

503
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:36,930
I'm not his girlfriend. Just a friend.

504
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,480
You can stop making my meals.

505
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,280
Is this writer Jeong Hyeon Tae?

506
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,510
Don't be sick.
