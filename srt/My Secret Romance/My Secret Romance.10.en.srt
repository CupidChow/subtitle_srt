00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,080
♫  Won’t you stop and leave it to me now?  ♫

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,130
♫  With fairly plausible words  ♫

25
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,490
♫  Truth and compromise, even when they give birth to lies  ♫

26
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,390
♫  Like the horn of a rhino, I gotta go  ♫

27
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,720
♫  I, without hesitation, like Desperado  ♫

28
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,090
Are you going to ride again?

29
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,390
Ouch!

30
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,800
Oh, where are your mothers?

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,890
Go on, go up.

32
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,830
Is this the neighborhood where she lives?

33
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,780
Yes, they live on the second floor of the cafe building.

34
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,800
His eyes for picking out women must be stuck under his feet. (low standards)

35
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,200
How could he pick such a...

36
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,880
I should nip it in the bud before it gets worse.

37
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,580
What's that? Stop the car!

38
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,460
That punk, what is he doing over there?

39
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,010
Who is that kid?

40
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,700
This kid!

41
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,960
What?

42
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,580
- Let's say 'goodbye'.
- Say goodbye.

43
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,800
I guess Dong Goo looks like his dad.

44
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,030
I'm not his father–

45
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,920
Dong Goo, say goodbye.

46
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,940
- Bye!
- Go safely, Dong Goo.

47
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,170
Bye, Dong Goo.

48
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,080
Now, next!

49
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,770
This Staphylococcus aureus. You have to be extra careful about this.

50
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,620
Why is that? Because there's an intestinal toxin that this fungus produces

51
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,580
and even if it's heated for 30 minutes in 100°C water,

52
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,480
it won't die, despite the hot temperature shock.

53
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,230
So, the hand was cut with a knife and wounded,

54
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,910
then the germs are swirling more.

55
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,450
If there's such person, we need more...

56
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,110
Director, did you get home safely?

57
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,860
Hiccupbird: Director, did you get home safely?

58
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,330
There are 150 kinds of bacteria living on my hand that I am holding up right now.

59
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,940
In order to fight this bacteria on my hand, we will end today's lecture with a round of applause.

60
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,050
Applause!

61
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,950
Louder!

62
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,220
They're dying! They're dying! Die!

63
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,450
Hiccups: Director, did you get home safely?

64
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,740
Geez... Look at all this sand!

65
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,720
Come here. Let's wash your back.

66
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,810
What is that? Skin atopy?

67
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,240
Hey! Don't you know that a man's butt is the most important?

68
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,570
Are you okay?

69
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,890
Isn't it painful?

70
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,940
Okay, it's not painful.

71
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,490
Where are your clothes?

72
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,230
Over there

73
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,990
Where? Here?

74
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,690
M.H.

75
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,340
Who on earth would chose to buy this quality of underwear...

76
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,380
They should get him better underwears, his skin is sensitive

77
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,580
Where's the front? Foot!

78
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,710
That's right.

79
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,810
All done.

80
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,030
By the way, how old are you?

81
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,450
Three years old?

82
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,760
Three years old...

83
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,140
Three years old?

84
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,990
Are you three years old?

85
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,620
Hye Ri, don't you think you've been doing a little too well lately?

86
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,340
I know. Oh, it's not like there's no one at work. I'm the only one who's so busy.

87
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,230
Vacation days that you enjoy so much, you can't even use them.

88
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,200
You must be tired.

89
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,810
I'm planning on quitting after I get married.

90
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,190
Married?

91
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,510
With whom?

92
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,120
Could it be Cha Jin Wook from Daebok?

93
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,590
You drama's viewer ratings have dropped lately?

94
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,790
Good for you.

95
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,830
I hope everything goes well.

96
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,430
I think it's about time for a turning point.

97
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,890
For example, the introduction of a new character?

98
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,560
Yes, well... It could work.

99
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,190
Right? Then, how about this?

100
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,670
As a rival against Gyeong Ae,

101
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,690
a divorced lady makes her entrance to the show.

102
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:12,600
A highly praised erotic actress in her golden days!

103
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,060
The title is...

104
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,580
'It's Going to Explode'.

105
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,380
Isn't that your story? 'It's Going to Explode', Jo Mi Hee.

106
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,720
Is it?

107
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,950
You know my life is so dramatic.

108
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,290
Anyway,

109
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,770
- What? She was an erotic actress?
- Why don't you suggest to the writer?

110
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,680
Look! I have no wrinkles at all.

111
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,220
I'm getting younger.

112
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,170
I'll think about it. Excuse me, I need to go back to work.

113
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,850
I'll be waiting for good news.

114
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,330
Call me, okay?

115
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,000
Call me!

116
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,810
Director! You are still here?

117
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,830
Why is he with you?

118
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,910
Your mother asked me for a favor.

119
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,970
My mom?

120
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,950
So that's why you are... You should've contacted me.

121
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,640
You went to your meal service company.

122
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,190
They will have a bad impression of you.

123
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,700
And, coincidentally, I have some free time.

124
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,200
By the way, who is he?

125
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:46,160
Well... that is, he used to live with my mom but now we live together.

126
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,450
Thank you for your help today.

127
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,430
Let's go, Dong Goo!

128
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,900
Hold on.

129
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:02,550
Do you know how much I went through today?

130
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,180
He's like a robot. He doesn't get tired.

131
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,630
Dong Goo caused trouble?

132
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,210
I apologize.

133
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,790
Not that.

134
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:18,010
Dong Goo, look over there, what is it? Yes, what could it be?

135
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,710
This. I'm leaving now.

136
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,080
Dong Goo, see you later.

137
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,260
What did you do with him?

138
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,430
He, at the playground,

139
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:03,440
did "Wow," so others did "Wow, "and during the bath,

140
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,180
He did "Tah," and I did "Tah."

141
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,890
Can't understand a thing.

142
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,320
Was is that fun?

143
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,730
Let's finish this.

144
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,710
♫ It’s getting weirder, my heart ♫

145
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:30,390
♫ You’re not even my ideal type ♫

146
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:36,060
♫ It’s getting weirder ♫

147
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,980
♫ The way I see things is changing ♫

148
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,660
If you are grateful, can you what you just did once more?

149
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,590
If you are sincerely grateful, I think you can

150
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,250
♫ Maybe it’s Love love love ♫

151
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,650
♫ What’re you thinking about? ♫

152
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,690
♫ Will you trust me? ♫

153
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,690
♫ Half fear half excitement ♫

154
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,830
♫ They say that’s love ♫

155
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:18,220
♫ It’s getting weirder, my heart ♫

156
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,070
I told you countless times that I can't let you in...

157
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,170
Blacky...

158
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,200
Hey, Blacky. You have kids!

159
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,520
Okay, okay.

160
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,890
But, why did you come to my house with the kids?

161
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,400
By the way, you.

162
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,070
Where's your husband? Why alone?

163
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,070
Did the cats get your tongues?

164
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,020
All of you must have adopted a cat over the weekend, right?

165
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,780
Any more ideas on the limited editions?

166
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,530
Yes, this is all we have so far.

167
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,780
Everyone. Is this the best you can do? Yes?

168
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,690
- My apologies.
- We'll think of more.

169
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,920
How about this?

170
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,900
A combo of underwear for fathers and sons.

171
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:27,820
Since Tencel is a natural fabric, I think it should be good for kids with atopy or sensitive skin.

172
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,290
Of course. It has excellent moisture control and cooling effects.

173
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,820
The market should like it.

174
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,420
I agree.

175
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,950
Definitely.

176
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,270
So, everyone agrees?

177
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,230
Yes.

178
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,300
The chairman called.

179
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,940
Let's wrap up for today.

180
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,000
Good work.

181
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,980
What brings you to my office?

182
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,390
How long did you plan on keeping it from me?

183
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,090
Pardon me. What are you talking about?

184
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,350
Did you have a baby without my knowledge?

185
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,430
Is the nutritionist's child your son?

186
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,060
Pardon me?

187
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,890
What the hell did you do with her three years ago?

188
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,030
Did you follow me and take pictures after you banished me?

189
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,700
That's not the issue. You tricked me this whole time.

190
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,350
He's a child born out of wedlock.

191
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,360
Even as a chairman, I have a clear record.

192
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,610
What child born out of wedlock?

193
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,100
That kid!

194
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,830
The child the nutritionist is secretly raising by herself. Stop playing dumb.

195
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,350
Pardon me?

196
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:19,230
Is that kid Lee Yoo Mi's son?

197
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,660
Didn't you know?

198
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,090
Then, what were you doing last weekend?

199
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,010
There's no way...

200
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,320
There's no way...

201
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,950
That's where it was. My little brother...

202
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,010
doesn't own that. It belongs to my dog.

203
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,690
If you want to impress Yoo Mi, You should treat him well.

204
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,210
But, how old are you?

205
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:59,370
My mom took care of him, but now we live together.

206
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,060
That looks nice.

207
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,410
Here, have a taste?

208
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,610
Take a poop already!

209
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,520
I wonder if he's remembering to eat his meals?

210
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,920
Is he having dinner tonight?

211
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,120
From: Director Cha

212
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,260
Let's meet after work. I'll wait for you outside.

213
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:15,610
I'll tell Jin Wook Oppa everything about Lee Yoo Mi today.

214
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,540
What?

215
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,520
Where are they going this time?

216
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,830
But, where are we going?

217
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,940
I don't know either.

218
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,790
Please tell me the truth.

219
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:52,040
Is there anything you want to tell me?

220
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,150
I thought you asked to see me because you had something to say.

221
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:59,300
I asked to see you because I thought you would have something to tell me.

222
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,540
But I don't have anything to say.

223
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,220
Really?

224
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:16,630
I thought... we really had something to talk about.

225
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:36,880
Director Cha, why are you acting like this?

226
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,230
What happened to you three years ago?

227
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:47,150
Don't leave anything out and tell me everything.

228
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,970
Why are you bringing that up again?

229
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,150
I'm being very serious right now.

230
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,020
So please be honest with me.

231
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,300
What do you want to hear?

232
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,880
What do you want to know?

233
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,710
Everything! Everything about you!

234
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,010
I don't know why you're acting like this.

235
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,070
I'm getting out.

236
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,550
Lee Yoo Mi!

237
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,700
I worked myself to the bone.

238
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,730
That was the only way I could live, because of you.

239
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,120
Lee Yoo Mi, because you...

240
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,720
Because you disappeared without a word, I couldn't date anyone

241
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,180
I couldn't eat or sleep properly.

242
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:59,070
I just worked like crazy until I couldn' t work anymore.

243
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,710
I didn't forget about you for a single moment.

244
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,850
So tell me how you felt.

245
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,170
Tell me what happened to you since then.

246
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:19,070
If you don't tell me there's no way of knowing.

247
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,810
I was scared.

248
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,230
I didn't want to look easy.

249
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,070
Now matter how much times have changed, one-night stands

250
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:44,360
That was... something that wasn't supposed or couldn't happen to me.

251
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,540
But in the end...

252
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,870
I know it sounds stupid and, whether or not you believe me,

253
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,690
but in my entire life,

254
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:11,870
I've never done anything like that or felt like this with anyone but you.

255
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,190
What? What do you want?

256
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,760
♫ What do you think is the same? ♫

257
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,870
♫ Love is the same ♫

258
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:52,900
♫ When we meet, my heart goes thump thump thump ♫

259
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,190
I'm fine now. Go inside.

260
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,350
♫ When we brush our teeth, thump thump thump ♫

261
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,380
Get home safely.

262
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,520
♫ When we’re apart, it’s an even bigger thump ♫

263
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:10,680
♫ What else is the same with you and me? ♫

264
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,510
♫ I wanna know you ♫

265
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,860
♫ Not your blood type or sign ♫

266
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,960
♫ But the real you ♫

267
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,360
♫ The you that no one else knows ♫

268
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,370
♫ Will you tell me? ♫

269
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:36,410
♫ Starting from your first memory ♫

270
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,710
♫ Except your first lie and first love ♫

271
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:46,970
♫ I wanna know everything ♫

272
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,510
Excuse me. You might die at this rate.

273
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,220
It would have been more awkward for you if you had intervened.

274
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,380
Shut up.

275
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:08,840
I'll appear on your show, but in return, forget what you heard today.

276
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,700
Let's stop getting in the way of their relationship.

277
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,070
Look at you, doing the right thing.

278
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,930
Excuse me. I'm really pissed right now,

279
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,950
so stop making me angry and get out of my way.

280
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,810
I worked myself to the bone.

281
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,850
That was the only way I could live

282
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,050
because of you, Lee Yoo Mi.

283
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:24,700
Because you disappeared without a word, I couldn't date anyone.

284
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,580
I could eat or sleep properly.

285
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,190
I just worked like crazy until I couldn't work anymore.

286
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,240
I didn't forget about you for a single moment.

287
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,820
I guess I wasn't the only one.

288
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,260
You guys must be happy.

289
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,770
You a mom, a warm blanket,

290
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,840
And...

291
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,360
You can be together.

292
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,190
I''m going to catch you.

293
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,900
Jin Wook, I'm a ghost!

294
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,120
I'm going to catch you, Jin Work!

295
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,580
That's my son.

296
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,920
Do you want to hide this time?

297
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,360
Mom!

298
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,750
Mom!

299
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,070
Mom!

300
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,640
Dad!

301
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,890
Where's Mom? Why isn't she coming back?

302
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,620
Dad!

303
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,990
Cha Jin Wook, stop hesitating.

304
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,320
Is your family something to worry about?

305
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,860
All you have to do is be together.

306
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,350
That's all it takes.

307
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,780
Nutritionist Lee Yoo Mi

308
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,190
What is all this?

309
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,360
We're setting up your office.

310
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,670
What? My office?

311
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,420
Oooh. Amazing!

312
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,390
Nutritionist Lee Yoo Mi

313
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,730
Amazing. What is all this?

314
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,880
They sure treat the nutritionist really well.

315
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,210
I'm sorry.

316
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,060
Can I use that massager from time to time?

317
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,870
Yes, of course.

318
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:26,280
But who set up this office for you?

319
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,920
Um... The thing is...

320
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,250
It's the latest printer.

321
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:47,070
General Director, Cha Jin Wook

322
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,650
Perhaps, did you...

323
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,390
happen to

324
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,420
give me an office?

325
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,110
I thought your work environment looked too shabby.

326
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,470
The employee welfare team upgraded it for you,

327
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,980
so don't feel burdened by it.

328
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,300
I feel burdened. I feel really burdened.

329
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,370
Nutritionist, Lee, the light comes on too.

330
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,300
Ohhh. Great, great.

331
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,010
What?

332
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,990
She's dating Director Cha.

333
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,040
Director Cha?

334
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,680
Why did you hit me?

335
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,600
What?

336
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,380
You hit me.

337
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,360
What was that for?

338
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,130
Hiccupbird

339
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,530
Thank you

340
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:02,700
I wonder, will this look good on Dong Goo?

341
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,860
Make the packaging different.

342
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,930
There's no problem with production?

343
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,470
No, no problem.

344
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,090
By the way, we're trying to come up with a name for this product.

345
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,730
There are a few possibilities.

346
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,360
How about this:

347
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,570
"I'm Your Father."

348
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,610
I like it!

349
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,640
It's simple. It rolls off the tongue.

350
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,670
Okay. You can go.

351
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,410
Yes.

352
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,790
It's the weekend tomorrow. Let's go on a date.

353
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,020
Bring Dong Goo.

354
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,360
Dong Goo?

355
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,510
Did Dong Goo grow on him?

356
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,640
We're in trouble, we have a big problem!

357
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,500
Oh, what is it?

358
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,010
Is someone coming again?

359
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,570
Hello Chairman Cha! How are you?

360
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,190
Hello, Chairman Cha.

361
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,770
Nutritionist Lee Yoo Mi?

362
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:51,030
Yes. What would you like to eat?

363
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:55,030
If there's something you'd like to eat, we'll make it as soon as...

364
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,350
There's no need for that.

365
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,100
Please give me what my employees are having.

366
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,130
Yes.

367
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:26,220
Then, enjoy your meal.

368
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,560
Are you busy?

369
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,090
Sit down.

370
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,750
Yes.

371
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:42,820
I don't have to tell you why I'm here, right?

372
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,570
No.

373
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:55,400
It seems like Nutritionist Lee and Director Cha really are dating.

374
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,520
Hey!

375
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,340
In most cases, isn't his mother the one who comes and gives an envelope of money?

376
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,630
- That's right, the mother usually—
- What are you talking about?

377
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,050
What are you doing?

378
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,360
Hurry and get back to work,

379
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,310
Yes!

380
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,120
Get back to work!

381
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:30,420
The reason why I'm not doing anything

382
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,860
is because I'm waiting until Jin Wook ends it himself.

383
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,290
I want you to remember that.

384
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:42,050
It seems neither of you have established what this relationship is.

385
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,920
Dong Goo!

386
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,850
♫ Love love love is so sweet ♫

387
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,430
♫ Love love love is so ♫

388
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,770
Let's do this.
♫ sweet ♫

389
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,260
♫ Milky ♫

390
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,200
He said it would be a date.
♫ Lattes ♫

391
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,140
♫ And pretty blankets that make you sleep ♫

392
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:24,340
♫ Everything is perfect, love is mint pink ♫

393
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,710
♫ Burning  ♫

394
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,630
♫ Romance, please let it go ♫

395
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,520
♫ With that smile that was cold yesterday ♫

396
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,420
♫ But warm today ♫

00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,560
♫ You confuse me ♫

398
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,550
♫ Burning romance, what do I do? ♫

399
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,360
♫ Every day, I miss you ♫

400
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,440
♫ I don’t even know how I feel ♫

401
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,290
♫ I think I love u so good ♫

402
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,320
Are you ready to order?

403
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,520
Yes.

404
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,720
We recommend the family ice cream set for families.

405
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,330
No, we just want—

406
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,760
Oh, we will have the family set.

407
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,830
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Here you go.

408
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,980
Why are you looking at me like that?

409
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,850
Why do I feel like this?

410
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,240
I feel embarrassed

411
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,490
because I feel like a third wheel on your date.

412
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,230
Of all the things to be jealous of.

413
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,100
Is it good, Dong Goo?

414
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,390
It's good.

415
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,390
It's good?

416
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,290
About the Chairman, I'm sorry.

417
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,770
I should have stopped him.

418
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,620
Did Secretary Jang tell you?

419
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,700
Did Chairman Cha say anything harsh to you?

420
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,420
He just ate and went back upstairs.

421
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,140
Forget whatever he said.

422
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,070
I've already decided

423
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:46,210
that you're... no longer alone.

424
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,290
Here, look. It's a gift.

425
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,970
You didn't have to...

426
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,400
It's for Dong Goo.
- Oh.

427
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:20,880
We're launching a new project for a father and son underwear line.

428
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,370
I was inspired by Dong Goo's poor quality underwear collection.

429
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:28,550
Kids grow really fast,

430
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,730
so I bought cheaper underwear for him.

431
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,720
But, if this is a matching father and son underwear set...

432
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,440
Oh... hey come on. We're with a child.

433
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:46,280
Come over to my place next week with Dong Goo.

434
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,470
All three of us again?

435
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,850
Why? You don't want to?

436
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,870
No, sounds good.

437
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,670
Sounds good. Good idea.

438
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:01,000
Director Cha, you must really like children.

439
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,130
No, but if it's Dong Goo...

440
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,590
Because he's your family.

441
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,730
Dong Goo, it's time to go home, okay?

442
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,270
Get home safely.

443
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,800
Bye Dong Goo!

444
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,810
Let's go, Dong Goo!

445
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:30,320
Are you serious?

446
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,230
How... How can this be?

447
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:42,720
I know you're suprised. I couldn't believe It either.

448
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,790
How...

449
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,950
How could you keep this from me?

450
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,390
Weren't we closer than that?

451
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,400
Did you think that was my point?

452
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,330
What?

453
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:05,060
Secretary Jang, when you followed me here three years ago did you take pictures?

454
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,480
What pictures?

455
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,420
Chairman Cha used a double agent.

456
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,140
In the end, Chairman Cha didn't trust me either.

457
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,310
What are you going to do now?

458
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:31,320
As soon as the next project ends I'm going to tell Chairman Cha.

459
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,310
Will it be okay?

460
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:48,370
I never thought... the idea of a family suited me.

461
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,120
But if it's with the two of them, I'd be willing to give it a try.

462
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:28,190
What are you thinking about?

463
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,800
It's strange.

464
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:34,580
Is it because this is my first time?

465
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,780
He does a lot for me,

466
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:43,410
but how do I say this? I don't feel like Cinderella.

467
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:46,070
The way he's been treating me, am I a devoted son?

468
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,050
Is this normal?

469
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:53,180
It sounds like things are going well with director Cha.

470
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,690
Not really.

471
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,990
Do you think you'll be okay?

472
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:03,650
It might be different from what you expect. He's not an average person.

473
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,360
That's true.

474
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,900
But...

475
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:25,580
♫ My dear, call on me every time every time  ♫

476
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:30,730
Don't you feel suffocated if you cover up like that?

477
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:33,140
♫ You don't have to fight it all by yourself  ♫

478
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,720
I feel more comfortable this way.

479
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,040
You're not an easy woman.

480
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,840
♫ to tell us to never give up on hoping ♫

481
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,800
I've never thought that about you once.

482
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,250
♫ Someone to tell us... ♫

483
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:50,500
I've never had a more difficult woman in my life.
♫ to get up again ♫

484
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,540
That's why you can let loose now.

485
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,110
In front of me at least.

486
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:59,510
♫ Who felt that there was nowhere left to run ♫

487
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:03,040
♫ I wanna tell you right now, whenever you're down  ♫

488
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,360
I felt that way too.

489
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,790
To me, there's only one man

490
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:11,420
like you.

491
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,610

Ahjussi said, "Wow," at the playground
#Ajussi #AtThePlayground #SaidWow #So

539
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:23,060

You were just a "one-night."

571
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:40,270
I said I came to confirm if this kid is my blood!

572
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,740
So I got excited all by myself without realizing that

573
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,870
and felt touched and was happy?

574
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:49,210
Don't touch that woman.

575
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:50,890
I'm not a kid anymore.

576
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:53,520
The two of you should never have met.

577
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,240
Three years ago or now.

578
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,800
That one night changed my life.

579
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,750
You were right. We are from two different worlds.
