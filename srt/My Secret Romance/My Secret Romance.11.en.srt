Episode 11
Fond Goodbye

4
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,870
Will you be okay?

5
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:17,850
Things could be very different from what you thought. He's different from others.

6
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,680
It does seem like that.

7
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,030
But...

8
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,620
Isn't it suffocating to always be so buttoned-up?

9
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,090
This is more comfortable for me.

10
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,390
You're not an easy woman at all.

11
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,480
I've never thought that about you.

12
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,940
There's no one as difficult as you in my life.

13
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,900
So you can be more at east now.

14
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,720
At least with me.

15
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,090
♫  No you were never the only one  ♫

16
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,150
♫  Who felt that there was nowhere left to run  ♫

17
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,720
Me, too.

18
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,780
To me, a man like you,

19
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,830
you're the only one.

20
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,980
I'm going to do what my heart tells me to for now.

21
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,680
Yeah, that's alright then.

22
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,550
♫  And you can hum along and someday you'll find it  ♫

23
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,040
♫  The way to sing your song for love  ♫

24
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,450
♫  Song for love  ♫

25
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,660
♫  Song for love  ♫

26
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:56,140
♫  Maybe someday you'll find it, the way to sing your song for love  ♫

27
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,250
Joo Hye Ri?

28
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,110
- Why did you drink so much? Are you okay?
- Annoying...

29
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,220
Joo Hye Ri, come to your senses.

30
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,310
If you're drunk, you should go home, not be out here like this.

31
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,950
You, you!

32
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,900
Seriously, you're so annoying!

33
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,570
Why are you crying?

34
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,850
Why are you crying?

35
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,970
Hey, Pancake!

36
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,320
Because of you, my life is ruined.

37
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,350
It's all destroyed.

38
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,200
Okay. If you have something to tell me, say it all tonight. I'll listen to anything, even if you curse at me.

39
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,510
You're a one-night stand. Just a one-night stand.

40
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,780
Aren't you embarrassed?

41
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:14,170
What was it again? It's... Going to Explode?

42
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,970
What ridiculous nonsense.

43
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,540
What does your mom keep saying is going to explode?

44
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,230
It doesn't make sense at all.

45
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,530
You're just an erotic actress's child, so how dare you set your sights so high?

46
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,980
Were you by chance dreaming of changing the course of your life with just one night?

47
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,070
Do you think it's as easy as flipping over a pancake?

48
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,400
Do you think it's easy?

49
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,510
You even look like a pancake.

50
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,070
It's not like that.

51
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,280
What do you mean, "It's not like that"?

52
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,630
You know, the fact that I exist on this Korean land

53
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:57,050
with a woman like you is just

54
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:02,440
so, so embarrassing. I'm begging you.

55
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,710
If you're a one-night stand, then like a one-night stand,

56
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,400
quietly go get lost, okay?

57
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,280
When you disappeared without a word

58
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,030
I couldn't date anyone. I couldn't eat nor sleep

59
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,720
and lived like a work-obsessed crazy person.

60
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,600
Driver, please turn the car around.

61
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,090
Okay.

62
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,310
What brings you here this late?

63
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,640
I was curious about how great your love was.

64
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,840
That was it?

65
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,430
One-night?

66
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,620
Joo Hye Ri. How do you know that?

67
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,490
You... Don't you think this is too much?

68
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,960
Ten years. It's been 10 years. A decade

69
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,280
is long enough to build roads through mountains and rivers.

70
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,400
But why don't you change?

71
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,520
Why can't you accept my feelings!

72
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,230
My 10 years, is that anything to you?

73
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,270
One single night with her. Was it that significant?

74
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,280
That one night...

75
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,470
changed my life entirely.

76
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,840
Jin Wook.

77
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,310
That's why she isn't just some woman to me.

78
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,780
I won't see you out. Get home safely.

79
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,600
What should I do when my feelings just don't change!

80
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,910
All men in Korea say they like me,

81
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,880
but that doesn't help.

82
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,050
Only you don't like me.

83
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,310
Cha Jin Wook, you bastard!

84
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,380
It's you.

85
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,440
Please excuse me. This is all for you.

86
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,810
What are you doing?!

87
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,170
You don't look like a customer.

88
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,110
Who are you to lay your hand on someone else's child?

89
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,910
I'm a person that has the right to meet him.

90
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,810
Right? Who are you to say that?

91
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,470
Step aside.

92
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,860
What in the world are you talking about!

93
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,410
Why do you mess with someone else's child!

94
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,810
How dare you stare at me like that...

95
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,030
I'm about to call the police. Watch your words.

96
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,900
Move away!

97
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,520
No. What in the world are you talking about? Explain in detail.

98
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,540
Oh ho. Don't meddle in this.

99
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,410
- You grumpy old man—
- Grumpy?

100
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,670
How could you call me grumpy!

101
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,910
So you want to fight me, right now?

102
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,140
Darn... move!

103
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,290
Did you just hit me?

104
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,400
This woman, for real...

105
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,410
You are a one-night stand. Just a one-night stand.

106
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,130
I'm asking you please,

107
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,380
if you are just a one-night stand, like a one-night stand,

108
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,450
quietly go get lost?

109
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,250
General Manager Cha

110
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,760
Chairman Cha, please...

111
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,870
I have no idea what you are talking about!

112
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,640
Stop what? What?

113
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,460
I'm here to check if he is really blood-related to me!

114
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:03,710
Why would Dong Goo be related to you?

115
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,530
Jae Sook, could you take care of Dong Goo for a moment?

116
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,960
That...

117
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,550
So,

118
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,010
did we ever sleep together?

119
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,260
I don't remember you.

120
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,220
What? Why would I...

121
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,070
Chairman...

122
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,540
I'm here to confirm

123
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:32,180
whether the kid is Jin Wook's child.

124
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,010
What do you mean?

125
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,890
Father!

126
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,130
What are you doing right now?

127
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:50,300
You weren't doing anything, so I came to make it clear.

128
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,250
What... is going on?

129
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,390
Lee Yoo Mi, I know it all.

130
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,990
Dong Goo, he's my...

131
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,700
Right now,

132
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,230
what are you all doing with my son!

133
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:25,320
He's my son whom I gave birth to.

134
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,240
How dare you underestimate my womb! Huh?

135
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,980
I can't hold it in any longer.

136
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,190
What?

137
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,400
Beer & Book

138
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,650
Really, he isn't?

139
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,810
He really isn't?

140
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:59,120
No. I told you, he came with my mom.

141
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,920
He's my step brother.

142
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,830
Then what was I doing?

143
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,080
Then all the things that you did for me,

144
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,450
what you said to me.

145
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,370
This was why?

146
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,900
I didn't know that,

147
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,870
and I was excited and touched and was happy

148
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,910
all by myself?

149
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,200
Let's go.

150
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,730
Father.

151
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,010
We should talk.

152
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,960
No.

153
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,520
Later. Let's talk later.

154
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,450
Go.

155
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,690
How dumb can you be?

156
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,010
You let that golddigger hurt Hye Ri?

157
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,420
She's not that kind of woman.

158
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,660
No? What do you mean, no? The mother is an erotic actress,

159
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,400
and the daughter is a golddigger. This is embarrassing.

160
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,300
Please watch your words.

161
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,340
You are the one that misunderstood the situation.

162
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,130
- What?
- You wanted a grandson so much.

163
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,820
You should feel embarrassed.

164
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,590
Me? What? What did I do?

165
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:37,390
She will pay for this. She played a game against Daebok Group.

166
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:41,290
You will never see her again.

167
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,960
That woman—

168
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,940
Leave her alone. I'm not a young kid anymore.

169
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,330
I won't stand aside like when my mother...

170
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,970
Please, do me a favor. If you are done...

171
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,280
Then all the things that you did for me,

172
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,490
what you said to me.

173
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,450
This was why?

174
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,910
I didn't know that,

175
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,080
and I was excited and touched and was happy

176
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,400
all by myself?

177
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,740
♫ As if nothing’s wrong  ♫

178
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,900
♫ I joke around  ♫

179
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,680
♫ With my friends  ♫

180
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,840
♫ Saying being alone is better  ♫

181
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,340
Because you disappeared without a word,

182
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,210
I couldn't date anyone. I couldn't eat or sleep regularly.

183
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,890
I just worked like crazy until I couldn't work anymore.

184
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,260
I didn't forget about you for a single moment.

185
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,410
I've already decided that you are...

186
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,710
no longer alone.

187
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,570
So this was why.

188
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,370
I was dumb.

189
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,650
♫ I miss you so I’m crying  ♫

190
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,940
♫ I comfort myself  ♫

191
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,840
♫ But the tears keep dripping  ♫

192
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,100
♫ After getting exhausted from endlessly crying  ♫

193
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,430
♫ I fall asleep  ♫

194
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:01,560
♫ I can’t even see  ♫

195
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,750
♫ You in my dreams  ♫

196
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,620
Here.

197
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,450
Yoo Mi, come over and try the sweet potato.

198
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,120
Lucky! I wanted something sweet.

199
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,400
Thank you.

200
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,120
No!

201
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,230
Take it upstairs.

202
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,390
Why? No? Would I?

203
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,950
The title for the product hasn't been decided, yet.

204
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,360
How about this? I'm your father.

205
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,420
I'm from the kitchen.

206
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,130
Come in.

207
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,880
We prepared some sweet snacks.

208
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,810
She doesn't want to see me at all?

209
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,710
Yes?

210
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,940
Nothing. Thanks for the snack. Put it on the table.

211
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,850
Enjoy it.

212
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,360
Hye Ri, the topic of the day is spicy food...

213
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,260
Traditional pepper, Thai pepper, and red pepper.

214
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,970
With three types of pepper powders,

215
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,130
without any chemical ingredients like capsaicin,

216
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,580
we can create a delicious spiciness.

217
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,650
This is so spicy. It's so spicy, but...

218
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,150
I want to see...

219
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,470
I mean, It's spicy but I want to eat more.

220
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,050
Did I make it too spicy? Are you okay, Hye Ri?

221
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:36,120
Yes, I'm okay, okay.

222
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,450
I'm okay.

223
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,590
Is she okay?

224
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,480
I'm okay, but...

225
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,470
Are you crying?

226
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,600
No, I like spicy food very much...

227
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,900
- I must have made it too spicy.
- I'm sorry.

228
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,450
I'm sorry.

229
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,740
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

230
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,990
What should I do? I'm sorry.

231
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,540
Pause for a moment.

232
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,230
I'm so sorry.

233
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,110
Are you okay?

234
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,430
Why did she have to shed tears?
Joo Hye Ri, Cries during the show

235
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,540
Cries while eating spicy chicken feet
Breakup with C?

236
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,270
Joo Hye Ri's chicken feet is drawing attention

237
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:21,500
Sales of spicy chicken feet rising

238
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,600
Joo Hye Ri got dumped by C?
He's the heir of Daebok

239
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,490
No... Hye Ri Goddess!!
Daebok the underwear? Some say he dates an employee.
He dated 2 women?

240
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,470
I knew Joo Hye Ri was making a stretch haha
Isn't he Cha Jin Wook?
I wanna eat chicken feet...

241
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,690
Joo Hye Ri's tears... What's the real story?

242
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,000
She was going to quit after marriage. Seems like she got dumped.

243
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,360
Speculations is that Joo Hye Ri cried was because of D Group's C's dating rumors. We'll seewhether it'll be tears of reunion or tears of farewell.

244
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,170
Thinking of herself as the best, well deserved lol

245
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:47,730
There are many celebrities, announcers, models who were rejected.

246
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,780
Please give a statement!

247
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,370
Please answer!

248
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,370
Miss Joo Hye Ri!

249
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,160
Ms. Joo Hye Ri!

250
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,960
Just one statement—

251
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,820
Joo Hye Ri, cries during the show
Will the tears bring her love back?

252
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,130
Is it because of C from D group?

253
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,950
C from D group, secretly dates a nutritionist?

254
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,640
Joo Hye Ri liked him for 10 years? I feel sorry...
He dated both of them?

255
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,760
- This is cute.
- I should get it for my husband and son.

256
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,950
I think this is very well done.

257
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,730
What is this? Atopy?

258
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:34,120
She should get him better underwears. His skin is sensitive.

259
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,010
General Manager, the situation seems unexpected.

260
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,820
Well, it's my idea. Of course, you should've expected it.

261
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,620
Not that.

262
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,250
Look.

263
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:08,470
Announcer J, cries
J and C were discussing the marriage date but then C's son and woman appeared.

264
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,990
Furthermore, she's a normal employee at D group!

265
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,150
- What's up?
- My friend sent me some news.

266
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,410
It says the General Manager has a child.

267
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:24,120
Furthermore, the woman is an employee here.

268
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,160
- Is that so?
- Who could it be?

269
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,080
Annoying...

270
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,370
Where are you going?

271
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,380
To the restroom.

272
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,590
I work at Daebok, I think I know who it is.
Poor Joo Hye Ri...
Secret romance must have been exciting.

273
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:59,790
Isn't she a golddigger?
Stealing a man after a one-night stand, that's horrible.

274
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,600
She's the nutritionist at the cafeteria, right?

275
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,590
Preparing him a takeout for every meal. So this was why?

276
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,650
She doesn't look like a person to do that.

277
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,770
We really can't judge a book by its cover.

278
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,020
I totally didn't expect this.

279
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,320
Community Board

280
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,220
There should be something.
Isn't she the one that has been bringing the lunch boxes?

281
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,640
What an unpleasant situation right after the release of new product.

282
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,780
Quite unfortunate, General Manager.

283
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:58,400
So, how would you turn this into a chance like before?

284
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,010
The phone has been turned off, and you will be forwarded to voicemail.

285
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,700
After the beep, you will be charged for the call.

286
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,300
You're going to ruin everything you've gained, just for a woman?

287
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,630
- Did you hear the rumor?
- What?

288
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,770
What about the fact that she had a kid?

289
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,940
I heard that wasn't the general manager's.

290
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,470
So she just wanted to get some money out of it?

291
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,990
Wow, amazing.

292
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,030
What was she trying to do?

293
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:56,510
General Manager, I think it'll be best not to make contact for now.

294
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,440
She might run off if you try to hold onto her by force

295
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,130
like what happened with your mom.

296
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,750
♫  My tears are flowing  ♫

297
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:16,800
♫  It's becoming harder to breathe  ♫

298
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,580
You two shouldn't have met,

299
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,430
three years ago or now.

300
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:30,300
♫  Just filled with words we can't say to each other  ♫

301
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:36,390
♫  With eyes closed tight  ♫

302
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:43,200
♫  Although I tried closing my heart ♫

303
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:50,490
♫  Between these tightly shut eyes  ♫

304
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,530
Once in a while...

305
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,840
I thought about you quite often.

306
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,860
Whenever I drank wine.

307
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,320
Whenever I came near here.

308
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,600
And once in a while, when I get a 500 won coin back as change, sometimes I flip it over.

309
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,340
I don't regret it.

310
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,370
At least, I was true to my feelings at that time.

311
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,660
I don't regret it either.

312
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,500
I was thankful to you, General Manager.

313
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,720
Yoo Mi!

314
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,400
Hey, you have to relax and watch the ball to the end.

315
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,240
Do you think just hitting it mindlessly will work?

316
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,750
Be quiet.

317
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,420
Hey! Hey.

318
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,640
One more time?

319
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,030
I spent over 30,000 won here.

320
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,300
Let's go.

321
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,570
I just got the hang of it.

322
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,450
Cheapo!

323
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,000
What?

324
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,640
Hey, Yoo Mi.

325
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,800
- How was it? Did it get rid of some of your stress?
- Yeah.

326
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,030
Totally got rid of it.

327
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,870
Why aren't you asking?

328
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,930
You must have seen, too. That gossip.

329
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,580
Well, do I have to ask you something?

330
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,010
You were right.

331
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:37,360
That person and I are from two different worlds.

332
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:44,930
If I keep liking him, I think it'll get harder for me.

333
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:54,470
It's a lot of commotion for my first time dating, huh?

334
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,960
I know. It was a newsworthy newbie ceremony.

335
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,020
I don't think your average romance novels can come close.

336
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,620
Hey, Jeong Hyeon Tae!

337
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,940
Dummy. So stop reading those erotic novels all the time

338
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,850
and read something with depth.

339
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,900
What? Come here.

340
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,300
Hey! Come here! Hey!

341
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,140
- You were with Hyeon Tae?
- Huh?

342
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,120
Yeah.

343
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,920
You woke up because of me?

344
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,840
What did the general manager say?

345
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,270
What do you mean? Don't mind it.

346
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,000
If he ignores everything after all that ruckus,

347
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,620
he was no good from the getgo. Forget him.

348
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,620
He's not the only man in the world.

349
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,440
You're only just beginning. There are so many good men in this world.

350
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,670
Someone like you—

351
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,130
I got it. Dong Goo will wake up.

352
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,760
Beer & Book

353
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,320
You speak as well as you write.

354
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,740
Then I'll ask you the last question.

355
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,330
If you could say what travel means succinctly?

356
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,280
Travel is... dating.

357
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,150
What could that mean?

358
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,830
The excitement before a trip.

359
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:42,570
The happiness of getting to know a new destination.

360
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:48,880
The sense of sadness you feel when you return home to where you were.

361
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:53,370
These are similar to dating.

362
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,150
Hearing you say that, it's true.

363
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:59,580
Have you ever traveled alone?

364
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,520
No. I haven't been by myself yet.

365
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,640
You should do it at least one time.

366
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,260
It really feels like dating.

367
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,670
Okay, cut!

368
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:11,920
That was great.

369
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,540
Thank you. You worked hard.

370
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,130
Thank you.

371
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:18,090
- You worked hard.
- You worked hard.

372
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,500
You're good. For someone who nearly refused to do it.

373
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,300
I'm very good at adapting to circumstances.

374
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,980
Think about what I told you.

375
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,940
Aren't you of the age where a serious relationship would suit better than a one-sided love?

376
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,730
Never you mind.

377
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:39,190
It was great. Thank you.

378
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,970
♫  I am dreaming locked within you  ♫

379
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:18,920
♫  I am crying embraced within your arms  ♫

380
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:24,120
♫  You see me  ♫

381
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:29,260
♫  Slowly kissing your cheek  ♫

382
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,990
♫  And now again  ♫

383
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:41,160
♫  It became another rain sound for someone  ♫

384
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,660
You don't know yet who that woman is, right?

385
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,530
I don't think it's one of our employees. I'm so curious.

386
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,390
Enjoy it.

387
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,930
Enjoy it.

388
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,480
I'll do it. You take a break.

389
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,810
No, I'm okay.

390
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,720
Hurry up.

391
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,360
Team Leader, it's me.

392
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:35,910
I think I have to change my location of employment.

393
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,390
I have some personal reasons.

394
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,580
I ask of you.

395
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,860
Think about it carefully

396
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,150
Whether because of you, that woman will have more days of laughter

397
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,530
or more days of tears.

398
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,420
Please take care of me.

399
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,570
Do you want to try it too? You really won't cry.

400
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:41,390
- I'm fine.
- Stop talking!

401
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,830
It's hand cream that I had lying around. It's for you.

402
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,680
Thank you so much

403
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,810
You did well.

404
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,720
I'm so proud of you.

405
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,470
Nutritionist Lee Yoo Mi

406
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,450
Amazing!

407
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,440
Why are we here?

408
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:41,560
I have something to tell you. I'll come by your house.

409
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:59,090
I was going to call you, too.

410
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,590
I'm sorry for not getting in touch.

411
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,080
I had things to take care of.

412
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,190
General Manager.

413
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,410
Thank you for all this time.

414
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:23,650
I think staying here any longer, for you or me,

415
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,300
I think will be uncomfortable for us both.

416
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,930
I've applied to be relocated.

417
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,080
What are you saying right now?

418
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:37,900
You're going to leave here?

419
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:41,210
I think it's a little late,

420
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,450
but I think it'll be best.

421
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,200
I know.

422
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:10,700
I know that it's really hard for you.

423
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,530
But still, this is not right.

424
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,410
You can never. I can't allow it.

425
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,470
I don't have any intention of asking for your permission.

426
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,490
I don't want to become even more pathetic.

427
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,900
I'm going now.

428

432

Epilogue 11: Loving alone?
♫  Endlessly...  ♫

445
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,980
I didn't even know that.

446
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:04,550
And I was excited and touched

447
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,910
and was happy all by myself?

448
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,810
- Let's go now.
- Yes.

449
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,170
Sir.

450
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,990
Father.

451
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:47,510
Let's talk.

452
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,100
No.

453
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:54,040
Later. Let's do it later.

454
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,030
Go now.

455
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:47,450
♫  All the pain, all the sorrow  ♫

456

If you take one away from two,

459
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:29,190
it's just one.

460
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,590
But I can't be one without you.

461
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,510
♫  Words we can't say  ♫

462
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,220
If you add one with one,

463
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:42,000
it has to be two.

464
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:50,750
But if I add you to me,

465
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,840
we can't be two.

466
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:59,570
♫  Between my tightly shut eyes  ♫

467

♫  I can't hide my feelings  ♫

468
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,350
We have to always be one.

469
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:17,720
But after sending you away, I can't find where I belong.

470
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:24,030
You aren't aware of my presence.

471
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,960
So you keep thinking back to the words which affected you.

472
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:33,440
But still, we can't be one.

473
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,510
I'm praying to turn back time.

474
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:42,350
If you take away one from two, it can be one.

475
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:49,260
But me without you, I can't be one.

476
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:55,200
I don't think I can look back.

477
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:02,110
If I do, I feel like I'll go back.

478
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:07,600
I feel like I'll regret it, so I won't look back.

479
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,150
From the moment I leave,

480
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,680
whatever reasons there may be,

481
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:18,830
I know that I can't rationalize it.

482
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,280
Not being able to at least say sorry.

483
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,420
Not being able to say I love you at least once.

484
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,080
It's my last bit of pride I have towards you.

485
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:40,890
♫  I didn’t know it’s this nice  ♫

486

Words I want to say that are inside of me,

487

I think there are more than a thousand of them

488
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:52,580
But I'm leaving without even saying one word.

489
00:48:54,850 --> 00:49:00,200
No matter how much I miss you, the old memories won't come back, right?

490
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:05,590
Those precious times I don't dare recall lightly,

491
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:09,130
will no longer smile upon me, right?

492
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:14,650
One day, yes, one day,

493
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:17,520
I'll regret it.

494
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:22,500
That time, I should have looked back.

495
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:28,390
♫  Even in my dreams I can't see you  ♫

496
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:32,200
My Secret Romance

497
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,970
I'm sorry for relocating so suddenly.

498
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:38,090
Get prepared to take over my position.

499
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:41,840
- Do you know something? I like you.
- Huh?

500
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,320
- Where did you work, you said? - Daebok Group? That's ...

501
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,380
Oh, you know it?

502
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:49,560
Is it totally over with him?

503
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,000
I will be okay soon, too.

504
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,730
Why? I'm sincerely worried about you.

505
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:57,200
Her mother is an erotic actress.

506
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,760
Where is Lee Yoo Mi? I said, where is she?!
