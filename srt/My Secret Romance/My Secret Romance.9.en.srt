00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,810
My Secret Romance

3
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,190
♫  Never even imagined, love love  ♫

4
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,190
♫  It’s in my eyes, love love  ♫

5
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:51,060
♫  Lala lalala  ♫

6
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,650
♫  Maybe it’s love love love  ♫

7
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:09,730
Episode 9. You Are My Bra-Paderella

8
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,310
I apologize.

9
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,110
No, it's okay.

10
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,690
You educated your employees really well.

11
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,510
You're on a different level than someone who called me a raging bull or whatever.

12
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,080
It's a whole different dimension.

13
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,000
This is a gift we prepared.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,580
Oh, well, I was also at fault, you don't have to...

15
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,700
It's okay.

16
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,950
You two have a great time.

17
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,630
What are you doing right now?

18
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,660
Who knows, you might act like a child again and break this or throw it. I'll be keeping this.

19
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,750
Excuse me, Director! This is mine.

20
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,070
I was the one who was almost hit by the cart.

21
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,730
And I was the one who got the wine all over me, so why would you keep it?

22
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,570
The one who saved you from getting hit by the cart was me.

23
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,110
And you heard earlier, they said,

24
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,010
"You two have a great time," and gave it to us.

25
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,960
Then I have half-ownership, right?

26
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,830
Goodness, how baffling. So, what then? You're saying to drink it together?

27
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,530
Well, why can't we, with our kind of relationship?

28
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,970
"Our relationship"? I'm speechless...

29
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,830
Quickly give it to me.

30
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,660
I don't want to.

31
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,830
Give it to me right now.

32
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,140
Just try not to get caught!

33
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,000
Is this wine expensive?

34
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,220
I almost got caught.
♫  What do you think is the same?  ♫

35
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,550
What, what, what?
♫  Love is the same  ♫

36
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,790
Aigoo.
♫  When we meet, we go kong kong kong  ♫

37
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,060
Seriously! Give it to me, quickly!

38
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,990
♫  When we brush our teeth, kong kong kong kong  ♫

39
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,190
I caught you!
♫  When we’re apart, it’s an even bigger kong  ♫

40
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,020
♫  What else  ♫

41
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,370
♫  is the same with you and me?  ♫

42
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,420
♫  I wanna know you  ♫

43
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,060
You caught me.

44
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,660
Head up there first. I'll come up after getting wine glasses.

45
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,130
♫  The you that no one else knows  ♫

46
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,360
♫  Will you tell me?  ♫

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,030
♫  Starting from your first memory  ♫

48
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,400
♫  Except your first lie  ♫

49
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,810
♫  and first love, I wanna know everything  ♫

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,260
Take care, pretty ladies.

51
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,140
I'm closing the store and I'm going to leave.

52
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,020
It's me.

53
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,300
What now? I definitely told you I'm not doing it.

54
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,010
Give me a glass of beer.

55
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,980
Today I came to drink, I didn't come to negotiate.

56
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,930
Just one glass.

57
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,770
Beer & Book

58
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,440
But, is Lee Yoo Mi not back yet?

59
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,520
She went on a business trip.

60
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,200
Business trip? With who?

61
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,450
I mean, what kind of nutritionist goes on a business trip?

62
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,310
I know, right?

63
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,180
And you just let her go?

64
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,960
You should've stopped her!

65
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,430
I mean, even if it's a business trip, how can a woman sleep out with another man!

66
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,120
What are you thinking of now?

67
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,850
The same as you're thinking!

68
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,860
Let's... have a glass of wine.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,650
It's because you don't know her well. But Yoo Mi is not that kind of girl.

70
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,860
I think you're the one who doesn't know her.

71
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,480
Women are so cunning.

72
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,730
You wouldn't know just from the outer appearance.

73
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,950
There are kids who look innocent, right?

74
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,360
They make their breasts look bigger by stuffing in two, three bra pads,

75
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,710
tissues, rolled socks. I'm telling you they just stuff it in there!

76
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,380
Of course, I...

77
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,100
Well, I don't need anything additional.

78
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,450
You worked hard.

79
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,620
So did you.

80
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,330
This reminds me of the old days.

81
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:54,060
Sometimes... Fairly often, I think of you.

82
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,420
When I drink wine...

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,870
And when I come near here.

84
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,690
When I happen to get a 500 won coin as change,

85
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,540
I flip it.

86
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,780
Honestly,

87
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,910
I didn't know you would suddenly disappear that day.

88
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,550
- I didn't think—
- Again...

89
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,360
I didn't think we were going to run into each other.

90
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,200
I mean, to be more accurate,

91
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,620
I didn't want us to start that way.

92
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,810
Did you dislike me that much?

93
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,360
O-Of course.

94
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,470
I mean... Wh-Why? Why? In what way?

95
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,030
Do you not know?

96
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,740
You called me a raging bull.

97
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,590
You saw me at my worst, falling out at the restroom.

98
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,820
our first meeting was in the car, and...

99
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,640
And what? Keep going.

100
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,960
Never mind, that's it.

101
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:13,490
Anyway, I don't think so.

102
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,760
What happened that day, do you regret it?

103
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,630
Yes.

104
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,660
I don't say anything I don't mean.

105
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,940
If I hate it, I say I hate it. If I like it, I say I like it.

106
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,500
I express it with certainty.

107
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't know why people tire themselves out by playing hard to get.

108
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,820
There's that saying too, "The best way to play hard to get is to not play hard to get."

109
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,500
I like your refreshing personality.

110
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,610
Are you confessing that you like me right now?

111
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,980
Are you drunk?

112
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,550
I didn't drink that much.

113
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,750
I'm stronger than you think.

114
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,690
You look like you have alcohol tolerance.

115
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,450
Oh, yeah?

116
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,890
Do you know what it feels like

117
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,530
when all the men in this world say they like me,

118
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,160
but the person I like

119
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,140
is not even interested in me at all.

120
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,970
That feels really lonely.

121
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,470
We already drank all of it.

122
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,290
But, about that jewelry box—

123
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,180
It has nothing to do with you.

124
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,650
Don't bother thinking about it.

125
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,470
Are you angry because of me?

126
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,370
No, not at all!

127
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,940
What, what, Lee Yoo Mi, do you think you mean to me?

128
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,970
You said you thought about me frequently.

129
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,200
When did I say that?

130
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,880
Never mind, I might be mistaken.

131
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,910
Let's just go.

132
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,870
CLOSED
OPEN: 3PM /
CLOSE Whenever

133
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,790
Sit down here, I'll give you some water.

134
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,810
It's been twelve years

135
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,750
that I've been seeing Oppa.

136
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,980
I don't have anyone but Jin Wook Oppa.

137
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,070
Even when the better guys flirted with me,

138
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,960
I thought of Jin Wook Oppa. For Jin Wook Oppa's sake,

139
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,860
I didn't go all the way.

140
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,010
That's so cowardly.

141
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,230
Who? Me?

142
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,180
That shouldn't be for someone. It's an excuse.

143
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,360
It should be of your will.

144
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,140
You shouldn't do it for someone else.

145
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,840
You do it when you want, with the person you want.

146
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,990
What are you?

147
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,660
To the girl you like,

148
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,300
you are not even being honest with her.

149
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,580
To be honest,

150
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,480
you are the coward, not me.

151
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,110
What a stupid jerk.

152
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,470
Hey. I'm going. I'm going.

153
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,750
Sometimes...

154
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,270
No, I thought about you quite often.

155
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,800
Whenever I drank wine. Whenever I came near here.

156
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,520
Whenever I got a 500 won coin back as change, I flipped it.

157
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,670
I don't see why not in our relationship.

158
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,750
Our Relationship? I'm not sure. What relationship is this?

159
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,980
I don't know either.

160
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,840
Forget it. What can i say if I show this to her?

161
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,040
Thank you. We will do our best.

162
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,360
You read my mind. How did you know I have a weakness for good food?

163
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,660
I have made my mind up quickly, thanks to that competent dietitian.

164
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,330
Good work, Director Cha.

165
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,190
This reminds me of three years ago. How did you get here?

166
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,870
I took the shuttle bus.

167
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,360
Go.

168
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,630
Pardon me?

169
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,630
Go.

170
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,320
I'll see you in Seoul.

171
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,190
I wonder when the next bus is leaving.

172
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,530
See you in an hour.

173
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,720
Why are we at a pool all of a sudden?

174
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,490
To swim.

175
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,480
But there is no one here.

176
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,290
I rented it out.

177
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,970
This entire pool?

178
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,960
This is my father's resort.

179
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,800
I hate swimming in the same pool with strangers.

180
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,450
I see. Since I can't really swim, I'll be at the spa.

181
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,820
Where do you think your going?

182
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,160
You need to watch.

183
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,600
I asked you to be here so you can watch me swim.

184
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,430
But, why should I watch you swim?

185
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,240
My feet could cramp up all of a sudden,

186
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,800
or if I suddenly when into cardiac arrest,

187
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,300
I'd have someone to call for help.

188
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,800
Am I to look out

189
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,470
for your safety then?

190
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,010
Shouldn't Secretary Jang do that—

191
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,810
Why are you acting that way?

192
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,020
This isn't the first time you saw my body.

193
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,830
Do you still regret what happened that night?

194
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:09,590
Why are you bringing that up out the blue?

195
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,480
Because what you said bothers me.

196
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,010
Then what about you? Don't you regret it?

197
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,050
I don't regret it

198
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:24,250
because I was being honest to my true feelings.

199
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,350
I wish you didn't regret

200
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,290
and think of it as an embarrassing memory.

201
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,710
Can you pull me out?

202
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,290
Are you crazy?

203
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,820
What if something went wrong? I can't swim!

204
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,500
Hey, you don't get the hiccups anymore.

205
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,520
I-I should go.

206
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,470
Where are you going?

207
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,390
S-Stop fooling around.

208
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,140
My feet could cramp up all of a sudden,

209
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,720
or if I suddenly went into cardiac arrest,

210
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,620
I'd need someone to call for help.

211
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:59,190
What do I do? Please help!

212
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,930
Director Cha!

213
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,270
Please help us!

214
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,600
Hey, hurry!

215
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,670
Please hurry!

216
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,920
- Check His Pulse.
- Yes!

217
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,180
Director Cha!

218
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,410
Go.

219
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,720
I told you to go. Go, go, go!

220
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,180
Please wake up.

221
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,280
Please don't die!

222
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,070
Where are you going? Where are you going? Please don't go.

223
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,490
Go!

224
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:35,660
We'll call for help.

225
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,370
Please wake up!

226
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,780
Please wake up, Director Cha.

227
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,200
I don't regret that night either.

228
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,610
It was a very special day for me.

229
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,370
I'm glad it was with you.

230
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:57,220
I even saw my bra pad in your jewelry box!

231
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,120
Director Cha.

232
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,840
D-Did you really see that?

233
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,310
Damn it! You scared me!

234
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,990
I-I was just fooling around. Did you really see it?

235
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:36,030
That night, when I hid in your closet. That's when I saw it.

236
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,390
I don't know why that was in there.

237
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:45,110
But we all have our unique preferences.

238
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,930
I have my own preferences too.

239
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,720
Yes.

240
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,780
But, why did you bring it here?

241
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,240
Now that the owner is here, I should return it to her.

242
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,170
- Pervert.
- Hey,

243
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,250
Seriously.

244
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,710
I'm not a pervert.

245
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,730
That's all you left behind,

246
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,860
so what was I supposed to do?

247
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:19,240
It wasn't even a shoe. Are you Paderella or what?

248
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,930
- Paderella?
- That's right, Paderella.

249
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,830
If I think about how much I went through because of it... Wow.

250
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,510
Fine, I can understand how you might think I'm a pervert.

251
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,360
Even I don't know why I kept it all this time.

252
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,100
But, if I didn't have that,

253
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,770
I couldn't bring back the memories we shared.

254
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,040
Thank you,

255
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,360
for treasuring it.

256
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,620
If you're really thankful,

257
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,600
can you do that one more time?

258
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:48,160
If you're really thankful, I think that's the least you can do.

259
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,030
♫  I wanna know you  ♫

260
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:01,830
♫  Not your blood type or sign  ♫

261
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,860
♫  But the real you  ♫

262
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,400
♫  The you that no one else knows  ♫

263
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,660
♫  Will you tell me?  ♫

264
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,430
♫  Starting from your first memory  ♫

265
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,660
♫  Except your first lie and first love  ♫

266
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:27,200
♫  I wanna know everything  ♫

267
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,970
Today, you're really not getting the hiccups.

268
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,000
Then, good night.

269
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,620
Oh, okay.

270
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,490
But there's something I'm curious about.

271
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:02,400
That initial. Why is it MH, not YM?

272
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,520
It's not a brand name.

273
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,240
You don't need to know that.

274
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,690
Wait.

275
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,450
A-A-Are you hungry by any chance?

276
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,650
Get back safely.

277
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,440
D-Do you want to eat ramyun...

278
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,870
Sleep well.

279
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:59,460
♫  It’s getting weirder, my heart  ♫

280
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:05,230
I don't regret it because I was being honest to my true feelings.

281
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:11,380
♫  It’s getting weirder, the way I see things are changing
 ♫

282
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,730
♫  They say that’s how love comes  ♫

283
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,030
What should I do?

284
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:21,710
♫  It’s getting weirder, my heart  ♫

285
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,630
♫  It’s getting weirder  ♫

286
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:32,490
Whatever it is, I'll follow where my heart goes.

287
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,640
Let's see how far it goes.

288
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,200
You're saying it's just a nutritionist he's seeing?

289
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,290
Do you want him to come to the office?

290
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,160
No.

291
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,570
We don't know how he'll react without any plan.

292
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,880
Let's find more about this lady first.

293
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,140
What kind of person she is, which family she is from and the flaws she has.

294
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,750
You're here early.

295
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,950
Yeah, I need to write the book.

296
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,020
Oh, you're getting ready for the new book?

297
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,160
You look nice. You don't look tired from the business trip.

298
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:22,290
It was good to sleep by myself in the large bed. When I sleep with three others usually—

299
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,410
it was so comfortable.

300
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,820
Alone?

301
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,150
I feel stupid getting relieved by those words.

302
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,390
Joo Ye Ri was here when you were on your business trip.

303
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:41,280
Joo Ye Ri? Why? To ask you to be on the show?

304
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,630
No, she came to drink. She must have something worrisome going on.

305
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,770
Really?

306
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,720
How was the trip?

307
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,780
I'm late. I'm going to go grocery shopping for the birthday. Do you wanna go with me?

308
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,640
Oh yes. I'll pick you up later.

309
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,770
See you!

310
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,110
I'm so stupid!

311
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:31,250
Director Cha ♡

312
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,690
How was your lunch?

313
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,310
Director Cha ♡

314
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,800
Yes.

315
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,510
I should have not terminated the lunchbox task.

316
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,730
I have no excuse to see your face at work.

317
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:12,620
A little. Very little. It's a bummer.

318
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,720
She is awkward at push and pull.

319
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,040
You know how to laugh like that?

320
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,780
What did I do?

321
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:26,150
Let's have dinner after work today.

322
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,870
I can't today. It's my dog's birthday.

323
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,030
My dog?

324
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,640
I come after the dog?

325
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,590
If he felt sad because he can't go out with me because of the birthday party,

326
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,230
I'm bad.

327
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,520
Yoo Mi!

328
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,570
Good job.

329
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,490
Get on!

330
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,630
- There, I'm ready. - Here we go.

331
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,610
Let's go.

332
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,590
That woman, seriously!

333
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,430
- What are you doing? - Dong Goo likes these.

334
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,430
No, you don't even know him.

335
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:49,100
Here it is. Dong Goo is obsessed with these.

336
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,420
- He only eats these.
- You like these.

337
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,250
Hm, what else should we buy him? Oh, this is the one I like.

338
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,400
- I scared you.
- Let's get this one

339
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,690
- This? Let's buy this one too.
- No!

340
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,270
When did you buy this?

341
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:20,620
Dong Goo is a guy too, so he should have a suit of his own.

342
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,110
Hyeon Tae sure has a good sense of style.

343
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:29,650
Yoo Mi, thanks for preparing Dong Goo's birthday dinner.

344
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,050
It's our fault for having a mother who can't even cook rice.

345
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,230
Let's blow out the candles and eat. I'm hungry.

346
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,490
- Can you light the candles ?
- Sure

347
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:42,390
Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you

348
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:46,140
Happy Birthday, dear Dong Goo.

349
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,610
Happy Birthday to you!

350
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,110
Blow out the candles. One, Two, Three.

351
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,820
I'll turn on the lights.

352
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,270
Ya.

353
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,200
We're closed...

354
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,980
Director Cha.

355
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,740
Are you the director?

356
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,990
- Goodness. Yoo Mi, did you invite him?

357
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,020
No, it's not that...

358
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:34,360
I came here on my own because I heard you're having a birthday party.

359
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,590
But why did you bring dog food?

360
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:40,400
I guess we do have a cute dog in our household.

361
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,180
But, who's that kid?

362
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,330
He's our pride and honor.

363
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,130
Our Dong Goo is my—

364
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,920
Mom!

365
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,670
It's Dong Goo's bedtime.

366
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,190
Hey, we just started.

367
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:59,240
Since it's your birthday, I'll let you watch Dino.

368
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,520
Slam as much as you want.

369
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,140
Hurry up and eat the cake.

370
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,210
- Why?
- Quickly!

371
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,280
I can go back a little later, too...

372
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,040
- Hurry up and...
- Okay.

373
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,480
Wow, you're very muscular.

374
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:30,650
Hyeon Tae, you'd better not be too comfortable.

375
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,410
Hurry up.

376
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,490
I don't want to tell my superior about my complicated family relationships.

377
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,490
Superior? You don't mean your boyfriend?

378
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,410
Ah, come on in.

379
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,450
You don't go in and out of a woman's place where she's living alone, do you?

380
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,780
Well, sometimes.

381
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,720
By the way, do you do much business here?

382
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,540
It's not a bar and it's not a bookstore.

383
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:02,590
It's a little vague, just like the owner.

384
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,840
It's enough to make a living.

385
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,500
I'm not foolish enough to work like someone who ends up suffering from malnutrition.

386
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,250
Okay, should we say cheers once?

387
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,450
One more drink?

388
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,910
Okay.

389
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,240
Will you be okay?

390
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,690
Oh, I'm not going home!

391
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,670
What's wrong with him?

392
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:46,760
I want to leave with Three Meals punk!

393
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,310
Director!

394
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,900
Director!

395
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,620
If I call a substitute driver, can you get home?

396
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,720
If I call a substitute driver, can you get home I said!

397
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,400
No. I can't go!

398
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,090
- No. I'm not going.
- Pardon?

399
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,300
I don't want to go home.

400
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,830
I don't want to sleep alone.

401
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,600
I don't want to eat alone.

402
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,810
Don't you dare try to move me.

403
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,500
Oh, okay, okay, okay. Let's sleep here. Okay?

404
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,260
You should have said that sooner.

405
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,880
It's the weekend... Where are you going?

406
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,520
I forgot about an education session at the headquarters.

407
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,800
PD Lee, when do you have time?

408
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,240
I have something important to talk to you about.

409
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,290
I have a little time over lunch. Do you want to stop by the TV station?

410
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:45,530
When the director gets up, feed him before he goes.

411
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,420
Don't change your tune, okay?

412
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,790
I got it.

413
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,480
[Closed today/Reason: The boss was running around all night] 
 [OPEN: 3PM / CLOSE: Whenever]

414
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,620
It hurts. It hurts.

415
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,770
What are you doing here?

416
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,040
You're up, I see.

417
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,330
Wow, you look cute even with your hair like that.

418
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,450
Pardon? What do you mean?

419
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,100
Ouch.

420
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,900
Yoo Mi made some dried pollack soup, so have some upstairs.

421
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,620
But...

422
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,010
What happened?

423
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,620
Don't you remember?

424
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:05,060
No, not at all.

425
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,710
One more drink?

426
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,760
Fine.

427
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,460
- One more?
- Thank you.

428
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,320
What's your true identity? You're not really her friend are you?

429
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:41,460
Well, you never know what happens with people.

430
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,960
You're the one who should act like her superior.

431
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,820
Do I just look like

432
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,910
Yoo Mi's superior?

433
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,950
Stop bothering her.

434
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,630
You should be the one who's

435
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,690
making your position clear instead of being vague!

436
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,430
Stop using rankism to tell her to do this and that,

437
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,500
and bothering an innocent person!

438
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,930
I dare you to say one more word.

439
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,980
What? If I do?

440
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,510
What are you going to do?

441
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,860
Get up, punk.

442
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,130
Get up.

443
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:31,860
What are you two doing?

444
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,670
Did you get nervous? I said to get up, punk!

445
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,090
He usually passes out when he's drunk.

446
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,390
You should go home, too. I'll call you a substitute driver.

447
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:46,680
This mechanical pencil-like bastard.

448
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,220
He's not a friend! He's black inside!

449
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,530
He's like a mechanical pencil! I said to get up!

450
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,830
What are you talking about?

451
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,750
Oh, it's so annoying!

452
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,030
I'm annoyed, I said.

453
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:12,800
I'm saying I don't like you being in the same space with another man.

454
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,220
You're hiccuping again.

455
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,560
You're cute. So cute.

456
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,750
Director?

457
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,520
Director?

458
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,300
Director!

459
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,530
Yes, I remember now.

460
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,180
I'll be going then.

461
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,090
Nothing to excuse yourself for.

462
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,760
I have something important that's come up.

463
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,110
So I have to go out.

464
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:15,100
Yes, then I'll leave with you.

465
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,820
But there's no one to watch Dong Goo.

466
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,580
I see.

467
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,010
Can you watch him for a few hours?

468
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:29,290
Pardon? Why would I?

469
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:32,850
Well...

470
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,240
If you want to make a good impression on Yoo Mi,

471
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,430
you probably should be good to the kid.

472
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,760
Then I ask of you.

473
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,130
- Pardon?
- Bye, Dong Goo.

474
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,980
Wait, don't say good-bye. Hold on.

475
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,180
Before you eat, take this for your hangover.

476
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,130
Whether you chew it or drink it in one gulp.

477
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:02,530
Whatever is your style.

478
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,900
What are you looking at?

479
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:28,360
But does that cafe owner come here often, too?

480
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,530
What am I asking a kid?

481
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:58,960
Lee Yoo Mi, she even watches these classics.

482
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,930
Wow.

483
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,850
-  She is about to explode! 
- Oh.

484
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,930
It's Going to Explode

485
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:23,050
You're not going to give me back my phone?

486
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,560
Hey, a new sprout should be outside running and playing.

487
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,130
Sitting here like this...

488
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,510
with a smartphone...

489
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,590
Come here.

490
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,410
Let's put this down.

491
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,830
Let's go. To go run around and play.

492
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,730
♫  Everybody say it, Go! Go! Go! Go! ♫

493

♫  The show is on, the curtain has risen  ♫

498
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,400
♫  Go up there and show me your world  ♫

499
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,390
♫  You can expect it  ♫

500
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,780
♫  Life is my stage  ♫

501

♫  Attention, everybody  ♫

502
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,600
♫  Everybody  ♫

503
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,680
Are you going to ride again?

504
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,450
Oh, where are your mothers?

505
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:22,870
Go on, go up.

506
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:51,810
This is where that woman lives?

507
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:56,150
Yes, they live on the second floor of the cafe building.

508
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,810
His eyes for picking out women must be stuck under his feet (very low).

509
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:01,850
How could he pick such a...

510
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:06,480
I should uproot it before it sprouts.

511
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:13,060
What's that? Stop the car.

512
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,080
What's that punk doing over there?

513
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,680
Who's that kid?

514
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,360
Punk...

515
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:44,920
♫  If it’s only one, it’s you  ♫

516
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,690
♫  Even the second, it’s you  ♫

517
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:52,220
♫  My one and only person  ♫

518
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:57,320
♫  Do you know it’s you?  ♫

519
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,630
♫  I’m drawing you out  ♫

520
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:06,630
♫  I’m shouting from here so you can hear  ♫

521
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,610
♫  My last person  ♫

522
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,820
♫  It's you  ♫

523
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:17,530
Epilogue
Revenge is Mine ▶▶▶

524
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,810
You worked hard.

525
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,970
I remember three years ago. How did you get here?

526
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,580
I came by shuttle.

527
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,460
I see. Leave now.

528
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,000
- Pardon?
- Go back on your own.

529
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,450
By myself?

530
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,740
#SecretarySaidSo #YouHaveToTakeCareOfThingsYourself

531
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,490
See you in Seoul.

532
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,570
Did you really worry about me?

533
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:59,370
Stop it.

534
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:12,170
♫  Love love love is so sweet  ♫

535
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:16,030
♫  Love love love is so sweet  ♫

536
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:19,530
♫  Milky lattes  ♫

537
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:23,430
♫ And pretty blankets that make you sleep ♫

538
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:30,240
♫  Everything is perfect, love is mint pink  ♫

539
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:35,770
♫ Burning romance, please let it go ♫

540
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:39,830
♫  With that smile that was cold yesterday  ♫

541
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:44,370
♫  But warm today  ♫

542
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:47,820
♫  You confuse me  ♫

543
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,820
♫  Burning romance, what do I do?  ♫

544
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,620
♫  Every day, I miss you  ♫

545
00:49:55,620 --> 00:50:01,120
♫  I don’t even know how I feel  ♫

546
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:07,660
♫  I like you, The end ♫

547
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,700
My Secret Romance

548
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,620
I guess Dong Goo looks like his dad.

549
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,050
- Who the hell is this kid?
- Ach, that's...

550
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:33,500
You don't have to tell me why I'm here, do you?

551
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,670
Tell me everything about what happened to you three years ago.

552
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:41,510
In my life, something like that, someone like that, you were the only one.

553
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:45,810
I thought the concept of family didn't suit me.

554
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:48,760
I think I could do it if it were those two.

555
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,180
Will you be okay? He's not an ordinary person.

556
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:55,090
For now, I'll do what my heart tells me to.
