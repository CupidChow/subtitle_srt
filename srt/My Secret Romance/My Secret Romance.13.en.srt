Episode 13. It's Time to Wake Up From Dream

11
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,160
I heard her mom is an erotic actress.

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,800
Wow, really? What the...

13
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,080
Like mother, like daughter.

14
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,910
That Joo Hye Ri, she ruined her show because of her.

15
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,000
Really?

16
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,980
You saw, right?

17
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,900
Why? Yesterday with the noona?

18
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,280
It's her, it's her. The one whose mom is an erotic actress.

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,180
Poor her.

20
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,130
The reason I'm not doing anything

21
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,940
is because I'm waiting for Jin Wook to figure it out himself. Just know that.

22
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:02,450
It's not like anything's set between you two.

23
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,580
By chance, Nutritionist Lee Yoo Mi is...

24
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,630
She left without a word, so we can't get in touch either.

25
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,890
It's all because of you.

26
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,950
What, what's because of me?

27
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,410
Who do you think you are?

28
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,450
What do you think you know to be saying things like that on air?

29
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,560
Well, while we were talking, it just...

30
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,950
Also, that guy is offensive.

31
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,360
After dating however he wants,

32
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,770
and saying Dong Goo is his and whatnot and then throwing you away!

33
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,400
How can a man be so...

34
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,620
Dating?

35
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,670
There's nothing like that between us.

36
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,560
We just had a one night stand, that's all!

37
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,790
It's a secret that I should be taking to the grave without anyone knowing.

38
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,430
So why would you tell people anything?

39
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,800
Why would you? Why?!

40
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,170
Well... So what?

41
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,590
Is it a sin to have met a guy?

42
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,540
Was it nice to be on TV by using me?

43
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,960
You only care about yourself.

44
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,580
How hard it might be for me,

45
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,610
how I might feel. You don't care about those things at all, right?

46
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,340
How can you call yourself a mom?

47
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,660
I got it, you wench!

48
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,080
I will never say anything about you on air,

49
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,850
so you live your life thinking you don't have a mother!

50
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,370
I wish I could!

51
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,210
If you hadn't gotten married at that resort while making all that fuss...

52
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,260
No, if it weren't for that damned "It's Going to Explode."

53
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,660
No, if my mom wasn't that type of a person,

54
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,120
it wouldn't have turned out this badly.

55
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,140
Living as a daughter of an erotic actress,

56
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,610
do you know how hard it is?

57
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,130
Hey, I heard her mom is an erotic actress.

58
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,940
Oh! Wow!

59
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,360
That's no joke!

60
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,810
Do you know how hard I worked to try and live

61
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,660
so that no one would say it's because I'm a daughter of an erotic actress?

62
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,380
You did it because you liked it, but not me.

63
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,020
I'm embarrassed and ashamed.

64
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,960
Even if I live all buttoned up like this,

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,080
I feel like I'm naked in front of people.

66
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,690
I won't do this anymore.

67
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,980
I'm sick of it!

68
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,880

Where is she I said!

75

I warned you before, didn't I?

76
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,270
To draw the line. This is what I was worried would happen.

77
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,980
Because she might get hurt like this because she might get wounded, because she might hide!

00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,780
He said he missed his mom's abalone porridge.

165
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,380
Saying it never tastes the same anywhere else.

166
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,710
Really?

167
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,560
Even if I learned how to make it well,

168
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,420
I can't make it for him.

169
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,720
You must have really liked that man.

170
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,880
I'll do the dishes after.

171
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,140
I'm sorry.

172
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,920
Sorry.

173
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,700
Thanks to you, I ate and rested well.

174
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,930
Don't say such things.

175
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,450
By the way, do you know how to ride a bike?

176
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,670
Pardon?

177
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,240
I have a bike. Do you want to ride it?

178
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,790
It's better than walking, I think.

179
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,670
Really?

180
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,390
Then I'll bring it back before I leave.

181
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,970
Okay.

182
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,840
What?

183
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,370
There.

184
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,710
It was you?

185
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,300
Hey, I told you you can't be in the house.

186
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,950
Are you okay?

187
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:28,900
♫  You're far away  ♫

188
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:38,550
♫  If you could hear me now  ♫

189
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,900
♫  Across the vast expanse of the sea  ♫

190
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,700
♫  If only I could hear this voice  ♫

191
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,010
Where is she?

192
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,880
Where the heck did Lee Yoo Mi hide?

193
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:07,200
♫  You can't see it  ♫

194
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:16,080
♫  If only I could feel my love right now  ♫

195
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,180
♫  I will show you my love, ♫

196
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,600

197

♫  than any other valuable thing in the world  ♫

198
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,210
♫  What do you think is the same?  ♫

199
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,380
♫  Love is the same  ♫

200
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:51,570
♫  When we meet, my heart goes thump thump thump ♫

201
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,880
♫  When we brush our teeth, thump thump thump  ♫

202
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,010
♫  When we’re apart, it’s an even bigger thump  ♫

203
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,820
♫  What else is the same with you and me?  ♫

204
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,140
♫  I wanna know you  ♫

205
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,710
- What are you doing?
- I'm dancing!

206
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,250
Why are you doing this in public? It's humiliating.

207
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:37,230
Stop it! Stop!

208
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:52,150
I wouldn't have started the relationship if I had known it would hurt so much.

209
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,340
It's me who got away, but why does it hurt so much?

210
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:05,440
It hasn't been that long, I wanna see him already.

211
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:27,650
Lee Yoo Mi, I miss you.

212
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:33,220
Not you in my memory, but you for real.

213
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,900
Look at this! Yay, the money on the street!

214
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,880
Look! It's made in the year I was born.

215
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,900
I feel so lucky.

216
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,920
Didn't you have too many bad things today to be lucky?

217
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,870
Even if there are hundreds of bad things,

218
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:03,210
if there was a single good thing, it's considered as a good day.

219
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,810
₩ 500 (5 cents) on this huge beach,

220
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,870
and it's from the year I was born. It's big luck!

221
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,550
Here, it's a gift!

222
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,310
I'll find you!

223
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,020
Is it your hobby to be poor?

224
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,260
Just go away, pretend you didn't see me.

225
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,010
I mean I thought you might jump into the car.

226
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,570
What?

227
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,860
Right, one after the other. I'll forget about those.

228
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,960
Lee Yoo Mi.

229
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:57,280
Do you know how long I have looked for you?

230
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,070
I felt like I was dying because I was so worried about you.

231
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,200
Why did you come all the way here?

232
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,320
You said not to find you.

233
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:53,830
I was so worried you would run away forever.

234
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,860
You lost so much weight.

235
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,890
I didn't eat because I was worried about you.

236
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,690
Like a fool... Why did you do that?

237
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,670
So from now on, don't go anywhere.

238
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,910
Have I ever told you that I have insomnia?

239
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,500
No.

240
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,690
Was it when I was about Dong Goo's age?

241
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,920
My mom disappeared suddenly.

242
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:47,000
Mom's smell! I smell you mom!

243
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,190
Right,

244
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,030
I'm sleepy.

245
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,460
Get some sleep.

246
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,270
Mom?

247
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,100
Mom!

248
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,330
Mom!

249
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:43,770
Mom! Mom!

250
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:48,590
Mom!

251
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,440
Mom!

252
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,000
That's why I was so keen about Dong Goo.

253
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,120
I didn't want him to be like me.

254
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,090
You mom, do you blame her?

255
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,700
No.

256
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,670
There must be a reason for it.

257
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:14,720
She was born and raised around the beach, so it must be hard for her.

258
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:20,730
No matter big the house it, it's not as big as the sea.

259
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,220
I still blame my mom.

260
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,020
All this,

261
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:38,540
after I found she used to be a porn star,

262
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,550
I was acting like an adolescent.

263
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,860
I was afraid others would point to me,

264
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,630
I buttoned all of my buttons even though it is so uncomfortable.

265
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,140
I couldn't have any relationship because I was afraid of being seen as a slut.

266
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,990
My heart fluttered when reading a cheesy romance novel.

267
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,500
Am I stupid?

268
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:07,480
General Manager, wait... no.

269
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:13,510
I was happy because of Cha Jin Wook, the person.

270
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:20,110
I got to date the cool guy.

271
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,110
It was like a dream.

272
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,090
Don't say that.

273
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,840
For you, I am not like a dream.

274
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:45,430
I still have a lot of things that I didn't do with you.

275
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:50,430
Let's do them all, one by one for a long time.

276
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,930
I won't ever let you go.

277

I only eat what this woman makes.

00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:39,270
I don't want to sleep by myself,

323
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,770
I don't want to eat by myself.

324
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,120
Dong Goo, look at that! What's that?

325
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,540
Why? What's that?

326
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,260
I have only worked so hard.

327
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,850
I thought that was the only way I could live, because of you, Yoo Mi.

328
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,530
Thank you,

329
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:43,590
my first love and my last love.

330
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,680
It's you.

331
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,450
♫  I love you, always stay by me  ♫

332
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:36,490
♫  Everything is my life  ♫

333
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,510
♫  You are my everything  ♫

334

♫  Always by my side  ♫

335
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,150
♫  You know that you the one  ♫

336
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,700
♫  You are the my world  ♫

337
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,080
♫  I know it will be true  ♫

338
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:55,800
♫  You are my everything, my love is for you only  ♫

♫  No matter what the difficulties, I will still only love you  ♫

340
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:03,740
♫  As time flows by  ♫

341

00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,140
♫  I love you  ♫

343
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,540
♫  The morning have arrived  ♫

344
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,350
♫  With the sound of the noisy alarm clock  ♫

345
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:21,400
♫  The sweet voice that has now replaced the alarm clock  ♫

346
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,650
♫ My friends, I'm sorry ♫

347
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,460
♫  Our two-person world is more enjoyable than going out  ♫

348
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:31,830
♫  Everyday I will record our love story in the diary  ♫

349
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,110
♫  I don't know when you came to my side  ♫

350
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,930
♫  But you have always been with me  ♫

351
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:39,090
♫  This is love  ♫

352
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,370
♫  Whe didn't I know it  ♫

353
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,840
♫  I breathe because of your smile  ♫

354
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,770
♫  I dream because of your shining eyes ♫

355
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,750
♫ This is how I do ♫

Epilogue 13, Letting you go

357
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:56,390
#Now #NoNeed #WannaKeep

Epilogue 13, A lover passing by

364
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:00,550
#SamePlace #SameTime #Together #Lover

365
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:05,730
#Shadow #They #WentBy

366
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:25,300
♫  You're far away  ♫

367
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:33,860
♫  If you could hear me now  ♫

368
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:39,820
♫  Across the vast expanse of the sea  ♫

369
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:43,300
♫  If only I could hear this voice  ♫

370
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,970
There's nothing much to us,

371
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:51,450
but let's pray that we can become like a coin.

372
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:59,860
You're heads, I'm tails.

373
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:05,890
Let's pray that we become like a coin

374
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:11,570
that will get thrown away if one side is missing,

375
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:17,000
so we can always be together,

376
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,240
even though we can't be face-to-face.

377
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,730
We might not be able to see each other

378
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,640
but we'll be together forever.

379
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,880
To be like a coin...

380
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,440
Let's pray.

381
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:39,080
There's nothing much to us,

382
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,420
But let's pray that we can become like a coin.
♫  When loneliness  ♫

383
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:49,340
♫ makes me sick ♫

384
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,030
You're heads,

385
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:56,580
I'm tails.

386
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,650
Let's pray that we become like a coin

387
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,520
that will get thrown away if one side is missing,

388
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,850
so we can always be together,

389
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:18,560
even though we can't be face-to-face. 
♫  When you're crying  ♫

390
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:25,620
♫  and you're tired of despair  ♫

391
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,370
We might not be able to see each other,

392
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,070
but we'll be

393
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,180
together forever.

394
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,840
♫  I'd appreciate it  ♫

395
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,890
♫ if you could share with me  ♫

396
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:49,570
Let's pray to be like a coin.

397
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:56,170
♫ Even it's very far away ♫

398
00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:00,690
♫  I can hear  ♫

399
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:05,430
♫  the sound of you coming  ♫

400
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:09,980
♫

401
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:18,660
♫

402
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:23,400
♫  Sound of you ♫

403
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:29,170
My Secret Romance

404
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,700
♫  No matter what the difficulties, I will still only love you  ♫

405
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:38,720
I want you to be happy with someone you like,

406
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,330
instead of being scared that you'll get hurt.

407
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:46,050
It feels too unfair to let things just end this way.

408
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:49,210
- Are you going somewhere?
- I don't have a return ticket so I don't know when I'll be back.

409
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:53,210
If I lose this woman, I feel like I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

410
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:55,350
We haven't even begun.

411
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:56,760
That's what I want to say.

412
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,850
If you love him, then just hold onto him.
