My Secret Romance

3
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,170
♫  Never even imagined, love love  ♫

4
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,420
♫  It’s in my eyes, love love  ♫

5
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,660
♫  Maybe it’s love love love  ♫

6
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:10,880
Episode 8. This Is How You Do Business

7
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,130
It's work, work! Business!

8
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,220
I'm the creditor and she's the debtor.

9
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:26,430
To: Three Meals Bastard

10
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,000
Aren't you getting off work?

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,360
It looks like you're waiting for someone.

12
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,430
No. I'm here because still have an order left.

13
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,610
You go ahead.

14
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,590
Something smells fishy.

15
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,390
No, there's nothing.

16
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,040
I'll head out first.

17
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,110
See you tomorrow.

18
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:12,890
From: 1 9 8 9 ₩500

19
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,010
Let's have dinner together.

20
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,620
I'll wait for you on the first floor.

21
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,620
I thought as much.

22
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,440
Why did you keep looking around like a meerkat on your way over here?

23
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,380
Because someone might see.

24
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,100
You said you have to walk your dog. What's the reason you suddenly

25
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,610
changed your mind?

26
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,090
I need to pay off my debt.

27
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,830
I was thinking about it and I realized

28
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,350
I should pay it off quickly before interest gets added.

29
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,330
The dog will understand.

30
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,930
Did something happen?

31
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,410
Not at all.

32
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,070
But, where are we going?

33
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:42,260
Since the restaurant reservation is canceled, that won't do. Let's go to my house.

34
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,990
Yes, let's...

35
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,190
What?

36
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,310
House?

37
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,650
What are you doing? Aren't you getting out?

38
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,790
Well...

39
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,230
Going into a single man's house at this time of night is a bit...

40
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,150
Let's just go to a nearby haejang soup (hangover soup) place.

41
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,570
Why is your face getting red again?

42
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,310
What?

43
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,320
Don't think of weird things and let's just go inside.

44
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,170
I am hungry.

45
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,300
What is it?

46
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,830
Th-Th-That over there.

47
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,870
That rascal.

48
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,130
She's cranky because she's pregnant. Just pretend like you don't notice her.

49
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,350
But, how long do you plan on grabbing onto me?

50
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,770
Have a seat.

51
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,820
Nonetheless, you're here as my guest. I should be hospitable.

52
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,660
Why is there a blanket on the sofa?

53
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,700
Oh, that? I can't sleep well at night.

54
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,510
Do you have insomnia or something like that?

55
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,060
Since when?

56
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,970
Not sure. When did it start? I can't remember.

57
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,260
You're good with a knife.

58
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,800
Why didn't you tell me?

59
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,680
Because you didn't ask me.

60
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,140
I guess you often bring women here and make food for them.

61
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,840
This is the first time that I've brought a woman here.

62
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,380
Yeah, sure.

63
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,270
Up until now, you were sulking, and now you're jealous?

64
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,880
J-Jealous?!

65
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,020
Don't make assumptions.

66
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,180
You're totally not my type.

67
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,660
You'll change your food after you take one bite of the food I make.

68
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,580
♫  The way I see things are changing  ♫

69
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,890
♫  They say that’s how love comes  ♫

70
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,110
Do you need help with anything?

71
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,940
I'm just fine on my own.

72
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,500
♫  Love love ♫

73
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,860
♫  It’s in my eyes, love love  ♫

74
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,850
♫  Maybe it’s, love love love  ♫

75
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,220
Just sit down and stay still.

76
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,410
I'm doing this because I feel awkward, because of my job.

77
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,430
Then bring me the broccoli from the refrigerator.

78
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,100
Okay.

79
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,650
And? Do you need anything else?

80
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
What do I need...

81
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,520
It's good! Good.

82
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,260
♫  It’s getting weirder  ♫

83
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,070
Is it good?

84
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,280
Yeah.

85
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,790
♫  They say that’s how love comes  ♫

86
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,550
Alright, so the food is done.

87
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,230
Will you turn off the light?

88
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,320
Why turn off the light?

89
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,240
I prefer dim light when eating.

90
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,470
Can you help with moving these?

91
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,600
Okay.

92
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,020
Your hands, please.

93
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,490
This is mine

94
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,670
and this is yours.

95
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,300
Don't drop them. These dishes are expensive.

96
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,120
Of course, I'm good at this kind of stuff.

97
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,110
And this is an appetizer.

98
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,970
♫  I wanna know you  ♫

99
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:07,120
♫  Not your blood type or sign  ♫

100
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,260
♫  But the real you  ♫

101
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,680
♫  The you that no one else knows  ♫

102
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,040
♫  Will you tell me?  ♫

103
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,780
♫  Starting from your first memory  ♫

104
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:28,150
♫  Except your first lie and first love  ♫

105
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:34,290
♫  I wanna know everything  ♫

106
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,000
What are you doing? Come have a seat.

107
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,040
Here, try this.

108
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,930
Why is my father here at this hour?

109
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,500
If it's your father...

110
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,540
Chairman Cha?

111
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,740
Why isn't he opening the door?

112
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,660
F-Father.

113
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,020
What brings you here

114
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,590
without any notice?

115
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:50,330
Why? Is now a bad time or something?

116
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,140
No, it's not that.

117
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,640
Oh, I'm thirsty.

118
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,800
Father, you didn't eat dinner yet, did you?

119
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,700
This is...

120
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,280
Please sit, Father.

121
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,120
Were you waiting for someone?

122
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,810
No, this is how I normally eat.

123
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,840
I'm not in any kind of relationship with Joo Hye Ri.

124
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:27,300
That jewelry box has nothing to do with her.

125
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,580
The main character is someone else.

126
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,850
What was that?

127
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:17,220
Yes? No, this house. Gosh.

128
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,620
Is someone here?

129
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:28,150
No one's here, Father. Have you ever seen me invite anyone over to my house?

130
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,610
Father! Father!

131
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,100
Why are you getting up in the middle of a meal? Where are you going?

132
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,850
I'll go check it out.

133
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,450
Just stay seated here, Father.

134
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,540
I should move out or something.

135
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,650
What's wrong with this house? What was that sound?

136
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,390
Father, please!

137
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,000
Gosh, that surprised me.

138
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,030
What is that?

139
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,380
What is she doing here?

140
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,590
She's a stray cat.

141
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,990
Hey! Blackie!

142
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,890
I told you not to come inside the house.

143
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,930
How did you get in here?

144
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,580
Are you raising that cat?

145
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,390
No, I'm not really raising her. She just lives here.

146
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,480
This punk.

147
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,650
I thought you were hiding a girl.

148
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,830
Were you here alone?

149
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,280
Call Hye Ri and tell her I enjoyed the show.

150
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,700
Yes.

151
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,050
Look how she helps you

152
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,100
I made the right choice.

153
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,070
Yes. I got it.

154
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,260
Father, get home safely.

155
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,660
Fine, go inside.

156
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,140
Yes I will. Please get in.

157
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,940
Please take him home.

158
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,530
Lee Yoo...

159
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,670
Lee Yoo Mi?

160
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,500
Lee... Lee Yoo...

161
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,520
Oh!

162
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,790
You scared me.

163
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,720
Are you okay?

164
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,620
Yes.

165
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,670
I think I should go home now.

166
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,170
Wait, you can't leave in the middle of dinner.

167
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,400
It's okay. Then I'll be going.

168
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,310
Gosh. What is she going to do about her hiccups?

169
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,000
Gosh. I just lost ten years of my life.

170
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,030
Taxi!

171
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,370
Where did it go?

172
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,730
Oh, where did the other one go?

173
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,410
Don't tell me...

174
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,980
M.H

175
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,550
What are you doing? Did you hide some money there?

176
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,290
No, it's nothing.

177
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,460
It's Dong Goo's birthday next week, so make some time.

178
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,480
We should throw him a party even if it's just the three of us.

179
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,660
Right, Dong Goo? You're going to blow out the candles?

180
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,630
I'm going to blow out the candles.

181
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,140
I found it.

182
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,610
Why did I forget this of all the things?

183
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,060
What are you going to do with those bra pads?

184
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,150
Are you going to a party?

185
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,930
What are you talking about, what party?

186
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,840
I booked a meeting with the buyer this Wednesday.

187
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,400
Did you also ask the resort?

188
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,170
Of course.

189
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,290
We can't make even the slightest mistake.

190
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,830
He's known to be picky.

191
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,480
I doubt he's as picky as you.

192
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,550
Secretary Jang, what are you trying to say?

193
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,960
I've been your secretary for almost three years.

194
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,480
In three years, you pick up a few things.

195
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,070
There's a rumor that,

196
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,130
Working under you for three years, there are rumors your body produces Sarira. (bodily relics of spiritual masters)

197
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,030
Thanks to that, people now call me "The Legendary Jang Woo Jin."

198
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,490
It feels like you just dissed me.

199
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,950
I'm just saying.

200
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,740
What brings you here

201
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,620
without any notice?

202
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,830
Why? Is now a bad time or something?

203
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,550
No, but...

204
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,580
I'm thirsty.

205
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,010
Yes, Chairman Cha.

206
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:44,070
Secretary Kim, I think Jin Wook is seeing someone.

207
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,410
Look into it.

208
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,270
♫ Nothing is easy ♫

209
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,530
♫ You don't have the same feelings as I do ♫

210
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,030
You're tone-deaf.

211
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,460
That scared me.

212
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,790
You seem to be in a hurry this morning, just like you were in a hurry to leave last night.

213
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:09,630
Why are you avoiding me, like someone who saw something they shouldn't have?

214
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,950
M.H.

215
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,470
Follow me. There's somewhere we need to go together.

216
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,030
What is it?

217
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,720
Gosh, what is there to see in such a shabby neighborhood?

218
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,760
I heard he sold books and alcohol, so I thought it would be a bookstore with a bar,

219
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,000
but this is it?

220
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,620
Where is the owner of this place?

221
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:54,320
How can the owner leave the store?

222
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,020
You're from the shop, right? Please take this.

223
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,890
Oh hey!

224
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,930
Sorry, it's three dollars, right? One moment.

225
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,560
Here, you keep the change.

226
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,950
Ah you're here for the change?

227
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,200
Where are we?

228
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,160
You have yet to properly see it, right?

229
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,120
What? See what?

230
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,960
I brought you because I thought it would be faster for you to see it for yourself.

231
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,210
This is the first product from my company.

232
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:40,220
The company was skeptical about men's underwear,

233
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,760
but it's bringing lots of money to the company now.

234
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,240
- We're planning on selling it abroad too.
- Wow.

235
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,030
That's amazing.

236
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,320
But why are you telling me all this?

237
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,100
I need your help.

238
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,780
What? My help?

239
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,330
An overseas buyer will come on Wednesday.

240
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:02,980
It's an important contract to determine whether we can make the oversea market or not,

241
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,860
so we are taking special care of this matter.

242
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,850
During the period, I ask that you

243
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,160
prepare meals for that buyer.

244
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,260
Me?

245
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,720
This time, make the lunchbox for that buyer, not me.

246
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,970
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you before.

247
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,230
You looked so sexy— I mean, young and handsome,

248
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,650
I didn't expect you to be an author.

249
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,030
Who says so?

250
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:39,560
Who says that authors are old and ugly?

251
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,180
That's not what I'm saying.

252
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,270
Anyway, if you appear on our show, it'll be good for you in many ways.

253
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,680
A bookstore run by a young, good looking writer!

254
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,500
If we promote the store as such, you will get more customers—

255
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,790
I don't like that.

256
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,790
Excuse me?

257
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,890
People already come to the store without any promotion.

258
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:03,740
But if I go on a TV show, more people will come and I won't have free time.

259
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,130
Ah, I see.

260
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,720
If so, let's remove the personal matters and store promotion

261
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,180
and talk about your book.

262
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,520
Then it won't be fun, right?

263
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,450
It's a high-quality show.

264
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,720
Not everyone can appear.

265
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,530
Do you know who the previous guest was?

266
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:33,440
Cha Jin Wook, the heir of Daebok Group!

267
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,030
Has that piqued your interest?

268
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,330
As far as I know, he has diabetes and cares about his health very much.

269
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:50,970
He won't be here long, but still, he may not like Korean cuisine.

270
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,040
If we provide prepared meals for him, he might think, "Wow, they really care about me."

271
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,340
That's a possibility,

272
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,520
and I think it would be advantageous.

273
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,340
How can I do such an important job?

274
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,240
Just do it as you did it for me.

275
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,730
I can think of this as business, right?

276
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:14,060
"Business" like how we dined together.

277
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,480
Is this because of what I said—

278
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,200
Let's call it even.

279
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,730
The three debts I have remaining, let's call it even with this.

280
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,790
I can't do that.

281
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,870
Why not?

282
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:33,630
If I were to go on the business trip and prepare the meals, wouldn't that be worth 300,000 won?

283
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,870
It's under different conditions.

284
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,050
You said to keep the boundaries between work and personal.

285
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:42,740
And it's four times, not three times.

286
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,780
How so?

287
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,400
We weren't able to complete our meal last night,

288
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,460
so it doesn't count.

289
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,640
After everything I went through, hiding in the closet on an empty stomach,

290
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,180
That doesn't count?

291
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,410
There's nothing I can do.

292
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,470
This is how you do business.

293
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,540
I wish he couldn't talk.

294
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,580
Why are you here, Mom? Where are you going with Dong Goo?

295
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,440
We're on our way to Kica.

296
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,770
Kica?

297
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,690
Kids' cafe.

298
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,660
Kids' cafe?

299
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,890
You don't know slang?

300
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,430
I don't think I'm young enough to know that.

301
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,340
Is that so?

302
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,810
Oh, her!

303
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,030
She's Joo Hye Ri, right?

304
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,960
Do you not know me?

305
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,990
Mom, please...

306
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,680
How did you find out where I live?

307
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,290
You live here?

308
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,610
I said, why did you come here?

309
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,540
Here.

310
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,520
Reserve me an extra room.

311
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,980
Is another person coming?

312
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,930
Ms. Lee Yoo Mi will be joining us on this business trip.

313
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,700
Why would she?

314
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,880
We need someone to take care of this picky buyer.

315
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,000
Just leave it be.

316
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,860
There's a five-star chef at the resort. What do you need a nutritionist fo—

317
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,190
We need her.

318
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,090
How can we possibly go on a business trip without a nutritionist? I'll make the preparations right away.

319
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,370
I'm saying this again, but this is strictly business.

320
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,460
Business.

321
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,530
Also, this time you'll be going separately.

322
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,340
Yes, Si— What?

323
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,770
Separately. Let's go separately.

324
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,140
Yes, Sir.

325
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,860
Oh, Oppa!

326
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,700
Yeah?

327
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,960
About that nutritionist, do you know she lives with another man?

328
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,560
Yeah, I know.

329
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,890
O-Oh, you know?

330
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,230
You called to tell me that?

331
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,690
No. It's not that. The kid in that house—

332
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,590
I'm getting a phone call. I'm hanging up.

333
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:20,780
What's that? It's definitely not the old lady's child.

334
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,760
What could it be?

335
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,600
Wooh!

336
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,690
Why did Joo Hye Ri come all the way here?

337
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,590
Oh, she wants me to appear on her show.

338
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,680
That one that my director was on?

339
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,180
"My director"?

340
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,920
So, did you say you'll do it?

341
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,090
Why? Would you like it if I did it?

342
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:49,190
Wouldn't it be good if you did? I heard that only successful people can go on that show.

343
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,650
You'll get very busy and become famous,

344
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,340
although I'll be a bit bored without you

345
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,320
People from all across the nation will want to see Jeong Hyeon Tae's face

346
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,940
and form a line in front of the store or something like that.

347
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,330
Then, what would you think of it?

348
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,700
What?

349
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,830
If I couldn't hang out with you because other girls were lined up to see me.

350
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,760
Well if there's a decent woman you could even go on a date and— Oh my!

351
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,960
Why do you ask?

352
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,260
What's with that look?

353
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,170
Geez, don't look at me like that.

354
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,240
What's up with you all of a sudden?

355
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,630
How is this?

356
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,260
Do you feel anything?

357
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:49,060
Um...

358
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,980
Your muscles shrunk a little.

359
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,090
Ah.

360
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,620
Really?

361
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,690
It's late, let's go quickly. I need to pack for a business trip tomorrow.

362
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,430
Business trip? Do nutritionists go on business trips too?

363
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,200
Apparently so.

364
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,660
You still didn't throw that thing away?

365
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,380
Give that to me! I'll go throw it away.

366
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,310
Why would you throw this away? It's perfectly fine.

367
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,660
You said it's an important occasion!

368
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,840
You need to dress the part, even if it's not designer label clothes.

369
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,660
I'll handle it myself.

370
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,300
"Handle it," bull crap.

371
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,550
Make sure you pack that thing.

372
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,340
That thing?

373
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,990
Bra pads. The ones I gave you.

374
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:54,730
I've cleaned them for 20 years because I was going to give them to you.

375
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,450
You should use them at a time like this.

376
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,630
I'm going there to work, why would I take the pads?

377
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,220
M.H

378
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,160
She's still the same.

379
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,270
Same as three years ago.

380
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,100
Your clothing...

381
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,770
I like that you're always the same.

382
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:38,510
Get in.

383
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,300
Okay.

384
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,910
Where's Secretary Jang?

385
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,550
I sent him away. I wanted to go separately.

386
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,350
Where are we headed?

387
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,860
I haven't heard yet.

388
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,540
You'll know when you get there.

389
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,150
It was here.

390
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,420
What are they telling me to do here?

391
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,130
So you didn't tell...!

392
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:02,160
Sorry, I have a bad memory here.

393
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,790
Let's go!

394
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,960
To work!

395
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,570
Seriously. This isn't right.

396
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,660
Let's go!

397
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,570
No.

398
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,470
Hey guys,

399
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,890
this is my secretary, Mr. Jang.

400
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,990
Nice to meet you.

401
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,800
And Yoo Mi.

402
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,250
She will be taking care of your meals.

403
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,770
Hello.

404
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,460
Oh wow. The dietician just for me?

405
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,850
Yep.

406
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:41,600
I'm so happy to meet you. I hope everything will go well.

407
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,460
Let's go now.

408
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,370
Let's go.

409
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:13,700
This company is definitely worth investing in. Let's start writing on the contract.

410
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,780
Sounds good.

411
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,750
This is rice covered with lotus leaf.

412
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,980
Quercetin that's in the lotus leaf has a great antioxidative effect,

413
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,600
so it's good for anti-aging.

414
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,420
This is lotus leaf rice,

415
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:41,890
the rice has been in a lotus leaf, and

416
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,960
steamed.

417
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,740
Delicious!

418
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,020
What's this?

419
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,880
I didn't order room service.

420
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,920
It's free.

421
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,860
You came to apologize you said, so do it.

422
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,950
No way.

423
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,900
Wear this and come down.

424
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,520
I chose it myself while thinking of you.

425
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,300
It should be fine, right?

426
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,410
This woman. You make it impossible for me to take my eyes off of you even for a second.

427
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,040
Clean it.

428
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,200
I guess you usually shower with wine rather than drink it.

429
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,100
Thank God this is all that happened. We could have called 911 again.

430
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,420
Let's stop that.

431
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,310
It was pretty.

432
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,300
The dress.

433
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,550
It's expensive.

434
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,560
Then I have to pay you back for this as well?

435
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,640
It's not going to work with just having meals together ten times.

436
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,000
Wait. I didn't say I wanted to wear the dress!

437
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,520
You told me to wear it.

438
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,440
Excuse me.

439
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,860
It's our staff's mistake, we are very sorry.

440
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,950
Sorry.

441
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:57,580
It's okay. You didn't mean to.

442
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,170
It's okay.

443
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,590
No.

444
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:06,490
We apologized to this lady.

445
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,560
You should too!

446
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,170
Why me?

447
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,980
Aren't you the head director of Daebok Group?

448
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,820
It's the fault of your employees, so you should, of course, apologize.

449
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,360
Go ahead.

450
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,830
I apologize.

451
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:33,360
No, it's fine.

452
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,010
You trained your employees very well.

453
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:42,720
You're on a whole different level than someone who called me a ragged bull.

454
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,690
This is what we have prepared as a gift.

455
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:50,810
It's my fault, too. You didn't have to.

456
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:51,990
It's fine.

457
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:56,360
You two have a great time.

458
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,910
What are you doing?

459
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,760
You might drop it again,

460
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,070
I'll keep it.

461
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,990
Excuse me, director! This is mine.

462
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:24,280
I was almost hit by a cart, and it was also I who had wine all over me.

463
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,030
Why do you keep it?

464
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,890
The one who saved you from getting hit by the cart and dying is me.

465
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:32,420
Also, you heard them say,

466
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,250
"You two have a great time," and give this to us.

467
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,710
Then I own the half of this.

468
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,030
Gosh, seriously.

469
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:43,370
Then what? You wanted to drink it together?

470
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,070
Why not? Between us.

471
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,370
B-Between us?

472
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:52,320
Seriously.

473
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,640
Give it to me.

474
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,020
I don't want to.

475
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,510
Come on.

476
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,690
You wait till I catch you.

477
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:07,590
Is this wine expensive?

478
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,540
That was close.

479
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,830
Why, why, why?

480
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:21,220
Aigoo.

481
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,370
Come on, give it to me!

482
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,830
Gosh.

483
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:33,530
I caught you!

484
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:37,420
♫ What else is the same ♫

485
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,620
♫  between you and me ♫

486
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,810
♫  I wanna know you ♫

487
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:45,000
I'm caught.

488
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,710
♫ Not your blood type or sign ♫

489
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,780
♫  But the real you ♫

490
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,860
Go upstairs first.

491
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,440
I'll come up with the wine glasses.

492
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,430
♫  Will you tell me? ♫

493
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,410
♫  Starting from your first memory ♫

494
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:10,650
♫ Except your first lie and first love
I wanna know everything ♫

00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:17,000
♫  I wanna know everything ♫

♫  What do you think is different?  ♫

497
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:27,520
♫  Two minus one is one but  ♫

498
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,600
♫  Me without you is not one at all  ♫

499
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,950
♫  When I see you, my heart trembles  ♫

500
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:44,180
♫  When I miss you, my heart rings  ♫

501
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:51,380
♫  I wanna be your one and only  ♫

♫  I wanna know you ♫

503
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,560
♫  Not your blood type or sign ♫

504
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:08,160
♫  But the real you The you that no one else knows  ♫

505
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,180
♫  Will you tell me?  ♫

506
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:17,200
♫  Starting from your first memory  ♫

507
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,600
♫  Except your first lie  ♫

508
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,210
♫  and first love I wanna know everything  ♫

509

♫  My sign is the star of scars  ♫

510
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,380
♫  I’m shy,  ♫

511
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:44,200
♫  lonely and irritable  ♫

512
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,660
♫  I always  ♫

513

♫  think alone  ♫

514

[Epilogue]
You've never had an appetizer like this, have you? ...

516
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:01,380
When I eat, I prefer dim light.

517
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:06,610
Will you help carry the foods to the table?

518
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,000
Yes.

519
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,350
Give me your hands.

520
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:13,130
#GiveMeYourHands #Never #DropThem

521
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:15,460
This is mine,

522
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,330
and this is yours.

523
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:22,350
Don't drop them, they're expensive.

524
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,810
Of course.

525
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,150
I'm good at this sort of thing.

Hey Blackey,

537
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,590
didn't I tell you that you can't come inside?

538
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,710
How did you get inside, and how did you get up here?

539
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,770
Is this a cat that you raise?

540
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:59,630
No, well, it lives here more than it is raised by me.

541
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:00,790
You rascal.

542
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:05,350

00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,440
Delicious.

00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,360
Good.

553
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,920
What is this tray?

#EvenForeigner'sPalate #CapturedBy #YooMiLee's #BusinessTripLunchbox

Go up first. I'll come up with wine glasses.

563
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,160
Did I just lose to a dog?

564
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,730
Why are you like this? Like this is the first time. It's not even the first time you've seen me.

565
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:39,590
I don't regret it. At least I was true to my feelings back then.

566
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:43,530
You're the truly cowardly one, not me.

567
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:47,330
Are you saying that the person you refused Hye Ri for is only the cafeteria nutritionist?

Find out more about this woman.

569

I don't want to go home.

570
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:57,940
I don't want to live alone, and I don't want to eat alone.
