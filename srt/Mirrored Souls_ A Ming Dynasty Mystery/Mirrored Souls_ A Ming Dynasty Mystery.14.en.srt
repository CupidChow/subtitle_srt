1
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,600
Everyone, please proceed to the main hall.

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,329
I have an announcement to make,

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,240
and I request your cooperation.

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,560
Sir,

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,380
please make sure you catch the murderer who killed our master.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,050
Are you done with the questioning?

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,370
They didn't ask anything else.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,640
After mumbling to himself for a long time,

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,500
the officer told everyone to go back to their rooms.

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,120
Miss,

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
the officers want everyone to go to the main hall for questioning.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,040
I got it.

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,880
Wait for me here

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,320
and don't let anyone see you.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,780
I'll come back and tell you

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,060
about the current situation,

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,680
so you can help me analyze it.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,400
Okay.

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,840
Today,

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,680
I request that everyone provide details of your whereabouts

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,160
from yesterday morning until 3 p.m.,

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,960
including everything you saw and heard.

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,520
If anyone dares to deliberately conceal information,

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,320
you will be charged with murder.

25
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,640
I'll go first.

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,810
Everyone, please follow me to wait in the courtyard.

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,380
Father's health has been declining lately.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,200
Every day after I wake up,

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,440
I go to see him.

30
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,600
But yesterday when I went,

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,160
he wasn't awake yet.

32
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,160
Mr. Zhang.

33
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,200
Miss.

34
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,700
Is Father still not awake?

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,600
Why is he still sleeping at this hour?

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,800
Don't worry, Miss.

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,480
The master will be fine.

38
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,080
The medicine the master has been taking

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,320
has a calming effect,

40
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,460
so he'll sleep longer than usual,

41
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,940
but it's nothing serious.

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,240
Given the master's current condition,

43
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,080
more rest

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,200
will help him recover faster.

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,810
Please don't worry.

46
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,800
If you say so, Uncle Zhang, I feel relieved.

47
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,120
Yue'er.

48
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,650
Go brew some tea and bring some snacks,

49
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,040
I want to sit in the pavilion for a while.

50
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,680
Oh, and

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,480
bring that storybook I told you about last night,

52
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,280
The Dreams of Splendor in the Eastern Capital.

53
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,200
Yes, miss.

54
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,400
Miss,

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,560
let's go outside too,

56
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,690
so we don't disturb the master's rest.

57
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,079
Miss,

58
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,680
I'll go to the front courtyard to arrange other matters.

59
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,880
Alright, Uncle Zhang,

60
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,940
please continue taking care of the household affairs.

61
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,760
Miss.

62
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,320
Uncle Zhang.

63
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,440
Miss.

64
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,720
This is my distant relative

65
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,280
whose hometown is suffering from famine.

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,720
He's in quite difficult circumstances

67
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,680
and will be staying with me for a while.

68
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,880
Please don't worry, Miss.

69
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,920
I'll arrange for him

70
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,160
other accommodation and work as soon as possible.

71
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,560
I apologize for the inconvenience

72
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,920
and hope you can understand.

73
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,000
What are you staring at?

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,400
Don't wander around when you have nothing to do.

75
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,040
If you disturb the young miss,

76
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,570
I will punish you severely.

77
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,140
Did you hear me?

78
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,600
Miss.

79
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,560
Miss, are you there?

80
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,320
Miss, you are indeed inside.

81
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,440
I forgot to tell you to look for me at the pavilion.

82
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,570
I knew I'd forgotten something today.

83
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,440
I'm sorry, my little Yue'er.

84
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,680
Miss, are you missing your friend

85
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,120
or worried about the master?

86
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,050
You're naughty.

87
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,480
Yue'er is different from others.

88
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,080
Although she's my maid,

89
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,140
I've always seen her as my sister.

90
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,040
We grew up together

91
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,440
and have been companions all along.

92
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,210
What tea is this? It smells wonderful.

93
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,200
This is from Manager Hu at the shop,

94
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,280
a new jasmine pearl tea he brought back from his recent trip.

95
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,880
Look,

96
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,740
it's beautiful and fragrant.

97
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,400
Try it quickly,

98
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,530
you'll feel better after drinking it.

99
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,320
Delicious.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,200
Let's take some

101
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,840
for everyone to try during mealtime.

102
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,970
Seems we have quite a few guests today.

103
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,680
And I've never seen them before.

104
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,640
Miss.

105
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,850
Uncle Zhang.

106
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,680
This new jasmine ball tea is excellent,

107
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,760
let everyone have a taste.

108
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,400
Very well, thank you, Miss.

109
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,320
I'll return to my room at 2 o'clock,

110
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,840
I'm feeling a bit drowsy.

111
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,640
I've told Yue'er to rest as well.

112
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,120
It's almost noon.

113
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,540
Father should be awake by now.

114
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,880
Miss,

115
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,360
the master is already awake.

116
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,890
I was just about to tell you.

117
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,440
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

118
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,400
Ruoting,

119
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,520
come in.

120
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,720
Ruoting.

121
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,580
Haven't you had lunch?

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,200
These snacks were brought by Mr. Zhang.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,200
Mrs. Wu brought them.

124
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,480
Why hasn't she brought you fresh tea?

125
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,560
Yue'er brought it specially.

126
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,460
Yue'er is still more attentive than I am.

127
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm sorry, Father.

128
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,159
No one can replace our Ruoting.

129
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,080
Ruoting.

130
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,640
If...

131
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,640
Father said what if

132
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,560
she becomes yours?

133
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,820
How about that?

134
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,680
Ruoting.

135
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,520
Have you seen my maid Yue'er?

136
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,120
No, I haven't.

137
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,720
I knew he was always stealing glances at me,

138
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,800
but I didn't want to get entangled with him,

139
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,640
so I quickly walked past him.

140
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,520
When I reached the hall, I saw Lei Lei again.

141
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,800
Miss.

142
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,680
Miss.

143
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,560
Is the master awake?

144
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,640
You may go.

145
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,600
Thank you.

146
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,280
The time then was about quarter past noon.

147
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,640
Thank you for your help, Miss Zhao.

148
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,170
Please go and get some rest.

149
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,120
Officer Li,

150
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,600
may I sit in on the questioning?

151
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,400
Chief Li.

152
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
Since someone is willing to vouch for you,

153
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,240
you may stay and observe.

154
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,680
Someone vouched for me?

155
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,040
Don't ask too many questions about that.

156
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,840
But remember,

157
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,770
you must not make any sound.

158
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,320
Zhao Yue'er.

159
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,480
You've grown up in the Zhao household since childhood.

160
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,320
Master Zhao and Miss Zhao

161
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,340
have treated you like family.

162
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,400
They've never treated you as an outsider or servant.

163
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Are you grateful?

164
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,200
Sir,

165
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,440
I will be grateful to the master and miss

166
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,560
for their kindness all my life.

167
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,480
This is the greatest blessing in Yue'er's life.

168
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,540
If that's the case,

169
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,600
you must not hide anything.

170
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,840
Think carefully,

171
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,280
to honor their kindness.

172
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,720
I will certainly tell everything I know

173
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,980
and hold nothing back.

174
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,810
Yesterday morning,

175
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,400
after I helped Miss with washing and dressing,

176
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
I accompanied her to see the master.

177
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,840
When we reached the door of the room,

178
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,930
we saw the butler was there too,

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,840
and he told us the master hadn't woken up yet.

180
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,640
The young lady said she wanted to go to the pavilion

181
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,360
and asked me to bring her some tea and snacks

182
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,080
along with some storybooks.

183
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,600
Mrs. Wu from the kitchen said

184
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,840
that Manager Hu from the shop had gone out a few days ago

185
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,720
and brought back some new jasmine tea balls that were especially fragrant and sweet,

186
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,200
and told me to quickly brew a pot for the young lady to try.

187
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,160
But when I went to the pavilion,

188
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,250
I didn't see the young lady.

189
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,360
I took the food box to her room to find her.

190
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,320
When I passed by the main hall,

191
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,580
I didn't see the master there.

192
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,640
So I thought I'd check on him.

193
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,280
Master.

194
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,600
Yue'er.

195
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,480
Yue'er.

196
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,340
Just leave it here.

197
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,600
Tell the butler later

198
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,490
that we'll discuss matters in the afternoon.

199
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,920
Don't disturb me for lunch either,

200
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,080
I won't be eating.

201
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,200
I went to the hall and told the butler.

202
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,640
I found the young lady in her room

203
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,120
She must have had something on her mind

204
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,400
and forgot she had asked me to look for her at the pavilion

205
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,080
so she felt a bit guilty about it.

206
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,800
Later we went to the main hall

207
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,360
and had lunch with everyone.

208
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,890
When I returned to her room with the young lady

209
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,060
it was around 1 p.m.

210
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,040
She told me to go rest as well.

211
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,200
I remembered the master hadn't had his lunch yet.

212
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,080
I just brought him a box of pastries.

213
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,360
Yue'er.

214
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,490
I've already eaten.

215
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,640
Who is it?

216
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,240
Master, it's me.

217
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,420
What are you afraid of?

218
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,640
Come in.

219
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,440
Afterwards, I only heard the butler and the master

220
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,170
discussing something about signing a contract.

221
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,250
After the master took his medicine, the butler left.

222
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,840
At that time,

223
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,760
it was about fifteen minutes before the hour.

224
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,420
I came out from behind the bed.

225
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,680
I was sweating profusely.

226
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,340
The master even teased me saying.

227
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,240
If Ruoting sees you like this,

228
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,720
wouldn't it be terrible?

229
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,800
I vaguely heard

230
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,560
the master and miss talking about marrying me.

231
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,240
The young lady angrily threw something and ran out.

232
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
I'm very afraid,

233
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,780
afraid of hurting the young lady.

234
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,370
I started feeling drowsy for some reason.

235
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,800
I faintly heard the master getting out of bed,

236
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,900
and after a while, he walked around the room.

237
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,160
He didn't call for me,

238
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,890
so I didn't dare to move.

239
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,520
Later, someone knocked and came in,

240
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,640
but I couldn't hear clearly what was said.

241
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,770
After a while, there was no more sound.

242
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,840
I was both sleepy and thirsty,

243
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,040
so when I saw no one in the room, I ran out.

244
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,280
The sky at that time,

245
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,450
it looked like it was past 3 p.m.

246
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,290
Zhao Yue'er.

247
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,160
Everything you've told us,

248
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,720
we will verify one by one.

249
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,320
Please wait outside,

250
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,200
don't speak with anyone,

251
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,480
don't move around freely,

252
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,560
and be ready to cooperate with our investigation at any time.

253
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,040
Yes, sir.

254
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,440
If your father had married Zhao Yue'er,

255
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,120
would you have developed hatred toward her?

256
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,200
Yue'er and I are like sisters.

257
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,400
I would certainly find it difficult to accept my father marrying her,

258
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,860
but I wouldn't go so far as to hate them for it.

259
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,480
Well, Miss Zhao,

260
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,480
let's continue.

261
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,000
Bring Wang Er in.

262
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,920
Yue'er.

263
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Wipe your tears.

264
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,250
Don't let others see you like this.

265
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,000
Master.

266
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,040
How did he suddenly get killed?

267
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,240
He treated me well,

268
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,920
how could he end up like this?

269
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,680
Master.

270
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,490
Zhao Wan'yi is a disrespectful old man

271
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,840
who had the audacity to want to marry you.

272
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,440
He's several times your age,

273
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,160
yet shows no shame.

274
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,730
Such a shameless old man

275
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,060
deserves no pity when he dies.

276
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,080
But the master has been kind to me.

277
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,200
If it weren't for him,

278
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,000
I wouldn't be where I am today.

279
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,720
Kind?

280
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,730
His so-called kindness

281
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,280
is just a cover for his selfish desires.

282
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,560
Do you really think he has good intentions?

283
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,360
He's just coveting your beauty,

284
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,440
wanting you to submit to him.

285
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,720
Zhao Ruting is the same age as you.

286
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,320
Don't you find that disgusting?

287
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,200
I won't let you talk about the master like that.

288
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,520
You're nothing to me,

289
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,560
what right do you have to interfere?

290
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,160
Yue'er.

291
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,360
I just came back from the outhouse

292
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,240
I wasn't intentionally eavesdropping on your conversation.

293
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,640
It's time to question me.

294
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,560
Wang Er

295
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,080
tell me everything you saw

296
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,520
and heard at the mansion yesterday

297
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,920
in complete detail.

298
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Yes, Chief Constable.

299
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,840
Yesterday I followed the steward

300
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,280
into the mansion.

301
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,400
Young Miss.

302
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,800
The steward explained to her

303
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,040
that I was his distant relative

304
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,920
who came seeking refuge with him

305
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,720
because of the famine back home.

306
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,080
Then I followed the steward through the side door to the guest room

307
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,420
and after putting away my belongings

308
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,100
I went to the main hall.

309
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,700
I saw many strangers there

310
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,980
and we all had lunch together.

311
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,079
The master never appeared.

312
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,119
After lunch

313
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,880
I went back to take a nap.

314
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,960
But I couldn't fall asleep no matter how much I tossed and turned.

315
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,200
Wang Er

316
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,240
what are you thinking about?

317
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,050
If you dare to hide anything

318
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,020
I'll make sure you rot in jail.

319
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,160
I think I've seen the Young Miss before.

320
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,880
Perhaps

321
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,800
it was in a dream.

322
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,400
I wanted to walk around the garden again

323
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,920
hoping I might run into the Young Miss.

324
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,080
Wait for me.

325
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,060
When I wandered to the master's bedroom.

326
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,320
Have you seen my maid Yue'er?

327
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,120
No, I haven't.

328
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,600
I saw her with tears in her eyes

329
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,040
rushing past me,

330
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,440
so I became curious.
