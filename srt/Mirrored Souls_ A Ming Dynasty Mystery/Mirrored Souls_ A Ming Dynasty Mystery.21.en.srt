1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,680
I've heard that the Sun family runs a food supply business

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,320
with many shady dealings behind it.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,720
The head of the Sun family is called Sun Ding,

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,450
a man with quite a terrible reputation in Jizhou.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,820
I suspect that ghost poppy

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,240
must be the Sun family's method.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,840
Luopin Pavilion's business is surprisingly prosperous,

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,000
even though the quality of their sea cucumber has been declining,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,840
they still have many returning customers,

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,240
which must be the effect of the ghost poppy.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,400
The Sun family supplies Luopin Pavilion

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,480
with ingredients laced with ghost poppy.

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,520
Those who consume it gradually become addicted

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,980
and find it hard to give up.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,920
Although the quality of ingredients is nowhere near what it used to be,

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,680
Luopin Pavilion's business hasn't declined at all.

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,640
Over time,

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,960
these merchants have no choice but to cooperate with the Sun family.

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,960
The deer tendons sold in Yangchun Lane

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,920
and other ingredients like snail slices

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,250
are all different from the ordinary ones.

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,400
I believe what the Sun family controls

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,840
is definitely not just Luopin Pavilion alone.

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,280
The Sun family uses this poison

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,560
to control the people, expand their business, and amass wealth.

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,760
Such tactics are truly despicable.

27
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:19,120
These unscrupulous merchants are utterly detestable,

28
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,920
caring only about profit,

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,560
with complete disregard for people's lives.

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,280
Throughout history, dishonest merchants have been blinded by greed,

31
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,539
willing to do anything

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,160
for money.

33
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,760
Any sense of morality

34
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,020
has been cast aside like worn-out shoes.

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,860
If we don't expose the Sun family's schemes,

36
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,050
I fear more people will fall victim

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,160
to their poisonous influence.

38
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,000
This meeting with young Master Sun

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,560
certainly won't go smoothly.

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,220
But since we've come this far,

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,729
we cannot back down now.

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,160
Such a huge luxury estate

43
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,720
and barely any guards along the way.

44
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,720
Something doesn't feel right,

45
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,039
we should be careful,

46
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,960
safety first.

47
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,640
Thank you all for coming such a long way today.

48
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,280
Miss Zhao,

49
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,680
here are the sea cucumber samples we've prepared for you,

50
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,740
please take a look.

51
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,320
Please taste the cooked sea cucumbers.

52
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,880
Our family's sea cucumbers are of premium quality

53
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,810
and have an excellent reputation.

54
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,300
Where is Young Master Sun?

55
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,720
My young master is quite busy today

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,840
and couldn't get away,

57
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,170
so he sent me specially to receive you all.

58
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,160
The Sun family clearly lacks sincerity,

59
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,000
deceiving me

60
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,220
and looking down on my family,

61
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,040
sending just a minor steward

62
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,840
to do business with me, the eldest daughter of the Zhao family.

63
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,480
What,

64
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,180
is this sum of money beneath Young Master Sun's notice?

65
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,740
If that's the case,

66
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,400
we might as well forget about this business deal.

67
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,200
Miss Zhao

68
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
please calm down.

69
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,260
How about this,

70
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,160
let me report to them first.

71
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,960
Everyone, please be patient

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
and wait a moment.

73
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,560
This sea cucumber isn't right.

74
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,400
What's wrong with it?

75
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,000
This sea cucumber is too clean,

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,730
there's no ghost lily mixed in.

77
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,800
So the problem isn't with the Sun family?

78
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,370
What's wrong, Ruoting?

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,490
I think I just saw Anruo coming.

80
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,720
Anruo?

81
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,600
Why would he be here?

82
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,840
Someone from the prestigious Situ family

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,800
showing up at a competitor's house -

84
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
something's definitely not right.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,060
Thank you all for coming and waiting.

86
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,720
I've been tied up with matters today,

87
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,280
and I apologize for keeping you waiting.

88
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,240
I am Sun Anyang, at your service.

89
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,840
Miss Zhao,

90
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,240
what do you think of these sea cucumbers?

91
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Young Master Sun,

92
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,320
these sea cucumbers are not what I ordered.

93
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,880
What do you mean by that, Miss Zhao?

94
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,240
The sea cucumbers from my Sun household

95
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,200
are of the finest quality,

96
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,800
unmatched throughout the Tongzhou region.

97
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,880
Miss Zhao, are you toying with me?

98
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,440
Mr. Sun,

99
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,890
these sea cucumbers are what I'm looking for.

100
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,940
Miss Zhao, please don't joke around.

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,730
My family doesn't have this type of sea cucumber.

102
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,240
How can that be?

103
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,240
At the birthday banquet at the Situ mansion,

104
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,720
they served exactly this type of sea cucumber.

105
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,000
Luosong told me

106
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,720
that batch of sea cucumbers came from your family.

107
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,160
Miss Zhao,

108
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
if you want this kind,

109
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
it's not impossible,

110
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,800
I just need some time to arrange it.

111
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,460
How about this,

112
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,640
you all stay at my residence tonight,

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,930
and I'll have it ready by tomorrow.

114
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,000
What do you think?

115
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,840
Since you're being so hospitable, Mr. Sun,

116
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,240
we'll graciously accept your invitation.

117
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,980
Quickly, brew me some good tea

118
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,480
to calm my temper.

119
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,140
Right away!

120
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,060
I'll have someone bring it to you.

121
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,159
This Sun Anyang

122
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,960
putting us in this secluded place

123
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,560
clearly has bad intentions.

124
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,360
We just can't be sure

125
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,820
what his next move will be.

126
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,000
If he makes a move against us,

127
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,410
wouldn't that confirm the Sun family is behind everything?

128
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,920
Let's wait and see.

129
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,920
That soup was definitely drugged.

130
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,480
Sun Anyang

131
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,240
is quite devious.

132
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,300
Where is everyone?

133
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,690
That's strange.

134
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,840
Ruoting,

135
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,010
are you alright?

136
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,240
I'm fine,

137
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,300
let's get out of here quickly.

138
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,170
Don't worry,

139
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,200
they shouldn't catch up so quickly,

140
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,240
this place is safe for now,

141
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,500
we can rest for a while.

142
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,240
How about this, Ruoting,

143
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,440
Qiming can take you back to the Zhao residence first,

144
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,900
and I'll draw them away if anything happens.

145
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,200
Chu Bufan,

146
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,520
I don't want to go through this kind of thing again,

147
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,960
we should all stick together.

148
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,890
I'm not leaving,

149
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,040
I refuse to believe

150
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,200
that with both of us here,

151
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,800
anything could happen to Miss Ruoting.

152
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,120
If we go back, we go back together.

153
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,920
Besides,

154
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,580
if they had any real skill,

155
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,560
they wouldn't resort to such despicable methods.

156
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,890
It's truly despicable.

157
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,780
Think about it,

158
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,480
is there a chance to catch Sun Anyang

159
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,600
when he's alone and bring him here?

160
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,400
This time we need to make the first move.

161
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,680
You must

162
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,840
be very careful.

163
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,820
Put some strength into it.

164
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,240
Boss.

165
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,530
That's some good strength you've got.

166
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,640
Ouch!

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,160
That's more like it.

168
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,860
Well, well, Young Master Sun,

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,660
you dare to use such despicable means as poison.

170
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,200
What kind of dirty deeds

171
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,860
has your Sun family committed

172
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
that you're afraid we'll discover?

173
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,260
I know nothing about what you're talking about.

174
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,320
I just

175
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,720
follow the master's orders.

176
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,880
I truly don't know anything else.

177
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,090
As the eldest son of the Sun family,

178
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,520
you manage all the family's business affairs,

179
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,760
and you're telling me you know nothing?

180
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,530
Do you even think before you speak?

181
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
Tell me the truth,

182
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,160
or I'll kill you right now.

183
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm just a wanderer,

184
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
a worthless life,

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,260
why would I fear death?

186
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,770
But you, Young Master Sun, are different.

187
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,120
Your life is quite precious,

188
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,820
so you'd better think carefully.

189
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,240
No!

190
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,160
I understand.

191
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,280
I...

192
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,880
I'll tell the truth.

193
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,360
Actually, I'm not Young Master Sun at all.

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,600
My real name is Zhang Hao,

195
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,000
just an ordinary villager from the east suburbs.

196
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,880
It's just because I look

197
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,680
like Young Master Sun,

198
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,040
so they hired me to impersonate him.

199
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,140
I'm just...

200
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,760
I'm nothing but a fraud.

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,240
The real Sun Anyang,

202
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,160
he was just a sickly person.

203
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,000
He died a year ago.

204
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,320
Sun Anyang died a year ago,

205
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,060
who hired you to impersonate him?

206
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
I'll tell you,

207
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,480
that person...

208
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,360
He seemed to be another young master with the surname Sun.

209
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,720
He told me to impersonate Young Master Sun,

210
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,480
and said everyone in the household would cooperate with me.

211
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,680
This time the plan

212
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,800
was just to keep you all here,

213
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,200
and I'd get an extra 100 taels of silver.

214
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,080
100 taels of silver.

215
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,240
What does this Master Sun who bribed you look like?

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,360
About 30 years old,

217
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,680
average height.

218
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,040
He looks like he has

219
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,280
a certain refined air about him.

220
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,480
From his description,

221
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,700
doesn't it sound just like An Ruolai?

222
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,040
If you dare tell even one lie,

223
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,680
remember,

224
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,560
I can find you anywhere.

225
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,760
No, hero...

226
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,560
I wouldn't dare.

227
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,120
Every word I've said is true.

228
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,850
I would never dare deceive you.

229
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,320
Please spare me.

230
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,760
Where can we find him?

231
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,480
I... I meet him

232
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,880
at a place outside the east city called

233
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,400
Bishui Manor.

234
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,360
That's... that's all I know.

235
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,440
So it really is that heartless man,

236
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,640
Sister Yun's death must be his doing.

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
He was originally

238
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,080
just an apprentice at the Situ family's grocery store.

239
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,000
Because he was smart, studious, and handsome,

240
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,800
Sister Yun fell in love with him.

241
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,880
Master Situ didn't mind his background

242
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,440
and took him in as a son-in-law.

243
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,200
Sister Yun even

244
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,360
gave birth to a lovely daughter for him.

245
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,880
I never thought this beast

246
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,360
would conspire with the Sun family to harm his wife,

247
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,820
he's worse than an animal!

248
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,520
This An Ruolai

249
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,240
must be after the Situ family's fortune,

250
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,170
that's why he killed Situ Chenyun.

251
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,880
The Situ family showed him tremendous kindness,

252
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,340
yet he repaid their kindness with betrayal.

253
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,570
I will definitely get justice for Sister Yun.

254
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,570
What are you staring at?

255
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,000
You... you deceived my feelings.

256
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,360
Ruolai.

257
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,240
This jade pendant

258
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,520
is my family's treasured heirloom.

259
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,600
Father told me to always wear it,

260
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,200
saying it would keep me safe.

261
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,840
Today I'm giving it to you, my husband,

262
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,640
hoping it will keep you safe as well.

263
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,260
If you are well,

264
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,400
then I am well.

265
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,680
Yun'er.

266
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,680
Having you by my side in this life is my greatest blessing.

267
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,400
I only wish that for our entire lives,

268
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,760
we'll never part or abandon each other.

269
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
You finally came.

270
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,960
From what you're saying,

271
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,640
you knew I would come.

272
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,880
Chu Bufan,

273
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,960
I've heard so much about you.

274
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,560
An Ruolai,

275
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,160
did you kill Situ Chenyun?

276
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,200
Yun'er was the love of my life,

277
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,320
and Tian'er's mother.

278
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,040
If I had a choice,

279
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,840
I would trade my life for hers.

280
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,960
All lies.

281
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,240
You teamed up with that fake Sun Anyang

282
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,930
using ingredients laced with ghost poppy

283
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,320
to control all food suppliers in Tongzhou,

284
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,450
stealing the Situ family's position,

285
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,920
harming innocent people

286
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,840
and killing Situ Chenyun.

287
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,840
You helped the Sun family so ruthlessly.

288
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,640
What did they offer you

289
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,080
that was worth betraying the Situ household?

290
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,720
I didn't do any of this.

291
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,640
It was all planned by my father, Sun Ding.

292
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,160
I was just following his orders.

293
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,040
Yun'er's death

294
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,360
was absolutely not my doing.

295
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,560
Sun Ding is your father?

296
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,280
Yes,

297
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,330
he is my biological father.

298
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,080
Just because my mother came from humble origins,

299
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,740
he refused to acknowledge me,

300
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,090
so we never had any contact.

301
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,120
Did Situ Chenyun know?

302
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,250
I never kept anything from Yun'er.

303
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,720
Until a year ago,

304
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,450
when Sun Ding suddenly appeared in Tongzhou.

305
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,040
Tiantian.

306
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,480
Tian.

307
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,280
Tian.

308
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,120
Tian.

309
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,080
Tian.

310
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,560
Excuse me,

311
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,600
what are you doing?

312
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,200
Tian.

313
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,680
Tian.

314
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,359
Tian.

315
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,400
Tian.

316
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,760
Ruolai, don't panic.

317
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,560
It's you.

318
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Tian is safe.

319
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,890
Where did you take Tian?

320
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,560
What are you going to do?

321
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,760
Why are you shouting?

322
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,120
I am her grandfather,

323
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,080
would I harm her?

324
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,640
Cut the act,

325
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,280
what do you really want?
