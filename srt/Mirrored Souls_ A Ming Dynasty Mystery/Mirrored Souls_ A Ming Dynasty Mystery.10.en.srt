1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,240
Chu Bufan,

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,280
what exactly is going on here?

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,120
Why is Master Lin dead at this location?

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,040
Sir,

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,240
this matter is extremely serious.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,500
Lanxin's fake death was clearly a setup,

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,820
and Master Lin's death

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,280
further proves something is wrong with this painting house.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,520
Someone must be manipulating everything from the shadows,

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,960
keeping even the officials in the dark.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,300
Seal off Yanbo Painting House

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,450
and bring everyone present back to the county office for questioning.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,320
Sir,

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,760
please investigate thoroughly.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,160
Yanbo Painting House has been properly managed for decades,

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,040
and has never experienced

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,760
such horrifying incidents before.

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,120
Today Master Lin died tragically,

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,260
Miss Lanxin has disappeared,

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,640
all of this must be Chu Bufan's conspiracy,

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,160
he is the murderer.

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,120
Chu Bufan,

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,920
did you hear that?

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,860
Someone is now accusing you of being the killer.

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,480
Master Lin's death,

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,380
Lanxin's disappearance,

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,610
how do you defend yourself?

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,440
Sir,

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,960
Madam Gu is trying to confuse the issue.

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,760
I couldn't possibly be the murderer,

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,200
I don't even know Master Lin,

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,930
I have no grudge against him, why would I kill him?

33
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:30,680
Besides,

34
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,570
I've been with you the whole time, sir,

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,039
please clear my name.

36
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,280
I am willing to cooperate with you to find the real culprit.

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,240
Sir.

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,280
This Chu Bufan keeps saying

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,479
he's innocent,

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,009
yet offers no evidence.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,039
How did he know about this hidden platform?

42
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,000
Such a villain,

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,520
how can we believe his one-sided story?

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,320
Please, Your Honor, make a fair judgment

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,080
and give Master Lin justice.

46
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,320
Madam Gu,

47
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,280
how I knew about the hidden platform

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,480
is none of your concern.

49
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,680
If I were the murderer,

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,680
why would I bring the magistrate here to investigate

51
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,120
and hide the body here?

52
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,520
Wouldn't that be completely contradictory

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,650
and utterly stupid?

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,920
Stop making excuses to me.

55
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,600
You had ill intentions from the moment you entered our gallery.

56
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,400
The evidence is now conclusive.

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,000
You still think you can escape punishment?

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,600
You hid the body to kill two birds with one stone,

59
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,320
framing our Yanbo Gallery

60
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,480
for what happened to Master Lin and Lanxin.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,660
Your Honor,

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,120
I've been wronged!

63
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,640
I only ask that you severely punish this villain

64
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,720
and clear Yanbo Gallery's name.

65
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,210
How dare you, Chu Bufan,

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,400
making such deceptive arguments before me!

67
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,560
Do you really think I would easily believe you?

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,120
Guards,

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,480
bind Chu Bufan and take him back to the county office for interrogation!

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,600
Your Honor, I'm innocent!

71
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
We can't let the real killer go free.

72
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,770
Don't be deceived by Madam Gu's words!

73
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,560
Your Honor!

74
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,040
Wait!

75
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,440
If you only take me back,

76
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
you'll only give the real killer

77
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,800
a chance to destroy evidence.

78
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,600
Take him away!

79
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,690
How dare you!

80
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,840
Chu Bufan,

81
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,640
you have nowhere to run,

82
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,000
yet you still dare to cause trouble here!

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
Since you've already condemned me,

84
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,480
I have nothing to lose,

85
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,200
so I might as well make this matter even bigger.

86
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,640
Let more people know

87
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,530
about the dirty secrets of Yanbo Gallery.

88
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,240
Chu Bufan,

89
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,600
do you know what you're doing?

90
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,560
Release me immediately,

91
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,360
or your punishment will be even more severe!

92
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,020
Please calm down, Your Honor.

93
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,520
If you want me to release the magistrate,

94
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,840
then do as I say.

95
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,600
Dig up the roots of that tree in the courtyard,

96
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,460
and I'll release the magistrate.

97
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,600
No!

98
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,800
That ancient tree is our gallery's treasure,

99
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,680
a thousand-year-old tree worth a fortune,

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,600
it absolutely cannot be damaged!

101
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,320
Madam Gu,

102
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,560
is that tree

103
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,960
more important than our magistrate's life?

104
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,440
You're so desperate to stop us.

105
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,120
Could there really be some secret hidden there?

106
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,520
I... I didn't mean that.

107
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,400
It's just that the ancient tree

108
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
is closely tied to our gallery's auspicious feng shui

109
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
and good fortune.

110
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,120
Digging up tree roots is highly disrespectful.

111
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,720
I'm only thinking of the gallery's interests.

112
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,640
For the gallery's interests or for yourself?

113
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,160
If you weren't hiding some unspeakable secret,

114
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,690
why would you be so nervous?

115
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,399
Madam Gu,

116
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,020
since things have come to this point,

117
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
what harm is there in digging up the tree roots?

118
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,480
My safety

119
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,280
cannot be compared to this ancient tree.

120
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,920
I...

121
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,280
If you don't want me to harm the magistrate,

122
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,720
then do as I say.

123
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,890
Hurry up and dig!

124
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,210
Dig quickly!

125
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,840
Dig!

126
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,240
I'd like to see who dares.

127
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,800
You dare to touch Yanbo Art House?

128
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,040
This ancient tree is their treasure.

129
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,640
You're just some petty yamen runners.

130
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Even if the prefect himself were here today,

131
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,120
he would still show me some respect.

132
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,280
I wonder if my Imperial Guard

133
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,660
has the authority to deal with your Yanbo Art House.

134
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,340
Commander Lin,

135
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,920
what brings you here?

136
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,250
The matters of Yanbo Art House,

137
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,400
does even the Imperial Guard need to interfere now?

138
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Even for a murder case, the county magistrate is here,

139
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
so there's no need for your concern.

140
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,970
What interference?

141
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,409
We're all just upholding justice.

142
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,320
No matter who they are or what status they hold,

143
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,640
if they violate national laws,

144
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,170
or threaten public safety,

145
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,160
my Imperial Guard naturally has jurisdiction.

146
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,240
Ordinary murder cases

147
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,440
are indeed handled by the county magistrate.

148
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,240
But this Yanbo Art House of yours

149
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,400
is known to everyone.

150
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,680
The people who visit your establishment

151
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,080
are not ordinary either.

152
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,720
But do you know

153
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,760
that Master Lin who died here today

154
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,560
was tasked with important foreign negotiations?

155
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,800
And yet, coincidentally,

156
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,680
he died here today.

157
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,400
Whether you have spies here

158
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,330
is something I must thoroughly investigate.

159
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,980
Commander Lin,

160
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,480
in matters like this,

161
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,530
you shouldn't jump to conclusions so easily.

162
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,440
Chu Bufan,

163
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,360
release the magistrate at once.

164
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,440
How dare you cause such trouble?

165
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,040
Don't be insolent just because you achieved merit last time.

166
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,920
Magistrate,

167
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,120
the situation just now was unavoidable,

168
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,180
please forgive me.

169
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,480
Don't hesitate,

170
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,400
dig up the roots of this ancient tree.

171
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,060
If anyone dares to interfere,

172
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,940
they're opposing my Imperial Guard.

173
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,200
Don't blame me for being harsh.

174
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,600
Yes, yes.

175
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,440
Continue digging,

176
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,300
let's see what's actually there.

177
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
I haven't been in Tongzhou for long,

178
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,960
and these bones clearly belong to someone who died long ago,

179
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,360
Sir, please investigate this thoroughly.

180
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,159
Madam Gu.

181
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,210
What's the meaning of these bones?

182
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,320
How could there be human remains in this painting studio?

183
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,480
Explain yourself clearly.

184
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,440
Sir,

185
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,520
I have no idea about this,

186
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
this certainly has nothing to do with me.

187
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,440
Madam Gu,

188
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,880
you're the last person who should be saying that.

189
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,280
Judging by the decomposition of these remains,

190
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,280
they must have been buried here for quite some time.

191
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
If not for your influence and control,

192
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,080
how could they have remained undiscovered?

193
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,360
What kind of business

194
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,480
is this Yanbo Painting Studio really conducting?

195
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Think carefully before you answer.

196
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,560
Madam Gu,

197
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,480
this is what you've been

198
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,940
desperately trying to hide as your studio's secret treasure.

199
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,360
Chu Bufan,

200
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,450
don't think you'll get away with this.

201
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,490
Magistrate Liu.

202
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,400
I'll leave the rest to you.

203
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,920
Please send someone to inform me when the interrogation results are ready.

204
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,980
I need to hurry back

205
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,000
to report Master Lin's case to my superiors

206
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,730
so they can make arrangements.

207
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,490
I'll take Chu Bufan with me now.

208
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,650
Come with me.

209
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,720
Stay here and keep watch.

210
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,800
Take Lady Gu, Ma Renyi,

211
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,920
Yurou the painter and the others back to the magistrate's office.

212
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,250
I will thoroughly investigate this case.

213
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,410
Brother Lin.

214
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,760
Master Lin's case must be serious

215
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,380
if it brought you here.

216
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,400
It's not about how serious it is,

217
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,000
it's about how lucky you are.

218
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,920
I've seen your wanted poster.

219
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,050
I thought you would resolve it easily.

220
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,120
Miss Zhao came to see me last night

221
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,760
and told me about your situation these past few days.

222
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,800
She was worried you'd face trouble

223
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,760
at the magistrate's office and Yanbo Gallery today

224
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,560
and asked me to come protect you.

225
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,000
The great hero Chu,

226
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,380
with a bounty of only 10 taels of gold,

227
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,090
making a young lady worry about you every day.

228
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,800
Well...

229
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,120
It truly undermines your reputation as the noble thief.

230
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,000
That's not...

231
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,730
What happened to Master Lin

232
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,180
was completely unexpected to me.

233
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,640
When Li Qiang and I first arrived,

234
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,280
we were observing from the rooftop

235
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,560
and saw you trigger a mechanism

236
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,080
that revealed his corpse.

237
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,680
It was quite terrifying.

238
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,560
I quickly sent Li Qiang back to arrange for people.

239
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,520
Fortunately,

240
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,600
I knew Master Lin had important matters to attend to,

241
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,660
which gave me reason to get involved.

242
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,400
You even dared to hold the magistrate hostage.

243
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:09,840
No, I didn't.

244
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,640
I can't intervene in just any case.

245
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,240
You're lucky you ran into me.

246
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,560
Seems my life isn't worth much.

247
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,300
Thank you for saving me today,

248
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,120
otherwise things might not have worked out.

249
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,640
No need for formalities between us.

250
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,500
If you're ever in trouble, I'll certainly help you.

251
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,720
Where are we going now?

252
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,480
To the magistrate's office, of course.

253
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,040
Did you think it was all over?

254
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,960
I just didn't want you

255
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,840
to go back with them,

256
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,260
or your status would be quite different.

257
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,160
You're right.

258
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,560
The warrant for my arrest is still active,

259
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,880
I need to follow procedure to clear my name.

260
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,080
Leaving with you

261
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,280
versus returning to the office with them

262
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,340
does make a significant difference.

263
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,120
How did you know

264
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,640
there were remains under that old tree?

265
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,780
Actually, under the old tree,

266
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,280
I was taking a gamble.

267
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,600
A gamble?

268
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,400
Have you lost your mind?

269
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,520
I'm not even sure if there's any real evidence,

270
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,440
just going on some vague clues

271
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,320
and taking a gamble.

272
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,240
Ancient tree.

273
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,290
Wind chimes.

274
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,000
Ancient tree,

275
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,280
save them.

276
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,080
When Lanxin was unconscious,

277
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,000
she mentioned the ancient tree and wind chimes.

278
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,960
I thought,

279
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,320
perhaps beneath that ancient tree

280
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,880
lies a dark secret.

281
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,680
I see.

282
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,200
Brother Chu, you truly are brilliant.

283
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,960
But this gamble of yours is too risky.

284
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,460
You may have won that round in the courtyard,

285
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,520
but the Yanbo Gallery is not to be trifled with.

286
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,600
Ma Renyi,

287
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,240
we need to proceed with caution.

288
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,880
I've been dragged into this,

289
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,400
fortunately, Master Lin's matter

290
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,730
gives me a reason to investigate further.

291
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,520
Are you confident about going to the magistrate's office later?

292
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
It should be fine.

293
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,960
The sisters share a deep bond,

294
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,020
they should stand together against these evil forces.

295
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,000
Mrs. Gu.

296
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,480
Regarding the case of corpses hidden in the ancient tree at Yanbo Art Studio,

297
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,200
there is substantial evidence pointing to you.

298
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,090
Do you have anything to say?

299
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,600
Sir,

300
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,040
I truly know nothing about this.

301
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,860
I've only just learned

302
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,440
about those remains hidden in the studio.

303
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,700
I'm merely a woman running an art studio,

304
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,000
how could I know about such evil deeds?

305
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,240
I have questioned everyone from the painting studio

306
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,120
and found no suspicious individuals,

307
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,100
I've permitted them to leave,

308
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,760
except for you, Madam Gu, who remains under heavy suspicion.

309
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,320
Your Honor,

310
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,850
according to Ming Dynasty law,

311
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,600
if someone is willing to vouch for a suspect,

312
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,520
they may be released from custody

313
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,780
and summoned again for the formal trial.

314
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,720
I am willing to stake my reputation as guarantee

315
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,680
and request your permission to take Madam Gu with me.

316
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,360
Mr. Ma,

317
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,880
this is no ordinary case.

318
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,200
Several skeletons were found hidden in Yanbo Painting Studio,

319
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,160
multiple lives are at stake.

320
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,380
How can I release someone arbitrarily in such a major case?

321
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,240
Your Honor!

322
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
I remember now,

323
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,140
I know who the murderer is.

324
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,530
It's Hanxiu,

325
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,960
she did it all.

326
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,760
She killed Master Lin too,

327
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,320
she harbored resentment against the painting house customers,

328
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,720
and secretly hid the bodies to frame me.

329
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,680
Madam Gu, do you have any evidence

330
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,720
that connects Miss Hanxiu to this murder case?

331
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,620
Your Honor,

332
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,220
bring Hanxiu in for questioning and you'll know the truth.

333
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,960
Hanxiu.

334
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Were the remains found under the old tree

335
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,260
at the painting workshop your doing?

336
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,280
If you speak even one false word,

337
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,960
I will not be lenient.

338
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,820
Your Honor.

339
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,360
I did indeed kill Master Lin.

340
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,080
Madam Gu is telling the truth.

341
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,210
Those bones under the ancient tree

342
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,920
were indeed my doing.

343
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,560
Continue.

344
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,090
Who exactly were those bones under the ancient tree?

345
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,240
Those bones belong to

346
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,600
the painters from the art studio.

347
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,480
Fengling,

348
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,760
Qiluo, and Xiaomeng.

349
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,280
Hanxiu,

350
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,000
what possible motive could you have

351
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,290
to commit such atrocities against your own sisters?

352
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,600
Miss Hanxiu,

353
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,960
if anyone has forced you to confess,

354
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,680
feel free to speak up,

355
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,359
I will support you.

356
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,420
Your Honor,

357
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,380
Master Lin's death

358
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,380
was indeed caused by my momentary anger.

359
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,620
Such a wonderful evening is rare.

360
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,520
Tonight,

361
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,760
I shall appreciate your beauty like a painting,

362
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,840
and give you all my affection.

363
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,520
No rush.

364
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,600
I understand,

365
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,560
fine wine on a beautiful night,

366
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,360
with a woman as precious as jade.

367
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Let me show you some real affection.

368
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,480
Such a picture-perfect beauty.

369
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,360
No.

370
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,920
Let go of me,

371
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,560
stop it!
