1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,460
Where have you taken Tian?

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,800
What are you planning to do?

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,880
If you handle this matter well,

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,000
I promise I'll never come after Tian again.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,050
He used Tian to threaten me.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,200
At first,

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,000
I thought he only wanted to use

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
my connections with the Situ family

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,160
to help the Sun family establish themselves in Tongzhou.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,820
But who would have thought

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,760
he would mix ghost poppy into the ingredients,

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,040
using this to control more food suppliers in Tongzhou

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,400
and gradually take over the Situ family's business.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,440
Then why didn't you report this to the authorities?

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,080
Report it?

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,560
You think I haven't thought of that?

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,160
But Sun Ding is very cunning.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,520
I was the face of all transactions,

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,400
but the goods never passed through my hands.

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,660
I never knew the source of the ghost poppy

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,560
or where the food was processed.

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,320
Without solid evidence,

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,440
how could I challenge the Sun family?

24
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,560
Young Master Sun's behavior

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,720
is both ridiculous and suspicious.

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,930
I don't understand,

27
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,039
why did you send people to kill us?

28
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,200
The people who tried to kill you were sent by Sun Ding.

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,460
I couldn't intervene.

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,560
Until that day when I saw the butler leave,

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,280
I deliberately showed myself so Miss Ruting would see me.

32
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,240
Because I knew she was close to Yun'er,

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,539
if she saw me at the Sun residence,

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,560
she would certainly become suspicious

35
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,080
and would definitely investigate thoroughly.

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,880
That night, if it weren't for me,

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,330
you would have been poisoned to death.

38
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,890
So you were the one who saved us.

39
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,840
Yun'er told me

40
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,420
that by Miss Ruting's side

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,020
there was a young man named Chu Bufan.

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,400
He's righteous and chivalrous,

43
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,860
skilled at solving cases.

44
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,080
After arriving in Tongzhou,

45
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,000
he helped the Imperial Guard solve the iron ore case,

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,860
and exposed the darkness in the painting workshop.

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,920
Master Chu,

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,600
the ghost poppy matter concerns the safety of the common people,

49
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,200
Sun Ding must face the punishment he deserves.

50
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,140
We need comprehensive evidence,

51
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,500
but I can't do it alone.

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,890
What do you need me to do?

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,940
I recently discovered a place

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,440
that's very likely storing ghost poppies.

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,600
There are too many guards for me to get close and confirm.

56
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,079
If we can catch them red-handed,

57
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,210
we can certainly bring him to justice.

58
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,240
An Ruolai.

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,520
I'll trust you this once.

60
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,820
You'd better not have any other motives.

61
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,840
Don't take any lives during this operation.

62
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,640
Rest assured.

63
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,560
Brothers, let's have another drink.

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,280
Come, drink up!

65
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,560
Carry on.

66
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,930
Who's there?

67
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,280
There are too many people.

68
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,120
Let's go.

69
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,160
What a hassle.

70
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
I must add two chicken legs tonight.

71
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,680
So many.

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,880
You keep watch here,

73
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,080
I'll go notify Constable Li,

74
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,880
be careful.

75
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,620
Tie it tighter.

76
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,960
Alright.

77
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,560
I know, it's nothing.

78
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,680
Thank you,

79
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,409
my pleasure.

80
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,240
Have a drink, sir.

81
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,080
Good.

82
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,800
What do you want?

83
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,060
How dare you, Sun Ding!

84
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,280
You've been selling poisonous ingredients,

85
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,040
harming the people of Tongzhou,

86
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,200
Today I'm ordered to arrest you.

87
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,370
Ridiculous!

88
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,240
My family has been in business for generations,

89
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,080
we've never broken any laws.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,880
You officers are spreading lies

91
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,500
and slandering my family.

92
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,320
Whether you've broken the law or not,

93
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,720
we'll discuss it at the magistrate's office.

94
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,520
Take him away.

95
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,720
I won't go! I won't go!

96
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,720
That's An Ruolai.

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,920
I'm innocent!

98
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,720
You've got the wrong person!

99
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,730
You've arrested the wrong person!

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,240
You shameless merchant!

101
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,320
How dare you sell poisonous ingredients,

102
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,600
the evidence is irrefutable.

103
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,000
Take him away.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,640
Yes, sir.

105
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,600
This can't be!

106
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,680
Sir! Sir!

107
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,140
What are you doing?

108
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,040
Officer, you can't take that!

109
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,970
Get out of my way!

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,640
Sir,

111
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,080
I'm innocent, sir!

112
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,080
Sir,

113
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,280
save it for the court.

114
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,920
No,

115
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,450
my business is legitimate!

116
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,200
I'm innocent!

117
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,440
I'm innocent! Wrongfully accused!

118
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,500
This is injustice!

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,720
Sun Ding.

120
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,920
You've been hoarding large quantities of ghost millet fruit,

121
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,780
selling poisonous ingredients,

122
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,560
harming innocent people,

123
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,520
and disrupting the marketplace in Tongzhou.

124
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,920
Do you admit to your crimes?

125
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,159
Your Honor, please see clearly,

126
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,320
these accusations are all false.

127
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,200
I'm merely a merchant,

128
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,120
how could I have done such harmful things?

129
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,220
All these wrongdoings

130
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,760
were committed by my unfilial son,

131
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,000
An Ruolai.

132
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,880
He deceived me.

133
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,640
I was simply misled

134
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,680
and knew nothing about it.

135
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,440
Sun Ding,

136
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,120
the evidence is conclusive,

137
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,040
yet you continue to make excuses

138
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,640
and push all blame onto others.

139
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,200
According to our investigation,

140
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,680
your Sun family in Jizhou

141
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,410
has been secretly growing ghost poppies,

142
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,240
in massive quantities,

143
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,400
earning ill-gotten gains.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
Are these false accusations as well?

145
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,180
Your Honor,

146
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,600
I am an old man

147
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,400
who never inquires about the details of our business.

148
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,560
An Ruolai manages everything,

149
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,480
and I had no idea he was using my name

150
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,080
to commit such harmful deeds.

151
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,240
Your Honor,

152
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,200
here are the ledgers and supply orders showing Sun Ding's conspiracy to grow ghost poppies

153
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,360
and harm the people.

154
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,280
These ledgers and contracts

155
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,840
clearly document

156
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,120
your cultivation and sale of ghost poppies,

157
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,560
and they bear your seal.

158
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,900
What else do you have to say for yourself?

159
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,160
An Ruolai.

160
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,690
You ungrateful son.

161
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,800
If my son Sun Anyang hadn't died prematurely,

162
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
I would never have acknowledged

163
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,120
a bastard of such lowly birth as you.

164
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,000
You'll end up just like your worthless mother,

165
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,080
meeting a miserable end,

166
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,760
Sun Ding.

167
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,289
My mother lived a virtuous life until you ruined her.

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,039
You have no right to even speak of her.

169
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,300
The criminal Sun Ding,

170
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,960
with all witnesses and evidence present,

171
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,000
has committed unforgivable crimes.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,840
According to the laws of the Great Ming,

173
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,360
he shall be beheaded in public,

174
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,090
to serve as a warning to others.

175
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,880
Guards!

176
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,960
Take him away.

177
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,200
Your Honor.

178
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,280
Your Honor, please leave.

179
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,040
Your Honor, spare my life!

180
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,080
Your Honor, please hurry!

181
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,440
Your Honor, have mercy!

182
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,760
Excuse me,

183
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,000
do you have fresh deer antler here?

184
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,640
Yes,

185
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,200
this way, miss.

186
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,940
Please take a look,

187
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,760
this is golden-edged plum blossom antler,

188
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,520
sourced from the northern cold regions,

189
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,650
taken from two-year-old strong deer,

190
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,280
with extremely rich medicinal properties.

191
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,880
Look.

192
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,160
The texture is firm and delicate with a rich red color,

193
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,840
making it a premium choice,

194
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,700
especially good for nourishing vitality, enriching blood, and strengthening bones.

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,200
If you're looking for

196
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,460
warming and nourishing effects,

197
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
we also have this.

198
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,640
The spotted deer antler has mild properties,

199
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,720
suitable for women's daily health maintenance and replenishing energy,

200
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,450
and won't cause internal heat.

201
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,200
You know quite a lot for an apprentice.

202
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,640
I've been poor since childhood,

203
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,840
with no one to rely on,

204
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,720
but I understand that without connections, learning more

205
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,040
will always be beneficial.

206
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,700
I can see you're trustworthy,

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,040
work well in my Situ family in the future,

208
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,170
and you'll surely achieve something.

209
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,000
May I ask your name, miss?

210
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,640
My name is Situ Chenyun.

211
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,160
Yun'er.

212
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
I miss you so much.

213
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,600
Do you know

214
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,040
I cannot bear all this by myself.

215
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,720
I still need to get a clear answer from him.

216
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,000
I just feel that

217
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,200
Sister Yun's matter hasn't been fully explained.

218
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,560
An Ruolai.

219
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,720
An Ruolai.

220
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,580
He's taken poison.

221
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,620
Quickly take him to the young master.

222
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,280
Do you think An Ruolai

223
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,080
truly failed Sister Yun?

224
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,880
Seeing him kneeling at Sister Yun's grave,

225
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,400
crying so heartbrokenly.

226
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,730
The matters of the heart

227
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,280
are truly unfathomable.

228
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,420
An Ruolai's behavior,

229
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,440
rather than seeming like repentance,

230
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,360
is more like

231
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,520
someone unable to bear

232
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,280
the pain of losing his beloved.

233
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,400
I believe his feelings for your Sister Yun

234
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,530
must have been genuine without doubt.

235
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,520
If he truly loved Sister Yun,

236
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,040
why would he get involved in the Sun family's conspiracy?

237
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,700
What exactly was he planning?

238
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,720
There must be

239
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,880
hidden circumstances we don't yet know about.

240
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,000
In matters of love,

241
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,650
everyone protects it in their own way.

242
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Sometimes we shouldn't use our own perspective

243
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,050
to measure the depth of others' feelings.

244
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,520
But true love

245
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,160
should be mutual trust and honesty,

246
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,900
not deceiving each other in the name of love.

247
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,660
Someone as perceptive as Sister Yun,

248
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,820
if she knew An Ruolai was hiding something from her,

249
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,520
would be terribly disappointed.

250
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,360
Ruting.

251
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,250
Everyone has dark corners in their heart.

252
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,220
Painful memories of the past,

253
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,620
or secrets too difficult to speak of.

254
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,000
Keeping secrets from a loved one

255
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,920
might be unavoidable,

256
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,680
or perhaps

257
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,120
not wanting to drag them into darkness.

258
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,280
Now that Miss Situ has passed away,

259
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,720
whether An Ruolai ever kept secrets from her

260
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
remains unknown,

261
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,290
we shouldn't rush to conclusions.

262
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,900
What about you?

263
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,940
Do you also have painful memories

264
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,180
or secrets unknown to others?

265
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,410
I... well...

266
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,520
weren't we talking about An Ruolai?

267
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,800
How did the conversation turn to me?

268
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,000
So you do have secrets.

269
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,440
Ruting.

270
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,640
My past isn't worth mentioning.

271
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,680
Let's focus

272
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,560
on saving An Ruolai instead.

273
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,920
Fortunately, the poisoning wasn't severe

274
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,320
and treatment was prompt,

275
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,250
so there's no serious concern now.

276
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,360
You two talk. I'll go prepare the medicine.

277
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,000
An Ruolai.

278
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,240
If you're so heartbroken,

279
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,840
why did you betray Sister Yun

280
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,720
and cause her untimely death?

281
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,160
How dare you cry here?

282
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,320
I never betrayed Yun'er.

283
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,360
How could I ever harm her?

284
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,600
Her death

285
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,400
was our mutual decision,

286
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,400
solely to expose Sun Ding's crimes.

287
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,290
What do you mean by that?

288
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,080
Sister Yun,

289
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,690
why did she have to sacrifice her life?

290
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,620
Yun'er had always suffered from a heart condition.

291
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,880
She always endured it daily,

292
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,330
making it difficult for others to notice.

293
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,560
But now

294
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,760
it had reached a point where her life could be in danger at any moment.

295
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,420
She repeatedly discussed it with me.

296
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,600
I certainly didn't agree with her plan.

297
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
But she knew her days were numbered.

298
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,160
She wanted every remaining moment

299
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,960
to have meaning.

300
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,170
She didn't want to leave with regrets.

301
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,240
This way she could pass away with peace of mind.

302
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,930
She knew about my mother's wrongful accusation.

303
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,880
She knew Sun Ding was threatening me with Tian'er.

304
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,720
She also knew I had been secretly

305
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,130
planning to expose Sun Ding's crimes.

306
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,040
But those ingredients mixed with ghost poppy

307
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,170
are impossible for ordinary people to identify.

308
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,400
I tried.

309
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,880
With my strength alone,

310
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,860
obtaining evidence was simply impossible.

311
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
So she decided

312
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,600
to use the family banquet as the perfect opportunity.

313
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
She deliberately

314
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,400
went to Sun Ding's supplier to purchase ingredients.

315
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,460
Yun'er's heart condition

316
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,319
absolutely couldn't withstand the toxicity of ghost poppy.

317
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,440
She said

318
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,980
that with her status, if something happened to her,

319
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,720
it would certainly cause a huge sensation.

320
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,040
Only this way

321
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,680
could the exposure of Sun Ding's crimes

322
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,079
move forward.

323
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,200
She once told me.

324
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,640
If something suddenly happened to her,

325
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,380
you would certainly become suspicious.

326
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,000
You would definitely investigate thoroughly

327
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
and clearly.

328
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,920
At that time,

329
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,660
I would guide you from behind the scenes.

330
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,420
Only in this way

331
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,800
could we obtain concrete evidence.

332
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,680
I'm sorry, Miss Ruoting.

333
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,440
Saying this

334
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,240
feels like we used you.

335
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,840
But we truly had no other choice.
