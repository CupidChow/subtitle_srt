1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,580
From your sister Ruoting.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,500
Upon opening this letter.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,420
Please don't grieve too much.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,720
I heard about the tragedy in your family

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,330
and I've been deeply concerned about you.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,930
You've always been as resilient as a reed,

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,280
and I believe you'll rise from these ashes like a phoenix,

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,980
finding warmth and light once again.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,600
Life is like rowing against the current,

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,320
and though hardships are difficult,

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,250
they are tests that strengthen us.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,240
I remember you once said,

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,360
"When you reach the end of the stream,

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,090
sit and watch the clouds rise."

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,020
This open-mindedness

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,460
is your strength to overcome adversity.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,880
Though the family tragedy weighs heavy as a mountain.

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,680
But please remember,

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,280
eat moderately and maintain regular habits,

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,120
only then can you make peace with yourself.

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,400
Take good care of your health,

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,280
only then can life continue.

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,880
Sister Ruoting,

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,200
please don't blame me for not saying a proper goodbye.

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,200
I've long known my days are numbered,

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,480
but there are certain things

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,920
that if I don't do now,

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,520
I may never have the chance again.

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,440
I know my death will raise your suspicions,

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,930
with your meticulous mind,

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,860
you'll surely seek the truth.

32
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,640
And Chu Bufan by your side,

33
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,620
though I've never met him,

34
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,200
I know he's a trustworthy person

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,880
who will surely help you uncover

36
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,800
the truths hidden in darkness.

37
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,160
Ruoting,

38
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
all this time,

39
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,460
you've gritted your teeth through every storm.

40
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,920
Though now thorns surround you,

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
I firmly believe

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,479
you'll eventually overcome these difficulties,

43
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,740
carrying my unfulfilled expectations,

44
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,480
living more bravely and happily.

45
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,280
Chenyun, with tears.

46
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,100
If peace comes,

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,250
it will be as easy as turning your palm.

48
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,370
Your mission stands firm as a rock.

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,960
Tian'er is still young,

50
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,090
and Master and Madam Situ are elderly,

51
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,280
they all rely on you

52
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,960
and place great hopes in you.

53
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,180
If you choose to leave this world now,

54
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,079
they will surely sink into grief and loneliness.

55
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,520
I hope you won't fail Sister Chenyun's request,

56
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,120
bravely take on this responsibility,

57
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,040
as befits a true man of honor.

58
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,120
Sister Yun.

59
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,130
You've always understood me best.

60
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,520
Many things need not be said aloud,

61
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,500
for you already know them.

62
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,760
I only wish to reassure you.

63
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,120
I will remember your teachings:

64
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,800
to eat moderately,

65
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,960
to keep regular hours,

66
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,010
and to take good care of myself.

67
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Without a healthy body and mind,

68
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,300
how could I fulfill what you've entrusted to me?

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,960
Sister Yun, I know

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,560
that Tian'er is the most precious hope

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,760
you've left in this world,

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,720
and your greatest concern while you were alive.

73
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,200
I will devote myself to accompanying her,

74
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,760
watching her grow up in the sunshine,

75
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,560
shielded from the hardships of this world,

76
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,680
and honoring your profound love and kindness.

77
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,920
I'll come to see you often,

78
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,620
tell you about everything in this world,

79
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,040
and let you know

80
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,620
that the light we've been waiting for

81
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,760
will eventually illuminate the earth.

82
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,920
Is it fun?

83
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,000
Tian'er is fun.

84
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,700
Miss Ruoting, Brother Bufan.

85
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,040
Don't run around.

86
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,159
Auntie Ruoting,

87
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,680
I've missed you

88
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,240
and my mother too.

89
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,690
You look so pretty today, Tian'er.

90
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,920
I've missed you too.

91
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,080
Look,

92
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,840
I brought you some treats.

93
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
Thank you, Auntie.

94
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,280
Let's eat together.

95
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,360
Father.

96
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,690
Tian'er is such a good girl.

97
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,690
Thank you, Tian'er.

98
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,520
Auntie thanks you, Tian'er.

99
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,159
Auntie Ruting,

100
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,560
this is what my mother left for me.

101
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,840
She said she'd give it to me when I was older,

102
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,920
but she...

103
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,440
Tian'er,

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,400
this is the key to the Situ family treasury.

105
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,880
It's an important responsibility your mother left you.

106
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,480
It represents all the wealth and future

107
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,820
that will be placed in your hands.

108
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,680
Remember, wealth is important,

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,130
but responsibility weighs even more.

110
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,560
Auntie Ruting,

111
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,080
can I handle it?

112
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,960
Of course.

113
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,320
You need to grow up quickly,

114
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,720
learn to distinguish the complexity of human hearts and between good and evil,

115
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,520
maintain a clear mind,

116
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,080
be tolerant of others,

117
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,440
yet sharp as a sword.

118
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,010
Don't be afraid,

119
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,760
I'll help you.

120
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,560
I'm leaving now.

121
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,460
Brother Bufan,

122
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,540
here's what you asked for.

123
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,010
I almost forgot.

124
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,480
What's this?

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,640
I'll cook sea cucumber for you tonight,

126
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,500
are you scared?

127
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,040
The people have grievances,

128
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,400
please uphold justice, Your Honor.

129
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,480
The people have grievances,

130
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,720
please uphold justice, Your Honor.

131
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,320
Isn't that Master Shao from the Chunqiu Troupe?

132
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,520
How did he end up like this?

133
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,480
I heard he hasn't eaten, drunk, or slept for days.

134
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,960
He's come to the magistrate's office to seek justice again.

135
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,880
How pitiful.

136
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,080
His apprentice ran away and he lost his family heirloom.

137
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,720
He's probably gone mad.

138
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,960
Your Honor,

139
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,120
please uphold justice.

140
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,200
Shao Heng

141
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,480
why is it you again?

142
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,240
Sir.

143
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,680
This humble citizen has nowhere else to turn,

144
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,760
so I had to trouble you again.

145
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,320
The Peacock Feather is our opera troupe's family heirloom,

146
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,980
we absolutely cannot lose it.

147
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,140
How many times has he come to report this now?

148
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
In response, sir,

149
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,280
this is the fourth time.

150
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,680
Shao Heng,

151
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,560
do you know that for this matter,

152
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,120
I have sent constables

153
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,520
to investigate Wang Pengshu's residence.

154
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,320
However,

155
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,440
they found nothing.

156
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,039
Sir,

157
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,200
when the constables went there...

158
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,530
Wang Pengshu must have already hidden the Peacock Feather,

159
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,570
how would he dare to show it openly?

160
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,400
I beg you to investigate again, sir.

161
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Shao Heng,

162
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,280
it's not that I don't want to uphold justice for you,

163
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,760
but

164
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,080
Wang Pengshu is a prominent gentry in Tongzhou.

165
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,760
How could he possibly steal

166
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,360
something from your little theater troupe?

167
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,880
He has already signed a statement to me

168
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,200
declaring he has nothing to do with this matter.

169
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,120
Besides, he's willing to offer you 100 taels of gold as compensation.

170
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
Why won't you just let it go?

171
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,520
Sir.

172
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,900
The Peacock Plume is our troupe's family heirloom.

173
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,360
Can 100 gold taels replace it?

174
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,600
I don't want money,

175
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,970
I only seek justice.

176
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,120
If this treasure is lost today,

177
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,640
where is our troupe's honor,

178
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,840
and how can our ancestors rest in peace?

179
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,320
You, Shao Heng,

180
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,520
are clearly just a greedy person

181
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,540
causing trouble all day long.

182
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,400
I have important matters to attend to,

183
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,530
and no time to deal with your nonsense.

184
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,360
Guards, take him away.

185
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,420
Get him out of here!

186
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,280
Sir.

187
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,240
I have no greedy intentions,

188
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,800
I just want the peacock feather back.

189
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,400
This peacock feather is our opera troupe's heirloom.

190
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,400
If it's lost,

191
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,920
I cannot face our ancestors.

192
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,880
Sir,

193
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,880
Master Wang is well respected

194
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,120
throughout the region as a generous man.

195
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,850
Why would he covet your insignificant ornament?

196
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,440
Get him out! He's annoying me.

197
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,960
Sir.

198
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,480
Move along!

199
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,960
Sir.

200
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,760
Wang Pengshu stole the peacock feather!

201
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,760
Why won't you investigate thoroughly?

202
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,520
Master Shao,

203
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,840
stop making trouble,

204
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,970
or we'll have to get rough with you.

205
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,760
This troupe leader Shao is so stubborn,

206
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,880
making such a fuss

207
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,040
over a worthless thing.

208
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,920
Worthless thing.

209
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,040
Don't talk nonsense.

210
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,000
I heard the peacock feather

211
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,800
is a treasured heirloom passed down for generations.

212
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,680
Wang Pengshu

213
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,960
is a famous wealthy gentleman in Tongzhou.

214
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,400
Why would such a gentleman want his worthless trinket?

215
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,240
I think that Shao Heng is nothing but a scoundrel

216
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,700
trying to extort someone.

217
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,280
Mr. Shao

218
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,400
please get up

219
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,480
things aren't hopeless yet

220
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,140
there might still be a way out.

221
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,530
Thank you, young master

222
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,440
I have nowhere else to turn for justice.

223
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,280
This peacock feather is our Chunqiu Troupe's

224
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,120
treasured heirloom passed down through generations

225
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,280
if it's lost

226
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,440
I can't face our ancestors

227
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,800
how can I face the troupe?

228
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,970
Since that item is so important

229
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
didn't Squire Wang offer to pay 100 gold pieces?

230
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,560
Why don't you accept it

231
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,290
at least it could compensate for some of the loss.

232
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,380
Young master, you may not know

233
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,920
this peacock feather is not just an object

234
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,560
it's the very soul of our opera troupe.

235
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,320
If we could recover it

236
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,570
Never mind a hundred taels.

237
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,740
even if I have to lose everything I own

238
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,280
I would not hesitate.

239
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,280
Lose everything?

240
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,300
Though I'm not wealthy

241
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,180
I've been saving for years

242
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
and have accumulated some savings.

243
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,680
I'm willing to pay 1,000 taels of silver to get the peacock feather back.

244
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,520
If...

245
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,720
1,000 taels of silver!

246
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,720
Master Shao

247
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,200
you're so wealthy?

248
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,850
Please don't mock me, young master

249
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,640
these savings may not be much

250
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,080
but every coin was earned with blood and sweat.

251
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,800
If it can bring back the peacock feather

252
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,260
spending every last penny would be worth it.

253
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,840
1,000 taels of silver

254
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,920
is certainly tempting.

255
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,900
Well, tell me first

256
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,000
what exactly does this peacock feather look like?

257
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
It's a brooch for the opera costume.

258
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
About this big.

259
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,360
Its color and shape resemble a peacock's feather.

260
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,680
Young master.

261
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,560
Can you help me find the peacock feather?

262
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,120
1,000 taels of silver...

263
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,280
What exactly is this treasure?

264
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,920
I'm also curious about what kind of treasure it is.

265
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,080
If we can help Master Shao

266
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,760
recover that peacock feather,

267
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,600
we'll solve our money problems

268
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,720
and help Ji'an and the children,

269
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,900
killing two birds with one stone.

270
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,120
Then what are we waiting for?

271
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,880
Brother Chu,

272
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,490
what's your plan to find it?

273
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,320
First, let's investigate Wang Pengshu

274
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,420
to see if he's really keeping someone else's treasure.

275
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,040
Heaven is truly on my side,

276
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,680
Jieyi has such a perfect opportunity to exploit.

277
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:33,960
Jieyi is looking for a personal attendant.

278
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,320
This attendant position means serving the master closely,

279
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,260
which makes investigation much easier.

280
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,290
Honorable steward,

281
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,760
is the attendant position still available?

282
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,820
I'm willing to serve your household.

283
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,920
You're applying too?

284
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,200
Indeed.

285
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Though I may not be impressive in appearance,

286
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,880
I've always been diligent,

287
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,320
literate and good at manual labor.

288
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,490
Moreover...

289
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,040
Incredibly strong.

290
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,060
That's enough.

291
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,800
A personal attendant must provide close care,

292
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,200
and my master values appearance above all.

293
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,840
Your appearance is rather crude,

294
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,760
I'm afraid you won't be pleasing to his eye.

295
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,720
Rather crude?

296
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,160
Does a servant who attends to someone

297
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,090
need to be as beautiful as a flower?

298
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,280
I wonder what kind of rule your household follows.

299
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,640
Rules?

300
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,040
Our master is a man of refinement

301
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,720
who cannot tolerate vulgarity in his sight.

302
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,760
Throughout the entire household,

303
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,440
whether servants or maids,

304
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,370
all must be pleasing to the eye.

305
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,840
With your rough appearance, forget about attending to the master,

306
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,520
even the flowers and plants in the backyard

307
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,980
would wither from fright at the sight of you.

308
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,040
I...

309
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,240
Sir Steward,

310
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,240
I've come to apply for the position of attendant in your noble household,

311
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,040
this is a letter of recommendation from my uncle,

312
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,100
please take a look.

313
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,160
What an outstanding talent!

314
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,920
With such appearance and talents,

315
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,980
the master will surely be delighted.

316
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,840
Good, please follow me,

317
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,770
this way please.

318
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,880
What a marvelous person!

319
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,480
Come, please step inside.

320
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,400
They're hiring servants here as if selecting concubines,

321
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,440
requiring servants more beautiful than flowers.

322
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,600
Truly unheard of and unseen before,

323
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,000
indeed a wonder of the world.

324
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,400
Look at that handsome young man,

325
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,560
with features like a painting and the aura of an immortal.

326
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,920
No wonder he was chosen.

327
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,580
His looks are nothing special

328
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,120
compared to Yun Lingke from the previous Chunqiu Troupe,

329
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,250
it's like comparing heaven and earth.

330
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
That Yun Lingke

331
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,320
was truly a rare beauty in this world.

332
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,880
Brothers,

333
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,520
who is this Yun Lingke

334
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,120
you were just talking about?

335
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,600
You don't know,

336
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,280
in the previous Chunqiu Troupe that performed southern opera,

337
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,040
there was a famous male actor who played female roles,

338
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,840
named Yun Lingke,

339
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,650
who often performed at the gentry's mansion.

340
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,010
So he doesn't come anymore?

341
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,760
Now,

342
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,120
I heard he eloped with a maid from the gentry's mansion.

343
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,920
Eloped?

344
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,320
These matters of wealthy families

345
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,120
are best left unquestioned by common folk like us,

346
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,280
lest we bring trouble upon ourselves.

347
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,200
Come, drink up.

348
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,240
Let's drink.

349
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,090
It seems this theater manager Shao

350
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,680
hasn't been honest with me.

351
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
Young Master Chu,

352
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,329
do you have any news?

353
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,359
Manager Shao,

354
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,839
I've been working hard to help you find the Peacock Feather,

355
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,880
yet you haven't been truthful with me.

356
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,480
How am I supposed to help you?

357
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,079
Young Master, what do you mean?

358
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,680
There must be some misunderstanding.

359
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,920
How would I dare hide anything from you?

360
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,359
Why didn't you mention Yun Lingke eloping with the gentry's maid?

361
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,490
Why keep that quiet?

362
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,640
Everyone, stop staring.

363
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,319
Young Master Chu.

364
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
Young Master Chu.

365
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,040
I don't believe Yunling would do such a thing,

366
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,900
there must be something more to this.

367
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Something more?

368
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,760
Setting that aside,

369
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,200
before your peacock feather was lost,

370
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,960
which costume was it sewn onto,

371
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,580
and who was wearing it?

372
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,720
Master Shao.

373
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,920
