1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,000
Lin, Lin.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,920
I don't need your help.

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,320
Lin.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,280
Lin.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,880
They've taken Ping'an away.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:20,920
I don't understand.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,780
Why did she keep hiding it from me?

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,400
Actually, I...

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,400
Give it back to me.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,320
So you knew all along.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,479
Give it back.

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,780
That day when you came to my house,

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,120
asking about this thing,

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,000
I thought it was strange.

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,600
My wife said she wasn't wearing it,

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,860
which was impossible.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,000
Many things that happen

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
are just such coincidences.

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,960
Li Qiang told me

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,920
my official uniform had no wear,

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,880
no scent of having been worn.

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,520
My wife is a meticulous person,

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
I know that.

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,800
Her not asking

25
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,180
doesn't mean she didn't suspect.

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,940
But many things are like this,

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,240
hiding things during special times

28
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,160
leads to complications.

29
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,340
She also hid the special concealed weapon from the Golden Knife Sect.

30
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
She knows...

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,530
Brother Lin,

32
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,720
perhaps there were secrets,

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,940
but it's not necessarily a bad thing.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,060
Maybe there are misunderstandings,

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,800
or she had no choice.

36
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,880
I still remember

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,640
the winter when I met her.

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,760
That bitterly cold night.

39
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,640
Six years ago, with snow drifting,

40
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,250
I was leading the patrol team then,

41
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,860
the cold in the early hours reached its peak,

42
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,560
my mind was numb.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,840
Damn weather.

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,440
I'm freezing and need to pee.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,930
Wait for me here.

46
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,920
Yes.

47
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,480
Help me.

48
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,320
Save me.

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,760
Please save me.

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,160
I want to live.

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,760
It's so cold today.

52
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,360
Yes, it is.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,760
Master Lin,

54
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,720
what happened?

55
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,850
I'm short on time, so I'll be brief.

56
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,370
Do your best to save her,

57
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,450
whether she lives depends on fate.

58
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,220
Don't mention this to anyone,

59
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,660
I'll come back at dawn.

60
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,080
I thought she wouldn't survive.

61
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,360
She was severely hypothermic.

62
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,159
Thank you.

63
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,280
I was planning to send her away once she recovered.

64
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,890
On the day we parted,

65
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,160
we were by the city gate.

66
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,960
I asked if she would stay.

67
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,840
I told her

68
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,530
that the past doesn't matter anymore.

69
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,640
You have been reborn.

70
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
No matter what you've been through,

71
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,840
I don't mind.

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,930
These past few days,

73
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,360
I've been hesitating on how to tell you.

74
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,690
This is the secret letter Shi Jia hid in the blacksmith shop.

75
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,480
It

76
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,500
contains information about her.

77
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,360
Suo Yun.

78
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,440
That's her real name.

79
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,520
Go in.

80
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,280
Suo Yun is dead.

81
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,800
Brother Chu said

82
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,760
you shouldn't go back home for a couple of days,

83
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,890
Lin Feng went there.

84
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,400
Alright, got it.

85
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,530
Take it easy.

86
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,480
Looks like I'll have to crash here with you for two nights.

87
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,520
Brother Chu brought some friends over,

88
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,080
and it's not convenient for me to show up.

89
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,120
Brother Chu is handling important matters,

90
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
we should just support him quietly.

91
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,679
I'm really afraid that when you leave,

92
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,880
I'll be crying again.

93
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,360
I hate to say goodbye.

94
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,440
We'll have plenty of time in the future,

95
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,400
when we get to the capital,

96
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,860
we'll bring you good news.

97
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,080
Drink up!

98
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,300
I wish to serve our clan again.

99
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,240
Please grant me this opportunity, Master.

100
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,880
I know why you've come.

101
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,640
Bring her out.

102
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,160
Mother.

103
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,800
I'm fine.

104
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,490
I'm alright.

105
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,690
Do you not trust me, Master?

106
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,360
Have they been mistreating you?

107
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,800
No one has mistreated me,

108
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
but I'm so hungry, Mother.

109
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,060
Mother will take you to get something delicious now, okay?

110
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,640
Wait.

111
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,360
This child needs to take

112
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,890
my special tonic every day.

113
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,800
What you need to do,

114
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,290
how you should do it,

115
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,320
you should know very well.

116
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,560
Come, Ping'an.

117
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,530
Take this medicine,

118
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,880
and Mother will take you for something delicious.

119
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,280
Let's go.

120
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,840
Don't be gone too long.

121
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,890
You know the consequences.

122
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,320
Come back soon.

123
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,480
Brother Lin, can we stop drinking?

124
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,200
You're on duty during the day,

125
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,120
and at night you don't sleep but keep drinking.

126
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,440
Who can handle that?

127
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,560
And also,

128
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,640
what about your promise to completely eliminate

129
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,720
Li Haifeng's Golden Blade Gang?

130
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,160
I haven't forgotten.

131
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,160
How could I forget?

132
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,080
The Golden Blade Gang has dominated the martial world for years,

133
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,560
with numerous complicated connections.

134
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,890
I've been gathering information during the day,

135
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
and it's all so complex.

136
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,920
How could I figure everything out all at once?

137
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,210
At night, my mind is filled with thoughts of Ping'an and her,

138
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,520
how am I supposed to sleep?

139
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,120
Brother Chu,

140
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,200
if you were in my position,

141
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,320
could you sleep peacefully?

142
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,120
You make it sound

143
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,280
like I have no compassion.

144
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,780
Please bear with me, Brother Chu,

145
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,720
for your great kindness today,

146
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,120
I will repay you someday.

147
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,560
Don't worry, Brother Lin.

148
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,240
I won't just drink with you to drown your sorrows,

149
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,880
I will help you solve the Tieshi case,

150
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,960
bring Ping'an back safely,

151
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,840
and free your wife.

152
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,020
Speaking of which,

153
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,330
Brother Lin,

154
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,810
this Li Haifeng is the mastermind,

155
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,920
he's been here for so many days,

156
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,660
yet at all our checkpoints

157
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,200
we haven't caught him moving any goods out.

158
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,080
Why is that?

159
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
According to recent intelligence,

160
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,160
their original plan

161
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,040
was to gather goods from five locations

162
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,640
before shipping them out,

163
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,080
otherwise it wouldn't be worth the risk.

164
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,960
And we've destroyed two of their bases -

165
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,440
the blacksmith shop and the temple,

166
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,690
which has significantly affected their inventory.

167
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,960
Now we've identified another location

168
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,120
and plan to raid it tomorrow.

169
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,640
So,

170
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,840
they only have goods at two locations left.

171
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,560
Good.

172
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,960
Let's get some rest tonight,

173
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,840
and head out early tomorrow morning,

174
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,720
just to be safe.

175
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,100
Such an important matter,

176
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,210
why didn't you tell me earlier?

177
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,940
Afraid I'd leak the information?

178
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,320
Thanks to you,

179
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,890
Lin Feng and I are now half enemies,

180
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,260
do you think he'll trust me again?

181
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,160
Stop wasting time.

182
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,640
Go do it now,

183
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,780
and I'll give you the antidote when you're done.

184
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,810
What's going on?

185
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,160
Master Lin?

186
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,280
I need to tell you something,

187
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,760
but you must stay calm,

188
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,890
don't get upset.

189
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,680
What mistake have you made this time?

190
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,560
It's not me.

191
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,720
It's...

192
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,020
That person standing in front...

193
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,080
It's your wife.

194
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,220
Come back, Master Lin.

195
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,880
The exchange is about to happen.

196
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,520
Move in!

197
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,120
She truly is Brother Lin's greatest weakness.

198
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,960
Don't move!

199
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,560
Freeze!

200
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,860
Don't move!

201
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,860
Stay where you are!

202
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,400
Those people

203
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,600
are so ruthless even to their own.

204
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,560
Who sent you?

205
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,600
Sir,

206
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,000
we don't know anything.

207
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,240
We heard someone wanted to buy potatoes,

208
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,280
quite a large amount,

209
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,680
so that's why we came.

210
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,680
Potatoes?

211
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,740
You've been lying to me

212
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,280
to me,

213
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,800
to this family.

214
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,250
Do you have any feelings at all?

215
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,240
Haven't you been lying to me too?

216
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,760
Claiming you work at the magistrate's office,

217
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,490
pinching pennies every month,

218
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,040
changing into your uniform when you come home.

219
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,000
Captain Lin,

220
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,119
you're quite the actor.

221
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,280
Are you really giving up on this family?

222
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,960
Do you want Ping'an

223
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,319
to live the same kind of life as you?

224
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,720
I just want to stay alive.

225
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,849
Brother Lin.

226
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,450
We've been tricked.

227
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,120
The real transaction has probably already ended,

228
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,040
and all the disciples of

229
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,000
the Golden Blade Sect are dead.

230
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,200
We've lost our lead.

231
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
What a clever diversion,

232
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,120
we have to start over.

233
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,900
You want to start over with your sister-in-law?

234
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,970
We'll start investigating again from

235
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,120
Shi Jia's blacksmith shop.
