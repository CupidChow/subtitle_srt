1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,020
Immortal Ling,

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,410
do you have an antidote?

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,680
Don't worry. This dish isn't poisoned.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,410
Then why were you vomiting?

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,760
I just saw you two throwing up,

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,220
so I started vomiting too.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,120
However, from my observation,

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,280
none of these ingredients are incompatible with each other.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,920
You suspect there's something wrong with the food.

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,040
But didn't you say

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,170
the coroner found no traces of poison?

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,290
Brother Chu.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,560
If there's nothing wrong with the dishes at the birthday banquet,

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,360
could we be investigating in the wrong direction?

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,080
These dishes seem ordinary at first,

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,840
but when tasted carefully,

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,440
each one has a subtle, indescribable aroma,

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,800
extremely delicate in flavor,

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,720
almost imperceptible unless savored attentively.

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,600
Try them again.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,039
I don't taste anything special.

22
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,050
There is a faint, fresh fragrance.

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,640
And a slight bitterness in the aftertaste.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,840
This aroma

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,120
is perfectly concealed within the ingredients.

26
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,560
Hard to detect.

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,930
This seems to be the flavor of ghost poppy.

28
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,729
What is ghost poppy?

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,720
Ghost poppy.

30
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,960
Also known as Bewitching Incense,

31
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,200
it's an extremely rare medicinal herb.

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,520
Its fragrance is very faint and hard to detect,

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,840
but it's highly addictive.

34
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,810
Long-term consumption

35
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,120
gradually erodes one's body and will.

36
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,770
What's more terrifying

37
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,280
is that it slowly accumulates in the body,

38
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,680
eventually affecting the internal organs

39
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,820
and causing death.

40
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,000
And most importantly,

41
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,200
those who die from Ghost Poppy

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,560
show no signs of poisoning.

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,960
I can't believe something so terrible exists!

44
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,720
Could Sister Yun be affected?

45
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,410
This flower grows in the deep mountains of the south.

46
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,490
The government has explicitly banned its trade,

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,410
so there shouldn't be any way for it to circulate.

48
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,920
Unless someone deliberately cultivates it,

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
sells it secretly,

50
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,440
that would be a different story.

51
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,370
If it's ground into powder and mixed with food ingredients,

52
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,520
ordinary people would never notice it.

53
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,520
Miss Situ's death

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,760
must be connected to this powder.

55
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,440
Since someone is using such underhanded tactics,

56
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,770
we must catch the mastermind behind this.

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,960
If the mastermind wants to kill Situ Chenyun,

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,820
then why do all those ingredients

59
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,240
from the food shops contain ghost poppy?

60
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,000
Exactly.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,880
Or could it be that their target

62
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,280
isn't just Situ Chenyun?

63
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
That makes sense.

64
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,860
Both Luopin Pavilion and Tongjiang Seafood

65
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,440
are likely involved in this.

66
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,900
Especially when I questioned them that day,

67
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,280
their expressions were suspicious,

68
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,760
as if they were hiding something.

69
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,520
This ghost poppy is highly addictive,

70
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,620
there must be a massive conspiracy behind all this.

71
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,640
I'll go investigate the true origin of the ghost poppy flower.

72
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,240
Qiming,

73
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,360
keep an eye on

74
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,920
Luopin Pavilion and Tongjiang Seafood these days.

75
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,720
Leave it to me.

76
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,210
Brother Chu,

77
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,560
is there anything

78
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,440
I can do?

79
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,220
Immortal Ling,

80
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,000
I have an important task for you.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,930
Important task?

82
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,090
You're doing the dishes today.

83
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,240
No way.

84
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,050
Me? A divine immortal washing dishes?

85
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,000
I...

86
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,579
What a bargain.

87
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,079
Such a deal!

88
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,320
Do you have any ghost poppy flowers?

89
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,760
That deadly stuff? I don't have any.

90
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,690
Go away, go away!

91
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,360
Do you know where I can buy ghost poppy flowers?

92
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,960
Ghost poppy flowers?

93
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,760
Does such a thing even exist?

94
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,490
Never heard of it. I don't know.

95
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,480
Sir.

96
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,080
Do you have any ghost poppy flowers here?

97
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,880
What flowers?

98
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,280
Ghost poppy flowers.

99
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,159
Chive flowers?

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,730
Shopkeeper.

101
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,540
Do you sell ghost poppy flowers here?

102
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,000
Young master.

103
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
These are officially prohibited medicinal herbs.

104
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,330
Our humble shop doesn't carry such ingredients.

105
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,610
Shopkeeper.

106
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,140
Look at my terrible cough.

107
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,800
I've heard you have the most complete stock of herbs

108
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,760
and must have connections.

109
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,160
Please help me find a way.

110
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,120
I'll keep it absolutely secret.

111
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,560
Sir, you must be joking.

112
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,160
We are

113
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,200
law-abiding, legitimate merchants.

114
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
We don't have what you're looking for.

115
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,960
Leave now,

116
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,250
or I'll report you to the authorities.

117
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,120
Fine.

118
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,409
I'm leaving.

119
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,900
What grudge do you have against me

120
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,280
to block my way?

121
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,720
Blame yourself for meddling in others' business,

122
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,640
today will be your last day alive.

123
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,930
Oh no, they're after me.

124
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,960
Master Ling!

125
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,130
Master Ling!

126
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,120
Wake up!

127
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,840
Master Ling, wake up!

128
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,080
Master Ling!

129
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,170
Are you alright?

130
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,000
Chu Bufan.

131
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,680
I was just drying herbs in the courtyard

132
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,560
when someone knocked me out.

133
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,120
Ruoting.

134
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,420
Quickly, go check on Ruoting inside.

135
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,200
It's terrible! Ruoting is gone!

136
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,130
She's in danger.

137
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,680
I was just chased by assassins,

138
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,760
worried you might be in danger,

139
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,840
so I rushed back immediately,

140
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,170
but I was still too late.

141
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,960
Who on earth are these people?

142
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,690
Don't worry,

143
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,140
I'll definitely bring Ruoting back.

144
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,560
Ruoting!

145
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,760
Ruoting!

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,280
Careful, it's a trap!

147
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,720
Open the door!

148
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,880
Who exactly are you people,

149
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,920
and why are you harassing us?

150
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,280
You're the fools who stuck your noses where they don't belong.

151
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,610
Then don't blame us for what happens next.

152
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,800
Chu Bufan!

153
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,980
What's that smell?

154
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,760
It's ghost poppy flower.

155
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,420
This is bad,

156
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,380
we need to get out of here fast.

157
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,520
Yue'er!

158
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,960
Yue'er,

159
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,440
how are you here?

160
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,240
I thought I'd never see you again.

161
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,880
Yue'er!

162
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,960
Ruoting,

163
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,080
hang in there,

164
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,080
this smoke causes hallucinations.

165
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,280
Chu Bufan!

166
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,720
Ruoting!

167
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,000
Don't leave me!

168
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,360
Listen to me,

169
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,320
everything you're seeing is just hallucinations from the smoke.

170
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,580
You need to stay alert.

171
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,770
I'll get you out of here right away.

172
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,090
Wait for me a moment.

173
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,159
Chu Bufan!

174
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,480
I'm choking!

175
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,800
You're hurt.

176
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,840
I'm fine.

177
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,440
Why are they trying to kill us?

178
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,840
It must be related to the Situ mansion case.

179
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,600
They found out about our investigation so quickly.

180
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,060
They're coming! This way!

181
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,960
Hurry!

182
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,720
You go first, I'll draw them away.

183
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,440
Chu Bufan!

184
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,200
Don't go!

185
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,840
You have to hang on.

186
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,570
I'll definitely find someone to save you.

187
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,880
You've been chasing me relentlessly.

188
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,480
Who exactly sent you?

189
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,800
Even if I'm going to die,

190
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,280
at least let me know why.

191
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,960
Look at you, still trying to play the hero.

192
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,080
Miss Ruoting,

193
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,050
it really is you.

194
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,400
Qi Ming,

195
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,400
what took you so long?

196
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,600
Luoping Pavilion.

197
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,480
I thought

198
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,080
I'd never see you again.

199
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,720
I'm not that easy to kill.

200
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,520
Come on, don't cry.

201
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,810
How did you get back?

202
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,560
Are you hurt?

203
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,400
Miss Ruoting

204
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,930
was brought back by Qiming.

205
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,360
She was very worried about you,

206
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,080
so she's been waiting here

207
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,160
for news of you.

208
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,440
What about Qi Ming?

209
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,720
After he brought me back,

210
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,320
he went to look for you again.

211
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,850
Brother Chu,

212
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,860
are you actually injured?

213
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,020
Do you need me to treat you?

214
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,000
Thank you for your concern, Immortal Ling.

215
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,120
Those men in black who were hunting us

216
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,180
have dealings with Luopin Pavilion.

217
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,160
The evidence now points directly to Luopin Pavilion,

218
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,440
so we need to go there again.

219
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,760
The investigation isn't that urgent.

220
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,960
Taking care of your health is the most important thing.

221
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,560
No.

222
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,340
I'm afraid the longer we wait,

223
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,650
the more complications may arise.

224
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,840
Who are you? What do you want?

225
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,240
Mr. Luo, important people tend to be forgetful.

226
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,760
Just a few days ago, I bought sea cucumbers from your shop.

227
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,420
You said they were delicious.

228
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,320
Today I'd like you to taste them yourself.

229
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,760
Finish all of these and I'll let you go.

230
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,680
I can't eat them.

231
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,880
I can't eat them!

232
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,600
Why?

233
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,680
You swore up and down

234
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,120
that these sea cucumbers were premium quality,

235
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,000
so why are you afraid to eat them yourself?

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,280
They can't be eaten.

237
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,200
Ghost poppy?

238
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,040
Go on.

239
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,650
These sea cucumbers contain ghost poppy.

240
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,640
I'm just an ordinary businessman.

241
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,160
Please spare my life, sir.

242
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,720
Give me a chance to live.

243
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,640
Where exactly did you source these sea cucumbers from?

244
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,400
Tell me and I might spare your life.

245
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,000
I only know his surname is Sun,

246
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,320
he's very powerful,

247
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,800
with connections everywhere.

248
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,920
I-I was just following orders.

249
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,680
Please spare my life, young master.

250
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,440
Spare me, please.

251
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,360
In that case,

252
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,240
you'll go back to this Mr. Sun

253
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,020
and buy another batch.

254
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,040
Mr. Sun,

255
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,600
this is the order for sea cucumber from

256
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,680
Miss Zhao, the daughter of the Zhao family,

257
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,540
who specifically requested only premium quality.

258
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,700
Please take a look.

259
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,280
Such a large order.

260
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,840
It seems that you,

261
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,080
Mr. Luo, have been doing quite well lately.

262
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,000
Not at all.

263
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,960
Since this is such a significant transaction,

264
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,560
would you be willing to deliver it in person?

265
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,080
It would show more sincerity that way.

266
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,380
But I'm just the supplier.

267
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,060
Mr. Luo, you're actually allowing me to meet the buyer?

268
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,240
Aren't you afraid of the consequences?

269
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,600
Not at all.

270
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,480
Mr. Sun has always been

271
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,400
very supportive of our humble shop.

272
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,160
For such a large order,

273
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,600
it's too much for me to handle alone,

274
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,800
so I must trouble you to negotiate in person.

275
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,360
If the deal goes through,

276
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,360
you would only need to set aside

277
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,640
a small commission from the profits.

278
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,320
Very well then.

279
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,040
Mr. Luo.

280
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,360
I'll remember

281
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,080
your kindness.

282
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,800
Thank you, Mr. Sun.

283
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,840
I'll take my leave now.

284
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,200
Master Chu

285
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,640
Miss Zhao

286
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,160
that Master Sun

287
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,220
has agreed to make the deal in person.

288
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,040
As you can see, the task

289
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,280
you assigned has been handled perfectly.

290
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Would you please show mercy

291
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,080
and spare my life?

292
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,420
If that's the case,

293
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,040
I'll go on Miss Zhao's behalf

294
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,680
to meet with that Master Sun.

295
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,130
No, absolutely not!

296
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,040
Master Chu,

297
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,840
there's something you don't know.

298
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,760
This Master Sun

299
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,160
is always extremely cautious in his dealings.

300
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,560
If Miss Zhao doesn't appear in person,

301
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,120
I'm afraid he might not show up at all.

302
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,080
After all, this deal

303
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,010
was only arranged out of respect for the Zhao family.

304
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,360
This whole situation is because of me.

305
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,420
I can't let you face the danger alone.

306
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,490
I'll go with you to meet Master Sun.

307
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,760
Ruoting.

308
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,120
Do you realize that if we go,

309
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,320
there's an eighty percent chance we'll face danger?

310
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,780
You've experienced this firsthand before.

311
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,040
I can't let you come with me again.

312
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,900
I know what you're worried about,

313
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,640
but if we want to meet Master Sun,

314
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,240
I must be there in person.

315
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,680
We can't give up so easily because of me.

316
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,680
All right,

317
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,220
we'll go together,

318
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,450
but you must follow my instructions completely.

319
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,690
What are you looking at?

320
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,880
Very good.

321
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,119
Very good.

322
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,839
Very good.

323
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,280
A few days ago, I went to investigate the Sun family

324
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
and discovered that they

325
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,599
were originally just a small merchant in Jizhou

326
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,599
making a living by selling seafood.

327
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,880
In recent years, they've grown quite ambitious

328
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,720
and have continuously

329
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,200
expanded their food supply business.

330
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,120
A year ago, they relocated to Tongzhou

331
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,000
and began eyeing the Situ family's position

332
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,960
in the food trade market

333
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,440
with the clear intention of replacing them.

334
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,520
The Situ family's foundation in Tongzhou's food trade

335
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,600
is extremely solid

336
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,640
after generations of business.

337
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,160
What power does the Sun family possess

338
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,760
to compete with the Situ family?
