1
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,560
Thank you.

2
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,500
It's getting late,

3
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,560
and Ruoting still hasn't shown up.

4
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,420
I hope nothing's happened to her.

5
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,560
Hello, mister.

6
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,320
Good girl.

7
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,600
Be careful in the future, okay?

8
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,480
I will.

9
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,360
I'll never go with strangers again,

10
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,760
or take food from them either.

11
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,040
That's right.

12
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,040
Run along now.

13
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,320
Young Master Chu.

14
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,440
I've been thinking about this for a while,

15
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,640
wanting to thank you,

16
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,840
but never found the right opportunity.

17
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,720
The young lady said

18
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,280
she would express my gratitude to you on my behalf,

19
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,400
and told me not to worry about it.

20
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,960
Your young lady

21
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,800
wouldn't happen to be Zhao Ruoting, would she?

22
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,180
The young lady said

23
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,480
I shouldn't reveal her identity.

24
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,680
I got too excited and let it slip.

25
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,480
Please don't tell anyone.

26
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,240
Don't worry.

27
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,410
I'll definitely keep your secret.

28
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,920
Does your young lady have something going on today?

29
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,960
I heard her say

30
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,480
she's never missed a day of serving porridge,

31
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,960
but today she's nowhere to be seen.

32
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,560
I find it strange too.

33
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,280
Early this morning at the mansion,

34
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,760
the person who usually checks accounts with me didn't show up either,

35
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,620
which has never happened before.

36
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,800
Zhao Ruoting.

37
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,650
That can't be right.

38
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,040
Which household is she from?

39
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,640
She's the young lady,

40
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,140
the precious daughter of Master Zhao Wanyi,

41
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
please keep this secret for me, sir.

42
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,769
Brother Chu.

43
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,930
Brother Chu,

44
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,300
what's wrong with you?

45
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,480
I've never seen you like this before,

46
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,200
what happened

47
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,330
that could trouble our great hero Chu?

48
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,760
Do you know Zhao Ruoting?

49
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
What a question!

50
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,010
Of course I know her,

51
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,180
we've met her together so many times.

52
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,480
Then do you know she's the young lady of the Zhao family?

53
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,200
Yes, I do.

54
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,000
That famous Zhao family,

55
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,280
Zhao Wanyi,

56
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,610
she's the daughter of that crooked merchant Zhao Wanyi.

57
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,480
What's wrong?

58
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,659
The young lady is herself,

59
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,380
and Zhao Wanyi is himself,

60
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,450
it's not what you're thinking.

61
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,159
Don't listen to all that gossip

62
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,760
from people outside.

63
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,680
Zhao Wanyi may be a crooked merchant,

64
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,920
but the young lady has always been different,

65
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,440
her kindness isn't fake.

66
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,860
She never gets involved in the family business,

67
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,410
she has her own things to do.

68
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,320
I think she's someone worthy of respect

69
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,440
and friendship.

70
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,100
After spending time with her,

71
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,560
don't you like her too?

72
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,320
Why didn't you tell me this before?

73
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,370
You didn't know?

74
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,040
That's not like your usual approach.

75
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,720
Don't you usually investigate

76
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,980
everyone thoroughly?

77
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,850
What's this,

78
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,240
you've met a woman you fancy

79
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,900
and made an exception for her?

80
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,080
Besides,

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,440
you never asked me about this.

82
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,480
It's not what you think,

83
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,240
when I make friends,

84
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,640
I don't always investigate their background.

85
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,000
When dealing with people, you need your own judgment,

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,400
to think and evaluate,

87
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,040
not just listen to what others say

88
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,200
and let them shape your perception.

89
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,800
In this world, you must use your own heart

90
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,760
and interact with others sincerely.

91
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,680
That makes a lot of sense.

92
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,820
But you've been together for so long,

93
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,810
I thought you already knew.

94
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,820
Could it be related to what happened last night?

95
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,850
Brother Lin.

96
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,880
Brother Chu, sorry to keep you waiting.

97
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,720
I just got some confidential information.

98
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,400
Last night,

99
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Zhao Wanyi died.

100
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,040
What time last night? How did he die?

101
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,480
I don't have the details yet

102
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,010
as it happened so suddenly.

103
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,200
The Zhao family has extensive businesses

104
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,480
and the authorities immediately suppressed the news.

105
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,600
No one can freely enter or leave the Zhao residence,

106
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,330
as officials are investigating the case inside.

107
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,480
Zhao Ruoting.

108
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,520
Thank you for your help, Lin.

109
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,280
I must go now.

110
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
If I encounter any more difficult matters,

111
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,250
I may have to trouble you again.

112
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,880
Of course.

113
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,800
Officials are conducting an investigation,

114
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,060
leave quickly if you don't want trouble.

115
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,080
Officer,

116
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,600
may I ask

117
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,280
what's happening here today?

118
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,960
I came urgently to settle my account today,

119
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,420
but I wasn't even allowed near the entrance.

120
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,800
My family desperately needs money,

121
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,960
please do me a favor

122
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,520
and let me in for a moment.

123
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,760
Please, be flexible.

124
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,680
I told you, officials are investigating,

125
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,720
go in and you might not come out alive.

126
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,880
Not come out alive?

127
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,960
What exactly happened?

128
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,600
What could possibly be

129
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,560
more urgent than common folk like us

130
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,420
needing money?

131
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,480
I already have quite a pile of debts.

132
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,360
This household usually pays on time

133
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,480
so I thought I'd let it accumulate

134
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,080
and settle it all at once.

135
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,320
If I can't get paid now,

136
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,850
my family will have nothing to eat.

137
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,920
For me,

138
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,120
this is truly a matter of life and death.

139
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,840
Why so much nonsense?

140
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,120
Can't you understand simple instructions?

141
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,840
Forget it.

142
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,880
Get in.

143
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,890
Enter only, no exit.

144
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,919
Chu Bufan.

145
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,929
What are you doing here?

146
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,760
I was worried when you didn't come to the porridge shop this morning,

147
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,080
so I asked around and found out where you live.

148
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,520
I had to convince them

149
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,040
to let me in.

150
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,890
The officers at the gate said there was an incident here.

151
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,440
You're really brave,

152
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,820
sticking your nose into everything.

153
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,400
Next time before you do something,

154
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,200
gather some information first.

155
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
I believe you.

156
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,080
Let's go to Linglong Valley to talk,

157
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,540
it's not convenient here.

158
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,520
My father was killed last night.

159
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,360
It happened so suddenly.

160
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,290
After the officials arrived, they sealed off our house.

161
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,820
Yesterday at home,

162
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,370
there were indeed many unfamiliar faces.

163
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,440
After the officials arrived,

164
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,480
they quickly began the interrogations.

165
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,360
Everyone gave their statements as ordered.

166
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,360
The Zhao family owns numerous businesses

167
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,760
and their prosperity or decline

168
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,820
affects the tax revenue of Tongzhou.

169
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,850
Master Zhao's murder today

170
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,240
is a matter of great importance.

171
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,040
If anyone here harbors thoughts of taking chances

172
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,880
or attempts to conceal anything

173
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,360
and fails to tell the whole truth,

174
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,090
they will be severely punished

175
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,540
without any leniency.

176
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,520
Sir.

177
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,520
I, Lei Lei,

178
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,280
am an honest and legitimate merchant

179
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,530
who just arrived in Tongzhou from Xuanfu yesterday.

180
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,530
Through a friend's introduction,

181
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,840
I've met Master Zhao several times.

182
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,800
I've been discussing with Master Zhao

183
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,000
about purchasing his blacksmith shop.

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,280
I arrived early this morning, at around 7 o'clock.

185
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,410
I had just arrived at the Zhao mansion.

186
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
The head steward.

187
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,440
Merchant Lei.

188
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,200
Steward Zhang's face

189
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,000
showed no trace of the smile one would expect for a business partner.

190
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,640
He exchanged pleasantries with me briefly

191
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,100
before being called away by the doorkeeper.

192
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,720
Steward Zhang,

193
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,250
there's a young man at the door asking for you.

194
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,040
Sir,

195
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,200
I am Wang Er,

196
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,440
a distant relative of Steward Zhang.

197
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,080
There's been a famine in my hometown,

198
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,840
and life has become unbearably difficult,

199
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,360
so I've come seeking refuge.

200
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,220
I arrived at the Zhao mansion at exactly noon today.

201
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,840
I have urgent business

202
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
and need to see your head steward, Zhang Shuyi,

203
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,640
please be kind enough to inform him.

204
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,440
Just a moment.

205
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,520
Uncle.

206
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,000
There's been a famine back home,

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,660
so I've come to seek your help.

208
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,920
These two arrived at the household just yesterday.

209
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800
I had never seen them before,

210
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
nor had I heard anyone mention them.

211
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,000
I've rarely involved myself in household affairs

212
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,210
and never wanted to interfere.

213
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,760
Now I truly feel guilty about that.

214
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,080
In any case,

215
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,730
I still want to do something for my father.

216
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,520
Take comfort in your grief,

217
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,780
take care of yourself,

218
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,720
and stay rational and clear-headed.

219
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,120
Given what has happened,

220
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,120
the most important thing is to find the killer.

221
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,920
I'll stay by your side and help you figure this out.

222
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,400
Next,

223
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,000
we'll question the people inside the mansion.

224
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,960
I, Liu Yang, a humble commoner,

225
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,800
am an orphan.

226
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,840
Over the years, I've worked diligently,

227
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,120
joined opera troupes, served as a soldier,

228
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,320
worked as a cook, sold medicine,

229
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,960
and done all kinds of hard labor.

230
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,160
Now I'm the chief guard at the Zhao mansion.

231
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,020
I've been at the Zhao mansion for over three months.

232
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
I am Zhang Shuyi, a humble commoner.

233
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,000
I entered the Zhao household when I was 22,

234
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,200
and have been here for 20 years now.

235
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,760
All the masters of the house have been very kind,

236
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,440
treating their servants well.

237
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,480
The Zhao family business is substantial,

238
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,410
and has never had any major issues.

239
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,850
As far as I can remember,

240
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,120
they have no enemies.

241
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,440
I am Zhao Yue'er,

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,600
an orphan.

243
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,380
When I was six, I was kidnapped by brothel thugs.

244
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,960
It was Master Zhao who kindly bought me

245
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,400
to be the young lady's personal maid,

246
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,130
accompanying her daily, never leaving her side.

247
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,360
I am Zhao Ruoting,

248
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,440
daughter of Zhao Wanyi.

249
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,800
I have a close relationship with my father.

250
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,880
I enjoy reading poetry and painting in my daily life.

251
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,770
That newly opened embroidery and fabric shop

252
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,240
is a business I manage on my own.

253
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,920
In my spare time,

254
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,540
I also participate in some charitable activities.

255
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,440
Boss Li.

256
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,240
Night clothes.

257
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,240
You said Officer Jia came in with the night clothes

258
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,100
Did you hear clearly what he said?

259
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,410
Is there anything special about this Lei Lei?

260
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,760
I only met him for the first time yesterday.

261
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,160
If I had to point out something special,

262
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,400
it would be his ambiguous smile,

263
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,120
his expressionless face,

264
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,240
yet somehow it gives me chills.

265
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,320
But then again,

266
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,800
I don't find him very suspicious.

267
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,640
He came here to discuss business with my father,

268
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,370
my father's murder at this time

269
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,280
brings him no benefit whatsoever.

270
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,060
What did the officer say next?

271
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,520
8:30 PM.

272
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,400
I was planning to discuss with the master

273
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,120
about selling the blacksmith shop.

274
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,980
When I reached the master's room,

275
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,720
I saw the young mistress and Yue'er at the doorway.

276
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,040
Miss.

277
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,770
Uncle Zhang.

278
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,360
Why are you and Yue'er standing at the door

279
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,120
and not going in?

280
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,960
Has Father retired so early?

281
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,280
I've been knocking but no one answers,

282
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,010
and I can't force the door open.

283
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,920
Let me try.

284
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,640
Master.

285
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,240
Master.

286
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,080
Master, are you in there?

287
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,920
Master.

288
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,720
Master.

289
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,120
Someone come!

290
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,480
Someone come!

291
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,000
Liu Yang!

292
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,420
Open this door!

293
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,900
The master is injured.

294
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,410
Please go check his wounds.

295
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,120
Should I go report this to the authorities?

296
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,320
Yes, go quickly.

297
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
Be discreet. Don't let anyone know.

298
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,920
Miss,

299
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,280
please wait here.

300
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,930
I'll go in and check.

301
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,820
There might be intruders.

302
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,600
Master!

303
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,120
Master!

304
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,170
Uncle Zhang,

305
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,480
is my father alright?

306
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,960
Miss,

307
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,339
please wait outside the door.

308
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,000
Miss.
