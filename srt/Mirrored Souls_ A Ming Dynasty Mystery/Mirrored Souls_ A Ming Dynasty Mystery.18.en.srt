1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,560
At around 4:30 PM

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,530
there was no one left in the courtyard,

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,760
so I went to the master's room again.

4
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,880
I've lived in this mansion for 20 years,

5
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,480
yet I never knew there was a secret chamber in the master's room,

6
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,810
filled with treasures.

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,520
He must have been trying to get that universal antidote.

8
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,890
After I dragged him out,

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,330
I pressed his fingerprint on the deed.

10
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,280
This is not love.

11
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,039
Not love.

12
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,200
You're crazy too.

13
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,200
Ruoting.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,600
Let's talk to Officer Li later

15
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,900
about questioning Yue'er in the garden.

16
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,039
She's timid,

17
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,280
and in such an intimidating environment,

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,440
I'm afraid she won't be able to handle it.

19
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,120
Yue'er has grown up with me since childhood,

20
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,160
I know she's actually very fragile inside.

21
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,780
I think that's a good idea.

22
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,960
Miss

23
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,240
Yue'er.

24
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,810
Zhao Yue'er.

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,720
Let's begin.

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,040
Tell us everything you concealed today,

27
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,170
and anything else you might remember,

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,280
in complete detail.

29
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,079
When I was six,

30
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,960
for some unknown reason,

31
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,890
my brother suddenly disappeared.

32
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,440
Since then, I was all alone.

33
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,610
I could only wander around,

34
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,450
searching for food to survive.

35
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,680
While wandering,

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,680
nothing was more terrifying than

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,410
being caught by brothel thugs.

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,440
But I was also fortunate,

39
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,880
I met Master Zhao,

40
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,200
who bought me without hesitation.

41
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,320
I kept crying and thanking the master.

42
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,400
Back at the mansion,

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,320
I saw a little girl

44
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,000
who was about my age.

45
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,200
Since then,

46
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,440
we grew up together.

47
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,240
She also gave me a new name,

48
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,850
calling me Zhao Yue'er.

49
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,400
She taught me how to read and write.

50
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,000
I was deeply grateful to the young lady.

51
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,880
I've always been a light sleeper.

52
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,640
One night,

53
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,640
I faintly saw something.

54
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,060
There were tears glistening in his eyes.

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,240
I wondered

56
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,840
what could make the master so sorrowful.

57
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,360
I don't know how to comfort him

58
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,320
or how to handle this situation.

59
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,040
I know

60
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,900
the master isn't entirely a good person.

61
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,090
But when I heard him crying about his past,

62
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,140
I actually felt sorry for him.

63
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,200
Somehow I've developed some feelings for the master.

64
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,880
The master had a bit too much to drink

65
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,690
and couldn't stop talking.

66
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,640
Most importantly,

67
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,200
he expressed his affection for me.

68
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,480
I took his words to heart.

69
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,440
But I'm not sure

70
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,520
if it was just drunken nonsense.

71
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,720
Surprisingly, he brought it up again later

72
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,260
with absolute certainty.

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
He solemnly declared his sincerity

74
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,530
and asked me to consider it carefully.

75
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
I was happy inside.

76
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,920
But

77
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,100
I'm afraid of hurting the young lady.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Matters of the heart are always delicate and complex,

79
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,440
there's never an absolute right or wrong.

80
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,900
Even if you harbor regrets

81
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,770
they're hard to remedy.

82
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,360
Just keep those regrets in your heart

83
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,690
and let time eventually smooth them away.

84
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,160
All these years, I couldn't bear to throw away

85
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,120
the only thing that could prove

86
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,680
my true identity.

87
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,040
I just hope that someday

88
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,520
when I reunite with my brother,

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,040
I will definitely ask him

90
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,080
why he abandoned me back then.

91
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,560
But I don't resent him,

92
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,840
instead I pray that in this world

93
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,680
he finds peace and everything goes well for him.

94
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,820
When you were inside the room,

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,130
did you drink the tea Mr. Zhao offered?

96
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,320
Yes, I did.

97
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,760
I was so nervous at that time

98
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,480
and felt a tightness in my chest.

99
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,480
There was a small amount of sedative in that tea,

100
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,409
which is why you felt drowsy while hiding behind the bed.

101
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,840
Sedative?

102
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,340
It was Liu Yang.

103
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,320
We searched his room

104
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,490
and found the sedative powder.

105
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,160
Yue'er,

106
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,200
tell us about your relationship with Liu Yang.

107
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,600
When did you find out about your connection?

108
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,960
Did Liu Yang

109
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,530
say anything to you before he died?

110
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,210
After the questioning in the main hall

111
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,980
I had an argument with him.

112
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,720
I was really angry at that time

113
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,200
and demanded to know why he thought he could control me.

114
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,840
When I reached the woodshed

115
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,960
he pulled me inside.

116
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,560
Guard Liu,

117
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,860
what are you doing?

118
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,560
Don't be afraid, Yue'er,

119
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
I'm your brother.

120
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,890
It's your brother who has wronged you.

121
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
Back then I had no choice,

122
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,600
I was afraid of putting you in danger,

123
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,960
that's why I left you.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,720
I hope

125
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,240
you won't hold it against me.

126
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,490
How can you be sure I'm your sister?

127
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,840
After I left,

128
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,320
I kept asking about you.

129
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,760
Later I heard

130
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,120
you were bought by the Zhao household as a maid,

131
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,850
so I came here to work as a guard.

132
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,300
Don't cry, Yue'er.

133
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,200
Yue'er,

134
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,080
my dear sister.

135
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,240
Your brother has been so worried about you, missing you so much.

136
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
I really want to make up for the past.

137
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,050
It's all my fault

138
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,440
that you've suffered so much humiliation

139
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,970
and endured such hardship.

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,720
If we can get through

141
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,050
this situation safely,

142
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,160
I promise

143
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,120
to make up for everything I owe you.

144
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,760
What I'm about to tell you

145
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,840
you must remember

146
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,409
and never tell anyone unless your life depends on it.

147
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,450
Understand?

148
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,980
What do you want to tell me?

149
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,180
Yesterday,

150
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,210
I went to the master's room.

151
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,280
But he wasn't there.

152
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,520
Just as I was about to leave,

153
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,050
I ran into merchant Lei Lei.

154
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,880
I hid on the bed under the covers

155
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,000
and pretended to cough, imitating the master's voice.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,040
This Lei Lei is actually Wang Youshan,

157
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,000
the man who made me set fire

158
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,420
to a shop when I was a child.

159
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
I recognized him.

160
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,360
I suspect he recognized me too.

161
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,740
I didn't dare reveal anything during his questioning.

162
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,200
I have a feeling

163
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,060
something bad will happen today.

164
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,690
So I need to reveal myself to you now

165
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,320
and tell you

166
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,159
the real reason why I left back then.

167
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,320
My brother was likely killed by Lei Lei.

168
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,010
My brother also said

169
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,960
he was very angry when he found out the master wanted to marry me,

170
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,360
and talked about secretly buying arsenic.

171
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,040
Could the master have died from poison my brother gave him?

172
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,200
Master Zhao did indeed die of poisoning,

173
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
but it wasn't arsenic.

174
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,160
You don't need to blame yourself.

175
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,200
You've cooperated and told us

176
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,560
everything you know.

177
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,500
That's already very good.

178
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,920
Yue'er.

179
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,120
I have never

180
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,680
harbored any resentment toward you,

181
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,480
nor have I ever

182
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,340
looked down on you for any reason.

183
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,400
In my heart,

184
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,400
I've always held words of gratitude.

185
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,460
Thank you for always being by my side,

186
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,960
never letting me feel alone.

187
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,560
You've allowed me to bravely pursue

188
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,120
what I desire,

189
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,280
without a moment's hesitation or retreat.

190
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,880
Miss.

191
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,440
As long as you don't abandon me,

192
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,100
I will accompany you for life.

193
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,920
Wang Youshan.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,330
You're no longer pretending to be Lei Lei,

195
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,000
it's time you return to being yourself

196
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,580
and face the punishment you deserve.

197
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,200
Wang Youshan,

198
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,520
why did you disappear?

199
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,250
What terrible thing did you do?

200
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,360
Did you kill my mother?

201
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,280
Miss Zhao,

202
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,890
I never wanted things to turn out this way.

203
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,000
When I was a doctor, your father and I were very close friends,

204
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,440
as you well know.

205
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,090
It's just...

206
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,000
I met Wan Yi when I was 20,

207
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,730
and we became as close as brothers.

208
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,960
He trusted and admired me greatly.

209
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,060
I inherited my family's medical skills,

210
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,900
blessed with natural talent,

211
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,080
and was known as a miraculous doctor at that time.

212
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,760
Once,

213
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,680
I gathered with several friends

214
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,520
after several rounds of drinks.

215
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,800
My friends asked me to check their pulses

216
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,650
and inquire if they could achieve greatness.

217
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,460
It was on that occasion

218
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,440
that I discovered something unusual about Brother Wan Yi's health.

219
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,680
Due to his daily drinking and deep depression,

220
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,440
he had almost lost his ability to father children.

221
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,960
I never told him directly,

222
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,320
thinking that with his womanizing and drinking habits,

223
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,920
it might actually prevent him from causing trouble outside.

224
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,560
But when Wan Yi turned 25,

225
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,400
he surprisingly had a daughter.

226
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
I was extremely anxious and uneasy,

227
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,970
I had my suspicions.

228
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,240
But I didn't dare say anything to him,

229
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,280
because I couldn't remember

230
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,760
if I had accidentally mentioned

231
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,240
his infertility during one of our drunken conversations.

232
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,520
Although he never mentioned it,

233
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
I was deeply frightened.

234
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Because when he turned 30, he asked for my help.

235
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Brother Youshan,

236
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,640
tell me.

237
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,400
Why, despite giving everything I have,

238
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,520
can I never win her heart?

239
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,760
I've given her everything,

240
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,440
but in the end,

241
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,500
I received not a bit of love in return.

242
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,520
What am I doing wrong?

243
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,680
Please help me.

244
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,570
Help me, please.

245
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,860
Brother Wan Yi,

246
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,120
don't overthink this.

247
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,460
You've already done well enough,

248
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,680
you should believe in yourself.

249
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,600
Just wait patiently,

250
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,480
and you'll surely win her sincere affection.

251
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
Brother Youshan,

252
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,160
can you help me?

253
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,440
Help me burn down that fabric shop.

254
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,280
I really can't bear

255
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,120
to see her going there anymore.

256
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,960
I deliberately chose early morning to set the shop on fire,

257
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,120
but who would have thought that young lady

258
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,040
had spent the night in the shop.

259
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,960
From then on, Brother Wan Yi was devastated,

260
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,880
and we rarely met again.

261
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,280
Later, for various business matters,

262
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,760
he just had his servants handle everything.

263
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,280
Since then,

264
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,960
I've presented myself to the world as the merchant Lei Lei.

265
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,640
Only when facing certain people

266
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,080
do I appear as a doctor.

267
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,680
No one knows about my disguise,

268
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,400
as my merchant identity became increasingly busy.

269
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
I brought my only relative, Wang Er,

270
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,160
from Yingtian Prefecture

271
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,160
to manage the medicine shop.

272
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,540
Back then, when the shop was burned down,

273
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,020
the person you hired was Liu Yang, wasn't it?

274
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,600
Children playing carelessly and causing a fire

275
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,480
isn't a serious crime,

276
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,920
as long as no one insists on pursuing it,

277
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,520
the matter can be put to rest.

278
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,080
Later, I couldn't find that child,

279
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,280
so the matter was quietly covered up.

280
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,440
Then how did you know

281
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,280
that Liu Yang was that child from years ago?

282
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,280
At first, I didn't notice anything unusual.

283
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,960
Because of my close dealings with the Zhao household,

284
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,640
whenever there were new people or happenings there,

285
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,970
I would know about them.

286
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,200
So when I first met Liu Yang,

287
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,240
I intended to get on his good side,

288
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,880
thinking it might benefit me in the future.

289
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,180
Who would have thought

290
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,180
that from our first meeting, he harbored hostility toward me.

291
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,000
When I was discussing contract matters in the master's room.

292
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,360
You sent a child to burn down a shop,

293
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,320
don't you feel any guilt at all?

294
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,000
I became nervous immediately.

295
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,360
The master didn't know about my disguise skills.

296
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,200
I saw the edge of a garment sticking out from under the blanket,

297
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,600
it was the guard's outer robe.

298
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,920
I was terrified,

299
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,240
and fled in panic.

300
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,660
Later, I observed that

301
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,060
no one knew Liu Yang's true identity.

302
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,240
I had no choice but to let Wang Er know about

303
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,640
my disguise techniques.

304
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,320
He helped me kill him,

305
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,360
and then we framed the murderer.

306
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,880
Officer Li.

307
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,120
I truly know nothing about the master's death.

308
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,560
It really wasn't me,

309
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,480
it wasn't me.

310
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,320
Wang Youshan.

311
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,210
You cannot escape blame for Master Zhao's death,

312
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,120
it's clearly the result of your wicked collaboration.

313
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,880
You and that Zhang Shuyi,

314
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,200
how many more dirty deals have you made

315
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,460
to embezzle the Zhao family's property?

316
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,520
You even coerced Zhang Shuyi

317
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
to help you sign the deeds.

318
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,240
Wang Youshan, Wang Youshan.

319
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
Your greed

320
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,360
has grown to the extreme.

321
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,880
I was just forced by circumstances!

322
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,960
Have some shame!

323
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,680
Await your deserved punishment.

324
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,210
[You]

325
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,250
I, Ruoting, your daughter,

326
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,800
named after your wishes.

327
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,840
I hope to be gentle and kind,

328
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
and hold goodwill toward the world.

329
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,480
May everything in this life go smoothly,

330
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
and may my days be filled with light.

331
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,040
Mother,

332
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,600
thank you.

333
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,940
Even though you're not by my side,

334
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,680
the love you've given me

335
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,560
is like a bright lamp,

336
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,160
forever illuminating my path forward,

337
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,120
ensuring I'm never afraid.

338
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,760
Miss,

339
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,480
today's dessert

340
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,210
was newly created by Auntie Wu.

341
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,760
Everyone says it tastes absolutely delicious,

342
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,690
please try some.

343
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,400
Young mistress,

344
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,480
something terrible has happened!

345
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,200
Miss Situ suddenly passed away yesterday.
