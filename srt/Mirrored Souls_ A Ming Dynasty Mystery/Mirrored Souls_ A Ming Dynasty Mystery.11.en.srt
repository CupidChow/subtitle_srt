1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,450
I couldn't stand his tyranny anymore.

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,800
After he died, I hid his body

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,080
temporarily in a secret compartment inside the painting table.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,240
What about Qiluo, Fengling and Xiaomeng?

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,640
What did you do to them?

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,080
I was jealous of them.

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,240
Because

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,480
they were more favored by the nobles

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,100
and could earn more money.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,440
So I conspired with Lanxin

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,040
to pretend to befriend them.

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,160
We drugged their drinks

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,480
so they couldn't escape.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,000
Finally, we buried their bodies

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,480
under the ancient tree.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,980
I never thought Lanxin

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,960
would abandon me and escape on her own.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,050
Hanxiu, you're talking nonsense.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,800
Lanxin risked her life to escape

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,840
to expose the darkness of the painting house

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,440
and save you all from misery.

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,200
If she wanted to harm you,

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,800
why would she go to such lengths?

24
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,920
How could you say such cruel words?

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,200
Chu Bufan.

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,880
Where is Lan Xin now?

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,440
How would I know where Lan Xin is?

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,160
Han Xiu,

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,890
based on your confession, your crimes are numerous.

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,140
I will have you detained immediately

31
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,720
and pass judgment after a thorough investigation.

32
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
As for Lan Xin,

33
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,360
arrest her at once.

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,370
As for Lady Gu and the others, since they are no longer suspects,

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,759
they are free to go.

36
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,440
Sir,

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,979
how can you be so hasty?

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,920
This is absurd!

39
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,840
Chu Bufan,

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,440
are you trying to tell me how to do my job?

41
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,400
Take him away.

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,720
No!

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,400
Thank you, Your Honor, for your keen judgment.

44
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
Court dismissed!

45
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,520
This magistrate is a corrupt official.

46
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,160
The real culprit is clearly someone else,

47
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,440
yet he blindly believes Hanxiu's confession,

48
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,960
makes arbitrary judgments,

49
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,079
and even released villains like Ma Renyi and Madam Gu.

50
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,940
I even released villains like Ma Renyi and Madam Gu.

51
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,440
Brother Chu, don't rush.

52
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,800
Hanxiu suddenly confessing

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,660
that she committed all the crimes

54
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,440
must mean she's under some kind of coercion.

55
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,240
I suspect

56
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,210
Ma Renyi has leverage over her,

57
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,280
forcing her to do as he wishes.

58
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,920
Ma Renyi and Madam Gu

59
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,520
have been exchanging glances all along.

60
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,320
This must have been planned in advance.

61
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,400
Who knows where they are now,

62
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,000
celebrating their success.

63
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,610
Those girls died unjustly,

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,730
while they got away scot-free.

65
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,800
This Yanbo Art Studio is truly something else.

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,440
Brother Chu.

67
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,240
You're right.

68
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,920
Why don't we send some people

69
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,780
to scout around Yanbo Art Gallery

70
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,300
and see if they can find any useful clues.

71
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,520
You must be extremely careful

72
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,440
and look after your own safety

73
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,840
so you don't alert our targets.

74
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,640
That's right.

75
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,720
This matter has wide implications.

76
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,480
We still don't know

77
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,320
what Ma Renyi is really planning.

78
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,760
We must proceed with caution,

79
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,420
ensuring nothing goes wrong.

80
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,400
Ma Renyi.

81
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,810
Brother Lin.

82
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,880
You still haven't told me

83
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,680
who this Ma Renyi really is.

84
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,240
I can't disclose that information yet.

85
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,600
I see.

86
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,000
Once I confirm some more information,

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,260
I'll explain everything to you clearly.

88
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,120
His identity is somewhat special,

89
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,520
so we need to be cautious.

90
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
Trust me,

91
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,680
as soon as I have reliable information,

92
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,140
I'll definitely tell you.

93
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,000
Mr. Ma.

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,920
Thanks to your arrangements today,

95
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,640
otherwise I would have been ruined

96
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,170
by those two little girls, Lanxin and Hanxiu.

97
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,880
If you hadn't arrived in time today,

98
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:41,520
my Yanbo Painting House would have been finished.

99
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,520
However, our income these past two months has been quite substantial.

100
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,240
Worth celebrating.

101
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,440
You can rest assured.

102
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,800
Although Lanxin has left,

103
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,260
don't we still have Yurou?

104
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,970
But you'd better be more shrewd in the future,

105
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,900
discipline the others properly,

106
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,240
and don't let this kind of thing happen again,

107
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,800
understand?

108
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
You're right, Mr. Ma.

109
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,800
Now that we have Yurou,

110
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,370
we won't fear that little Hanxiu causing trouble again.

111
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,440
We'll keep the business booming,

112
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,360
and no one will dare touch us.

113
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,440
Fine wine.

114
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,040
And beautiful women.

115
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:49,880
Here, thank you, brother.

116
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,840
Take it slow.

117
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,400
Eat more.

118
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,280
Brother Chu,

119
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,740
careful, it's hot. Brother, I want some too.

120
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,880
I've gathered some information

121
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,140
that might be helpful.

122
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,280
There's a girl named Yurou at Yanbo Painting Studio

123
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,720
who is Hanxiu's younger sister,

124
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,980
and now she's missing.

125
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,400
Hanxiu probably took all the blame

126
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,720
because of her.

127
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,840
Also, before her death, Miss Fengling

128
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,080
was Ma Renyi's exclusive painter

129
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,450
and highly favored.

130
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,160
So that means

131
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,159
Ma Renyi might be holding Miss Yurou captive.

132
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,720
That night, Ma Renyi arrived last,

133
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,480
and it was Yurou painting at the scene,

134
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,400
not Hanxiu.

135
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,920
Which means

136
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,680
he had already coerced Hanxiu by then.

137
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,480
He promised to ensure Yurou's safe return

138
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,680
if Hanxiu would take the blame

139
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,960
for Madam Gu.

140
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,360
So when the people from the painting studio

141
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,440
were taken to the county office by officials

142
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,880
but were released without being charged,

143
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,160
Hanxiu already understood

144
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,200
Ma Renyi's influence.

145
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,400
When Hanxiu later

146
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,460
returned to the county office alone,

147
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,520
Ma Renyi was there

148
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,720
staring at her fiercely,

149
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,440
and she knew she had no choice.

150
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,480
For her sister's sake, she had to take the blame.

151
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,440
I believe this is exactly why

152
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,120
Madam Gu and Ma Renyi have such a deep connection.

153
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,720
The person behind Yanbo Painting Studio

154
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,880
must be Ma Renyi,

155
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,410
who controls the painters to extract wealth.

156
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,900
This Ma Renyi is quite something.

157
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,650
We need to find Miss Yurou quickly.

158
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,840
If she's still under the control

159
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,280
of Ma Renyi and Madam Gu,

160
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,159
Hanxiu will never be able to escape

161
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,360
their manipulation.

162
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,340
Brother Chu, you're here.

163
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,400
Miss Lanxin,

164
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,880
how are you feeling?

165
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,020
She's much better now.

166
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,440
I told you the young master was skilled.

167
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,000
Master Chu,

168
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,880
we truly appreciate your help in saving us.

169
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,680
Miss Lanxin,

170
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,040
I've come to tell you something.

171
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,820
Hanxiu has confessed.

172
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,410
She admitted that she's the murderer,

173
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,360
and she's also falsely accused you of conspiring with her.

174
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,160
Did Han Xiuzhen really say that?

175
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,810
Why would she falsely accuse me

176
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,700
and claim she's the murderer?

177
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,360
Perhaps she has no choice.

178
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,480
We found out her sister Yurou is missing

179
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,400
and it's very likely

180
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,600
she's being held by Ma Renyi and Mrs. Gu.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,330
Han Xiu must be confessing to those crimes

182
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,640
to protect her sister.

183
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Miss Lanxin,

184
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,520
I have one more question for you.

185
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,720
Do you know if there's any connection

186
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,120
between Ma Renyi, Mrs. Gu and Fengling?

187
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,360
That Ma Renyi,

188
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,280
you've never mentioned him before.

189
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,840
Fengling has been at the painting studio for a long time.

190
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,640
Mrs. Gu values Fengling greatly

191
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,010
and teaches her everything she knows.

192
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,080
She was the most talented

193
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,090
and versatile artist among us.

194
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,600
She was also the studio's star attraction.

195
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,930
Mr. Ma was also very fond of her.

196
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,080
His affection for her

197
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,650
was obvious to all of us.

198
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,640
Later,

199
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,880
Fengling left for about six months.

200
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,840
I heard that Mr. Ma

201
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,300
arranged for her to learn opera at a theater.

202
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,280
When she returned,

203
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,810
even more officials and nobles became her admirers.

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,480
Fengling often shared with us

205
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
what she had learned.

206
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,880
Our relationship grew closer.

207
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Then later,

208
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,480
she met a nobleman.

209
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,610
But the nobleman didn't dare to offend Mr. Ma.

210
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,080
When Master Ma found out

211
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,840
that Fengling wanted to leave,

212
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,840
he became furious.

213
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,280
What he hated most was betrayal,

214
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,960
so he had Fengling captured

215
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,490
and severed the tendons in her hands and feet.

216
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,160
Master Ma is a monster,

217
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,200
any Fengling would choose to leave him.

218
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,900
Fengling endured tremendous suffering

219
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,160
and died in anguish shortly after.

220
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,010
Madam Gu feared the news would spread,

221
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,080
so she secretly had someone take her body

222
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,010
and bury it under the ancient tree.

223
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,040
Actually, it wasn't just Fengling,

224
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,480
there were also Qiluo and Xiaomeng before her,

225
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,280
who suffered the same torture,

226
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,410
and their bodies were also hidden under the tree by Madam Gu.

227
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
Ma Renyi and Madam Gu,

228
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,680
these two are so cruel,

229
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,320
they've taken so many lives

230
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,120
yet they remain free from punishment.

231
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,880
I will definitely expose

232
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,180
their crimes to the world.

233
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,800
Hero Chu,

234
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
before I faked my death and escaped,

235
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,720
I tore out a page from the account book

236
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,780
in Madam Gu's room.

237
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,480
It contains evidence

238
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,360
of Madam Gu selling out the painter

239
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,760
in exchange for silver.

240
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,810
Where is this account book now?

241
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,880
I hid it in a piece of Suzhou embroidery.

242
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,120
That embroidery

243
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,920
was left to me by my mother when she died,

244
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,400
it means everything to me.

245
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,200
But when I sought refuge in the Ghost Market,

246
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,000
I had nothing else of value,

247
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,880
so I had to give that embroidery as a gift

248
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,760
to Mu Di.

249
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,120
To Mu Di.

250
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,010
The Ghost Market has a rule:

251
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,640
anyone seeking refuge there

252
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,900
must surrender something of great value

253
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,890
or something deeply personal.

254
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,040
That embroidery

255
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,080
was the only keepsake from my mother,

256
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,200
I didn't want to part with it,

257
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,380
but to gain entry to the Ghost Market,

258
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,840
I had no choice,

259
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,600
I had to give it to Mu Di.

260
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,760
Now trying to get it back

261
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,200
won't be easy.

262
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,560
These accounts are crucial evidence

263
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,760
to expose Mrs. Gu and Ma Renyi's crimes.

264
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,210
If we can retrieve them,

265
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,500
we can directly expose their crimes.

266
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,520
Don't worry,

267
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,920
I'll do everything in my power

268
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,450
to get that Suzhou embroidery back from Mu Di.

269
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,160
Hero Chu.

270
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,120
Please don't,

271
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,480
please get up.

272
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,690
On behalf of all my sisters,

273
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
I thank you for your great kindness.

274
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,760
We will pray for your blessings in the future.

275
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,440
The prayers won't be necessary.

276
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,560
Take good care of yourself.

277
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,560
Leave the rest to us,

278
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,520
we'll need you in court later.

279
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,400
Brother Chu.

280
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,120
Take me with you.

281
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
I've heard that place

282
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,400
has all kinds of strange and exotic things.

283
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,520
You think the Ghost Market is some kind of farmers' market?

284
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,960
That place is full of dangers,

285
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,160
it's no place for you.

286
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,240
Fine then.

287
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,080
You don't have to take me,

288
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,160
but make sure Brother Lin Feng goes with you,

289
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,090
it's always good to have someone watching your back.

290
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,400
Wait.

291
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,520
This coral pendant

292
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,720
was brought back by my father from the south,

293
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,920
it's quite valuable.

294
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,480
Since you're trying to get

295
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,920
the Su embroidery back from Mu Di,

296
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,480
you'll need something valuable

297
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,560
to trade with him for better negotiations,

298
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,090
and to show your sincerity.

299
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,000
If we can avoid using force,

300
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
we'll save ourselves some trouble.

301
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't need it.

302
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,040
Just take it.

303
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
If you don't need it,

304
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,400
you can return it to me later.

305
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,320
All right,

306
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,650
I'll take it for now.

307
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,000
If I don't need it,

308
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
I'll return it when I come back.

309
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,360
So it's settled then.

310
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,960
You must be extremely careful.

311
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,360
We'll wait for your news.

312
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,650
Brother Chu,

313
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,280
take two pills before entering the Ghost Market.

314
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,080
This will make you immune to all poisons

315
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,960
for two hours

316
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,690
and increase your power by 30%.

317
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,000
Such a good thing,

318
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,130
can I have some more?

319
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,810
Not a chance.

320
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,320
Only one pill left.

321
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,840
Chu Bufan,

322
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,400
you've got some nerve.

323
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Running away and daring to come back,

324
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,960
you're really asking for death.

325
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,760
Mu Di,

326
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,280
I came today

327
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,560
to take back Lanxin's Suzhou embroidery.

328
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,720
You think I'm a pushover,

329
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,850
that you can manipulate as you please?

330
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,360
This is the Ghost Market,

331
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,280
not a place for you to run wild.

332
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,240
No matter how powerful you are, Chu Bufan,

333
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,500
you have no right to order me around here.

334
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,880
Mu Di.

335
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,760
Then does the Imperial Guard have the authority?

336
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,940
So you're the Captain of the Imperial Guard.

337
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,840
I'm not doing anything

338
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,640
that threatens the imperial court.

339
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,000
Even the Imperial Guard

340
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,880
has no right

341
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
to do whatever they want in my place.

342
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,040
You're a smart man.

343
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,170
Since I've come here with Brother Chu,

344
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,200
it proves that the embroidery in your possession

345
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,040
isn't just a valuable item,

346
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,320
but is connected to a major case.

347
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,640
You're just a businessman in the underworld,

348
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,300
there's no need to get involved in a murder case.

349
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,530
Murder case?

350
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,500
You'd better not ask too much.

351
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,130
The less you know, the longer you'll live.

352
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,100
How about this.

353
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,700
I'll trade this for it.

354
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,920
This should be worth

355
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,040
a hundred times more than your embroidery.

356
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,970
A hundred times?

357
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,080
Are you kidding me?
