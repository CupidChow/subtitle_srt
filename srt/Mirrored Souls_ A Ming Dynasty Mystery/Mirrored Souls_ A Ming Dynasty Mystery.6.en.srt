1
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,560
Gentlemen,

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,280
are you looking to forge some ironware?

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,600
I am Lin Feng from the Divine Martial Guard,

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,000
ordered to investigate the case of Shi Jia,

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,320
and I request your full cooperation.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,240
Master Shi?

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,810
Investigation?

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,760
Officer Lin,

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,080
may I ask what exactly is going on?

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,000
When the incident happened,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,360
the officials only instructed us not to reveal his death,

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,220
and not to ask too many questions.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,120
Master Shi was just a blacksmith,

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,250
honest and dutiful,

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,800
how could he be involved in such a serious case?

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,960
May I ask who you are?

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,080
I am the head steward of the Zhao Wanyi household,

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,960
Zhang Shuyi.

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,440
This shop belongs to the Zhao estate,

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,200
and since Master Shi's incident,

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
I've been temporarily managing it.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,000
I see, Steward Zhang.

23
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,840
Then I'll be straightforward.

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,170
Shi Jia is not only involved in a homicide,

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,460
but also suspected of smuggling ore.

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,120
We came here

27
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,600
to investigate his daily activities

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,920
and see if there are any relevant clues.

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,600
Murder

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,120
and smuggling?

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,600
Officer Lin,

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,010
there must be some misunderstanding.

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,600
Shi Jia has worked here for over five years,

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,400
always honest and diligent,

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,259
extremely friendly to everyone,

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,560
and very responsible in his work,

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,289
nothing has ever gone missing in all these years.

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,780
Steward Zhang,

39
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,120
we also hope there's a misunderstanding,

40
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,000
but our investigation has led us here,

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,720
we need to learn more details,

42
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,440
please tell us more about

43
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,240
Shi Jia's daily activities.

44
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,360
Our Zhao household has many businesses,

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,220
Shi Jia is just the manager of this blacksmith shop.

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,440
He's normally friendly and clever,

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,640
and also a talented swordsmith.

48
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,760
Everyone who knows him

49
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,200
speaks highly of him.

50
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,600
We've never seen

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,330
any unusual behavior from him.

52
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,000
He rarely goes out and never takes time off.

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,440
All of the Zhao family's iron ore passes through his hands.

54
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,300
But there have never been any issues over the years.

55
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,280
Is all the iron ore

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,300
in the shop handled by Shi Jia?

57
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,079
He does have the opportunity

58
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,760
to access large quantities of iron ore.

59
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,440
Yes.

60
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,160
All the iron ore that's delivered

61
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,240
passes through his hands

62
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,079
before being forged into items and delivered to customers.

63
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,560
He's meticulous in his work,

64
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,620
keeps records of every item shipped,

65
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,040
and has never made any mistakes.

66
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,640
Does he always live in the shop?

67
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,920
He stays away from the shop two days each month.

68
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,560
The Zhao family has many properties,

69
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,440
and we provide all our managers

70
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,960
with their own separate accommodations.

71
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,880
Manager Zhang, please cooperate with our investigation.

72
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,360
Could you take us

73
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,680
to see the residence you just mentioned?

74
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,600
Of course.

75
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,610
I'll take you there.

76
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,420
Please follow me, both of you.

77
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,600
This is Shi Jia's room.

78
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,140
Why would a blacksmith's room

79
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,079
have so many drawings?

80
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,680
These weapons in the drawings

81
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,320
must be Shi Jia's own designs

82
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,420
that he sketched to preserve because he liked them.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,930
The craftsmanship in these drawings is remarkable.

84
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,010
Why is this painting

85
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,400
kept with these weapon diagrams?

86
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,800
Could she be Shi Jia's love interest?

87
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,240
I think I've seen her before.

88
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,680
You have?

89
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,720
I went to the Tongzhou theater a few days ago

90
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,920
and saw this woman performing on stage.

91
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,440
Her costume

92
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,920
was exactly the same as in this painting,

93
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,840
it must be her.

94
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,880
This woman and Shi Jia

95
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,600
must be connected somehow.

96
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Let's go to the theater and find out.

97
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,360
Thank you, Steward Zhang.

98
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,880
We'll take this painting with us.

99
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,880
If we need anything else

100
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,280
we might come back to you.

101
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,400
Let's go.

102
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,200
Hey, brother,

103
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,300
have you seen this person?

104
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,640
You upstairs,

105
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,530
do you know this man?

106
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,240
I've seen him,

107
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,560
but I don't know him.

108
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,680
No idea.

109
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,920
Every time I perform,

110
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,970
he comes and sits in that same spot,

111
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,400
but he never speaks to me.

112
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,400
Although he seems

113
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,840
quite mysterious,

114
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
he never did anything unusual.

115
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,520
However,

116
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,840
I haven't seen him

117
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,280
for almost two weeks now,

118
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,040
perhaps he left Tongzhou.

119
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,920
He won't be coming back anymore.

120
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,640
He won't return?

121
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,320
I was hoping to thank him.

122
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,330
Thank you, miss.

123
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,490
Wait for me here.

124
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,440
It's her.

125
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,290
It really is you,

126
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,560
Yin Qingmo.

127
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,380
Take them all away.

128
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,240
There's a secret in the painting.

129
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,840
The child has been poisoned,

130
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,900
we need to prepare this antidote.

131
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,640
This powder appears

132
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,250
to have been scraped off some kind of pill.

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,530
Ping'an has been poisoned.

134
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,680
How could Yin Qingmo allow this?

135
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,520
Why didn't she take better care of the child?

136
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,400
Ping'an is still so young.

137
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,600
Ping'an is such a good, sensible child,

138
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,920
how could she let him get poisoned?

139
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,520
Calm down.

140
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,360
Ping'an, my Ping'an.

141
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,040
Brother Lin,

142
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,370
please calm down first.

143
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,320
I have the antidote here,

144
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
I'll find a way to figure out the formula.

145
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,480
The most important thing now

146
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,600
is to first examine what secret

147
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,130
is hidden in this painting.

148
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,920
This painting doesn't show

149
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,780
anything unusual on the surface.

150
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,960
But the texture of this painting

151
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,080
seems a bit off.

152
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,600
The texture of this paper is different from ordinary paper,

153
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,330
it doesn't fully absorb water.

154
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,570
What do you mean?

155
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,960
Some ancient paintings

156
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,960
use double-layered paper to hide important content.

157
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,280
These papers look normal on the surface,

158
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,360
but with water or heat,

159
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,120
you can reveal what's hidden.

160
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,880
Heat it.

161
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,690
There is indeed a hidden layer.

162
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,640
These cunning bastards

163
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,200
hid it so well.

164
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,920
These all look like residential courtyards,

165
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,400
definitely hard to detect.

166
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,560
These dark spots,

167
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
looking at the surroundings,

168
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,020
are difficult to analyze.

169
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,240
We still can't determine

170
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,640
which location actually contains the ore.

171
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,680
If we can't be sure, let's have all locations watched closely,

172
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,540
not even a fly should get through.

173
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,610
They'll definitely leave traces.

174
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,560
We must win a decisive victory this time.

175
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,280
But we still can't determine

176
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,010
which location their real goods are coming from.

177
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
We've already fallen for

178
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
their diversionary tactics twice.

179
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,610
I'll go find Li Qiang to gather people.

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,320
I have some men available,

181
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,280
let's split up.

182
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,520
I'll arrange for people to scout first,

183
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,480
to check the activity at these locations.

184
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,080
Let's meet at Ji'an Porridge Shop in two hours.

185
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
I have failed you,

186
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,930
Chu Bufan has stolen the painting.

187
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,120
It's that Chu Bufan again.

188
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,640
Where did this freak come from,

189
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,020
ruining my plans time after time?

190
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,040
It's absolutely ridiculous.

191
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,680
Since things have come to this point,

192
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,540
to avoid further complications,

193
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,920
we'll have to move ahead of schedule.

194
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,460
Listen carefully.

195
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,920
This time we must split up.

196
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,530
Search this courtyard.

197
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,520
You, search this courtyard.

198
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,160
Forget it.

199
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,440
I'm going.

200
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,440
Remember,

201
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,440
as soon as they open the door,

202
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,920
try to see clearly

203
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,480
what items are inside,

204
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,340
who's in there,

205
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,800
understand?

206
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,800
Don't worry,

207
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,680
leave it to us.

208
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,680
Be careful.

209
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,530
Shopkeeper!

210
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,800
Sir,

211
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,660
what medicinal herbs do you need?

212
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,640
I urgently need to find an antidote formula.

213
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,700
This is a sample. Could you take a look

214
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,970
and identify its ingredients?

215
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,920
This powder has a strange smell,

216
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,920
somewhat familiar yet different.

217
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,680
It's quite peculiar.

218
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,850
I'm afraid I can't help you.

219
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,160
Please think again.

220
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,360
My family member is critically ill,

221
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,440
time is running out.

222
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,000
I've already asked many pharmacies,

223
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,280
and they all say the same as you -

224
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,400
it seems familiar but they can't quite place it.

225
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,080
Sir,

226
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,560
I'm truly sorry,

227
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
our pharmacy only stocks

228
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,400
common medicinal herbs.

229
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,640
For such an unusual formula,

230
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,720
I simply have no experience with it.

231
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
You might try finding traveling physicians.

232
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,760
They have broader knowledge

233
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,880
and might find some clues for you.

234
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,400
All right, thank you.

235
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,000
Master Chu!

236
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,000
Miss Ruoting.

237
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,650
What are you doing here?

238
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,720
I urgently need to find the formula for this antidote,

239
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,000
but I've asked many pharmacies

240
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,240
and none have any leads.

241
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,200
Has someone been poisoned?

242
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,080
Let me see.

243
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,320
This powder does have a peculiar smell.

244
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,080
However, I know someone who's an expert in pharmacology.

245
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,480
Perhaps I can help you find the antidote formula.

246
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,680
Thank you, Miss Ruoting.

247
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,520
Thank you.

248
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,920
This medicine is quite complex.

249
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,280
It contains Paris polyphylla

250
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,010
and other extremely rare herbs

251
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,960
used to expel insect venom.

252
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,040
Ordinary pharmacies

253
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,600
simply cannot produce such an antidote.

254
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,360
I see.

255
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,440
The Golden Knife Clan's methods are vicious

256
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,560
and appalling.

257
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,680
They made Luo Qiuming and Shi Jia ingest

258
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,610
the eggs of poisonous centipedes,

259
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,720
then used drugs that keep the insects dormant

260
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,650
to control them.

261
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,240
Now they're using such cruel methods

262
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,640
to control a child,

263
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,560
it's absolutely unforgivable.

264
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,280
Master Ling,

265
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,720
please do your best

266
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,400
to prepare the antidote quickly.

267
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,960
Though this is challenging,

268
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,200
there's still hope.

269
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,440
I believe I can not only create an antidote,

270
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,480
but also develop an advanced formula

271
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,080
to completely kill the poison insects inside.

272
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,640
This will allow the victims

273
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,370
to be completely free from the insects' control.

274
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,240
Have some tea.

275
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,320
I knew you were the best, Master.

276
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,730
Wait for me for two days,

277
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,610
and I'll provide the antidote.

278
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,440
By the way, Brother Chu,

279
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,800
how did you and Ruoting meet?

280
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,840
Miss Zhao and I...

281
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,680
thanks to her help,

282
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,010
otherwise I wouldn't be seeing you today.

283
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,240
That's such an exaggeration,

284
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,700
it's not even believable.

285
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,400
It's true.

286
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,490
I believe it,

287
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,760
I really do.

288
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Master,

289
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,120
you're teasing me.

290
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,320
How could I?

291
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,040
Ruoting has always been kind-hearted,

292
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,200
and being a righteous hero is her dream.

293
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,400
The people she values

294
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,800
must surely be people of honor and loyalty.

295
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,360
Our people went to these suspicious compounds

296
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,240
and checked them all out.

297
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,920
One of the compounds

298
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,280
looks completely empty,

299
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,210
with only guards watching over it.

300
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,480
These two compounds are particularly suspicious,

301
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,440
they have concealment structures

302
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,420
and signs of vehicle traffic.

303
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,280
It's very likely

304
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,080
that's where they're transporting the minerals.

305
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,760
Li Haifeng is extremely cunning.

306
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,920
These two locations

307
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,370
must be hiding something suspicious.

308
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,320
You go to this location,

309
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,400
as for the other one,

310
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,920
I'll discuss with Lin Feng shortly

311
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,120
and have him go there.

312
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
You should go now.

313
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,650
Brother Lin.

314
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,300
Haven't eaten yet,

315
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
have a bite first.

316
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,840
Tonight we

317
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,480
won't have time to eat or sleep.

318
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,680
I can't eat anything.

319
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,880
I've already arranged for Li Qiang

320
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,140
to stand by over there.

321
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,690
What have you found out?

322
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,280
I've got all the information.

323
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,960
Look,

324
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,760
I've found two most suspicious locations.

325
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,240
I'll go to this one,

326
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,480
you take this one.

327
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,840
As for the other compounds,

328
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,440
have Li Qiang take some men to search them

329
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,080
and bring everyone back for questioning.

330
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,440
Good, no problem.

331
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,250
Brother Chu.

332
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,000
Don't worry,

333
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,800
the mystic healer has promised to prepare the antidote.

334
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,600
Trust me,

335
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,340
Ping'an will safely return to your side.

336
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,160
Thank you, Brother Chu.

337
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,890
Brother Lin.

338
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,580
I'll repay this great kindness someday.

339
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,820
No need for such formalities.

340
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,360
But you've said it twice now,

341
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,280
so you owe me twice,

342
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,740
and I'm keeping count.

343
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,880
A gentleman's word is his bond.

344
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,000
As long as it's nothing illegal,

345
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,120
if you're ever in trouble,

346
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,320
I will do everything in my power to help.

347
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,040
Damn it!

348
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,800
Lin Feng is in danger.

349
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,280
Quick, split up!

350
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,200
Make it fast.

351
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,920
I sent Xiao Qi to follow Lin Feng.

352
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,680
Xiao Wu is at the corner.

353
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,920
I'll have him check

354
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,080
which car Lin Feng gets into,

355
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,340
then I'll let you know.

356
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,440
Let's go.

357
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,360
Damn it,

358
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,840
that cunning Li Haifeng!
