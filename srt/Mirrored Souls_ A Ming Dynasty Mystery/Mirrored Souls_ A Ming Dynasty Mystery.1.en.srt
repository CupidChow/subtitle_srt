1
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,360
Luo Qiuming,

2
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,320
surrender quietly,

3
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,120
you can't escape.

4
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,600
I'll kill all you lackeys.

5
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,640
How dare you act so recklessly before the Imperial Guards

6
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,520
without knowing your own limits.

7
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,440
Capturing me is useless.

8
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,720
I won't say a single word.

9
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,520
Centipede!

10
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,039
How could such a thing come out of his mouth?

11
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,080
Could it be poison craft?

12
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,640
Luo Qiuming!

13
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,650
Luo Qiuming!

14
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,160
Wake up!

15
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,120
He's dead.

16
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,800
We've lost our lead on the iron ore case.

17
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,039
Luo Qiuming's death is mysterious.

18
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,330
Someone powerful must be behind this.

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,880
We must proceed with caution.

20
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,280
What should we do now?

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,720
Investigate where he went before his death

22
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,320
and then make further plans.

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,200
Take his body back to the Imperial Guards

24
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,000
and have the coroner examine it.

25
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,880
Just as I thought.

26
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,400
Master Liu,

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,200
have you found anything?

28
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,079
Luo Qiuming did indeed die from poisoning,

29
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,440
and not from ordinary poison.

30
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,040
His internal organs were eaten by venomous insects

31
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,840
and rotted beyond recognition.

32
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,320
Such a manner of death

33
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,800
is extremely rare.

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,680
Venomous insects...

35
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,520
Could it really be the legendary Gu poison?

36
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,560
Gu poison?

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,940
It's rumored that it uses venomous insects to control people's minds

38
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,880
and manipulate life and death.

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,400
For many years,

40
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,080
despite various rumors,

41
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,760
there has never been concrete evidence

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,960
confirming the existence of Gu poison.

43
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,570
I dare not make hasty conclusions.

44
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,000
These rumors are often difficult to verify.

45
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,880
But Luo Qiuming's death is too strange.

46
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,530
If not for Gu poison,

47
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,800
it's hard to explain

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,640
why he coughed up a centipede before dying.

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,480
Master Liu,

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,460
continue examining the body.

51
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,380
Notify me immediately if you find anything new.

52
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,300
Boss, I'd like a bowl of porridge.

53
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,040
Sir,

54
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,720
we're out of porridge today.

55
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,250
Please come back tomorrow.

56
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,570
We're closed for today.

57
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,640
Xiao An!

58
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,600
Looking good!

59
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,920
Very nice!

60
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,020
Why so emotional, young lady?

61
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,940
You must have missed us terribly.

62
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,400
Why don't you prepare some food and drinks?

63
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,640
Brother Chu, Brother Liang,

64
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,520
I've really missed you both!

65
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,040
Although we've been exchanging letters,

66
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,159
it's been six long years since we last met.

67
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,920
When you said you were coming to Shuntian Prefecture

68
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,400
and could stay here in Tongzhou for a while,

69
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,920
I was absolutely thrilled!

70
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,720
I've been waiting for you every day.

71
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,520
Hurry!

72
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,160
Let's pack up and go home.

73
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,120
I've missed you so much.

74
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,400
Officer Lin.

75
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,980
Don't forget to take these clothes home.

76
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,240
Your wife always washes them so clean for you.

77
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,500
She's truly virtuous.

78
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,200
Your wife will have to trouble herself again

79
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
washing these clothes

80
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,720
that you've never worn.

81
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,160
But your clothes don't have any wear and tear at all.

82
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,360
Hasn't your wife ever asked about that?

83
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,280
How about this?

84
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,360
Next time when you wear them,

85
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,440
I'll patch them up a bit.

86
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,960
It'll look more authentic.

87
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,560
Getting clever, aren't you?

88
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,850
Take care, Officer Lin.

89
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,120
My dear.

90
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,860
My husband is back.

91
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,800
Why do you always get your uniform so dirty?

92
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,600
It's inevitable when I'm out working.

93
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Thank you for your trouble, my dear.

94
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,880
Daddy's home!

95
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
My little rascal.

96
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,600
Look what Daddy brought you.

97
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,120
A pinwheel!

98
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,380
This is for you.

99
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,000
Do you like it?

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,720
I love it!

101
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,800
Daddy,

102
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,960
I want you to play horsey with me.

103
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,880
Alright, let's play horsey.

104
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,680
Here we go!

105
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,520
Be careful not to drop the child.

106
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,720
Don't worry, my dear.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,040
You two play for now.

108
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,640
I'll tidy up and serve dinner soon.

109
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,770
After dinner, I'll wash your uniform.

110
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,140
Thank you for your hard work, my dear.

111
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,720
You guys!

112
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,360
I suggested cooking some fish,

113
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,960
but you insisted it was too much trouble.

114
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,820
It's rare for you to visit me here.

115
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,120
Though my porridge shop is small

116
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,320
and I don't earn much,

117
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,920
at least let me serve you something nice

118
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,180
to treat you properly.

119
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Just look at this.

120
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,720
Ji'an.

121
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
We're brothers.

122
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,600
What we eat doesn't matter.

123
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,260
What matters is this rare chance to be together.

124
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,640
Your porridge

125
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,500
tastes better than all those fancy meals out there.

126
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,680
That's true.

127
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,360
Years from now,

128
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
if we can still enjoy your porridge,

129
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,480
we'll be content.

130
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,480
Besides, look at Brother Chu and me,

131
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,940
we're strong and healthy.

132
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,820
But look at you.

133
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,810
You really need to eat more.

134
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,680
The hard times are behind us.

135
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,850
Cherish the present

136
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,720
and take better care of yourself.

137
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,240
We still have much to do in the future.

138
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,560
I understand, Brother Chu.

139
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,480
As for me,

140
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,320
I eat plenty but my digestion is poor.

141
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,930
You're joking again, brother.

142
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,760
Eat up.

143
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,880
Eat.

144
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,240
By the way, Brother Chu,

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,320
in your last letter you mentioned

146
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,040
asking me to find you

147
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,000
a good blacksmith in Tongzhou who makes quality swords.

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,680
I found out

149
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,720
there's a master named Shi Jia in Tongzhou

150
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,920
with exceptional skills.

151
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,400
Many people seek him out for his swordmaking.

152
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,360
I know this person.

153
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,090
He really is quite remarkable.

154
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,220
Is there anyone in the martial world you don't know?

155
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,060
Tomorrow I'll stay at the porridge shop.

156
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,840
Make yourselves comfortable

157
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,120
in my humble home.

158
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
If you need anything,

159
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,000
come find me at the porridge shop anytime.

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,480
Tongzhou isn't too big or small,

161
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,440
and I can usually

162
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,760
get information about what's happening around here.

163
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,280
Come to my shop for breakfast tomorrow,

164
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
I'll have everything ready for you.

165
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,040
Is your porridge shop still doing charity work every month?

166
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,120
On the 1st and 15th,

167
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
we give out free porridge on the 15th of each month.

168
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,490
On the 1st, I visit the children at the charity house.

169
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,540
I have some vegetables there too.

170
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,680
Their charity house

171
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,360
is different from what we had back then.

172
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,800
No one officially manages it.

173
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Some of us

174
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,400
offer help from time to time.

175
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,320
These children are quite self-reliant.

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,360
They beg during the day

177
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,520
and do odd jobs as well.

178
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,410
They look after each other too.

179
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,400
Though it breaks my heart to see them like this,

180
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
it's somewhat reassuring how they manage.

181
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,680
Here's the last dish.

182
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,960
Come.

183
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,120
Eat up.

184
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,220
Please, help yourselves.

185
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,960
Steaming hot buns.

186
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,560
Come see the buns,

187
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,000
madam, please take a look inside,

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,400
we have both vegetarian and meat fillings.

189
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,240
Sir.

190
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,680
We've discovered that before his death, Luo Qiuming

191
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,000
visited one final place,

192
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,360
this blacksmith shop.

193
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,120
The owner, Shi Jia,

194
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,980
is a craftsman known far and wide.

195
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,520
He's unlikely to be a spy.

196
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,700
Luo Qiuming wouldn't have visited Shi Jia without reason.

197
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,420
Perhaps as you suggested,

198
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,880
he just came to have suitable weapons made.

199
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,240
But running a blacksmith shop requires iron ore.

200
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,640
Since Luo Qiuming has been here,

201
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,440
we need to investigate thoroughly.

202
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,640
Don't miss anything,

203
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,300
but don't alert our suspects.

204
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,540
Take care, customer. Please come again!

205
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,560
This Shi Jia has such a fierce look,

206
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,080
I'm afraid there might really be something suspicious about him.

207
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,640
Don't judge a book by its cover,

208
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,440
seeing isn't always believing.

209
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,640
Stay alert

210
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,800
and look for any other clues.

211
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,720
Master Shi.

212
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Go in and look around first,

213
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,860
I'll join you shortly.

214
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,130
You have an excellent eye, sir!

215
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,280
This is the finest weapon

216
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,800
I've forged in all these years,

217
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,360
with a blade as sharp as frost.

218
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,440
If you truly like it,

219
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,520
then it has found a worthy owner

220
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,410
and will never disappoint you.

221
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,560
It is indeed excellent,

222
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,920
fits my hand perfectly, and I like it very much.

223
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,720
I will put this sword to good use.

224
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
However, I came seeking you today

225
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,210
to commission a custom weapon.

226
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,220
I have the design here,

227
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,680
take a look.

228
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,280
Being new here,

229
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,880
I don't know who's good or bad,

230
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,140
better not to bring trouble upon myself.

231
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Finders keepers.

232
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,160
Are you crazy?

233
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,760
I have no grudge against you.

234
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,160
I won't report you.

235
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,680
Let's just go our separate ways.

236
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,770
Something's happened.

237
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,580
Don't move.

238
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,920
I'm just here to practice swordsmanship.

239
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,920
What are you doing?

240
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,120
I suspect you're an accomplice of the criminal.

241
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,280
You can explain yourself in jail.

242
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,400
No.

243
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,800
It's a misunderstanding.

244
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,480
Don't move.

245
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,120
Sir.

246
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,330
Go check on Shi Jia quickly.

247
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,720
Sir.

248
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,880
Wasn't he already dead?

249
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,080
How can he still move?

250
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,450
Has he come back to life?

251
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,930
That's impossible.

252
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,800
Dead people don't come back to life.

253
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,040
Then he must be a walking corpse.

254
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,210
Centipedes.

255
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,360
Centipedes again.

256
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,680
What the hell is this?

257
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,800
This looks exactly like the poison in Luo Qiuming.

258
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,760
Poison?

259
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,000
You Imperial Guards actually believe in such things?

260
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,460
This is neither a walking corpse nor poison.

261
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,450
Inside this blacksmith's body...

262
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,180
There are venomous insects eating away.

263
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,850
Although he's dead,

264
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,400
his nerves are being bitten by the poisonous insects,

265
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,720
causing reactions.

266
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,440
These nerves, for a short period,

267
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,280
can still stimulate muscle responses,

268
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,940
causing the body to convulse.

269
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,400
That's what just happened.

270
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,060
How do you know so much?

271
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,130
Who exactly are you?

272
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,940
How do you know about our Imperial Guard?

273
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,170
The Imperial Guard is well-known.

274
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,840
You're all elite forces of the imperial court.

275
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,920
Tasked with protecting Tongzhou, defending against enemies

276
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,380
and handling rebellions.

277
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,640
I observed your uniforms

278
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,540
and deduced your identities.

279
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,480
You must be at the rank of Zongqi, right?

280
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,720
I am Chu Bufan, a wanderer.

281
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,400
I just arrived in Tongzhou yesterday.

282
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,600
Please look after me.

283
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,900
Look after you?

284
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,890
I can certainly do that.

285
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,680
Chu Bufan.

286
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,680
I've heard your name before.

287
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,010
But I don't care how famous you are.

288
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
If I find out

289
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,040
you've done something heinous,

290
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,600
I will not let you go.

291
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,160
What heinous thing have I done?

292
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,920
I didn't kill anyone,

293
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,500
and I didn't feed anyone insects.
