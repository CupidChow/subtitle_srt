1
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,600
I just ran to the door and peeked through the crack

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,060
when I saw someone coming.

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,960
I used to be an assistant at a pharmacy.

4
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,240
I'm certain that was real blood on the floor.

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,400
I was really scared.

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,480
After a while,

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,880
I felt like they had all left.

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,440
So I quickly came out.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,040
Is that really all?

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,890
Think carefully again.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,120
Did you hear nothing at all while you were in there?

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,240
I... I...

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,800
I did hear something,

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,640
but I was too scared at the time,

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,000
so I couldn't hear clearly.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,460
I didn't dare make a sound,

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,920
afraid of being discovered.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,600
Wang Er.

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,650
I told you not to hide anything.

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,760
Otherwise, there will be severe punishment.

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,960
I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare.

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,360
Every word I've said is the absolute truth.

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,160
Alright.

24
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
You may leave now.

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,680
This Wang Er,

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,039
he seems timid,

27
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:28,480
but I feel he's not being completely honest.

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,400
And he's even become infatuated with Miss Zhao's beauty,

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,680
how absurd.

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,400
Is this really his first time meeting the young lady?

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,680
I truly have no recollection of him.

32
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,680
But he doesn't have

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,280
any motive to kill my father.

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,039
According to his testimony,

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,400
he indeed has no grudge against the master

36
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,610
and no motive for the crime.

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,900
Bring Lei Lei in first.

38
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,200
This morning, I was chatting with Head Steward Zhang

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,920
in the main hall for a while,

40
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,560
when he was called away by a servant.

41
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,690
So he sent the head guard over instead.

42
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,639
This head guard,

43
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,080
he just stared at me as soon as he came in,

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,740
looking quite intimidating.

45
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,160
I quickly greeted him

46
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,930
and even complimented him.

47
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,000
So you're the one who recently joined the Zhao household,

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,320
the highly skilled and reliable

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,079
Head Guard Liu Yang.

50
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,640
Meeting you today, I see your reputation is well-deserved.

51
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,520
Looking at your dignified appearance,

52
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,079
you must be a man of great character

53
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:44,079
and a true hero who values loyalty.

54
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,960
He didn't react at all,

55
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,280
but I could feel

56
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,400
from his demeanor

57
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,320
that he was full of hostility toward me.

58
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,480
Don't you think that's strange?

59
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,560
Later, the steward brought in another person,

60
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,320
the one who was just here,

61
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,880
called something Er,

62
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,400
Wang Er.

63
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,440
Said he was some distant relative of his.

64
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,280
Can you believe I spent the whole morning

65
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,810
without seeing the master,

66
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,400
and my right eyelid

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,860
kept twitching non-stop?

68
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,530
I was thinking to myself

69
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,440
that perhaps this contract signing

70
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,200
wouldn't go as smoothly as planned.

71
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,600
You know how difficult it is

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,720
for us small businessmen,

73
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,360
right?

74
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,240
Later we had lunch together,

75
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,800
and nothing unusual happened during the meal.

76
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,560
That guard, Liu Yang,

77
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,360
kept staring at the young mistress's maid.

78
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,600
And that Wang Er

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,960
kept staring at the young mistress herself.

80
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,680
Whether there's something between them,

81
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,079
I really couldn't say.

82
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,520
Then afternoon came,

83
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,820
and I was getting really anxious.

84
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,840
You see, the head steward

85
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,480
kept ignoring my requests about signing the contract.

86
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,360
I just wanted to see the master

87
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,080
and discuss it in person.

88
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,880
So I kept waiting in the main hall,

89
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,920
and as luck would have it,

90
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,320
the young mistress passed by.

91
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,850
I quickly called out to her.

92
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,839
Miss,

93
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,600
Miss,

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,200
is the master awake?

95
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,440
You may go.

96
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,520
Thank you.

97
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,480
I was naturally very happy,

98
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,080
so I hurried over right away.

99
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,360
Mr. Zhao,

100
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,440
are you feeling better?

101
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:40,880
Mr. Zhao,

102
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,720
it's me, Lei Lei.

103
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,760
You left without seeing the master.

104
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,880
Indeed.

105
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,680
Lei Lei, please wait outside

106
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,400
for further instructions.

107
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,280
Yes, sir.

108
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,000
Now only Zhang Bo and Liu Yang remain.

109
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,280
Zhang Bo has been in the Zhao household since I was a child,

110
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,610
if I were to suspect him,

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,060
I truly wouldn't know where to begin.

112
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,360
As for Liu Yang,

113
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,760
it sounds rather strange.

114
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,580
Could it be that

115
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,640
he was in love with Yue'er,

116
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,700
and that's why he murdered my father?

117
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,040
But if that's true,

118
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,500
it means Yue'er didn't love him back,

119
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,480
otherwise they could have just run away together.

120
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,840
Could Yue'er and my father...

121
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,400
Based on what we've documented so far,

122
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,640
Liu Yang definitely requires our close attention.

123
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,600
As for Wang Er,

124
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,520
I also find

125
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,040
several suspicious points about him.

126
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,360
This Wang Er

127
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,320
isn't telling the truth.

128
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,800
And this Lei Lei

129
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,960
is hiding something.

130
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,440
Regarding Lei Lei's suspicious behavior,

131
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,120
we need to question the butler about it.

132
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,120
Miss Zhao,

133
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,400
remember not to discuss this with anyone,

134
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,680
and don't let personal feelings cloud your judgment.

135
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,640
This matter concerns not only the reputation of the Zhao family,

136
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,960
but also involves numerous business affairs

137
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,760
throughout Tongzhou district.

138
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,140
Please cooperate fully with our official investigation.

139
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,240
Officer Li,

140
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,520
rest assured.

141
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,900
I want to know who the killer is even more than you do.

142
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,960
To me,

143
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,480
he was my father,

144
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,480
the most sacred family bond.

145
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,370
His life experiences and past stories

146
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,980
are beyond my power to change.

147
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,320
I only wish to do my duty properly, nothing more.

148
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,480
Liu Yang.

149
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,000
You've been at the Zhao mansion for over three months now, right?

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,120
Yes, sir.

151
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,560
Why did you come to work as a guard at the Zhao mansion?

152
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,360
Over the years, I've learned some skills

153
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,680
and happened to see the Zhao family was hiring guards.

154
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,800
The pay was better,

155
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,160
and I thought I could settle down a bit,

156
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,760
didn't want to keep wandering around anymore,

157
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,880
so I decided to give it a try.

158
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,340
You said you're an orphan.

159
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,160
Don't you have any other relatives?

160
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,330
When I was seven,

161
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,920
my parents died in an accident.

162
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,560
Since then, I've been all alone,

163
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,820
surviving by begging,

164
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,760
life was extremely hard,

165
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,600
never knowing when I'd eat next.

166
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,000
Later, when I got older,

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,400
I was finally able to take on some short-term jobs,

168
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,200
and things gradually improved.

169
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,300
Since coming to the Zhao mansion,

170
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,200
who have you become close with?

171
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,690
I'm rather solitary by nature,

172
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,920
and prefer to keep to myself.

173
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,960
Usually just Steward Zhang,

174
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,930
and Auntie Wu from the kitchen.

175
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,880
She's like a mother,

176
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,940
treats all us servants very well.

177
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,450
And there's Yue'er,

178
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,520
we often run into each other,

179
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,480
she's nice too.

180
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,560
Tell me about the day of the incident.

181
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,440
What did you see?

182
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
What did you do?

183
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,520
I am Lei Lei,

184
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,000
a mineral merchant from Xuanfu,

185
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,010
I came today to discuss business with the master.

186
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,240
When I heard this man's voice

187
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,400
and his tone,

188
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,120
I felt extremely uncomfortable.

189
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,450
I disliked him from the bottom of my heart.

190
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,400
I always felt like this person

191
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,850
was hiding something strange,

192
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,620
but I couldn't put my finger on it.

193
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,320
I might have encountered him during my travels,

194
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,780
met him somewhere before,

195
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,920
but I can't remember where exactly,

196
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,540
or what happened then.

197
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,680
I'm really wracking my brain now,

198
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,140
but I just can't remember.

199
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,920
To be honest,

200
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,720
I found him very fake,

201
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,320
and doubted that his business

202
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,050
with the master would succeed.

203
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,040
After a while, Steward Zhang

204
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,760
brought back a young man,

205
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,520
and Yue'er came to the hall with a box of pastries.

206
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,320
After Yue'er whispered a few words to the steward,

207
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,330
Steward Zhang told everyone to wait for the meal.

208
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,040
I felt Lei Lei had bad intentions,

209
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,920
so I wanted to warn the master.

210
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,600
Just outside the steward's room,

211
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,800
I ran into Steward Zhang,

212
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,400
who asked why I had come to the inner courtyard.

213
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,770
Where are you going?

214
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,760
Mr. Zhang,

215
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,320
I-I need to see the master about something,

216
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,890
would that be possible?

217
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,700
I'm heading there myself,

218
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,760
let's go.

219
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,240
Master.

220
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,040
Master.

221
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,800
The master is probably still asleep,

222
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,320
but he should be waking up soon.

223
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,320
Wait here,

224
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,570
I'll go get the master's medicine.

225
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,400
About

226
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,730
fifteen minutes later,

227
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,240
Butler Zhang returned,

228
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,000
but there was still no response to his knocking.

229
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,260
The butler gestured for me to pry open the door with a knife.

230
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,720
After we entered,

231
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,480
the master was nowhere in the room,

232
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,740
and there were some fragments by the bed.

233
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,010
Butler Zhang was also stunned.

234
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,280
He said to me:

235
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,210
The master might have gone out.

236
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,840
Wait here while I go look for him.

237
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,060
The master wasn't in the room,

238
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,280
yet the door was bolted from inside.

239
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,720
This matter was too strange and suspicious.

240
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,920
Standing in the room,

241
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,700
I felt a chill run straight down my spine.

242
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,100
A bone-chilling feeling.

243
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,130
I dared not stay longer,

244
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,690
so I quickly closed the door

245
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,040
and left.

246
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,880
When did you leave?

247
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,400
Around 3 p.m.

248
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,120
And when did you meet Butler Zhang?

249
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,000
About a quarter past 1 p.m.

250
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,480
Alright, you may go now.

251
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,360
Do not discuss this with anyone else.

252
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,400
Yes, sir.

253
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,680
Officer Li,

254
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,620
is there something wrong?

255
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,840
He and the butler couldn't open the door

256
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,330
because Wang Er had locked it from inside.

257
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,640
After that, they left.

258
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,560
After they left,

259
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,620
Wang Er came out from the wardrobe

260
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,160
and left as well.

261
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,920
After they all left, Yue'er left too.

262
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,800
However, the time between these events

263
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,920
wasn't as brief as they claimed.

264
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,280
It seems that in this room,

265
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,600
other things must have happened.

266
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Between them,

267
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,780
there seems to be something they're all hiding.

268
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,680
What exactly did Liu Yang want to discuss with her father?

269
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,040
If it was merely to warn her father

270
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,700
that Lei Lei was problematic,

271
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,490
it doesn't make sense emotionally or logically.

272
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,200
There must be other reasons.

273
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,440
The butler was present throughout,

274
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,040
he knows the most details.

275
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,200
I just don't know if he...

276
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,280
Miss Ruoting.

277
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,720
Let's go have lunch first.

278
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,400
Later, we need to have

279
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,000
a good talk with this butler.

280
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,960
Chief Li.

281
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,640
Chief Li.

282
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,120
Master Six says Mr. Zhao died of poisoning.

283
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,600
Your family is very worried about you

284
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,460
and prepared all these delicious foods for you.

285
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,620
I suppose Uncle Zhang arranged this.

286
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,880
He has always cared for me since I was little

287
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,280
and manages most affairs in our household.

288
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,520
He's been thinking hard all day today

289
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,960
and must be quite tired.

290
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,080
By the way,

291
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,000
I was able to sit in the room today

292
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,880
because someone vouched for me.

293
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,880
Who do you think it was?

294
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,440
Vouched for you?

295
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,810
Who would have that kind of influence?

296
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,960
It must be Brother Lin Feng.

297
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,320
I went to see him before coming here,

298
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,050
and he's worried about you too.

299
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,120
I suppose it could only be him.

300
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,120
Just now, the constable told Captain Li

301
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,080
that my father died of poisoning.

302
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,120
Poisoned?

303
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,690
What kind of poison?

304
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,170
They didn't say.

305
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,020
Captain Li left immediately,

306
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,120
and I couldn't very well follow him.

307
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,880
Master Liu.

308
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,840
Have you identified the poison?

309
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,680
Not yet.

310
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Search every corner of the room carefully,

311
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,000
don't miss

312
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
any powder or granular substances.

313
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,500
Now we just need to talk to Steward Zhang.

314
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,960
He was present throughout the whole incident,

315
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,000
we should hear the details he knows.

316
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,810
Based on what you just said,

317
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,120
I'm certain

318
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,410
that Wang Er is definitely hiding something.

319
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,640
Since he claims to have seen you before,

320
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,000
he probably really has.

321
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,600
He sounds like a coward

322
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,280
with a weakness for women,

323
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,120
and somewhat slow-witted,

324
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,520
completely incapable of keeping secrets.

325
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,040
The relationship between Wang Er and Steward Zhang

326
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,770
needs further investigation.

327
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,000
As for that Liu Yang,

328
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,440
acting merely on intuition

329
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,480
to warn Master Zhao about Lei Lei,

330
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,960
it certainly seems suspicious.

331
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,970
The reason behind it can't be that simple,

332
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,560
there might be something else going on.

333
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,800
Go investigate

334
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,660
when Wang Er arrived in Tongzhou.

335
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,440
Also,

336
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,400
look into this Liu Yang.

337
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,560
This Liu Yang was an orphan,

338
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,420
so he must have done all sorts of odd jobs.

339
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,200
Since Lei Lei is a merchant,

340
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
there might have been some conflict

341
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,840
between them before.

342
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,100
Like unpaid wages.

343
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,280
I think there's something strange

344
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,560
between Yue'er and Liu Yang.

345
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,680
Since Liu Yang arrived at the mansion,

346
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,040
Yue'er has mentioned it to me several times.

347
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,640
She's terrified of Liu Yang.

348
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,700
She feels like Liu Yang is always staring at her,

349
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,840
and his gaze makes her shudder.

350
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,360
She doesn't even dare

351
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,220
to move around the mansion alone.

352
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,210
But she has also mentioned that

353
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,920
despite being afraid,

354
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,880
she somehow feels

355
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,420
Liu Yang wouldn't actually harm her.

356
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,280
Why are you here?

357
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,880
Be careful not to get caught.

358
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,540
It's fine. I'm being careful.

359
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,200
Everyone knows the young lady is resting inside,

360
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,000
so they won't suspect anything.

361
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,560
I'll get straight to the point.

362
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,880
A few days ago, I overheard the servants gossiping

363
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,160
that since Liu Yang entered the Zhao household,

364
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,360
although he's been diligent in his work,

365
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
he keeps staring at the maid Yue'er.

366
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,520
Though he tries hard to hide it,

367
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,240
all the servants can tell,

368
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,330
and even Yue'er seems uncomfortable around him.

369
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,440
However, from my observation,

370
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,560
I think Liu Yang's feelings toward her

371
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,520
don't seem like romantic interest,

372
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,980
but more like protection.

373
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,080
Like the way we were

374
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,810
as siblings when we were young.

375
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Besides, he knows

376
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,730
the master intends to take Yue'er as a concubine.

377
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,960
From what you're saying,

378
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,960
it doesn't seem like a crime of passion.

379
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,800
Don't worry too much about this.

380
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,400
You should still find opportunities

381
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,130
to have a good talk with Yue'er.

382
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,720
Though your personalities differ,

383
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,080
you've grown up together since childhood

384
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,080
and have always shared everything.

385
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,200
Talk to her more,

386
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,920
and you might actually

387
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,520
gain some information

388
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,450
that could help uncover the truth.

389
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,770
Liu Yang is dead.

390
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,780
Come with me to the main hall quickly.

391
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,160
Wang Er.

392
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,160
Sir.

393
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,560
I have a suspicion

394
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,220
that I'm not sure if I should mention.

395
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,730
Go ahead and tell me.

396
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,720
Ever since the incident at our blacksmith shop,

397
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,240
there have been various small problems in the mansion,

398
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,520
which is why the blacksmith shop has considered

399
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,160
partnering with others for operation.

400
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,840
Also, the mansion has been targeted by thieves recently,

401
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,250
though there were no significant losses.

402
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,650
But on the night the master was killed and in the days before,

403
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,560
the same thief was spotted,

404
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,260
with exceptional skills.

405
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,360
The same thief came twice

406
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,680
and you spotted him but couldn't catch him.

407
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,480
Butler Zhang,

408
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,690
what exactly are you implying?

409
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,040
Today I

410
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,680
believe I saw that thief again.

411
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,360
Are you saying

412
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,560
that this thief is still in the mansion?

413
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,280
Where is he?

414
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,240
He should be

415
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
in Linglong Courtyard.
