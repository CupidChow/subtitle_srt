00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,780
=Lust and Lies=

2
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,000
Beishan.

3
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,119
Beishan,

4
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,799
Qingwan is back.

5
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,320
Madam, what's wrong with you?

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,159
Why would a performer be Qingwan?

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,159
You gave this jade pendant to Qingwan
as a one-month-old present.

8
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,359
Remember?

9
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,840
On her back,

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,000
there's a scar from falling off a horse
as a kid.

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,079
Does such a coincidence exist?

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,359
Of course not.

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,840
She's our daughter.

14
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:33,560
Mr. Zhao,

15
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,959
what if Boss Huo finds out
we acted on our own?

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,239
If he blames us,

17
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,040
I'll take responsibility.

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,040
Feifei mustn't be harmed today.

19
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,140
=Episode 3=

20
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,039
What are you afraid of?

21
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,000
You're pointing a gun at me.

22
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,000
Of course, I'm scared.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,039
I don't believe my daughter
would appear out of nowhere.

24
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,039
Tell me.

25
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:42,919
What are you plotting?

26
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,560
To be honest,
I find it hard to believe too.

27
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,240
I've spent 15 years
searching for my parents,

28
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,919
and suddenly they appear.

29
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,840
I know my place.

30
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,520
I'm a mere performer.

31
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,800
How would I dare dream
of being a daughter of the Huo family?

32
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,240
Today,

33
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,400
allow me to perform one last song
for First Madam.

34
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,439
From this day on,

35
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,199
I'll never set foot
in the Huo Residence.

36
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,439
Beishan.

37
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,840
Fine.

38
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,639
I'll pull the trigger now.

39
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,759
If you die,

40
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,919
I'll accept you as my daughter.

41
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,280
But if someone rescues you,

42
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,080
I'll kill you all.

43
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,400
What's the difference?

44
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,120
I have to die anyway.

45
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,879
Of course there is.

46
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,080
One will be buried with honors

47
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,759
as a daughter of the Huo family,

48
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,439
the other will die with no tomb

49
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,680
as a bandit.

50
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,240
Beishan,

51
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,520
I've been praying every day

52
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,560
that Qingwan will return.

53
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,120
I'm begging you.

54
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:55,919
Please.

55
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,360
Aunt,

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,800
today's your birthday.

57
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,039
You can't kneel.

58
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,199
Aunt.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,520
Aunt.

60
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,199
Get up.

61
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,199
First Madam,

62
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,400
you don't have to do this for me.

63
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,080
In this life,

64
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,599
our time together may be short.

65
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,280
In the next,

66
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,439
I hope I can call you mother again.

67
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,800
Father, I'm so scared.

68
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,000
If you're afraid,

69
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,240
pinch your arm.

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,480
You won't be scared

71
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,480
when you feel pain.

72
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,519
Qingwan.

73
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,279
Don't be afraid.

74
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,519
Mother is here.

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,600
Mother is here.

76
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,519
There, there.

77
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,920
Mother is here.

78
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,279
Today,

79
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,879
I'll spare you.

80
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you, Governor.

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,519
Get up.

82
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,560
Aunt.

83
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,920
What do you think?

84
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,319
I find Miss Yan Qing very interesting.

85
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,759
Let her into the Huo Residence for now.

86
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,160
If she's plotting something,

87
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,360
keeping her close

88
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,759
is safer.

89
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,519
Good.

90
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,079
Keep a close eye on her.

91
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,079
Also,

92
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,360
investigate those people outside.

93
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:19,959
Here.

94
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,560
Please.

95
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,199
Come on.

96
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,319
Understood.

97
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:26,600
Come on.

98
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,639
Get on with your work.

99
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:27,920
Come on.

100
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:28,519
Mr. Zhao,

101
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,079
is Miss Ruan really safe there?

102
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,120
(Zhao Xun, Second-in-command of Huofeng Gang)
She gave me a signal to leave.

103
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,199
I trust her.

104
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,820
(Huo Residence)

105
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,399
Digging around like this

106
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,079
will get attention.

107
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,000
Xiu,

108
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,600
I was just

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,439
looking for my jade pendant.

110
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:13,920
It's with me.

111
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,279
Thank you, Xiu.

112
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,759
Who actually are you?

113
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,279
One moment you're Yan Qing,

114
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,160
next you're Huo Qingwan.

115
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,759
Xiu,

116
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,199
I'm Yan Qing.

117
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,160
But then

118
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,879
I became

119
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,480
the daughter of the Huo family.

120
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,600
I should get going.

121
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,480
Xiu,

122
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,360
undressing a woman you meet

123
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,240
is rude.

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,879
Besides,

125
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,680
we're now siblings.

126
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,639
That's improper,

127
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,160
Xiu.

128
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:25,920
Sorry,

129
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,160
Qingwan.

130
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,240
I need to take a good look

131
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,080
at the scar on your back

132
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,879
and see if it's new

133
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,159
or old.

134
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,320
Young Marshal Huo who kills
without blinking

135
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,080
is shutting his eyes tightly.

136
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,279
Ah, right.

137
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,639
I should thank you.

138
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,840
If you hadn't helped unzip my clothes

139
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,720
and revealed the scar to Mother,

140
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,240
we wouldn't have recognized each other.

141
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,120
Thank you.

142
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,320
Did she

143
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,200
break into my room yesterday?

144
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,480
She claimed she wanted her jade pendant back.

145
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,440
I checked her back.

146
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,039
It's an old wound.

147
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,679
Governor,

148
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,480
Miss Yiyi prepared
a bowl of soup for you.

149
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,480
But I think

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,120
the scar is new.

151
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,840
You've worked hard performing outside.

152
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,480
I had the kitchen

153
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,639
prepare seafood soup.

154
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's nourishing.

155
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,080
Yiyi,

156
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:37,039
did you also send some for Governor?

157
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,519
Yes.

158
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,080
Uncle, Aunt,

159
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,679
and Cousin Xiu all received some.

160
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,240
So they all know

161
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,480
you made it?

162
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,399
What are you getting at, Qingwan?

163
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:49,480
Nothing.

164
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,159
I just feel bad for you,
living in someone else's house

165
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,080
and always having to be wary
of their moods.

166
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,480
It must be hard.

167
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,320
Qingwan was allergic to fish and shrimp
when she was a kid.

168
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,399
Test it on her tomorrow.

169
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,600
What if

170
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,120
she's not Qingwan?

171
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,799
For those with ill intentions,

172
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,679
I never spare them.

173
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,559
Drink up, Qingwan.

174
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The soup is cooling.

175
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,200
Qingwan.

176
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,120
Qingwan!

177
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,960
Are you all right?

178
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:20,759
Uncle.
