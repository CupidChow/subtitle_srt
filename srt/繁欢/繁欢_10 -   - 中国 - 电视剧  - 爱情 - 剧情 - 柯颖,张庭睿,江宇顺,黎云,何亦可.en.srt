=Lust and Lies=

2
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,159
Qingwan, what's wrong?

3
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,359
Nothing.

4
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,760
I lost a pair of my earrings.

5
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,270
I've been trying
to figure out where I dropped them.

6
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,480
It's just a pair of earrings.

7
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,840
I can get you

8
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,159
any earring you want.

9
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,200
By the way, Mother,

10
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,200
why did you suddenly want
to go to the mountain to pray?

11
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,120
I go every year to pay respects to the lost souls.

12
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,400
Lost souls?

13
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:35,560
Madam,

14
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,439
everything is ready.

15
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,000
I've made up my mind.

16
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,239
Whether your feelings

17
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,519
are real or fake,

18
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,879
it doesn't matter.

19
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,159
Then what does?

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,879
What matters is

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,199
that you're here

22
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,479
by my side.

23
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,100
=Episode 10=

24
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,400
Hey.

25
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,199
What's going on here?

26
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:49,840
What are you doing here?

27
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,240
I asked him

28
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,319
to take me out.

29
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,120
Let's go.

30
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,120
Stop the car.

31
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,800
Even though I know

32
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,319
you're using me to get at him,

33
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm still happy.

34
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,400
If you keep
getting tangled up with Huo Xiu,

35
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,919
I'm afraid you'll forget why you came
to the Huo family in the first place.

36
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,479
I don't need you to remind me.

37
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,159
I know what I need to do.

38
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,159
My hair…

39
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,479
Well, you have plenty anyway.

40
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,080
You spent the whole day out
with Sheng Weilian.

41
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,800
Did you even want to come back?

42
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,759
What's that got to do with you?

43
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,759
Huo Xiu, what are you trying to do?

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,479
If someone sees us,

45
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,560
I'll just say you seduced me.

46
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,639
Huo Xiu,
aren't you done causing a scene?

47
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:18,720
Not yet.

48
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,439
Do you even realize

49
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,920
you're coming off like a desperate stray,

50
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,160
howling for attention?

51
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,279
I don't have time to play your games.

52
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,759
If you have nowhere
to vent your frustrations,

53
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,439
go find some other woman.

54
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,800
Other women?

55
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,439
In this family,

56
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,879
you're my brother.

57
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,959
I'm your sister.

58
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,600
You better remember that.

59
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,680
Don't tell me

60
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,079
you love Sheng Weilian?

61
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,319
I do.

62
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,460
(Huo Residence)

63
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,120
(Ruan Feifei,)

64
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,759
(love gets in the way of plans.)

65
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,399
(You still have a blood debt to settle.)

66
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,079
Miss,

67
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,839
Governor is asking
to see you in his room.

68
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,279
Governor.

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,839
What do you want now?

70
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,600
I was called here too.

71
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,120
That's low, even for you.

72
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,560
Someone wants to drug us.

73
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:29,920
Wasn't it you?

74
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,319
This is Governor's room.

75
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,000
Would I try to drug both of us here?

76
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,879
You really do drink anything, huh?

77
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,519
I'd rather be a confused victim

78
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,720
than be sober
and misunderstood by Governor.

79
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,720
Don't overthink it.

80
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,680
We'll find whoever's behind this.

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,560
I bet whoever set this trap

82
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,000
will have an interesting reaction

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,839
when they see us losing it

84
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,920
in the Governor's room.

85
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,519
Uncle,

86
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,800
I made you some chicken soup.

87
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,519
Have some
before you go back to your room.

88
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,879
You really should have some…

89
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,040
Is something wrong?

90
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:53,439
Xiu and Qingwan…

91
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,319

92
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,319

she's the one who drugged the liquor?

Yes,

drug the liquor.
