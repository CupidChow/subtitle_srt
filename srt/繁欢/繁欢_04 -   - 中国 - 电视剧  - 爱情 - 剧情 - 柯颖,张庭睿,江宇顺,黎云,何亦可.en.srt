1
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:35,701
=Lust and Lies=

2
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:41,920
How is she, sir?

3
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,359
Qingwan isn't allergic to
fish or shrimp.

4
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,079
You meant for her to hear it, right?

5
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,040
For smart people,

6
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,959
you have to use foolish tricks.

7
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,799
She's overconfident

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,200
and gives herself away.

9
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,439
Uncle,

10
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,799
the physician said

11
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,719
Qingwan isn't allergic.

12
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,319
She was poisoned.

13
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,060
=Episode 4=

14
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:58,879
You're awake.

15
00:01:59,239 --> 00:01:59,599
Come.

16
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,200
Slowly.

17
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,359
Governor,

18
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,599
you didn't drink the soup, right?

19
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,599
I heard it was poisoned.

20
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,560
Luckily, none of you drank it.

21
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,919
Qingwan,

22
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,879
you've suffered.

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
Being able to help Governor

24
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,199
is my honor.

25
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:35,960
Looks like

26
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,439
there are quite a few rats
in the residence.

27
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,800
Take care of them.

28
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,719
Yes, sir.

29
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,280
Governor,

30
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,639
this isn't our doing.

31
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,520
Miss Yiyi prepared the soup.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,759
Uncle.

33
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,800
Uncle,

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,319
I didn't poison it.

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,439
Please trust me.

36
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,039
I really didn't.

37
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,199
Yiyi,

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,599
you...

39
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,520
I trust her.

40
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,479
If she poisoned it,

41
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,319
it's too obvious.

42
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,080
Say,

43
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,840
I think Zhong added something
to the soup.

44
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,360
He's the cook.

45
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,919
I thought it was seasoning.

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,759
I didn't know it was poison.

47
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,000
Qingwan.

48
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,960
I'm sorry, Qingwan.

49
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,639
I was so careless.

50
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,120
I brought this harm on you.

51
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,520
Don't blame yourself.

52
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,960
I should thank you for helping me.

53
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,639
Get up.

54
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,840
Enough.

55
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,280
Go

56
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,479
deal with that cook.

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,599
Yes, sir.

58
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,080
The rest can go back.

59
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,319
Let Qingwan rest.

60
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,479
You really stop at nothing.

61
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,039
I thought you gave yourself
allergy medicine.

62
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,840
Yet you actually poisoned yourself.

63
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,520
You're wrong.

64
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,680
I didn't poison myself,

65
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,800
and I don't even know Zhong.

66
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,759
How could it not be you?

67
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,319
You must be kidding.

68
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,519
I'm just

69
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,439
a victim.

70
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,360
Young Marshal, you can't kill me.

71
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,920
It was your order.

72
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,839
All the more reason for you to die.

73
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,439
No.

74
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,120
Please.

75
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,519
Xiu.

76
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,240
You're back so late.

77
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,839
The place is far,

78
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,319
so I'm back late.

79
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,000
I heard Zhong

80
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:19,240
has been abusing others
under the name of the Huo family.

81
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,120
He even killed someone.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,319
You're well-informed,

83
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,120
Qingwan.

84
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,279
I found this poison

85
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,160
in his room.

86
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,040
You put it there, didn't you?

87
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,319
How can you be sure

88
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
this poison is mine?

89
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,279
Because my nose is keen.

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,120
Your body

91
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,680
carried a smell of cooking smoke.

92
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,759
I was puzzled

93
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,720
as to what the busy Young Marshal

94
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,519
was doing in the kitchen.

95
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,199
Turns out it was to kill me.

96
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,879
Looks like

97
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,279
we siblings

98
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,000
need a serious talk.

99
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,000
I agree.

100
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,800
But it's too late now.

101
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm tired.

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,959
Let's talk another day.

103
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,000
You're so sinful,

104
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,079
you'd best stay in the shadows.

105
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,590
You've loved horses
since you were little.

106
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,600
I've got one for you.

107
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:53,961
Thank you, Governor.

108
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,480
How is it?

109
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,439
Give it a try.

110
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,560
I fell off a horse

111
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,920
when I was little.

112
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,120
I have scars on my back.

113
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,240
I don't dare.

114
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,720
We're here to hunt.

115
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,480
How can you not ride?

116
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:08,319
Governor.

117
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,439
Let me teach her.

118
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,160
Sure.

119
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,639
Xiu,

120
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,360
I really can't.

121
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,000
Just try.

122
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,480
Sometimes

123
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,160
it's harder

124
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,439
to pretend.

125
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,680
Slowly.

126
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:38,959
Xiu,

127
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,439
you...

128
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,120
Don't let go.

129
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,839
I'm scared.

130
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,759
You're overreacting.

131
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,759
Give it here.

132
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,600
Xiu, I'll ride myself.

133
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:55,959
Be careful.

134
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,759
Don't give me an opening.

135
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,360
Thanks for the warning.

136
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:00,959
Hyah.

137
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,519
Hyah.

138
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:12,519
Hyah.

139
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,319
What's going on?

140
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,839
Miss Huo's horse got shocked.

141
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,159
Young Marshal killed the horse

142
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,200
to save her.

143
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,360
What?

144
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,660
I'm sorry for putting you
in a difficult spot,

145
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,919
Mother.

146
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
You're afraid of riding.

147
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,000
Why force yourself?

148
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,039
I wanted to make Governor happy.

149
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,159
You're the daughter of the Huo family.

150
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,159
No one can change that.

151
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,440
I believe Beishan

152
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,879
will accept you sooner or later.

153
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,120
Well,

154
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,559
rest for now.

155
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,879
I can see

156
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
you're a lunatic.

157
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,200
How so?

158
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,600
You startled the horse

159
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,840
to hide your riding skills.

160
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,519
Do you realize

161
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,919
that if it had trampled you,

162
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,799
you'd be dead?

163
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,320
You're worried about me.

164
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,879
Xiu.

165
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,399
Drop the act.

166
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,720
Put away your little tricks.

167
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,840
I've been wondering why you dressed up
as the character Bai Suzhen

168
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,480
in the Qingfang Troupe.

169
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,559
After all,

170
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,200
the Huo Army isn't the type
to work in disguise.

171
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,679
If it were for the Lion Seal,

172
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,399
you could've seized it by force

173
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,200
and killed everyone.

174
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,159
But you only took some out

175
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,919
and left some alive,

176
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,759
especially the man delivering the seal.

177
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,600
There's only one possibility.

178
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,960
You were

179
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,960
together on this.

180
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,240
The Lion Seal

181
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,960
was already in your hands
in the first place.

182
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,000
You feared Governor would suspect

183
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,639
if you handed it over directly,

184
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,159
so you staged this

185
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,960
to hand off the Lion Seal

186
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,240
while keeping yourself clean.

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,639
What?

188
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,080
I get it right?

189
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,720
Then, do you know

190
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,360
Yan Qing was my person?

191
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,720
She betrayed me,

192
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,039
so I killed her.

193
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,080
And now you're here using her name.

194
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,320
You won't dare expose me.

195
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,320
