1
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,780
=Lust and Lies=

2
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,359
Father?

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,840
You went to the army headquarters
to steal Governor's keys?

4
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,719
You'd better put it back.

5
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,400
Why?

6
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,680
Getting ready to be his lapdog again?

7
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,359
Since Zhao Yun's death,

8
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,640
you've been irrational.

9
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,159
If you take the Lion Seal away,
naturally, Governor will suspect you.

10
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,159
So be it.

11
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,719
With the Lion Seal,

12
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,200
I need not pretend to be Huo Qingwan,
who disgusts me.

13
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,159
What did you say?

14
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,060
=Episode 16=

15
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,240
Governor.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,159
I found your keys.

17
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,400
Where is Qingwan?

18
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,490
She said she was tired
from the gun training.

19
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,240
She's taking some rest.

20
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,759
Have you found me a locksmith?

21
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:49,759
After all,

22
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,560
everyone is coveting the Lion Seal.

23
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,840
To make sure nothing goes wrong,

24
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,199
we need to find someone reliable.

25
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,800
Go on.

26
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,919
Are you alright?

27
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,080
I'm fine.

28
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,220
Huo Beishan has figured out
the Huofeng Gang's whereabouts

29
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,599
and caught many of its members secretly.

30
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,879
The leader asked you
to figure out a way to save them.

31
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,479
Got it.

32
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,039
Tell them to relocate

33
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,319
those robbed arms at once.

34
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,280
Huo Jin.

35
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,879
Brat.

36
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,120
What are you doing here?

37
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,240
Nothing.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,159
I got some random stuff here.

39
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,080
You may have it.

40
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,000
It's for me?

41
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,960
I think it quite suits you.

42
00:03:59,159 --> 00:03:59,599
Thanks.

43
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,599
Go home now.

44
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,159
Miss.

45
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,360
What are you doing here at this late hour?

46
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,639
You look quite lovely.

47
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:21,680
Come on.

48
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,800
I'll take you home.

49
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:23,720
Let's go.

50
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,000
Let go of me!

51
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,079
You wench!

52
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
How dare you hit me!

53
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,160
Get over here!

54
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,160
Wench!

55
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,759
Today, I shall teach you a lesson!

56
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,639
Let go of me!

57
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,439
No matter how wretched I am,

58
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,199
I'm a heiress after all.

59
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,000
A rogue like you had better
keep your hands off me.

60
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,920
(Huo Qingwan.)

61
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,079
Qingwan.

62
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,839
So this is where you used to live.

63
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,240
That's right.

64
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,759
You must have had a lot.

65
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,800
I haven't played this game.

66
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,360
I'll join them.

67
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,839
If you want to play it,

68
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,800
I'll join you.

69
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,800
Why?

70
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,560
The formidable Young Marshal Huo

71
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,199
wants to be the hen?

72
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,240
As long as you're happy.

73
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:00,920
Fine.

74
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,759
I'll be the eagle, then.

75
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,199
Sure.

76
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,279
Let's play it.

77
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,680
I am

78
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,199
a big hen.

79
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,519
I've got you!

80
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:22,839
This is no fun!

81
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:23,639
I quit.

82
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,079
Don't run!

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,279
Catch him already!

84
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,560
Both of you are unbelievable.

85
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,199
Beishan.

86
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,279
I've come up with this guest list.

87
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,120
Take a look

88
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,399
and see if it needs any amendment.

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,839
I'll leave that to you.

90
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
We must make sure

91
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,000
the banquet goes well

92
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,240
so that Qingwan

93
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,439
will gain her recognition

94
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,920
as the heiress of our family.

95
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,279
Governor.

96
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,399
We found this letter at the door.

97
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,519
Beishan!

98
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,160
We've been kidnapped!

99
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,360
Governor.

100
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,480
Everything's ready.

101
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,360
Go ahead.

102
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,079
Mr. Huo, may you have an absolute victory.

103
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:04,680
Oh, right.

104
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,439
There's one more thing.

105
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,120
I know

106
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,439
the leader of the Huofeng Gang.

107
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,480
Miss Ruan.

108
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,639
Will Huo Beishan release them?

109
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,360
His most beloved son is with us.

110
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,360
So it's worth trying.

111
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,440
This time,

112
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,360
I want Huo Beishan dead.

113
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,960
The Huo Army is here.

114
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,279
Where are they?

115
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,720
Wake them up first.

116
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:47,879
Qingwan.

117
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,840
Qingwan.

118
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,240
Are you alright?

119
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,559
Qingwan, don't be afraid.

120
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,120
I've been kidnapped

121
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,200
for times.

122
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,720
Father will save us.

123
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,240
Let's do an exchange.

124
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,799
Tell Huo Beishan to come here.

125
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,440
These are his children.

126
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,240
As their father,

127
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,039
is he going to be a coward now?

128
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,399
Governor said,

129
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:24,240
if you dare hurt
anyone of the Huo family,

130
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,399
we'll get rid of these people.

131
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,919
Aren't they

132
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:35,039
like your family with whom
you've spent your time?

133
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,159
Deal.

134
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,120
Qingwan!

135
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,320
It's the Huo Army!

136
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,919
How dare they trick us!

137
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,240
We'll fight them til the end!

138
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,960
Charge!

139
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:39,759
Huo Jin!

140
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,039
Huo Jin, are you alright?

141
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:45,960
Stop it!

142
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,799
Don't shoot!

143
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,080
Huo Jin!

144
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,879
Take Young Master Huo Jin home first!

145
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,279
Huo Jin!

146
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,919
