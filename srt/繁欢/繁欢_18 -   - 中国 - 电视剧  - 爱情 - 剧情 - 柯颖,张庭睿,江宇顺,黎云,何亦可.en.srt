00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,000
but Huo Beishan
has had a celebratory banquet.

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,159
We should be

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,840
celebrating it instead.

6
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,520
Indeed.

00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,799
After Miss Ruan
and the Sheng family's marriage alliance,

8
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,600
the Huo family will have a hard time.

78
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:25,000

know my daughter,

Huo Qingwan.

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,839
The Huafeng Newspaper

81
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
wants to interview me.

82
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,079
Last night,

83
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,360
Governor sent his men
to get rid of the Huofeng Gang

84
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,600
and safeguard Sucheng.

85
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,639
It's said that bodies
were seen floating in the river.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,560
Those pirates have all been eradicated.

87
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,519
They've all been eradicated?

88
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,360
Yes.

89
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,480
It's the Huafeng Newspaper's honor

90
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,079
to be doing a report

91
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,480
on such a great achievement.

92
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,000
You knew it all,

93
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,920
but you chose to pretend to be ignorant.

94
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,480
That was Governor's order.

95
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,319
Huo Xiu.

96
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,040
It's me who can't figure you out.

97
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,319
Governor made me

98
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,160
choose between you and the Huofeng Gang.

99
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,839
Of course I'd choose you.

100
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,160
I didn't ask you
to make the choice for me!

101
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,639
I told you so.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,160
This isn't the best time
for your vengeance.

103
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:02,639
Fine.

104
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,560
You'll stay here

105
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,560
and be his lapdog.

106
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,639
Have you found the locksmith?

107
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,860
There have been some clues about him.

108
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,959
I've been trying to lure him out,
but he hasn't taken the bait.

109
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,680
Make it quick.

110
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,079
Do you hear me?

111
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,120
You can open

112
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,759
the Lion Seal by yourself.

113
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,639
That Japanese man
isn't a locksmith, is he?

114
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,959
Where is Huo Beishan?

115
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,639
Where is the Lion Seal?

116
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,000
Huo Beishan didn't ask you out.

117
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,240
I did.

118
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,680
That's alright.

119
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,040
Give me the Lion Seal

120
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,720
and I'll let you have this.

121
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,079
Hey.

122
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,720
Why are you

123
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,319
coveting our valuable?

124
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,959
No one despises money.

125
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,399
It's a shame that you're stupid.

126
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,519
Don't...

127
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,080
Don't kill me!

128
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,840
Don't kill me!

129
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,000
I've been looking for this
for more than ten years.

130
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,628
(Yesterday, Governor Huo Beishan of Sucheng
led his men to wipe out the Huofeng Gang)

131
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:02,980
(His long-lost beloved daughter is found)

132
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,360
Get me a gun.

133
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,559
Don't try anything funny.

134
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,240
Be it the Ruan family

135
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,759
or the Huofeng Gang,

136
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,919
I must get back at him!

137
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,679
Otherwise, what's the point
of pretending to be Huo Qingwan?

138
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,320
Qingwan...

139
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Give me a gun.

140
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,690
Aren't you afraid
she'd get herself killed

141
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,559
by provoking her this way?

142
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,799
No matter how many years

143
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,879
you've had a dog,

144
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,639
you need to get rid of it and eat it

145
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,159
when it becomes useless.

146
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,360
Miss Ruan.

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,879
Starting today,

148
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,480
I shall be your teacher.

149
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,519
I'll teach you
how to become Huo Qingwan.

150
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,039
You should teach me how to kill.

151
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,919
When you become Huo Qingwan,

152
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,120
