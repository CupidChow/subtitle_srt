You're only coming back now?

3
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,920
How's your injury?

4
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,159
You've certainly nailed that part

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,240
at the festival.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,990
You were just stalling with me,

7
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,799
playing along,

8
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,120
then had those people come after me,

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,359
didn't you?

10
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:14,840
I don't know those people.

11
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,000
Are you still trying to lie to me?

12
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,079
I saw with my own eyes
that you gave the order.

13
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,799
Those assassins were protecting you

14
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,280
but closing in on me at every step.

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,760
Then why would you be
dumb enough to save me?

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,159
You're right.

17
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,319
I was stupid.

18
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,840
Because I was afraid I was wrong,

19
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,200
and those people would really hurt you.

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,359
Young Marshal Huo, Governor wants to see you.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,280
When Young Marshal Huo was unconscious,

22
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,599
he gave me this nine-linked ring

23
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,960
and told me to redeem the prize.

24
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,280
He said it was for you.

25
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,719
I've never seen him
care about anyone like this.

26
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,800
I'm only his sister.

she was Huo Qingwan?
