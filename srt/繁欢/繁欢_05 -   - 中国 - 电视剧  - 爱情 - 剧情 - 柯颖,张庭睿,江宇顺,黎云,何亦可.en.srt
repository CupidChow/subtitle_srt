=Lust and Lies=

2
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,880
What?

3
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,520
Carry on.

4
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not stupid.

5
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,679
I won't kill you here.

6
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,519
Then I look forward to

7
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,920
where you'll try to kill me.

8
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,120
Do you?

9
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,799
Well, I'll have to
think about it carefully.

10
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,799
If you're here to look for something,

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,599
you'd better behave.

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
This is the Huo Residence, after all.

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,640
Your life won't be easy here.

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,879
What are you talking about?

15
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,920
It's the Huo family who traps me here.

16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,959
I don't want to stay here.

17
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,480
My dear sister,

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,519
you're so amusing.

19
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,640
I hope you'll stay.

20
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,780
=Episode 5=

21
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,439
Jin is back.

22
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,940
(Huo Jin, Young Master
of the Huo family)

23
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,800
Jin's been studying abroad.

24
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,159
As soon as he heard you were back,

25
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,879
he came back to see you.

26
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,400
Don't put on that smile.

27
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,919
I don't believe you're my sister.

28
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,439
Don't mind him.

29
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,439
Jin's just acting tough.

30
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,039
He has prepared Western food for you.

31
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:29,960
Really?

32
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,560
I'll leave this black snake

33
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,840
to you, Xiu.

34
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,919
Miss Huo is amazing.

35
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
She's not afraid of snakes.

36
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,080
Yeah.

37
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,800
Look.

38
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,000
Qingwan is Jin's favorite.

39
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,000
That day she disappeared,

40
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,800
they were playing hide-and-seek.

41
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,560
Jin hid in a cabinet the whole night,

42
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,480
but Qingwan didn't come looking for him.

43
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,879
He thought

44
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,759
she didn't want him anymore.

45
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,680
To him,

46
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,040
no one can replace Qingwan.

47
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,040
I am Qingwan.

48
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,160
Exactly.

49
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,639
That's why he's acting like a child.

50
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:22,800
Go back.

51
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,090
Are you waiting to be pushed again?

52
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,480
I still have something to do.

53
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,439
Put me down.

54
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,519
What's your problem?

55
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,600
You're the young master
of the Huo family,

56
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,720
yet you bully a woman.

57
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,160
You're so petty.

58
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,199
Qingwan is the most important person
to me.

59
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,560
How dare a performer like you
pretend to be her?

60
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,000
I must teach you a lesson.

61
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,639
You studied abroad, didn't you?

62
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,000
But you haven't even learn respect.

63
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,879
Did you throw away all manners?

64
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,680
You hook up with Huo Xiu.

65
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,920
Why should I respect you?

66
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,680
Father raised him

67
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,279
to be the Huo family's watchdog.

68
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,040
I guess you're just jealous of him.

69
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,040
Governor always says

70
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,040
you're an embarrassing dandy,

71
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,279
while he's the young marshal
everyone in Sucheng looks up to.

72
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,079
I...

73
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,040
I will kick you out of here.

74
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:58,720
Sure.

75
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,600
I'll wait.

76
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,759
But before that,

77
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,680
show me some respect.

78
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,040
Understood?

79
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:06,639
Alright.

80
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,319
I get it.

81
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:07,879
I will.

82
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:10,920
Now go back.

83
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,279
Aren't you afraid

84
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,279
he'll stir up trouble?

85
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,680
With a brat like him,

86
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,519
you handle him directly.

87
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,279
Even if I put up with him,

88
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,120
he'll still make trouble.

89
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:05,959
Let's go.

90
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,000
Governor,

91
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,879
the shipment scheduled to arrive tomorrow
from the Sheng family

92
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,319
has been raided.

93
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,439
They're bold enough to steal my goods.

94
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:20,839
Go now.

95
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,040
Find them.

96
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:24,560
Yes, sir.

97
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,700
Stop right there.

98
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,240
Father.

99
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,080
All you do is idle around every day.

100
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,000
Either playing with the violin
or messing around.

101
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,960
You've disgraced

102
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,399
the Huo family.

103
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,240
How have I disgraced the Huo family?

104
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,679
Here,

105
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,039
I'm nothing but a shame.

106
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,919
What did you say?

107
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,000
You always

108
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,679
tear me out.

109
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,440
I'm your son,

110
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,039
but you never give me face.

111
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:57,039
Because you don't favor my mother.

112
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,960
You only care about...

113
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:02,759
Governor,

114
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,120
please calm down.

115
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,519
Jin and I

116
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,759
were just fooling around.

117
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm stating the truth.

118
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,679
You neglect my mother.

119
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,879
Everyone here knows it.

120
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,559
Do you feel no guilt at all?

121
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,879
Father.

122
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,320
The Huo family's affairs
aren't for an outsider to meddle in.

123
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,399
Yes.

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,960
I'm an outsider to you.

125
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,960
Jin may be mischievous,

126
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,080
but he's your son.

127
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,480
If you want to hit her, hit me first.

128
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,039
Why take it out on her?

129
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,639
Investigate

130
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,600
why the shipment was raided.

131
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,480
So, even you

132
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,799
can only act obediently

133
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,759
in front of Governor.

134
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,840
The only one who can quarrel freely
with him is Huo Jin.

135
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,639
I'm the one

136
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,559
at his mercy.

137
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:35,879
Bear this in mind.

138
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,919
There are no good people

139
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:39,840
in this house.

140
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,360
Have you heard

141
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,679
that human nature is evil?

142
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,639
Someone told me this before.

143
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,799
She said

144
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,919
human is born evil.

145
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,600
But once they understand
love and warmth,

146
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,720
and learn the importance
of morality and order,

147
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,080
they learn

148
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,759
to be a good person.

149
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,879
The person who told you this

150
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,960
must love you very much.

151
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,559
That's why she taught you to see through
human nature in troubled times

152
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,919
and to be bad

153
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,120
