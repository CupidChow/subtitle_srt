=Lust and Lies=

2
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,280
Zhao Xun?

3
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,439
Why are you here?

4
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,039
I wanted to kill Huo Beishan,

5
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,960
so you wouldn't have to
risk staying here.

6
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,039
Go to my room.

7
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
It's the safest place.

8
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,480
Huo Beishan suspects me now.

9
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,519
He'll search for me outside.

10
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,680
He won't check my room.

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,190
Let's go.

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,719
How's your leg?

13
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,680
Being lame

14
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,959
makes them let down their guard.

15
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,159
The one I killed
was Huo Beishan's scapegoat.

16
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,359
Also, he has powerful bodyguards.

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,439
If we want to kill him,

18
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,719
it'll take a long plan.

19
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:30,879
By the way,

20
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,120
have you found

21
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,120
the Lion Seal?

22
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,040
The situation here is complicated.

23
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,760
I need to

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,799
secure my footing first.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,480
No rush.

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Keep yourself safe.

27
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,000
With that cargo,

28
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,239
we have the upper hand.

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,000
Zhao Xun,

30
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,480
the cargo could attract attention.

31
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,959
We must destroy it quickly.

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,599
What should we do with it?

33
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,040
If we stick to the plan,

34
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,560
the priority now is

35
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,239
to get you out of here.

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,240
Zhao Xun.

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,960
Zhao Xun.

38
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,900
=Episode 7=

39
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,759
Huo Qingwan?

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,319
I've underestimated you.

41
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,199
Not only did you hook up
with Huo Xiu and Sheng Weilian,

42
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,960
but now you've even brought
a man from outside.

43
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,879
It's not what you think.

44
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,479
When I struggled to get by,

45
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,680
he helped me.

46
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,680
So when he ran into trouble,

47
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,879
I helped him too.

48
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,599
Using the Huo family's money?

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,879
This is my money.

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,830
If you don't believe me,
look for yourself.

51
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,680
It's not Huo family money, is it?

52
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:38,840
Hurry and leave.

53
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,479
If Father finds you,

54
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,199
he'll treat you as bandits
and have you arrested.

55
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,520
Leave now.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,719
Thank you.

57
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,240
You defended me last time.

58
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,479
This time,

59
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,800
we're even.

60
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,639
I don't want to owe you.

61
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,240
All right.

62
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,240
You lot,

63
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,039
check the back area.

64
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:04,479
Yes, sir.

65
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:04,840
Yes, sir.

66
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,240
Father.

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,319
Governor.

68
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,879
Who's that man?

69
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,800
Governor,

70
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,600
please spare him.

71
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,240
He only came here

72
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,639
to see me.

73
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,759
Jin can vouch for me.

74
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,040
She wants you to testify for her.

75
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,240
I did see her with a man

76
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
by the back gate.

77
00:04:57,348 --> 00:04:58,120
But I think

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,480
the man is her lover.

79
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,920
Because

80
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,000
they were hugging each other.

81
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,040
They looked intimate.

82
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,439
Besides,

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,240
she even gave him money.

84
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,519
Oh, right.

85
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,680
That man is missing
his index and middle fingers.

86
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,680
He's not like the assassin.

87
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,639
He can't fire a gun.

88
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,759
Are you sure?

89
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,439
Mother says

90
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,279
she was with her

91
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,199
the whole night.

92
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,560
So I think

93
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,759
this assassination

94
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,079
has nothing to do with her.

95
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,040
I'll do Madam this favor.

96
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,399
But don't forget

97
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,000
this is the Huo Residence.

98
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,480
You should cut ties

99
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,160
with the past.

100
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,360
Thank you, Governor.

101
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,319
Lover?

102
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,160
Yes.

103
00:06:30,298 --> 00:06:33,898
(Huo Residence)

104
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,519
Xiu,

105
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,480
are you really going
to keep watching me?

106
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,639
Governor said

107
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,700
whoever visits the Huo Residence
these days

108
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
must be watched.

109
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,800
Are you here to guard me

110
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,120
or watch me?

111
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,040
Miss Huo,

112
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,480
before we make your outfit,

113
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,680
I need to take your measurements.

114
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,040
Sure.

115
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll do it.

116
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,839
Xiu,

117
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,160
why are your ears so red?

118
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,600
I...

119
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,240
I'm fine.

120
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,720
I'll go outside.

121
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,199
How's Zhao Xun?

122
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,560
He's fine.

123
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,800
Boss Ruan punished him

124
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,360
and prepared a corpse

125
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,800
to pose as the assassin.

126
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,720
The Huo Army should've found
that body by now.

127
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,480
Huo Beishan

128
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,720
isn't easily fooled.

129
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,879
Boss Ruan said

130
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:17,920
the body

131
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,600
would convince Huo Beishan.

132
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:21,639
Who is that?

133
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,120
Huo Beishan's enemies

134
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,120
are far too many.

135
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,399
Miss Ruan,

136
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:30,959
this is

137
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,440
the route map we planned.

138
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,200
Miss Huo,

139
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,480
Mr. Sheng has arrived.

140
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,080
Your leg's recovered?

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,240
After resting for a few days,

142
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,200
I'm almost well.

143
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,679
These are your favorite cookies.

144
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
I don't like them anymore.

145
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,879
Can you not be so cold to me?

146
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
Let's go,

147
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,159
Mr. Sheng.

148
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,320
The wound matches the one
from that night.

149
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,399
This should be the assassin.

150
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,919
These rats

151
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,679
are really hard to shake off.

152
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,159
These people...

153
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,720
It must be them

154
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,120
who raided the ship.

155
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,799
The temple fair is about to start.

156
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,279
We must catch them.

157
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,240
If Governor finds out that you leave your post,

158
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,320
you'll get a beating.

159
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,120
It's my business.

160
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,120
Do what I say.

161
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,399
Delay the action until after
the silver-throwing ceremony.

162
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,159
Mr. Sheng won't take her away.

163
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,159
Why are you so impatient?

164
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:18,919
Get out now.

165
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,159
Get out.

166
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,039
Fine.

167
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,279
I can't be bothered.

168
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,519
I didn't expect

169
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,320
Sucheng to be so lively at night.

170
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:51,960
Do you want a sachet?

171
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,320
To be honest,

172
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,840
I've always wanted

173
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,679
to take you to the temple fair

174
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,840
like an ordinary couple...

175
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,159
You have good taste.

176
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,840
Of course.

177
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,679
I...

178
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,279
Since you know what to do,

179
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,039
let's not waste words.

180
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,120
