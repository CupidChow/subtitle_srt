1
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,780
=Lust and Lies=

2
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,240
(Cheng, Adjutant)
That woman came for the Lion Seal, right?

3
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:52,320
Young Marshal,

4
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,840
she hurt you.

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,399
She's no ordinary woman.

6
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,620
=Episode 2=

7
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,680
What's your name, Miss?

8
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,359
Yan Qing.

9
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,519
We barely know each other,
Young Marshal.

10
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,159
Isn't it

11
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,840
a bit forward of you?

12
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,519
We barely know each other?

13
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,000
Have you forgotten

14
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,639
that just a few days ago,

15
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,759
you were flirting with me?

16
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,639
I don't understand

17
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,919
what you're talking about.

18
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,639
Could it be

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,919
that you

20
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,599
saw me in a dream?

21
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,159
I heard the Qingfang Troupe you worked with

22
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,759
caught fire a few days ago.

23
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,080
Yet you're in one piece.

24
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,159
Yes.

25
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,879
That day,

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,800
the building caught fire,

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,840
and many were killed.

28
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,560
I was fortunate.

29
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,560
A young lady saved me.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,039
Which young lady?

31
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,039
A woman

32
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,520
dressed as the character Bai Suzhen.

33
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,360
Now that you're in the Huo Residence,

34
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,360
I'll be watching you.

35
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,120
Thank you for your attention,
Young Marshal.

36
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,039
Young Marshal,

37
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,490
the birthday banquet is about to begin.

38
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,560
This way, please.

39
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,199
Look.

40
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,719
Look at that.

41
00:03:59,210 --> 00:03:59,719
There they are.

42
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,780
Congratulations, Marshal Huo.

43
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,830
Congratulations, Marshal Huo.

44
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,800
Congratulations.

45
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,790
Congratulations, Marshal Huo.

46
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,079
Her pipa playing is good.

47
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,319
(Liu Qing, First Madam Huo. Liu Yiyi, adopted daughter)
I haven't seen her before.

48
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:04,920
Aunt,

49
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,560
she just came here

50
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,079
with the Qingfang Troupe from Sucheng.

51
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,680
Of course, you haven't seen her.

52
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,000
Miss Yan Qing is renowned
for her pipa playing.

53
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,220
Many have offered high prices for it.

54
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,639
She is

55
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,079
mysterious.

56
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,720
Few have seen her face.

57
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,800
This time,

58
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,360
I specially invited her
to celebrate your birthday.

59
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,600
You're so thoughtful.

60
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,680
As long as you're pleased,

61
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm willing to do anything for you.

62
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,759
Didn't the Qingfang Troupe

63
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,480
disappear

64
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
after a big fire?

65
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,959
I've checked on

66
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,160
this Miss Yan Qing.

67
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,839
Someone rescued her.

68
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,000
If Qingwan were still here...

69
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,560
Today is a happy day.

70
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,240
Let's not talk about this.

71
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,199
Excellent!

72
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:06,960
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

73
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,839
Miss Yan Qing, your hat dropped.

74
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,680
I'm here to return it.

75
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,360
You must be kidding, Young Marshal.

76
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,560
This is a man's hat.

77
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,240
How could it be mine?

78
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:12,920
Are you sure?

79
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,160
Your wound has split open.

80
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,759
Go get it bandaged.

81
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,240
I'm going to change clothes.

82
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,600
What are you trying to do now?

83
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,199
I'll help you.

84
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,800
Do what I say,

85
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,839
and I might consider
stabbing you somewhere else.

86
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,519
How did you

87
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:16,959
get that wound?

88
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:18,920
This is

89
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,319
none of your business.

90
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,879
Aunt.

91
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,480
Where are you going, Aunt?

92
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,279
Aunt.

93
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,959
Everyone in the Qingfang Troupe died,

94
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,399
but you disguised yourself as Yan Qing

95
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,679
and entered the Huo Residence.

96
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,559
Should I call you stupid

97
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,679
or bold?

98
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,440
I don't understand what you mean.

99
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,960
Could you

100
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,960
have set that fire?

101
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,960
If this is your game,

102
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,879
I'll play along.

103
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,440
Let go of me!

104
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,100
What are you doing, Young Marshal?

105
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,080
Let go of me!

106
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,399
What are you doing?

107
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,960
First Madam.

108
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,840
Girl,

109
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,759
is this jade pendant

110
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,879
yours?

111
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,679
Yes, it's mine.

112
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,200
I don't remember much from childhood,

113
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,519
but this jade pendant

114
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,679
has been with me.

115
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,960
Aunt,

116
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,399
this is only a jade pendant.

117
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,200
Perhaps

118
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,399
it's just similar.

119
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,360
How did you get that scar

120
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,759
on your back?

121
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,240
I had it since I was little.

122
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,519
I can't remember

123
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,320
what happened.

124
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,159
You fell

125
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,080
from a horse

126
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
and scrapped it.

127
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,879
How do you know?

128
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,799
Because

129
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,759
you're my daughter,

130
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,960
Qingwan.

131
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,799
Qingwan.

132
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,279
Qingwan.

133
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,360
Qingwan.

134
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,919
Qingwan.

135
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,639
My Qingwan.

136
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,879
Miss Yiyi,

137
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,399
what's the big hurry?

138
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,250
Where are you rushing off?

139
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,519
Someone entered the Huo Residence
with bad intentions.

140
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,240
I must tell Uncle.

141
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,399
Who would dare?

142
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,480
The performer you brought in,

143
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,000
Yan Qing.

144
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,380
(Sheng Weilian,
Young Master of the Sheng family)

145
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,759
The good show

146
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,840
