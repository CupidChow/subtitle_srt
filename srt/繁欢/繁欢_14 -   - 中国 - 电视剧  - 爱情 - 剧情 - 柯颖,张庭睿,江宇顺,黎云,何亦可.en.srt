It's all your fault

3
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,000
that the Huo family got me!

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,039
I knew long ago

5
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,359
that you're Huo Beishan's daughter.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,560
You'd betray the Huofeng Gang eventually!

7
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:53,679
Father.

8
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,119
Help me.

9
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:56,600
Father...

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,840
Father, help me.

11
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,200
If you want to cut ties
with the Huofeng Gang,

12
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,040
kill him.

13
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,879
What's it, Qingwan?

14
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,280
You can't bring yourself to do that?

15
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,520
Zhao Xun.

16
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,360
Please don't tell Father.

17
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,639
If not, he'd beat me again.

Don't worry.

00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:33,519

86
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,199
Aunt.

87
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,120
I've been with you for 15 years.

88
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,839
You can't do this to me.

89
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,360
I've been nothing but kind to you.

90
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,279
Besides,

91
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,399
this isn't your home.

92
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,279
You should go home.

93
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,519
Go home?

94
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,800
My father gambled away his property.

95
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,759
To pay his debt,

96
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,240
he sent me here.

97
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,720
Going home will be a dead end for me.

98
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,000
If you had been good,

99
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,040
I would've seen you as my own.

100
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,040
But I owe Qingwan

101
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,040
way too much.

102
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,439
If you try to hurt her,

103
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,560
I won't forgive you.

104
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,439
Now that you have her,

105
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,680
I'm like

106
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,839
a disposable dog, huh?

107
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,920
Huo Qingwan!

108
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,720
Give me back everything
that belongs to me!

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,800
Why did you take away my everything?

110
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,920
Huo Qingwan!

111
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,000
Let go of me!

112
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,560
Huo Qingwan!

113
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,519
Let go!

114
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,079
I hate you!

115
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,759
Let go of me!

(Huo Residence)

117
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,000
Are you here to mock me?

118
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,759
I took a wrong step

119
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,919
by becoming Uncle's pawn.

120
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,320
If it hadn't been for their protection,

121
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,039
you'd be the one

122
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,639
getting chased out of here.

123
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,120
I ever warned you,

124
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,279
but you were unrepentant.

125
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,000
When one runs out of options,

126
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,279
they will take risks, no?

127
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,159
You just happened to be the winner!

128
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,759
You've dropped the act, huh?

129
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,759
We're both women.

130
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,279
We haven't had it easy in this world,

131
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,840
so I didn't want to make things
difficult for you.

132
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,919
But you've framed me
time and time again.

133
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,639
If it weren't for you...

134
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,799
Huo Qingwan.

135
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,919
This is the Huo Residence.

136
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,000
I didn't mean to hurt you.

137
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,840
But since your appearance,

138
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,600
you've taken everything from me.

139
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,240
I've done so much

140
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,159
for Aunt and Weilian.

141
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,000
When you showed up,

142
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,799
they abandoned me.

143
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,720

I'll spare you today.

147

It's because,
even though you're hateful,

148
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,919
you're also pitiful.

149
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,120

150
