1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,740
(Previously)
Mhen.

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,600
Where's that old picture frame

3
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:03,140
that doesn't have anything in it?

4
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,010
It's in those boxes that
haven't been unpacked.

5
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,500
You said you'd unpack
them yourself, didn't you?

6
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,340
I have a project coming up

7
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,870
and would like you
to do the casting for it.

8
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,980
It's on the scale of
major streaming series.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,970
Well, but I…

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,630
You're not fighting this
battle alone anymore.

11
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,992
I want you to give your
all for what you love.

12
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,960
- I made it!
- Are you serious?!

13
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,690
You are amazing.

14
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,280
Some people don't think so.

15
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,470
But you are.

16
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,260
<b>TWO DAYS LATER</b>

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,978
Min, is the whipped cream ready yet?

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,741
Almost.

19
00:00:40,785 --> 00:00:41,250
Just a little more to go.

20
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,190
You're getting good at this.

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,236
Oh, it's getting messy.

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,920
By the way,

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,970
do you throw a birthday party for Mhen

24
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:56,887
every year?

25
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,540
Exactly.

26
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,480
Some years are small, and some big,

27
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,661
but we make sure to do it every year.

28
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,670
How cute you are.

29
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,670
I'm envious.

30
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,670
Why would you be?

31
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,860
I'll throw you a huge
one for your birthday.

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,110
Here, have another cracker.

33
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,320
Your hand is dirty,

34
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,520
and you touched my cheek.

35
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,800
My face is a mess now.

36
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,210
I'll wash it off.

37
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,500
Min!

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,636
What are you up to?

39
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:26,150
It's loud.

40
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:26,661
Hey.

41
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,280
Mhen.

42
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,330
You're not allowed in,

43
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,020
or you won't feel surprised.

44
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:30,610
It was

45
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,058
never

46
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,910
a surprise.

47
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,430
It was

48
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,574
a surprise.

49
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,560
Come on, Mhen.

50
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,080
Just go along with it.

51
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,340
It won't take long.

52
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,870
Don't peek.

53
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,360
Why did you come down here?

54
00:01:41,396 --> 00:01:42,230
Go back upstairs.

55
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:43,380
I'm going to the bathroom.

56
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:43,774
All right.

57
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:44,340
I'll walk you there.

58
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,170
Close your eyes.

59
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,960
Let's go.

60
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,352
- I'll pretend I didn't see anything, then.
- Okay.

61
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:48,490
Nothing is going on.

62
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,100
Our neighbor was just hammering
their door a moment ago.

63
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,690
<b>HBD MHEN, THE BEST BROTHER IN THE WORLD</b>

64
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,380
Happy birthday to you.

65
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,380
Happy birthday to you.

66
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,590
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

67
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,850
Happy birthday to you.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,880
Make a wish!

69
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,580
I hope Min behaves,

70
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,870
stays out of trouble,

71
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,630
and doesn't cause any more headaches.

72
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,850
Make a proper wish,

73
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
and don't forget to wish for yourself, too.

74
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,820
Yay!

75
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,300
I'll be right back.

76
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,600
Dad, Mom,

77
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,312
I've got one for you.

78
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:51,120
Share it, okay?

79
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,350
If it tastes bad,

80
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,550
just spook Min.

81
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,930
These look amazing, Q.

82
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,740
Thank you.

83
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,140
I'm glad you like them, Mhen.

84
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:15,861
Unwrap it now.

85
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,800
Hurry up!

86
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,740
All right.

87
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,680
Min!

88
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,300
Whoa!

89
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,116
What do you think?

90
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:25,390
- Do you like it?
- I really do.

91
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,620
It's so beautiful.

92
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,330
Happy Birthday, Little Boy.

93
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,360
But I've got another surprise for you.

94
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,820
Don't turn around.

95
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,301
Look over here.

96
00:04:35,323 --> 00:04:36,087
Look over here.

97
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:37,978
- That's enough surprises.
- Mhen!

98
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,440
Hey!

99
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,309
- Happy Birthday!
- Jeen, how did you get here?

100
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,500
Nice.

101
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,760
Come take a seat.

102
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,680
Q got me these,

103
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,140
and this one is from Min.

104
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,580
Oh, they look nice.

105
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,290
Now I've got the shoes and the watch.

106
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,460
I just need the shirt and pants.

107
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,160
Come on.

108
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,080
You really love it, don't you?

109
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,410
I've seen you polishing it for ages.

110
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,640
How about bringing it to sleep upstairs?

111
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,970
It would be nice if I could.

112
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,790
I've had this motorcycle

113
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,150
since my parents were still around.

114
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,540
Actually, I almost sold it,

115
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,970
but Mhen wouldn't let me.

116
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,410
Min, Q,

117
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,590
I need to head back now.

118
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,680
Already?

119
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,610
I'll give you a ride.

120
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,780
Really?

121
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,870
I finally get to ride in
the little orange car.

122
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,150
Can I take some photos?

123
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,550
I want to upload them on my IG.

124
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,230
Of course.

125
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,160
Take care of Kanomjeen, okay?

126
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,420
Got it.

127
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,720
I'll drive safely.

128
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,510
Bye-bye.

129
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,100
Bye-bye.

130
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,920
Bye-bye.

131
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,810
Let's go, Jeen.

132
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,829
Q.

133
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,340
Q, you're going to Bangkok

134
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,970
and coming back tomorrow, right?

135
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,650
Why?

136
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,260
I just wanted to say that

137
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,490
driving for such a long distance

138
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,640
must be really tiring.

139
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,970
You have to keep driving back and forth.

140
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,910
Feel free to stay here.

141
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:21,170
This house might be a bit small and old,

142
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,105
but I promise you'll
be comfortable for sure.

143
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,960
You don't have to do anything.

144
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,120
Just sit back and relax.

145
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,010
I'll take care of everything else.

146
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,418
You don't have to handle anything.

147
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,670
I'll bring my stuff back with me

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,990
when I return.

149
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,670
Wherever you are,

150
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,220
that's where I'll be too.

151
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,140
Okay?

152
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,190
Have a safe trip home.

153
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,150
Let me know when you arrive.

154
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,390
Jeen, let's go.

155
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,310
Bye-bye.

156
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,220
Min, bye-bye.

157
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,970
Drive carefully.

158
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,730
Got it.

159
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,850
I'll drive nice and slow.

160
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,850
You acted all tough back then,

161
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,472
pretending that

162
00:07:02,494 --> 00:07:03,350
you kept wanting to run away from him.

163
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:04,160
Come.

164
00:07:04,196 --> 00:07:05,220
Let's wait inside.

165
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,490
Who said I'm waiting?

166
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,490
I'm just taking in the fresh air.

167
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,960
<i>Stop saying you're worried about me.</i>

168
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,330
<i>Where have you been?!</i>

169
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,450
<i>How does this have
something to do with me?!</i>

170
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,410
<i>You love him that much, don't you?</i>

171
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,150
<i>You're the oldest child!</i>

172
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,330
<i>Just the three of you live in this house!</i>

173
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:32,340
<i>If something happened to him,
how would you take responsibility?!</i>

174
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,440
<i>Come here, Min!</i>

175
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,690
<i>How dare you say that?!</i>

176
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,610
<i>Min!</i>

177
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,334
<i>Min, you're his big brother.</i>

178
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,950
<i>Take good care of him.</i>

179
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,530
<i>Dad!</i>

180
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,047
<i>Mom!</i>

181
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,780
It's time for breakfast, everyone!

182
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,970
Min, let's eat.

183
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,160
Mhen!

184
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,447
Let's eat.

185
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:24,661
I got plenty for all of us.

186
00:08:24,698 --> 00:08:26,218
Whoa, you got so much food.

187
00:08:26,254 --> 00:08:27,420
Can we really eat all this?

188
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,250
We'll put some in the fridge if we can't.

189
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,560
You bought more than we need.

190
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,240
I bought chicken with rice you wanted.

191
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,200
Is something up?

192
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,580
What's on your mind?

193
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,170
Nothing.

194
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,360
I'm just resting.

195
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,780
Let's eat.

196
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,180
I'll join you soon.

197
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,090
Min, let's eat

198
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,000
while it's still hot.

199
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,985
Wow.

200
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:05,320
This shop's food is yummy.

201
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,570
Try it, Min.

202
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,500
Take the big piece, Min.

203
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,180
It's stuffed with salted egg.

204
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,530
You haven't eaten anything today.

205
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,570
I'm off to run an errand.

206
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,730
I'll hurry back.

207
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,190
I've got an errand to run today.

208
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,650
<i>Min, where are you?</i>

209
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,330
I'm out running an errand.

210
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,767
It won't take long.

211
00:10:19,796 --> 00:10:20,581
I'll be home soon.

212
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,690
Are you visiting Dad and Mom?

213
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,940
You didn't ask me to come along.

214
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,940
Is something wrong, Min?

215
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,330
Nope.

216
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,300
<i>Just stay home.</i>

217
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm here for a bit

218
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,960
and then head back.

219
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,650
<i>Yeah.</i>

220
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,410
Can I help you with anything, sir?

221
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,590
Oh, no, I'm fine.

222
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,040
Noted.

223
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,890
Spying on me, huh?

224
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,440
Nope.

225
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,290
Come here.

226
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,530
Say hi to my parents.

227
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,894
Dad, Mom,

228
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,334
this is Q, my boyfriend.

229
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,420
Do you like him?

230
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,330
I like him a lot.

231
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,940
He fits my type perfectly.

232
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,720
You're talking this much,

233
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,090
but no kiss to show them?

234
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,770
Can I do that?

235
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,830
I'm kidding.

236
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:53,985
Dad, Mom,

237
00:11:54,021 --> 00:11:54,560
watch this.

238
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,040
Min.

239
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Why did you come to pay
respects to your parents?

240
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Does it have something to do with you

241
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,080
turning down Mangmoom's project?

242
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,420
Mhen, do you want anything?

243
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,160
Chicken with rice, please.

244
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,760
Okay.

245
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,090
Hello, Mangmoom.

246
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,770
I really have to apologize.

247
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,570
Well,

248
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,040
I can't take on your
foreign film project anymore.

249
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,178
Please send my apologies

250
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:58,290
to the director as well.

251
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,860
Why did you do that?

252
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,800
I had a nightmare last night.

253
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,310
I dreamed about my parents.

254
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,420
Even now, I still wonder

255
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,420
if they're still angry with me

256
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,810
for what I did that day
that caused them to die.

257
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,500
For as long as I can remember,

258
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,741
my parents and I never really got along.

259
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:52,974
The older I got,

260
00:13:53,003 --> 00:13:54,240
the more rebellious I became,

261
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,480
and we fought even more.

262
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,290
Everything I did was just my way

263
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,290
of trying to get their attention

264
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,025
because back then,

265
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,000
every second of my parents' attention

266
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,030
was all on Mhen,

267
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,989
and then I suddenly became unimportant

268
00:14:09,003 --> 00:14:09,934
to the family.

269
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,000
When they learned that

270
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:13,200
Mhen had a heart condition

271
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:14,000
since birth,

272
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,490
everyone even put their all into him.

273
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,970
From being an only child,

274
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,220
I became the older sibling.

275
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,690
I was always told

276
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,690
that everything I had
needed to be split in half.

277
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,000
Egg yolk, your favorite, Mhen.

278
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,690
Whether it's food,

279
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,940
Eat up, so you'll be healthy.

280
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,660
Great job.

281
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,180
Belongings

282
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,620
and time.

283
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,003
Q, I know it might sound silly

284
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:35,607
that I'm sitting here

285
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:37,003
feeling jealous of my little brother.

286
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,820
But seeing my parents
willing to move out of

287
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,454
the only home they've
known their whole lives

288
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,298
to Bangkok,

289
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,470
just for Mhen,

290
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:46,210
and forcing me to leave
all my friends behind,

291
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,272
made me even angrier at them.

292
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,840
That's when I started acting out more.

293
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,220
Where have you been?!

294
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,010
You went out,

295
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,840
leaving your brother home alone.

296
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,349
If something happened to him,

297
00:15:02,356 --> 00:15:03,040
how would you take responsibility?!

298
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,490
If you love him so much,

299
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:04,400
just take care of him!

300
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,060
You don't need me.

301
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,600
Just the three of you live in this house!

302
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,912
How dare you say that?!

303
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:08,280
Huh?

304
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,930
Hey!

305
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,410
That night, I meant to run away

306
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,378
somewhere my parents couldn't find me.

307
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,320
They drove around all night
looking for me, Q.

308
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,940
If I hadn't acted that way that day,

309
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,510
my parents might still be here.

310
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,900
I keep blaming myself

311
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,900
for being damn unreasonable.

312
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,570
Mhen didn't do anything wrong.

313
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,570
I try to make it up to Mhen,

314
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,650
to give him comfort

315
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,480
and help him live the life

316
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,200
my parents wanted for him.

317
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,236
I give Mhen everything I have,

318
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,750
whether it's food,

319
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,440
belongings,

320
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,060
time,

321
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,920
or even money.

322
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,734
To me, they all belong to him.

323
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,872
I know that no matter how much I give,

324
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,410
it'll never be enough to make up

325
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,080
for him losing our parents because of me.

326
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,920
That's why I decided

327
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:23,469
to reject Mangmoom's offer

328
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,010
because I know full well that

329
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,960
someone like me doesn't
deserve anything good.

330
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
As long as Mhen is still sick,

331
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
my life doesn't deserve happiness.

332
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,380
I really can't leave Mhen behind

333
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,470
because everything I do today,

334
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,560
no matter how much effort I put in,

335
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,650
will never make up

336
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,340
for what I took away from him.

337
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:13,970
The whole thing was an accident.

338
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,150
You didn't do anything wrong.

339
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,370
Keep this in mind.

340
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,570
You really didn't do anything wrong, Min.

341
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,141
You're the best brother for Mhen.

342
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,796
Mhen, come eat some snacks.

343
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:13,410
I bought tons for you.

344
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,120
Mhen.

345
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,120
Eh?

346
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,980
Mhen!

347
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:23,080
Is he in the bathroom?

348
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,650
When I left home, he was still here.

349
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,880
Come downstairs for snacks, Mhen.

350
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,530
I'll head upstairs to check.

351
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,330
Mhen!

352
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,710
Mhen!

353
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,590
Mhen!

354
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,460
Mhen!

355
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,570
Where is he?

356
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,400
Mhen!

357
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,290
Mhen!

358
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:44,930
Hey.

359
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,407
Hey, bro.

360
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,960
Did you see Mhen around?

361
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,850
You guys didn't meet up?

362
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,050
I saw him leave the house.

363
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,901
He said he was going to meet you

364
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:51,600
at the cemetery.

365
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,840
Thank you so much.

366
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,210
Thank you.

367
00:18:59,560 --> 00:18:59,978
Do you think

368
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:01,469
Mhen overheard our conversation?

369
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,120
Excuse me,

370
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,480
have you seen this boy?

371
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,530
I haven't.

372
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:11,920
Excuse me,

373
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,870
have you seen this boy?

374
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,630
Thank you so much.

375
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,940
Pop.

376
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,590
Have you seen Mhen around?

377
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,030
I haven't seen him today.

378
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,330
I can't reach Mhen.

379
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,580
I don't know where he has gone.

380
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,570
Dad, I need your help.

381
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,040
Please, just this one time.

382
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,740
Can you help Min?

383
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,330
<i>What do you want?</i>

384
00:19:37,352 --> 00:19:38,087
<i>What is it?</i>

385
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,520
I've found proof that

386
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,300
Mhen bought a bus ticket to Bangkok.

387
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,130
Bangkok?

388
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,900
Why did he head back to Bangkok?

389
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,480
If you spot Mhen near your place,

390
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,620
call me right away, Jeen.

391
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,410
<i>Sure, Min.</i>

392
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,620
<i>I'll keep an eye out for you.</i>

393
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,540
Relax, Min.

394
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,820
We'll find him, no matter what.

395
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,803
Min, eat this.

396
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,700
You haven't eaten anything all day.

397
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:50,690
Min,

398
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,310
eat this.

399
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,500
I'm worried you'll pass out.

400
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,330
Take the big piece.

401
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,730
You haven't eaten anything today.

402
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,360
Before my parents passed,

403
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,290
Mhen and I weren't close.

404
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,800
I never really treated him well.

405
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,730
Even on the day my parents passed,

406
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,960
I couldn't bring myself to talk to Mhen.

407
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,070
I couldn't even face him.

408
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,300
I was just by myself.

409
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,930
I couldn't even eat anything.

410
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:40,894
I just stood there,

411
00:21:40,923 --> 00:21:41,740
watching my relatives argue

412
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,440
about who would take care of who.

413
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,030
Can you take them with you?

414
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,080
My family can't handle them.

415
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,130
If I do,

416
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,390
I can only take one of them.

417
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,730
How about you take the youngest?

418
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,789
Min, tell Mhen to hurry and pack his stuff.

419
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,940
My house is far from here.

420
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,660
That day,

421
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,654
I didn't even care who'd adopt Mhen

422
00:22:04,683 --> 00:22:06,923
because I usually never cared about him.

423
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,210
Min, take the big piece.

424
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,900
It's stuffed with salted eggs.

425
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,420
You haven't eaten anything today.

426
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,900
I'm giving this to you.

427
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,900
Min.

428
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,570
Min, can you stay with me?

429
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,060
I already lost our parents.

430
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,970
I don't want to lose you, too.

431
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,901
I worry about you not eating

432
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,190
if you don't live with me.

433
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,050
It's just you, Min.

434
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,150
I can take care of you.

435
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,340
But you know what?

436
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,510
While I was the one

437
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,190
who kept pushing Mhen out of my life,

438
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,410
Mhen never hated me.

439
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,340
He worries about me

440
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,170
more than I do myself.

441
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,230
I have to find Mhen.

442
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,510
He means a lot to me.

443
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:39,352
Min, we'll find him, no matter what.

444
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
Hello, James?

445
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,590
I'm not available to talk now.

446
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,389
<i>Min, don't doubt the reason now.</i>

447
00:23:57,418 --> 00:23:59,010
<i>I'm with Mhen at the hospital.</i>

448
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,230
<i>Hurry here.</i>

449
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,340
Get in the car.

450
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,150
Mhen.

451
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,160
How are you feeling?

452
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,520
I'm feeling better now.

453
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,040
How did you meet James?

454
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,992
Before I called you

455
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:37,490
while you were at the cemetery,

456
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,180
I found Mangmoom's name card

457
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,410
lying behind our house.

458
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,450
When I saw that you had thrown it away,

459
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,847
I felt like you were acting strangely,

460
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,900
so I went to the cemetery

461
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,120
and heard the whole conversation.

462
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,780
So, I called Mangmoom.

463
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,363
I'm Mhen, Min's brother.

464
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,450
He asked me to tell you that

465
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,640
he's changed his mind already.

466
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,330
Could you please forward his casting video

467
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:08,590
to the international team?

468
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,690
Well,

469
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,300
I've already sent all the files

470
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,920
and notified the investors.

471
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,760
I really don't think

472
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:15,629
it's going to be in time.

473
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,800
Can you please talk to that team again?

474
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,800
My brother really has changed his mind.

475
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,700
Hey,

476
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,430
if you really want your
brother to get this job,

477
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,880
come talk to me face-to-face.

478
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,020
If I come to see you in Bangkok,

479
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,650
you'll agree to talk to the team, right?

480
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,450
<i>Yeah, just come!</i>

481
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,640
So, I came to Bangkok to meet him.

482
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,240
Hello.

483
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:37,265
Hello.

484
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,540
You're the director, right?

485
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,300
I'm Mhen,

486
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,196
who talked to you on the phone

487
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:40,890
earlier today.

488
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,767
Hey?!

489
00:25:41,796 --> 00:25:43,490
You really dare to come?

490
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:44,821
I won't talk to anyone.

491
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,190
So what?

492
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,750
But you promised me.

493
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,880
Why are you saying this?

494
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,509
Hey, anyone,

495
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:52,100
get him out of here!

496
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,000
Why are you talking like this?

497
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,960
I came all the way here.

498
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,750
Get him out of here!

499
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,367
If you can't do something,

500
00:25:55,396 --> 00:25:56,070
don't say it next time.

501
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:57,694
- Hey, call the police now.
- I'm not leaving!

502
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:57,905
Mhen.

503
00:25:57,934 --> 00:25:58,490
Mhen.

504
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,600
He's my brother.

505
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,970
- Quickly get him out of here.
- I'm not leaving!

506
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,130
Don't come back here again!

507
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,760
Someone like you won't live to be old!

508
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,310
Mhen, you can't do this.

509
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,180
Don't do something like this again.

510
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,069
Hey, what the hell?

511
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,330
What's wrong with you?

512
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,220
Mhen!

513
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,960
Mhen!

514
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,290
I probably moved around too much,

515
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,400
so the pacemaker wire shifted.

516
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,501
The doctor said a minor surgery to fix it

517
00:26:32,538 --> 00:26:33,680
should help me recover.

518
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,400
There's nothing to worry about.

519
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,300
Have you eaten anything?

520
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,570
You keep worrying about others.

521
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,230
How about you?

522
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,490
Have you eaten anything?

523
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,740
I heard what you said about

524
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,781
everything you've done not being enough.

525
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,340
But for me,

526
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,200
what you've done is enough.

527
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,930
I've known

528
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,930
and seen your effort.

529
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,660
Hey, I'm giving you this one.

530
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,450
Take it.

531
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,240
Taste it.

532
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,505
It's delicious.

533
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:08,560
I don't eat egg yolk.

534
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,430
It feels thick in my throat.

535
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,630
Just give me anything you won't eat.

536
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,670
I'll eat them.

537
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,280
You bought things for me

538
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:16,530
or gave me more food
than you took for yourself.

539
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,200
I can understand sharing food,

540
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,825
but the fact that

541
00:27:19,854 --> 00:27:21,323
you're willing to give up everything for me

542
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,230
is really too much for me to accept.

543
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,110
I won't feel at ease

544
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,110
any day that you haven't eaten.

545
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,978
I can't be happy if you aren't happy, Min.

546
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,410
Before I go into surgery,

547
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,550
can I ask you

548
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,720
to forgive yourself?

549
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,980
I have never been angry

550
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,370
about all the mistakes you've made.

551
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,247
I can't be without you either.

552
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,730
Besides,

553
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,980
I'm not the only one who lost our parents.

554
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,230
You lost everything, too.

555
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,540
I feel it's unfair

556
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,105
that you have to carry everything alone.

557
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,410
You're just three years older than me,

558
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,450
and I don't see how you're better than me.

559
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,301
Stop trying to act cool, Mr.Hero.

560
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,560
Okay?

561
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,200
Hey,

562
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,901
I think you guys should take some rest.

563
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,200
It's been a long day.

564
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,701
I'll take care of it here.

565
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,570
I have no house in Bangkok

566
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,680
to go back to anymore.

567
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,010
Min.

568
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,520
You can sleep at my place.

569
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,720
Thank you so much.

570
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,261
I'm glad that on the days

571
00:29:20,298 --> 00:29:21,200
when I have no one,

572
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,300
I still have you.

573
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,300
You're not alone anymore, Min.

574
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,600
You still have Mhen, your brother,

575
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:31,476
Jeen, and James.

576
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,196
You know they love you a lot, right?

577
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,190
But still,

578
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,950
I really have to thank you

579
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,990
for being in my life.

580
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,930
Min, listen up.

581
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:54,320
No matter how you were before

582
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,430
or what the past was like,

583
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,530
it doesn't matter to me at all

584
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,180
because ever since I met you,

585
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,887
you're still my good boy, always.

586
00:30:06,923 --> 00:30:08,618
Hmm? Good boy?

587
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,290
You're just teasing me

588
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:13,672
and calling me a dog again, huh?

589
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,960
<b>I'M VISITING MHEN AT THE HOSPITAL.</b>

590
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,960
Thank you so much, Mr. Kacha,

591
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,680
for helping me this time.

592
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,101
Consider it compensation

593
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,560
for all the chaos

594
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,887
Q has caused in your life.

595
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,083
Yes.

596
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,418
How is your brother now?

597
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,141
Mr. Kacha,

598
00:32:05,178 --> 00:32:06,676
you also know about Mhen and me?

599
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,840
I know everything related to Q,

600
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,790
including everyone around him.

601
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,745
It seems you worry about Q a lot.

602
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,978
Why don't you show

603
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,429
that you really care about him?

604
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,880
Q has walls around him.

605
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,949
Whatever I say,

606
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,378
he often opposes it.

607
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,749
But as far as I know,

608
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,556
while Q was at my place,

609
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,167
he seemed really worried about you.

610
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,916
Everything he has done

611
00:32:56,945 --> 00:32:58,080
might seem dangerous,

612
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,712
but he really wanted you to be safe.

613
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm just wondering

614
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,389
why you haven't given him

615
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,807
what he wants sometimes...

616
00:33:10,276 --> 00:33:12,270
that he wants you to quit your job.

617
00:33:22,574 --> 00:33:24,570
My duty is necessary,

618
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,214
and most importantly,

619
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,847
someone has to make sacrifices.

620
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,018
But Q wasn't ready to sacrifice his mom.

621
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,589
He isn't ready to sacrifice you either.

622
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,218
In fact, Q worries a lot about you.

623
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,054
I only have one family member left, too,

624
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:05,149
so I understand how scary it must be for Q

625
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,207
to face that kind of loss again.

626
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,585
This time, he'll be left with nobody.

627
00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:13,060
If you show him that

628
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,927
you truly understand how he feels

629
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,581
and genuinely try for him,

630
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:21,470
I think everything will get better.

631
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,298
Please excuse me for now.

632
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:34,821
Min.

633
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,701
Yes?

634
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,207
How…

635
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,672
How…should I start?

636
00:34:50,261 --> 00:34:52,260
I'll try to talk to Q for you.

637
00:34:56,414 --> 00:34:57,512
Thank you so much.

638
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:22,501
Why didn't you wake me up

639
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:23,549
when you came to see Mhen?

640
00:35:23,563 --> 00:35:24,858
I saw you sleeping soundly,

641
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,080
so I didn't want to disturb you.

642
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,978
How are you feeling, Mhen?

643
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,410
Better.

644
00:35:31,774 --> 00:35:32,472
After a bit of rest,

645
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,658
I think I can be discharged.

646
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,265
That's good.

647
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,250
Here you are.

648
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,916
You haven't had breakfast yet.

649
00:35:42,938 --> 00:35:44,458
You can have my boiled egg.

650
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,265
Let's do this.

651
00:35:53,265 --> 00:35:54,203
Half for each.

652
00:35:54,232 --> 00:35:54,749
You take one half,

653
00:35:54,756 --> 00:35:55,665
and I take the other.

654
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,156
This is exactly equal.

655
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,705
Let's do it this way from now on.

656
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,796
You won't leave anything behind

657
00:36:07,818 --> 00:36:08,923
just for me anymore, right?

658
00:36:12,552 --> 00:36:13,112
Yeah.

659
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,181
Good boy.

660
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:19,047
Good boy.

661
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,040
Good boy.

662
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:25,970
You shared it with him,

663
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,280
so eat yours, too.

664
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:29,047
Half for each of us.

665
00:36:37,803 --> 00:36:38,676
How are you feeling now?

666
00:36:38,705 --> 00:36:40,421
You feel more at ease, right?

667
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,345
How many years have you been keeping this

668
00:36:41,374 --> 00:36:42,210
just to yourself?

669
00:36:42,603 --> 00:36:43,527
It's such a relief.

670
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,127
After we really got to talk things out,

671
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:46,400
I now feel a lot more relieved.

672
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,483
Honestly,

673
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:01,990
I've felt relieved

674
00:37:02,029 --> 00:37:03,760
ever since I talked to you back then.

675
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,138
Thank you so much

676
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:07,229
for being by my side.

677
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,978
After you stepped in,

678
00:37:10,007 --> 00:37:11,272
my life has become a lot easier.

679
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,578
What?

680
00:37:13,985 --> 00:37:15,680
I didn't do anything for you today.

681
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:16,625
You already did.

682
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,501
What did I do?

683
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,516
You're just staying by my side.

684
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,970
Back then, when I was by myself,

685
00:37:24,523 --> 00:37:25,672
things were a lot tougher.

686
00:37:26,574 --> 00:37:27,636
My pleasure.

687
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,330
Stay by my side like this forever.

688
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:32,778
Are you proposing?

689
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,872
Proposing? No.

690
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,843
But if you say yes,

691
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,585
then I'm okay with it.

692
00:37:39,614 --> 00:37:40,138
No problem at all.

693
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:43,956
Who would want to marry

694
00:37:43,985 --> 00:37:44,792
someone messy like you?

695
00:37:45,025 --> 00:37:45,978
Messy?

696
00:37:46,152 --> 00:37:47,236
I'm super handsome.

697
00:37:49,003 --> 00:37:50,407
Let me have a look.

698
00:37:51,985 --> 00:37:53,980
We're both messy.

699
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,018
You're the messiest one ever.

700
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:46,443
Have you ever thought that

701
00:38:46,465 --> 00:38:48,690
if someone else was here instead of me,

702
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,974
your life might be a whole lot better?

703
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,447
Just seeing you smile and laugh

704
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:55,498
is enough to make me happy.

705
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,036
Hey!

706
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:05,425
Ouch!

707
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,843
I'm sorry that

708
00:39:08,872 --> 00:39:10,712
this is all I can do for you, Q.
