1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,920
Min, I want you to see with your own eyes

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,480
that your brother is now cooler than you.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,920
Without Q,
I wouldn't get to do this kind of thing.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,280
Don't forget to say sorry to him.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,640
You're pretty smooth.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,960
Q.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,120
You caught a cold too?

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,880
Wait here. I'll get you some medicine.

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,760
Min.

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,440
I'm really sorry.

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,760
It's all right, Q. It's all right.
I'm not mad anymore.

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,280
I'm sorry too.

13
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,160
If I had someone who loved me

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,640
the way you love Mhen,

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,880
I wouldn't ask for anything else
in my life.

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,000
Do you want to eat something?

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,520
I don't really eat breakfast.

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,480
I'm feeding you,
but you still get your mouth dirty.

19
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,520
Come on, no.

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,200
-That's my mole.
-Really?

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,480
Do you have to go that far?

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,440
You've got hands, so hold it yourself.

23
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,480
Just die already!

24
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,240
Jack. I've treated you terribly
all this time.

25
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,320
Why are you still protecting me this much?

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,960
-Hey.
-Min!

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,720
Min, I think the script
doesn't make any sense at all.

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,840
Who would really die
in someone else's place?

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,640
I could. I think I could die
in Mhen's place.

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,040
You don't need to do that.

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,520
But that's your brother.

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,480
This is a person
who has nothing to do with you.

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,960
It's a one-sided love.

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,800
Who would do that much for someone?

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,080
Why are you being so serious? It's my role
and I don't care about the script.

36
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,000
That's why your acting sucks.

37
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,360
So what?

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,120
Min, by the way,
aren't you doing your new job anymore?

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,800
Why are you doing a stuntman job?

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,160
I can take on stunt work if the schedule
doesn't conflict. Monday is my day off.

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,200
I see.

42
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,160
I'm off to work soon.
I'm just relaxing here for a bit first.

43
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,160
But I think you should try other jobs.

44
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,520
Seeing your acting just now,
I feel sorry for the director.

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,520
Did my acting suck that much?

46
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,200
Yes. What's your problem?

47
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,120
It didn't suck.

48
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,120
It just wasn't good.

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,640
Your acting is excellent, isn't it?
Show me now.

50
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,080
-Let me go! Don't! Let me go!
-Bang! Bang! Bang!

51
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,480
Hey, young man.

52
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,080
-Yes?
-Did you forget your keycard?

53
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

54
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,800
Don't forget it next time.

55
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,000
Got it.

56
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm here to switch shifts.

57
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,600
Are you sure

58
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,600
the evidence Phoom has
won't be handed over to Kacha?

59
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,680
If Kacha gets it, we're all screwed.

60
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,959
Yes.

61
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,320
Why are you doing this?

62
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,760
Because of your dad.

63
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,920
I can bow down at your feet.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,320
Please help my son.

65
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,320
That day, my dad didn't take any money
from that woman.

66
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
If you're sure your son is innocent,

67
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,880
he'll be cleared of all charges.

68
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,520
I know my dad well.

69
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,400
I've already handled that for you.

70
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,360
It'd be better if he was dead.

71
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,800
Go find out what Kacha's weakness is.

72
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,840
Noted.

73
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,720
How do I do this?

74
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,080
Q, you aren't done yet?

75
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,560
Mhen, this isn't fun anymore.
Untie it for me.

76
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,400
Nope. Do it yourself
so you learn how to do it.

77
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,040
If Min were here, he would do it for me.

78
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,680
So, are you and Min really just friends?

79
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,560
Of course. Don't we look like friends?

80
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,720
You don't.

81
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,160
Not even close.

82
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,880
Especially Min.

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
How so?

84
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,120
He fed you meals and snacks.
He even wiped your mouth for you.

85
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,120
Just seeing your face
makes him super happy.

86
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,120
And remember that tee
he's so protective of?

87
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,080
He let you wear it.

88
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,040
Think about it.

89
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,960
Do any of your friends do these things?

90
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,080
No.

91
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,200
-I don't have any friends.
-Come on.

92
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,840
I asked

93
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
because I've never seen Min
like this before.

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,920
I raised him myself.
How could I not notice it?

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,600
I just want to know…

96
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,280
if Min really has feelings for you,
are you okay with that, Q?

97
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,400
Come on, Mhen.

98
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,360
That can't be true.

99
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,400
Min doesn't feel anything for me.

100
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,800
If he did, I would have felt it by now.

101
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,120
I don't feel anything.

102
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,680
Fine. He doesn't feel anything.

103
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,960
-Let me untie it for you.
-Here.

104
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,240
PHYSICS GRADE 10-12

105
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,960
This is Min's keycard.

106
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,280
He forgot to bring it with him,
so will he be in trouble now?

107
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,240
I bet he is.

108
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,720
I guess I should bring it to him.

109
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,800
But the sunlight
is very strong today, isn't it?

110
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,000
If I bring it to him,
I guess I'll catch a cold.

111
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,320
But that's fine.

112
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,120
All right.

113
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,760
I'll bring it to him.

114
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,560
Just this one, right?

115
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Yep.

116
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,560
If you were just friends,

117
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,200
you wouldn't leave work,

118
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,320
drop everything,

119
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,880
and rush over to him

120
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,560
wagging your tail
like you haven't met in ages.

121
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,200
Also,

122
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,240
friends don't get shy
when they kiss each other's cheeks.

123
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,080
Try kissing Min's cheek

124
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,320
so you'll know
if you're really just friends.

125
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,520
Nonsense, Mhen. I'm off.

126
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,520
Let me borrow your phone
in case I need to reach Min.

127
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,000
Sure. Go ahead.

128
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,480
Go find out what Kacha's weakness is.

129
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,120
Your break time is up.
Why aren't you out there working yet?

130
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Is something wrong?

131
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
I… want to know how much longer I have to
work here to pay off my debt to Miss Yada.

132
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,080
Miss Yada doesn't need
that sum of money back.

133
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,560
Then,

134
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,360
can I quit this job?

135
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,160
There's one thing you need to know.

136
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,640
Once you're in this circle,
you can't get out.

137
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,320
Got it.

138
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,160
Min, I'm in front of the restaurant.

139
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,960
You forgot your keycard, so I brought it.

140
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,360
Q…

141
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,360
Thank you.

142
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,680
MIN, I'M IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT.
YOU FORGOT YOUR KEYCARD, SO I BROUGHT IT.

143
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
Don't come.

144
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,960
I don't need it anymore.

145
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,520
Min.

146
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,080
-Yes?
-Come help me check the supplies.

147
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,000
But I'm a guard.

148
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,840
Come on. I told you to come, so just come.

149
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,600
Got it.

150
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,160
Don't come. I don't need it anymore.

151
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,880
Be quick.

152
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,560
Be careful of those things.

153
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,360
MIN CALLING

154
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,680
Put your phone away.

155
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,240
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,840
Hurry up and check everything.

157
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
You, follow me.

158
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,520
The rest of you, keep an eye on these.

159
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,720
It's you.

160
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,200
Where are you going?

161
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,120
I'm not sure if you remember me.

162
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,480
I'm Yada.

163
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,440
How could you get here?

164
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,440
Did your dad know you're here?

165
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,920
What do you want? Just be straightforward.

166
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,440
You have issues with your dad, right?

167
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,520
If we share similar problems,

168
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,560
then we could cooperate.

169
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,160
What do you mean?

170
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,920
I want your dad

171
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,360
to back off from the burned warehouse case
that's in the news.

172
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,400
You're behind this case, aren't you?

173
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,520
So, that means you tried to hurt my dad.

174
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,320
That's right.

175
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,120
I was behind everything.

176
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,480
But your dad is more stubborn
than I thought.

177
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,400
He caused trouble for everyone.

178
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,360
I've been trying to find an easy way,

179
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,160
but I'm afraid…

180
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,920
I'll need to ask
for your help and cooperation…

181
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,880
since we can…

182
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,280
probably work out a win-win deal.

183
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,320
If I cooperate with you,
can you promise my dad will--

184
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,920
I promise.

185
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,600
I promise your dad and you will be safe…

186
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,040
as long as your dad
steps away from this case

187
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,480
and doesn't get involved again.

188
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,560
Any more questions?

189
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Is that guy, Min,

190
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
one of your men?

191
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,000
He's my favorite.

192
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,520
You know him?

193
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,400
Please excuse me for a second.

194
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,040
Miss Yada, there's been a bit of an issue
with the electrical system.

195
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,000
It's best if you come with me quickly
for your safety.

196
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,600
-But I'm talking with my guest.
-I'll handle that for you.

197
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,120
Please come with me quickly.

198
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,880
Please, Miss Yada.

199
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,080
Q, let's go!

200
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,880
Get on! Now!

201
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,960
Hey, Min. Pull over.

202
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,680
Min, pull over now.

203
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,480
Hey, where are you going?

204
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,960
You're with the people
who want my dad dead?

205
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,120
Hold on. Relax.

206
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,400
Listen. I can explain.

207
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,200
I also only just found out
she's against your dad.

208
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,400
You only just found out?

209
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,440
Why were you so determined
to stop me from going to the casino?

210
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,080
Or were you afraid
I'd find out you were working for her?

211
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,280
Why did you lie to me?

212
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Answer me.

213
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,200
Q, that's not it. Calm down.

214
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,400
I'm working to earn money

215
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,920
to pay back the person
who hired me to kidnap you.

216
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,440
Seriously, I just found out today
who they are.

217
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,360
I already tried to quit
so they wouldn't get to you through me.

218
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,800
I've done this much,
but you still don't trust me?

219
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,360
Why are you doing this for me?

220
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,120
The money you're going
to pay him back with,

221
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,800
you got it from here, didn't you?

222
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,760
Answer me.

223
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,080
Do you think I'm that kind of person?

224
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,360
After all this time,
you don't know me at all, do you?

225
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,760
Whoa, what happened to you?

226
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,920
You're all bruised.

227
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,520
Ouch.

228
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,880
Oh, something just fell on me.

229
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,520
It's nothing. I'm totally fine.

230
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,440
Okay then.

231
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,800
I thought you'd thrown yourself in front
of a bullet for Q like in the script.

232
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,760
If I did that,
it would be a pointless death.

233
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,120
But if someone hired you,
you probably would.

234
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,720
What happened?

235
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,600
In your opinion,

236
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,040
what kind of person is Min?

237
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,560
He's like this character Jack.

238
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,880
He keeps protecting others

239
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,400
but ends up hurting himself.

240
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,880
FATHER OF HEROIN WAREHOUSE CASE SUSPECT
DIES AFTER CAR CRASHES INTO TREE

241
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,880
POLICE INVESTIGATING POSSIBILITY OF MURDER

242
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,120
This is the evidence found at the scene.

243
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,800
I believe Mr. Phoom meant
for you to have it.

244
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,520
Thanks a lot for the heads-up about Yada.

245
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,840
Don't feel bad.

246
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,480
At least you warned me in time

247
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,200
about her plan to send her men to kill me

248
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,680
at the spot where I was supposed
to get Phoom's evidence.

249
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,720
But I couldn't save his life.

250
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,720
Don't blame yourself.

251
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,200
The role of a police informant like you

252
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,840
will be beneficial
to the case involving his son.

253
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,760
I believe we can track down Yada
and bring her to justice.

254
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,320
How has the work been going so far?

255
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,480
Are you safe?

256
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,200
Where are you going?

257
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,280
Miss Yada still doesn't know
that I'm the informant,

258
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,320
but there's a high risk
I might get caught.

259
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,960
So, what did you call me here for today?

260
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,680
Miss Yada has already met with Mr. Q.

261
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,320
You thought letting him stay with Min
would be safer than having him at home,

262
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,000
but the situation has now changed.

263
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,600
I think

264
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,200
both of them are going to be
in danger soon.

URGENT SALE

266
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,760
I'll sleep downstairs

267
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,800
so you can be comfortable.

268
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,920
Or you can head back home if you want.

269
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,760
It's not like
you've really been kidnapped.

270
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,280
Help! Dad! Dad!

271
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,840
Dad, help me!

272
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,200
Mom! Don't!

273
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,640
Mom!

274
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,400
Mom!

275
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,680
Mom!

276
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,800
Mom!

277
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,040
Mom!

278
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,800
Mom!

279
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,720
Mom!

280
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,560
Dad!

281
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,840
I'm here.

282
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,840
Sleep.

283
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,440
Everything is all right.
You were just sleepwalking.

284
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,680
I have to tuck you in every night

285
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,280
so I can have some peace, right?

286
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,600
Are you okay? Q?

287
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,440
Breathe in and out.

288
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,120
If I had someone who loved me
the way you love Mhen,

289
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,240
I wouldn't ask for anything else
in my life.

290
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,520
Min!

291
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,800
You're safe now.

292
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,440
Everything is all right. I'm here.

293
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,040
You're mad at me, aren't you?

294
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,640
You're the one who's mad.

295
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,880
You're okay now. Everything is fine.

296
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,800
I'm heading back.

297
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,040
Min.

298
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,920
When I asked how I could trust you,

299
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,000
I really needed an answer.

300
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,920
Just give me any answer.

301
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,440
I want to understand

302
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,720
the reason behind everything you've done.

303
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,600
I don't want to feel like this anymore.

304
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,760
I don't want to wake up alone again, Min.

305
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,800
I don't know if you'll believe
what I'm going to say.

306
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,120
I really don't know.

307
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,880
I hate seeing you cry.

308
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
When I see you hurt,

309
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,440
it hurts me even more.

310
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,520
I really don't know why, Q,

311
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,160
but I just can't stand seeing you in pain.

312
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,360
I've never lied to you…

313
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,000
even once, seriously.

314
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,560
I may not have all the answers right now…

315
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,560
but you can trust me.

316
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,920
Promise me

317
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,120
you won't let go of my hands.

318
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,400
I promise.

319
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Min, stand in for Ryukyu
in this scene for me

320
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,120
but make sure your face
doesn't show on camera.

321
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,920
The camera will focus on Miki first,

322
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,800
and in the next cut, Ryukyu will come in.

323
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,760
Sure.

324
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,240
-Got it? Let's film it up to that.
-Yeah.

325
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,840
-Okay.
-All right.

326
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,200
Clear the set, please.
Let's get to work. Let's start.

327
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,760
Go.

328
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,680
Let's get moving.

329
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,320
Camera.

330
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,360
Three, two, and action.

331
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,800
Just die already!

332
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,160
Hey!

333
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,320
You're mad at me, aren't you?

334
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,120
Can I ask you something?

335
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
All this time…

336
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,000
I've treated you terribly.

337
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,000
Why are you still protecting me this much?

338
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,120
That's because I can't stand…
seeing the person I love in pain.

339
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,960
Min, you nailed it!

340
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,560
He should be the leading man
in your next project, bro.

341
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,000
Min, great job.

342
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,240
Come on. Let's watch the playback.

URGENT SALE

344
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,840
What do you want?

345
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,400
I want to eat that snack,

346
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,280
not a dog.

347
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,680
Are you calling me a dog?

348
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,840
You're not one?

349
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,640
I'll open it for you.

350
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,760
Here.

351
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,720
Look at you, smiling so sweetly.

352
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,200
Hey, it's stained all over.

353
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Eat it up.

354
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,360
How grubby you are.

355
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,080
Aren't you working at the casino anymore?

356
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,520
Since the fire,
they've told me to take a break.

357
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,200
But honestly,
I don't want to work there anymore.

358
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,000
I'll find a way to quit.

359
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,280
But you'll be safe, right?

360
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,920
Q,

361
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,120
listen up.

362
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,920
I won't let anyone hurt you.

363
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,920
Trust me.

364
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,200
As long as I'm here,

365
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,920
-I'll--
-Min, watch out!

366
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,400
-Ouch!
-Q, who's that?

367
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,480
Asshole.

368
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,320
Man, you've got a hell of an aim.

369
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,040
Come on, James.

370
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,000
-My head's probably bleeding now.
-What are you doing here at this hour?

371
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,080
What were you playing at? You scared us.

372
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Come on. Let's talk about you, bro.

373
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,600
The kidnap job is already over,
but why haven't you gone home yet?

374
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,000
Gotcha.

375
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,560
Or is there some heart stuff going on
between you two?

376
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,560
What are you talking about, James?
Nonsense. Not now.

377
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,360
-What are you doing here?
-Right.

378
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,040
-I have something important to tell you.
-Important?

379
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,040
Phoom,

380
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,440
the guy who hired us to kidnap Q…

381
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,360
is dead.

382
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,440
According to the news,
it hasn't been confirmed yet

383
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,880
if it was an accident or murder.

384
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,000
But if it turns out to be the latter,

385
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,880
I wouldn't be too surprised.

386
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,840
But your dad
isn't letting this case go at all.

387
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,719
He gave an interview
saying he'd oversee every step closely.

388
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,000
Damn, that's so cool!

389
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,760
Are you okay?

390
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Yeah.

391
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,040
Are you worried about your dad?

392
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,280
Do you want to talk to him?

393
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,840
I'll lend you my phone.

394
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,760
No.

395
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,720
I have nothing left to say to him.

396
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,080
I've already said it all.

397
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,840
Well, then,

398
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,720
is there anything I can do
to lift your mood?

399
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,640
It can be anything that stops me
from thinking about all this.

400
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,880
I've got an idea.

401
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,520
Why did you bring me to the set?

402
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,920
Just follow me.

403
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,640
Hello. Hello.

404
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,040
I'm bringing my friend along.

405
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,320
-Hello.
-Hello.

406
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,240
Lie down.

407
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,520
Seriously. Don't be scared.

408
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,680
Smile a bit.

409
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,680
Come on, Min.

410
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,040
Throw up two fingers.

411
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,400
You look adorable.

412
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,800
-No, that's not it.
-It's not?

413
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,120
Do the zombie move like this.

414
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,560
Get all twisted.
Your legs should look more deformed.

415
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,480
That's right.

416
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,400
-Like this?
-Yeah. That's right.

417
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,320
Keep doing that.

418
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,480
Do you always get to work like this?

419
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,880
Do you think it's fun?

420
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,720
Yeah. It's fun.

421
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,960
-Do you want to come again next time?
-Yeah.

422
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,480
So it's a promise?

423
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,280
Yeah. I promise.

424
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,000
Min, if I really
turned into a zombie one day,

425
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,240
would you dare to shoot me?

426
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,760
Do you trust me or not?

427
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,880
I would never let you turn into a zombie.

428
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,840
But if I ever turn into one,

429
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,720
you must run away from me.

430
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,120
Why?

431
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,680
My life wouldn't matter.

432
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,800
It's fine if I die.

433
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,320
But if I had to watch you die…

434
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,640
I don't think I could handle it.

435
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,760
So, if one day, I become
the reason that you're in danger…

436
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,560
you must run away from me
as far as you can.

437
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,280
Who are you here to see?

438
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,000
-Mhen, who's that?
-Min.

439
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,440
How could you do that?

440
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,400
I don't need treatment anymore if it means
trading it for something like this.

441
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Q. I won't let you be alone again.

442
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,680
Stay with me here.

443
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,880
I have something for you.

444
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,280
I just wanted "Q" in the word "love."

445
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,840
-I just don't know anything about you.
-You want to get to know me, right?

446
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,640
You know what?
I've never let anyone in here.

447
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,160
Thanks for allowing me to get to know you.
