1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,120
Sleepwalking can be fatal.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,040
Q!

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,440
Sleep.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,400
Everything is all right.
You were just sleepwalking.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,520
I have to tuck you in every night
so I can have some peace, right?

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,960
Are you off to work?

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,720
I'm going out to run an errand.
I'll be back in the evening.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,440
Q, please take care of my brother.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,400
All right.

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,640
Hello, James?

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,960
Min, have you handled
all the evidence properly?

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,920
I've just found out that
the boy's dad is Big Kacha.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,800
Can you not investigate this case anymore?
You could be killed.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,080
It's my job.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,120
So righteousness is more important
than Mom's life?

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,400
Q, what have you done?!

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,440
We agreed that you'd wait
until I finished handling things.

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,280
You took the job to kidnap me…
because your brother is sick, didn't you?

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,800
What if I hire you
to demand a ransom from my dad?

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,280
Will you accept the job?

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,680
Then you can keep the money.

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,920
All of it.

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,200
URGENT SALE

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,760
Will you agree to do it?

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,560
Q.

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,920
You told me

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,960
that I've seen your face

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,920
and know where you live, right?

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,080
If I come after you,

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,960
there's no way you'll get away.

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,400
Think about it.

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,160
I haven't had pizza in ages.
The doctor says I can't.

33
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,160
Then eat a lot today, Mhen.

34
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,200
These look so good.

35
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
Min, let's eat some pizzas.

36
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,240
Pizzas?

37
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,280
Who bought them?

38
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,280
James got them for us.

39
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,520
-You see the picture?
-Yes.

40
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,120
Real blood wouldn't foam this much.

41
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,680
How did you mix it?

42
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,880
Did you add hot water?

43
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,160
The background is obviously just
the gym room in your house.

44
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,520
-That's not sneaky at all, damn it.
-Come on.

45
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,320
Honestly, I'm not surprised that
you couldn't bring yourself to kill him,

46
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,440
but I didn't expect you
to be this dim-witted.

47
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,600
Hiding him in your house?

48
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,800
Are you stupid or just dumb?

49
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,520
Doing this will get you in trouble
from now on.

50
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,640
Hey, I've got a plan.

51
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,640
What plan?

52
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,880
I'll tell the client
I thought I'd killed him,

53
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,480
but someone saved him.

54
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,640
As for the money,
I'll return the total amount.

55
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,480
You think they'll just accept that?

56
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,280
They ordered someone to be killed,
not the food to be served.

57
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,440
You can't just return the money
and call it quits.

58
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,040
Come on.

59
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,720
What do you want me to do then?

60
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,600
This is the best plan I've got.

61
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,240
I think it's the best way.

62
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,720
Fine,

63
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,520
let's go with it.

64
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,000
This is also my fault
for getting you involved.

65
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,600
You haven't spent the money, right?

66
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,360
Well,

67
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,640
I spent a little.

68
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,800
Min!

69
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,440
Hey, relax.

70
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,800
James.

71
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,440
-You're driving me crazy.
-James. James.

72
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,720
Relax.

73
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,280
I'll find the money to pay them back.

74
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,400
Can you talk things through
with the client for me?

75
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Please.

76
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,920
Please, bro. That's all I'm asking.

77
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,640
Fine.

78
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,560
Thanks a lot.

79
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,880
Thank you, really.

80
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,040
URGENT SALE

81
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,840
Bro, here.

82
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,320
Your car keys.

83
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,600
I parked your car over there.

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,880
Thanks.

85
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,040
Min.

86
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,400
I actually overheard
your conversation yesterday

87
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,560
about the ransom plan.

88
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,240
Why don't you just go for it?

89
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,560
He even said he wouldn't come after you

90
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,760
and you'd get to keep all the money.

91
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,120
Then, you could pay the client back
and end this mess.

92
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't understand why he wants this.

93
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,520
Why do you need to understand him?

94
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,680
All that matters
is making sure you stay alive.

95
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,200
I don't know if saying yes or no

96
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,600
will make it easier to survive.

97
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,480
I'm heading back.

98
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,600
Hey.

99
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,520
Hey, Min.

100
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,720
Is he the one who kidnapped me with you?

101
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,520
I recognized his voice.

102
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,320
Come with me.

103
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,560
You can't just randomly let anyone
inside the house like this.

104
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,080
Don't you remember what I told you?
You must stay out of sight.

105
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,120
Yeah, I remember.

106
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,120
But if he's on your side,
I don't see why I should be scared.

107
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,120
Look at you.

108
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,520
What do you mean?

109
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,320
How can someone like you hurt anyone?

110
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,400
A stray dog in front of 7-Eleven
is scarier than you.

111
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,400
Hey, what are you doing?

112
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,560
You really think I don't dare to hurt you?

113
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,760
What are you doing?

114
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,400
Let me go!

115
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,039
I'm showing you
that you can't trust anyone easily.

116
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,159
Not even me.

117
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,720
Q, don't forget.

118
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,880
Someone wants you dead.

119
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,360
Just kill me then.

120
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,680
I'm sick of this already.

121
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,400
Head inside.

122
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,160
I'm done talking to you.

123
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,080
Mom!
Help!

124
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,200
Help me! Help!

125
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,200
-Q.
-Help!

126
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,080
Q? Q, everything is all right.
You're talking in your sleep.

127
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,640
-Dad, help me. Dad!
-Q.

128
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,320
Q.

129
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,240
You're dreaming.
Everything is all right. Relax.

130
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,760
Q?

131
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,120
What have you been through, really?

132
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,440
Min.

133
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,400
Min.

134
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,080
Why are you standing here sleeping?

135
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,400
You were sleep-talking
and whining all night.

136
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,840
I barely slept.

137
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,840
-Really?
-Yeah.

138
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
I had no idea I was sleep-talking,

139
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,800
but I feel like
I was hugging something last night.

140
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,040
What? Who?

141
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
You weren't.

142
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,200
I wasn't?

143
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,840
I was.

144
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,760
It was a really tight hug.

145
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,360
I hugged your stray dog doll.

146
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,000
When I woke up, I was still hugging it.

147
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,200
I probably slept so well
because of your doll.

148
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,000
Thanks a lot.

149
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,520
Min. Where are you going?
You haven't finished brushing your teeth.

150
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,440
Min, I talked to the client
for you already.

151
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,600
We're all set to meet and talk.

152
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,040
Thanks a lot.

153
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,600
Let me know when you have the money ready.

154
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,680
Sure.

155
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,960
Stunt team, you're up.

156
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,520
Come to the set.

157
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,560
Yes.

158
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,480
Let's go.

159
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,920
I'll throw that away for you.

160
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,880
Let's wrap this up quickly.
I have an event to attend after this.

161
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,800
Let's get started.

162
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,280
-Ryukyu is ready. Let's start.
-Right on.

163
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,880
Is the camera ready?

164
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,480
Shit!

165
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,040
Check on Ryukyu now!

166
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,120
-Shit.
-Why are you still sitting there?! Go!

167
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,640
Does it hurt a lot?

168
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,120
Are you hurt?

169
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
A bit.

170
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,600
What's wrong with your damn acting?!

171
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,640
Min, this isn't like you.

172
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,840
I probably didn't sleep enough.

173
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,960
I'm sorry.

174
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,480
Did you forget your lines or what?

175
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
I'm sorry.

177
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,720
Hey. Are you okay?

178
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,120
James, is Ryukyu okay?

179
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,800
Did I get you in trouble again?

180
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,240
He's just seeking attention.

181
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,680
We're fine, no worries.

182
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,280
But…

183
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
the team wants you
to take a break for now.

184
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,800
But don't look so shocked.

185
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,120
You'll be back soon.

186
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,080
Just rest and let your wound heal.

187
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,720
When they ask for you, I'll let you know.

188
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,440
Okay?

189
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,600
Here's your pay.

190
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,160
Thank you.

191
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,600
Don't overthink it.

192
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,720
Where can I get the rest from?

193
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,800
-What are we having?
-Here you are.

194
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,600
Fish fritters, your favorite.

195
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,080
Oh, wow.

196
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,720
Thanks.

197
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,680
Min, how did you get
that wound on your head?

198
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,880
I went a bit off-cue.

199
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,360
Don't be so shocked.

200
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,680
I'm fine, really.
Blow on it and I'll be good.

201
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,240
-If you don't believe me, try it.
-Don't change the topic.

202
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,000
You don't usually mess up like this.

203
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,120
I didn't sleep enough.

204
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,720
After some rest, I'll be fine.

205
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,880
Here, I got your favorite.

206
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Eat up.

207
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,600
Mhen, let me help.

208
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Take a seat.

209
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,680
SAVINGS. DO NOT WITHDRAW.

210
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,000
BALANCE 43,800.69

211
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,599
Min.

212
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,640
Yeah?

213
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,000
Come here.

214
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,280
Move a bit closer.

215
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,400
You said you were good at it, right?

216
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,320
Why did you get hurt this much?

217
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,760
I'm a stuntman.

218
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,680
It's normal to go off-cue sometimes.

219
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,120
Wasn't it because I sleep-talked,

220
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,840
so you barely slept
and were out of it on set?

221
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,360
It wasn't.

222
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,480
I had to read,

223
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,640
memorize,

224
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,600
recite my lines,

225
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,880
and rehearse the cues.

226
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,880
I had a lot to do.

227
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,120
You're a stuntman.

228
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,040
How many lines could you have?

229
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,600
You didn't have any lines
and didn't even practice acting.

230
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,720
Okay.

231
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,480
It's all because of you.

232
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,480
I barely slept.

233
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,040
You sleep-talked all night.

234
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
So what now?
How are you going to make it up to me?

235
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,760
You told Mhen

236
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,960
your wound just needed a blow, right?

237
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,240
Like this.

238
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,080
You're strong, aren't you?

239
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,120
It hurts.

240
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,640
Min.

241
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,040
Why not take the job I offered,

242
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,320
since you're having money problems now?

243
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,600
Once this is over,

244
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,240
I'll talk to my dad for you,

245
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,400
telling him you didn't do anything wrong
and that you even saved me.

246
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,080
I really can't accept your offer

247
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,200
if I still don't know your reason for it.

248
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,920
If you know,

249
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,880
then you'll do it, right?

250
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,640
I want to get revenge on my dad.

251
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,600
What?

252
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,920
Now that you know,

253
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,720
can you accept the job?

254
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,120
Or if you think

255
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,960
you've got a better way to make money,

256
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,160
go for it.

257
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,320
-Sir, please hear me out.
-Go. Go away!

258
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,440
Sir, I'm out of options.

259
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,480
I don't know where else to get the money.

260
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
Are you out of your mind?

261
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,400
You just paid off the debt
and now you're asking for another loan.

262
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,080
Sir, please help me.

263
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,680
I really don't know what to do.
I really have no other choice.

264
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,880
You're annoying.

265
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,800
Take it.

266
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,680
Check out this place
and don't show your face here again.

267
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
You're a nuisance.

268
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,840
Customer, welcome.

269
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,520
I know Sir Mhoo. He suggested I come here.

270
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,440
You're not allowed in, young man.

271
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,640
-I know Sir Mhoo.
-Go away!

272
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,240
Please let me in.

273
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,200
-I know Sir Mhoo. He told me to come.
-Go away!

274
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,080
Please let me in.

275
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,960
-Ouch!
-Hey!

276
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,400
I'm really sorry.

277
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,600
Suea?

278
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,760
I'm Min. I came with James before.

279
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,120
Do you remember me?

280
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,840
How much do you need?

281
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,240
300,000 baht, please.

282
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,600
I'm offering you a loan with no interest.

283
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,360
Are you brave enough to punch this guard?

284
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,640
I'm giving you 50K for every punch.

285
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,280
Hey, hold up!

286
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,280
Hold up!

287
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,840
I haven't agreed to fight yet.

288
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,200
I forgot to mention,

289
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,480
I'm giving him 50K per punch too.

290
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,880
50K.

291
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,720
100K. 150K.

292
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,280
200K. 250K.

293
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,520
300K.

294
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,480
I like you a lot.

295
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,520
Interested in working for me?

296
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,480
Take the money,
and you don't need to pay me back.

297
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,920
Replace those two…

298
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,440
as my bodyguard.

299
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,400
You can start whenever you're ready.

300
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,760
James, the money is ready.

301
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,800
You can set up the meeting
with the client now.

302
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,600
Hello, James?

303
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,520
Hello, Min.

304
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,880
The client already replied,

305
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,160
asking to meet us tomorrow.

306
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,000
-You're ready, right?
-Yes, I am.

307
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,000
But the client asked that
you bring Q along.

308
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,200
I can't do that, James.

309
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,000
No way. I'm not taking him there
no matter what.

310
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,760
Tell the client that
it's just you and me going tomorrow.

311
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,480
Listen. Let's not mention
whether we're bringing Q yet.

312
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,320
We'll make something up when we get there.

313
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,040
Okay. See you tomorrow.

314
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,480
Are you meeting the person
who hired you to kidnap me?

315
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,680
Let me go with you.

316
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,520
Why? It's dangerous.

317
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,360
I want to know who they are
and what they actually want from me.

318
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,360
Want me to tell you?

319
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,600
They want to kill you, obviously.

320
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,640
Q. Can you not be stubborn for once?

321
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,640
Listen up.

322
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,480
I'll talk to them tomorrow,
and then you'll be safe.

323
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,600
Don't be stubborn, okay?

324
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Fine.

325
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,400
I won't go then.

326
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,160
Take care of yourself.

327
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,120
Are you worried about me?

328
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,160
No. I'm just trying to be polite.

329
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,240
I can debone it myself.

330
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,920
Okay. I'm off then.
I have to rush to run an errand.

331
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,200
You're full already?

332
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,240
You didn't eat much.

333
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,000
You guys enjoy.

334
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,720
Don't forget to take your pills.
I've set them out for you.

335
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,200
Thank you.

336
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,120
Don't be stubborn.

337
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,720
Eat a lot.

338
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,040
I'm off. I'll be back with dinner.

339
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,600
Take care of him for me.

340
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,480
I'll see him off.

341
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
Let's go.

342
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,000
Good luck.

343
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,080
Don't worry. I've already sorted
things out with the client.

344
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,960
Let's go.

345
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,360
Here's the 800,000 baht you paid us.

346
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,840
We're returning the full amount.

347
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,840
We're sorry things went wrong.

348
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,640
That boy happened to have a strong fate.

349
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,480
-Won't you check--
-Where is that policeman's son?

350
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,680
You said he was with you, didn't you?
Why didn't you bring him with you?

351
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,400
When we made the deal,

352
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,400
you told me you'd bring him.

353
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

354
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,760
I completely forgot to mention this.

355
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,680
I told you he came back, right?

356
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,320
There was a bit of a plot twist.

357
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,240
Someone rescued him.

358
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,280
Are you trying to play dirty?!

359
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,000
You're playing dirty, huh?

360
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,840
Relax, bro.

361
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,120
Let's… let's talk it out.

362
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,560
Let's handle this the right way.

363
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,800
Please put the gun down.

364
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,840
Where is he?!

365
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,280
Drag him over here right now!

366
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,360
I told you he isn't with us.

367
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,000
Someone rescued him this morning.

368
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,960
And that's the money we're returning.

369
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,480
Can we call it even?

370
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,480
Even? Fuck it!

371
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,440
You guys are kidding me, huh?

372
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,560
Fine. All of you go freaking die!

373
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,480
Hold on!

374
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,120
Q?

375
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,320
I'm here.

376
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,720
Just say what you want to say.

377
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,440
Q.

378
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,240
-Q, why did you come here?
-Why did you come here?

379
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,920
-Stay away!
-Min!

380
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,280
Why are you doing this?

381
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,280
Because of your dad.

382
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,600
-Dad, help me.
-Please let my son go. He didn't do it.

383
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,720
-I didn't do it. Dad, help me.
-Excuse us, please.

384
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,920
-I really didn't do it! Trust me, Dad.
-Pond!

385
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,560
We have already detained the suspect, the
warehouse owner, for further questioning.

386
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,760
Deputy!

387
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,200
YUENYONGWISUTT'S HOUSE

388
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,760
Please stop!

389
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,040
You're Deputy Kacha, right?

390
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,040
Deputy, please help my son.

391
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,360
Sir, the deputy is in the car, right?
Deputy. Deputy!

392
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,640
Deputy, please help my son.

393
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,280
You're the only one who can help him.

394
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,440
My son was slandered.

395
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,680
Do you have any proof?

396
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,080
Deputy.

397
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,160
You can ask me to beg or do anything.

398
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm willing to do anything, Deputy.

399
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,840
I can bow down at your feet.

400
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,320
Please.

401
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,720
I can bow down at your feet.

402
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,840
Please help my son.

403
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,400
I'm Yada, a businesswoman.

404
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,640
I'm here today to discuss

405
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,160
a potential business opportunity with you.

406
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,360
I begged your dad.

407
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,920
I was willing to bow down at his feet,
asking for help,

408
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,640
but he didn't help.

409
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,040
He even took the money
from the woman who slandered my son!

410
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,520
Was that why you hired someone
to kidnap me?

411
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,440
Yes.

412
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,960
And did it get you what you wanted?

413
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
At first,

414
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,680
I was going to negotiate with your dad,

415
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,560
but my son was beaten
nearly to death in jail.

416
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,320
Now, I want your dad to suffer like me.

417
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,440
So that's why you changed the order
from kidnapping to killing?

418
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,760
Yes,

419
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,200
but you two were too stupid and messed up.

420
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,840
That's why I have to kill him myself.

421
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,720
-Min!
-If you want to shoot, shoot me.

422
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,200
They have nothing to do with this.

423
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,480
Even if you kill me,

424
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,480
it won't change anything.

425
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:15,199
All you did will be for nothing.

426
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,239
No.

427
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,360
At least, I'll get to take revenge
on the person who hurt my son.

428
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,320
Are you sure

429
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,760
this is what your son would want?

430
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,080
Or are you doing this to satisfy yourself?

431
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,440
I'm not doing it for myself!
I'm doing this for my son!

432
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,360
Are you sure

433
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,960
this will make your son proud of you

434
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,120
and see you as a hero

435
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,360
for risking yourself in such a thing?

436
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,480
Are you sure

437
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,120
your son won't regret your actions?

438
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,120
If you're really sure,

439
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,520
then shoot me.

440
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,840
-Q!
-Min!

441
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,000
-Q!
-Min!

442
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,600
-Let go! Q!
-Min!

443
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,360
-Min!
-Don't!

444
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,240
Min!

445
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,840
Help me, Dad!

446
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
Pond.

447
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,320
Pond, my son.

448
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,600
Pond, I'm sorry.

449
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,240
Take it easy.

450
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,400
That day, my dad didn't take any money
from that woman.

451
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,120
If you're sure your son is innocent,

452
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,760
he'll be cleared of all charges.

453
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,320
I know my dad well.

454
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,160
You weren't afraid of being killed at all?

455
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,920
Are you okay?

456
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,440
I'm fine.

457
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,560
Do you think this is the first time
I've been in a situation like this?

458
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,520
As the son of a hero,

459
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,280
I must face these things.

460
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,480
This case is super basic.

461
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,960
Deep down,

462
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,400
you don't want to take revenge
on your dad, right?

463
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,440
You want me to demand your ransom

464
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,280
so your dad won't risk himself
with this case, right?

465
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,560
Q.

466
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,000
Dad, help me!

467
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,640
-Dad!
-Mom! Mom!

468
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,720
Q. Are you okay?

469
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,040
If you don't want to do it, then don't.

470
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,280
I can hire someone else.

471
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,880
Q!

472
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,280
Q!

473
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,400
Sit down, Q. Sit down.

474
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,800
Hey, why is your body so cold?

475
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,320
Breathe.

476
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,720
Breathe slowly.

477
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,800
Breathe slowly.

478
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,480
Are you all right, Q?

479
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,760
Breathe in and out.

480
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,680
In and out. Just breathe.

481
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:44,000
Okay, Q.
I'll demand your ransom myself.

482
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,320
Do you think
your dad has read the letter yet?

483
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,840
Once he reads it,
I think he'll back off from the case.

484
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,200
Do you want to box?

485
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,120
I'll take care of Mhen.

486
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,600
You remember what I taught you, right?

487
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,320
I heard you smiled a lot today.

488
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,800
Without Q, I wouldn't
get to do this kind of thing.

489
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,520
You caught a cold too?

490
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,200
If I had someone who loved me
the way you love Mhen,

491
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,200
I wouldn't ask for anything else
in my life.
