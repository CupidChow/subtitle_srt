(Previously)
He seemed really worried about you.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,980
If you show him that
you truly understand how he feels,

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,705
I think everything will get better.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,420
How…should I start?

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,727
I'll try to talk to Q for you.

6
00:00:16,997 --> 00:00:18,315
Why didn't you wake me up when you came to see Mhen?

7
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:19,723
I saw you sleeping soundly,

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,044
so I didn't want to disturb you.

9
00:00:21,308 --> 00:00:22,970
How are you feeling, Mhen?

10
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:24,632
After a bit of rest, I think I can be discharged.

11
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:25,497
That's good.

12
00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:27,905
Let's do this. Half for each.

13
00:00:28,174 --> 00:00:29,303
Let's do it this way from now on.

14
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:31,105
You won't leave anything behind
just for me anymore, right?

15
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:32,414
Yeah.

16
00:00:32,773 --> 00:00:34,414
Good boy.

17
00:00:34,856 --> 00:00:36,669
Good boy.

18
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,066
Good boy.

19
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,915
Thank you so much for being by my side.

20
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:41,976
After you stepped in,

21
00:00:42,054 --> 00:00:43,105
my life has become a lot easier.

22
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,705
I didn't do anything for you today.

23
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:45,588
You already did.

24
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,404
What did I do?

25
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:48,176
You're just staying by my side.

26
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:27,383
I talked to your dad last night.

27
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,970
It seems he really wants to
clear things up with you.

28
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:35,180
I have nothing to talk to him about anymore.

29

00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:40,773
I talked to your dad yesterday.

Suea,

what's going on?

76
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:51,297
Q told me he was heading home,

77
00:05:51,306 --> 00:05:52,582
but I couldn't reach him.

78
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,977
I think Yada and her men kidnapped Mr.Q.

79
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:01,903
Mr.Kacha is gone, too.

80
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,509

I'm going to find James.

83
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:13,437
I think he knows where Yada and her men are.

84
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:15,020
Then let's take my car.

85
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:41,121
The police already arrested you, didn't they?

86
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:42,811
How could you get out?

87
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,405

88
00:07:06,837 --> 00:07:07,783
It's not time yet.

89
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:10,300
I'm waiting for your dad to be here,

90
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:12,734
so you'll both die together.

91
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:14,573
My dad will never come here.

92
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:19,180
That's why I used a little trick to bring him here.

93
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:28,216

00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:36,010

00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,041
Come and get the shipment sorted out.

00:08:00,394 --> 00:08:02,211
going undercover as a cop
to take down that gambling den.

100
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,607
Honestly, you know what?

101
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:06,940
I kind of had a sense that deep down,

102
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:08,219
you're a good guy.

103
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,300
- Like, I could sense a shining white aura around you.
- James.

104
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:14,914
Have you got any information about Q?

105
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:16,022
Whoa.

106
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:17,324
Of course.

107
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:18,440
Don't you know who you're asking?

108
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,786
A couple of days ago,

109
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:24,512
Yada's former men were seen

110
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:27,222
moving smuggled goods and drugs to a warehouse.

111
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:28,912
They're preparing to flee the country.

112
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:31,820
And this was taken this morning.

113
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:33,816
I'm telling you,

114
00:08:33,954 --> 00:08:37,010
her turning herself in and suddenly
getting sick and going to the hospital

115
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:38,448
is definitely part of their plan.

116
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:40,471
They've got powerful backing.

117
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:42,379
There's no way they'd go to jail that easily.

118
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:45,710
Do you know where their warehouse is?

119
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:17,225
<i>Min,</i>

120
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:19,712

121
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:21,924
I saw you do it, and it looked pretty cool.

122
00:09:22,234 --> 00:09:22,817
Here you go.

123
00:09:23,826 --> 00:09:25,411
First, you need to do this.

124
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:27,302
Then, start rubbing them together.

125
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:35,202
<i>A little space will start to form.</i>

126
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,413
Keep rubbing and make your hands smaller,

127
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,816
and it'll gradually come undone.

128
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:42,177

129
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:43,776

133
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:01,927

134
00:11:02,223 --> 00:11:03,202

135
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:11,103

You still have this symptom?

144
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,970
It hasn't gotten better since that day.

145
00:12:07,831 --> 00:12:08,810
Why are you here?

146
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:12,830
You know they're going to kill you, don't you?

00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:14,220
I must be here, no matter what.

148
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:17,912
I won't let anything like that happen again.

149
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:37,703
Back then, I thought I could handle everything,

150
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:39,120
but I was wrong.

151
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:42,161
I'm sorry.

152
00:12:43,491 --> 00:12:45,497
I'm sorry I didn't choose our family.

153
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,414
That day, I tried to do everything,

154
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:51,271
fighting for what was right.

155
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:55,500
I believed that if I succeeded,

156
00:12:56,954 --> 00:12:59,512
nothing bad would happen to our family,

157
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,360
but I was wrong.

158
00:13:03,628 --> 00:13:06,900
I'm the one who tore our family apart.

159
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:14,980
Everything was my fault.

160
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:18,622
But don't be scared, Q.

161
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:21,311
There's no way I'll lose you.

162
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:23,971
I won't make the same mistake again.

163
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:31,379
It's kind of funny, isn't it?

164
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:33,274
At first,

165
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,202
I thought this was what I'd wanted to see all along.

166
00:13:37,093 --> 00:13:38,109
You chose me.

167
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:39,820
You came to save my life.

168
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:43,214
But now that it's actually happening,

169
00:13:44,285 --> 00:13:46,691
it's turned into the thing I'm most afraid of.

170

171
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:52,466

Don't be scared.

174
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:11,472
I'll find a way to get us out of here.

175

00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,165
Head back to the warehouse now.

180
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:23,216
Count.

181
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:23,982
How many do we have?

182
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:24,946
10.

183
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:26,482
- 10, right?
- Yes.

184
00:14:26,503 --> 00:14:27,059
All right.

185
00:14:29,983 --> 00:14:30,685
- Hey.
- Hey.

186
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:31,776
Hey.

187
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:32,453
Drop your guns.

188
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:35,502
I said, drop your guns.

189
00:14:57,508 --> 00:14:58,167
Ouch!

190
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,980
Min, find Mr.Kacha and Mr.Q.

191
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:05,604
James and I will take care of it here.

192
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:22,510
The heroin that was burned
didn't even graze my fingernail,

193
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:26,506
but then you suddenly decided to meddle.

194
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:28,306
The entire gambling den,

195
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:30,168
the connections,

196
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,370
and everything I built
and loved like my own children,

197
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:39,834
were ruined because of you.

198
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:46,514
No matter how I explain, you won't get it.

199
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:54,570
So, how about we make you feel the way I feel?

200
00:15:56,023 --> 00:16:02,570
Let's see how it feels when you watch
what you love crumble right before your eyes.

201
00:16:05,392 --> 00:16:06,354
Q! Q!

202
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:08,770
- Ouch!
- Q!

203
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:09,669
Stop it already!

204
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:12,114
If you want to do this,

205
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:13,241
hurt me instead!

206
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:17,921
Q.

207
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:22,570
How do you feel?

208
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:25,877
You're starting to feel
a sense of fatherhood now, huh?

209
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:27,321
Don't shoot!

210
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:32,368
Don't.

211
00:16:32,448 --> 00:16:35,410
This is fun watching a dad and son bonding.

212
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:37,580
How about a little game?

213
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:40,973
Q.

214
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:42,420
Q, are you all right?

215
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,980
Choose who will die first,

216
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,610
Dad or Son?

217
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:02,666
Shoot me.

218
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:04,506
If I die,

219
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:05,921
this problem will come to an end.

220
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:08,805
Q doesn't have any conflict with you, does he?

221
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:11,020
Don't!

222
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,303
Dad.

223
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:16,211
Dad, don't do this!

224
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:18,779
No!

225
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:22,848
I love you, Q.

226
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:29,970
I'm sorry this is all I can do for you.

227
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:34,925
Dad.

228
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,042
Dad.

229
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:49,157
Hey!

230
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:03,395
Ouch!

231
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:06,908
Min.

232
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:08,411
Get Q out of here.

233
00:18:09,032 --> 00:18:10,020
I'll handle them here.

234
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:20,902
มินMin.

235
00:18:22,217 --> 00:18:22,902
Hold on, Min.

236
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:25,222
I'll go back and help Dad.

237
00:18:26,848 --> 00:18:28,010
Ouch!

238
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:36,730
You can't do that.

239
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:38,334
We must run away from here.

240
00:18:39,014 --> 00:18:39,623
Hey!

241
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:40,320
Q.

242
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,899
- Q.
- Dad!

243
00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:43,020
Q. Q.

244
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,422
Min, I'm begging you.

245
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,568
I can't run away like this again.

246
00:18:48,444 --> 00:18:50,117
I can't lose Dad.

247
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:52,708
Please.

248
00:18:53,912 --> 00:18:54,506
Min.

249
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:10,317
Where is Q?

250
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:11,982
Hey!

251
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:13,334
Ouch!

252
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,318
You know how to shoot a gun?

253
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,502
Hey!

254
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:28,512
Ouch!

255
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:36,906
Stop it!

256
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,103
Q.

257
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:46,870
Miss Yada, drop your gun.

258
00:19:47,828 --> 00:19:48,875
You can't run away from this.

259
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,115
If I can't,

260
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,491
then let it end here.

261
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,121
Q!

262
00:20:01,448 --> 00:20:02,037
Hey!

263
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:08,720
Ouch!

264
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:13,920
Come.

265
00:20:16,604 --> 00:20:17,182
Quickly!

266
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:19,835
Min.

267
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:21,379
Min.

268
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:24,616
Min.

269
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:26,167
Are you okay?

270
00:20:29,057 --> 00:20:29,724
I am.

271
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,779
It was just a graze, no big deal.

272
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:36,278
Are you sure?

273
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:39,912
Yes.

274
00:21:09,632 --> 00:21:10,920
It was just a graze.

275
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:12,016
I'm totally fine.

276
00:21:16,023 --> 00:21:17,207
Honestly, I'm mad,

277
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,377
but don't want to make it a big deal.

278
00:21:19,072 --> 00:21:21,220
You really want to be
the human shield leading man, huh?

279
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,902
I think he's cool.

280
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:26,705
Mhen,

281
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:29,709
I'm sorry.

282
00:21:30,379 --> 00:21:32,810
Actually, it's my fault.

283
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:34,709
You didn't do anything wrong.

284
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:35,619
They're the ones at fault.

285
00:21:48,194 --> 00:21:50,115
I have something to talk to you about.

286
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:56,120
Q, take them outside.

287
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:02,602
Come.

288
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,117
Mr. Kacha, what do you want to talk to me about?

289
00:22:17,355 --> 00:22:19,730
I want to thank you

290
00:22:22,862 --> 00:22:24,771
for saving Q and me.

291
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,521
It's really my pleasure to help.

292
00:22:33,114 --> 00:22:34,142
As for the case,

293
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,056
thanks to your and Suea's testimonies,

294
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:37,611
which were helpful to the investigation.

295
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:45,010
The prosecutor will submit a request
to the court to designate you both as witnesses.

296
00:22:47,108 --> 00:22:47,906
Thank you.

297
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:54,430
I've made many mistakes in the past,

298
00:22:56,032 --> 00:22:58,010
and I know I can't go back and fix them.

299
00:22:58,952 --> 00:23:03,870
But I'm willing to fully cooperate
to make up for what I've done.

300
00:23:06,714 --> 00:23:08,328
You know Suea, right?

301
00:23:09,091 --> 00:23:09,712
Yes.

302
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:13,114
Suea used to be just like you,

303
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,110
forced to do things he knew
were wrong out of necessity.

304
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,010
He went through the point
where everyone turned their backs on him.

305
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:29,405
Society tried to push people like him away.

306
00:23:31,053 --> 00:23:38,010
But one thing I believe is just
as effective is giving them a chance

307
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:41,112
a chance to change,

308
00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:43,112
to become better,

309
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,108
so they don't end up back where they started.

310
00:23:50,192 --> 00:23:54,660
I hope you'll make the most out of this chance.

311
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:57,321
I will.

312
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,405
How did the conversation with your dad go?

313
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:25,903
It went well.

314
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:27,903
Once we understand each other,

315
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:29,014
talking becomes so much easier.

316
00:24:30,577 --> 00:24:31,217
So...

317
00:24:31,468 --> 00:24:32,420
Mhen already went back to his room?

318
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:34,805
All the kids have left.

319
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,071
We can do anything now, right?

320
00:24:40,927 --> 00:24:41,856
What do you want to do, huh?

321
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:43,494
Look.

322
00:24:44,582 --> 00:24:45,607
Your wound's going to reopen.

323
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,050
Come on.

324
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:48,617
Do we need to wait until my wound heals?

325
00:24:49,358 --> 00:24:51,305
It's been so long
since we're alone together like this.

326
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,568
I missed you so much.

327
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,718
Fine.

328
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,702
But don't move,

329
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:05,210
or your wound will reopen.

330
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:15,070
Hey, I told you not to move.

331
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:16,560
Don't move.

332
00:25:17,709 --> 00:25:18,515
Okay.

333
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:32,622
Eh?

334
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,277
What?

335
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:34,474
What are you doing?

336
00:25:34,697 --> 00:25:35,496
Stay still.

337
00:25:35,794 --> 00:25:36,518
This is not still enough?

338
00:25:36,783 --> 00:25:37,502
Don't move.

339
00:25:37,826 --> 00:25:38,517

I want to reaffirm my innocence.

366
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:37,607
Thank you for the justice that stood by me.

367
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,223
Please excuse me for now.

368
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:41,506
Can we interview you further, please?

369
00:27:41,518 --> 00:27:42,411
Could we ask you a few more questions, please?

370
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,703
Hey!

371
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:57,795
What's going on here?

372
00:27:57,862 --> 00:28:00,023
I believe society still needs people like you, Dad,

373
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:06,700
to address injustices rather than
leaving ordinary people to handle it on their own.

374
00:28:11,265 --> 00:28:11,828
Dad.

375
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,560
You're up?

376
00:28:14,921 --> 00:28:15,962
Are you off to work?

377
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,505
Yes. I have to attend a morning meeting.

378
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:19,416
Hold on.

379
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:25,709
<i>If you still want to be there,</i>

380
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:28,622
<i>I'll always support you, Dad.</i>

381
00:28:33,657 --> 00:28:34,506
Thanks.

382
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:44,899
You can be discharged today.

383
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:48,774
In the meantime, don't exert yourself too much.

384
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:50,702
If you experience any unusual symptoms,

385
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,650
like a racing heart or dizziness,

386
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:54,725
make sure to come back to see me right away.

387
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:56,869
Sure, Doctor. Thank you so much.

388
00:28:57,124 --> 00:28:57,976
Thank you.

389
00:29:00,722 --> 00:29:01,294
Let's go.

390
00:29:01,377 --> 00:29:02,417
Get changed and head home.

391
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,217
Let's go.

392
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,191
- Hold on.
- Yeah?

393
00:29:04,198 --> 00:29:04,976
Can you walk?

394
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,962
Your wound dried up just one day before mine,

395
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:08,065
and now you're acting all tough.

396
00:29:08,186 --> 00:29:08,714
Yeah.

397
00:29:08,733 --> 00:29:09,915
I told you, it's just a small wound.

398
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,125
You won't believe me.

399
00:29:12,032 --> 00:29:13,278
You got shot, Min.

400
00:29:13,505 --> 00:29:14,776
No matter it's just a small or big wound,

401
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:16,315
let me worry about you, okay?

402
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,078
You're acting like you don't want us to worry.

403
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:19,522
Just try not to worry, Q.

404
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,505
I bet you'd look like a sad puppy
with droopy ears and a tucked tail.

405
00:29:24,235 --> 00:29:25,321
Let's go home.

406
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:27,080
Walk carefully.

407
00:29:27,102 --> 00:29:27,933
Be careful, Mhen.

408
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:33,277
Be careful.

409
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,103
I missed home so much.

410
00:29:36,337 --> 00:29:37,205
You don't miss me?

411
00:29:40,152 --> 00:29:41,198
Sit carefully.

412
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,610
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

413
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,019
You said you're fully recovered, didn't you?

414
00:29:51,478 --> 00:29:52,263
Yeah.

415
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:53,228
It's just a scab,

416
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:54,371
so it's a bit tight.

417
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,014
Awesome!

418
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,509
Now that's how it should be.

419
00:30:00,051 --> 00:30:01,106
Our house is full of the sick.

420
00:30:02,445 --> 00:30:03,220
Don't worry.

421
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:04,605
I'll take care of you both.

422
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:06,628
Eh?

423
00:30:08,318 --> 00:30:09,105
Why?

424
00:30:09,122 --> 00:30:09,960
What's with that face?

425
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:10,914
Nothing.

426
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,320
I'm just surprised that Young Master Q
will take care of others.

427
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:16,517
I'm not really that much of a young master.

428
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:18,619
I'm just taking care of
my boyfriend and his brother.

429
00:30:18,997 --> 00:30:19,826
I can definitely handle it.

430
00:30:20,506 --> 00:30:21,619
I'll wait for that.

431
00:30:26,245 --> 00:30:27,482
Ta-da!

432
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:30,869
What?

433
00:30:31,684 --> 00:30:32,623
Why are they like this?

434
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:34,912
Lucky enough, I asked for boiled eggs.

435
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:36,539
If we ask him to make stir-fried morning glory,

436
00:30:36,882 --> 00:30:38,463
we'll definitely have to move house again, Min.

437
00:30:39,948 --> 00:30:41,407
I added water, put in eggs,

438
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:42,411
and covered it,

439
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,204
but why did they come out like this?

440
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:45,619
If it weren't for you throwing in the eggs,

441
00:30:45,962 --> 00:30:47,411
you might have had the heat too high.

442
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:48,557
It's all right, Mhen.

443
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:49,908
I'll cook you new ones.

444
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:51,619
I'll eat them.

445
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:53,211
I can eat whatever you cook.

446
00:30:54,905 --> 00:30:55,616
Don't.

447
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,383
They're a mess. Just throw them away.

448
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:00,668
I'll cook you new ones.

449
00:31:00,832 --> 00:31:02,115
I won't mess up this time.

450
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:03,819
Give me a second. I'll be right back.

451
00:31:07,663 --> 00:31:08,869
Can we order food delivery?

452
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:09,991
Relax.

453
00:31:10,354 --> 00:31:11,469
Let him do it one more time.

454
00:31:11,484 --> 00:31:12,177
Ouch!

455
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:13,549
Q!

456
00:31:15,703 --> 00:31:17,210
I shouldn't have let you cook.

457
00:31:17,312 --> 00:31:18,111
Does it hurt a lot?

458
00:31:20,242 --> 00:31:21,318
Just a bit.

459
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,820
Q, it's all right.

460
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,051
You don't have to cook again next time.

461
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,825
I told the made-to-order food shop
to deliver the food,

462
00:31:30,508 --> 00:31:33,420
and everything is back to normal now.

463
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,817
I'm sorry,

464
00:31:37,466 --> 00:31:40,210
but if there's anything you want me to help with…

465
00:31:40,543 --> 00:31:41,749
- It's all right.
- No worries.

466
00:31:42,324 --> 00:31:45,930
Just seeing that you're really trying
to help and care means a lot to me.

467
00:31:46,377 --> 00:31:47,555
We're glad.

468
00:31:47,576 --> 00:31:48,440
That warms our hearts.

469
00:31:56,274 --> 00:31:57,004
What's wrong?

470
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,211
You're sitting here, feeling down.

471
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:02,161
Nothing.

472
00:32:02,844 --> 00:32:03,619
I'm fine.

473
00:32:04,703 --> 00:32:07,000
How is your wound?

474
00:32:07,303 --> 00:32:08,108
It's healed now, really.

475
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,004
If you don't believe me, look at this.

476
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,011
See?

477
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:14,011
It's gone.

478
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:18,518
It doesn't hurt anymore.

479
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:22,010
At that moment when she was about to shoot me,

480
00:32:22,485 --> 00:32:24,056
I tried to twist her hand,

481
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:26,150
but I couldn't get away in time,

482
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,223
so it just grazed me.

483
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:28,410
It was just a graze.

484
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,225
It's okay. Next time, I'll dodge it better.

485
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:39,714
Min.

486
00:32:41,312 --> 00:32:42,432
Have you ever thought that

487
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:46,310
if someone else was here instead of me,

488
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:50,100
your life might be a whole lot better?

489
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,585
Honestly,

490
00:32:58,688 --> 00:33:00,105
my life has never been easy.

491
00:33:01,223 --> 00:33:02,303
It has always been tough.

492
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:05,075
But ever since you've stepped in,

493
00:33:06,334 --> 00:33:10,660
just seeing you smile and laugh
is enough to make me happy.

494
00:33:13,988 --> 00:33:15,157
And now that I'm sitting here,

495
00:33:15,168 --> 00:33:17,810
watching you like this, you know what?

496
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:20,069
I feel so damn lucky.

497
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,715
You're really exaggerating.

498
00:33:26,177 --> 00:33:27,392
I'm not exaggerating. I mean it.

499
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:30,017
I could die in your place, you know.

500
00:33:32,075 --> 00:33:33,111
No way, Min.

501
00:33:33,822 --> 00:33:35,111
You can't die.

502
00:33:35,485 --> 00:33:37,700
If you die, I'll be mad at you.

503
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:39,214
Really?

504
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:41,715
Yeah.

505
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:43,877
If you're mad, I'll just make it up to you.

506
00:33:44,795 --> 00:33:47,800
I won't let you touch me.

507
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:49,620
You can't kiss my cheek,

508
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:52,900
hug me or do anything.

509
00:33:53,838 --> 00:33:54,468
Okay.

510
00:33:54,854 --> 00:33:56,115
I won't die, then.

511
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:57,623
I'll be immortal.

512
00:33:58,548 --> 00:33:59,915
I won't get hurt or sick.

513
00:34:01,454 --> 00:34:02,062
Deal?

514
00:34:03,614 --> 00:34:04,515
You said that already.

515
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,259
Keep your promise.

516
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:11,510
So, now I can look at you,

517
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:12,610
hug,

518
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,474
kiss,

519
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:14,435
and kiss your check, right?

520
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:20,423
You can't.

521
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,600
I've never seen you stop at just a kiss.

522
00:34:25,404 --> 00:34:26,420
Let's sleep.

523
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:27,908
It's been a long day.

524
00:34:46,722 --> 00:34:47,911
Isn't this too close, Min?

525
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:51,750
I'm afraid I'll sleep walk and hit your wound.

526
00:34:52,808 --> 00:34:53,530
Don't worry.

527
00:34:53,754 --> 00:34:54,426
Just sleep,

528
00:34:55,164 --> 00:34:56,604
so you'll have a comfy sleep.

529
00:34:58,299 --> 00:34:58,920
Sleep already.

530
00:34:59,002 --> 00:34:59,610
Good night.

531
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,706
Good night.

532
00:35:49,782 --> 00:35:50,402
Min!

533
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:54,586
Q!

534
00:35:55,623 --> 00:35:56,432
What are you doing?

535
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,213
I just went through all that,

536
00:36:03,902 --> 00:36:06,600
so I figured I'd have nightmares again for sure.

537
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,910
I…was worried I'd hurt you,

538
00:36:11,226 --> 00:36:14,510
so I left the room and made coffee.

539
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,616
For how many days do you think you can keep this up?

540
00:36:19,564 --> 00:36:22,130
Until you're fully recovered, at least.

541
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,014
In the meantime,

542
00:36:26,004 --> 00:36:27,300
let's sleep in separate rooms.

543
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:29,010
Q,

544
00:36:30,986 --> 00:36:32,810
especially in situations like this,

545
00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:35,121
I want to be right by your side even more.

546
00:36:37,056 --> 00:36:38,407
I don't want you to sleep alone.

547
00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:42,109
My wound is totally fine, Q.

548
00:36:43,825 --> 00:36:44,758
Look at this.

549
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,420
See?

550
00:36:46,857 --> 00:36:48,450
There's just a scratch left.

551
00:36:48,468 --> 00:36:49,672
If you don't believe me, touch it.

552
00:36:50,854 --> 00:36:51,819
It's really gone.

553
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:53,539
I told you, but you won't believe me.

554
00:36:53,608 --> 00:36:54,091
I'm fully recovered.

555
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,017
I'm not seeing anything!

556
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,725
- Well, I'll head back to sleep.
- Hey, Mhen.

557
00:36:57,737 --> 00:36:58,470
Hold on.

558
00:36:59,165 --> 00:37:00,109
Q sleepwalked

559
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:02,082
- and he broke the coffee cup.
- I see.

560
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:02,699
Mhen!

561
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:04,041
Mhen, it's really not what you think.

562
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,312
I'm sorry, Min.

563
00:37:11,974 --> 00:37:14,210
I always cause trouble.

564
00:37:17,477 --> 00:37:18,573
All this time,

565
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:22,604
I've never wanted to cause you any trouble.

566
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:29,510
I just want to take care of you and see you happy,

567
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,260
but I've never been able to do that, damn it.

568
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:38,813
I'm such a good-for-nothing.

569
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,509
Stop pouting like that, Q.

570
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,580
I'm fine now. I'm okay.

571
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:46,859
I know you feel guilty,

572
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:51,700
but all the wounds on my body
are what I chose for myself.

573
00:37:53,248 --> 00:37:54,973
I don't want to see anything happen to you.

574
00:38:01,525 --> 00:38:02,730
I want you to take a lot of rest.

575
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,111
If you really want to help,

576
00:38:05,477 --> 00:38:06,314
stop being stubborn.

577
00:38:06,614 --> 00:38:07,370
Stop being naughty.

578
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,402
Just this will do.

579
00:38:16,814 --> 00:38:17,842
If you're okay, smile.

580
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,620
Smile more.

581
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:31,995
Good boy.

582
00:38:35,194 --> 00:38:37,450
You're my good boy, too.

583
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:41,813
Do you have any reward for this good boy, then?

584
00:39:06,525 --> 00:39:07,225
Just this?

585
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,211
What else do you want?

586
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:12,872
This isn't enough?

587
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,010

588
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:36,536
(Next Episode)
If we had met back in school,

589
00:39:36,837 --> 00:39:37,694
would we still have ended up together?

590
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,810
I have no idea where I would run into you.

591
00:39:40,013 --> 00:39:40,708
Or in Chonburi?

592
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,214
When my mom was still here,

593
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:44,614
she used to take me to the fireworks festival
in Chonburi almost every year.

594
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:45,957
We've probably crossed paths there.

595
00:39:46,022 --> 00:39:46,820
Do you want to go there?

596
00:39:50,573 --> 00:39:53,050
I guess going to see a therapist actually worked.

597
00:39:53,469 --> 00:39:54,192
Go away!

598
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:55,136
Yay!

599
00:39:57,517 --> 00:39:58,616
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.

600
00:39:59,365 --> 00:40:00,362
It's over now.
