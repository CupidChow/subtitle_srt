1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,920
-I have something for you.
-I like it.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,600
All I want is
to keep taking care of you like this.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,280
I want to talk to Q.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,640
I ask you to cooperate with me
in stopping your dad.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,560
Hold on.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,840
If you don't agree to go back peacefully,
my team can escort you.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,920
I'd like you to accept this sum of money.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,440
Staying away from Q
might be the best thing for you.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,440
You made the right decision
by accepting the money from my dad.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,840
Q. I didn't take your dad's money.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,320
I won't let you be alone again.

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,240
Stay with me here.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,960
You know what?

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,560
I'm so protective of this place.
I've never let anyone in here.

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,400
Choose any song that represents you.

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,600
I want to understand you.

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,440
Thank you for allowing me
to get to know you.

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,600
I like you, Q.

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,160
I like you too.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,920
-Min.
-Yeah?

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,520
Why did you buy
this dog surveillance camera?

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,240
To watch the dog.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,160
Come take a look.

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,120
What?

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,360
Here.

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,880
No, come on.
Seriously, why did you buy it?

27
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,320
I bought it to watch Mhen and you.

28
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,680
I have to work with James
for the next couple of days,

29
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,880
so I installed it here.

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,640
When I'm on set,
I can keep an eye on Mhen and you.

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,880
Good idea, right?

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,880
Even though Yada and her men have
stepped back, I still worry about you.

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,600
I need to keep you in my sight
all the time.

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,920
Okay. Then since you've bought
this dog surveillance camera

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,600
and that kidnap thing is already over,

36
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,760
can I continue staying here long-term?

37
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,440
I want to stay here with you. Can I?

38
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,240
You're already here, aren't you?

39
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,160
No, I mean,

40
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,320
I want to move in.

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,720
I'll pack my clothes
and move my stuff here,

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,000
so I can live like someone
who hasn't been kidnapped.

43
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,760
Go ahead.

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,160
Let's go.

45
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Let's head to my place and get my stuff.
I really miss wearing my own underwear.

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,080
Isn't my underwear yours?

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,240
They aren't the same. Come on.

48
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,640
They're different sizes, huh?

49
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,360
Whoa!

50
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,920
Whoa.

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,240
Let's go.

52
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,680
Wow. This luxurious?

53
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,600
Don't be naughty.

54
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,880
-Don't touch things randomly either.
-Yes, sir.

55
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,680
Hey.

56
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,120
My neck's itchy.

57
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Don't.

58
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,560
Which one is your room?

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,040
I won't tell you.

60
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,440
Sit and wait while I pack my stuff.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,360
I'll get changed.

62
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,920
Whoa. That's a full set.

63
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,520
Hey.

64
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,560
"Little Harit Yuenyongwisutt was born
on Sunday, August 4,

65
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,360
2002"?!

66
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,040
You're younger than me?

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,840
Little Q.

68
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
You're cute.

69
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,120
Hey, why are you messing
with my stuff like this?

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,800
I told you already.

71
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,800
I want to get to know you.

72
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,320
If you really want to get to know me…

73
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,720
how about living a life
like mine for a day?

74
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
Hey, are you done?

75
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,400
Give me a second. I'm almost done.

76
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,000
How did you know I was back home?

77
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,920
Our maid told me you just came back.

78
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,360
I've already talked to your Uncle Kanin.

79
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,440
I want you to stay in Vancouver
with him for some time.

80
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,040
What do you mean,
you want me to stay in Vancouver?

81
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,400
I already handed over
the evidence to the prosecutor.

82
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,360
From now on,

83
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,200
things will get even more dangerous.

84
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,840
For your safety, I want you to stay there.

85
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,400
I'm not going.
Whatever you do is your business.

86
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,440
I don't want to run away and get scared
because of your job anymore.

87
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,960
But if you stay here,

88
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,760
everyone around you will be in danger.

89
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,360
The person who got everyone
in trouble is you, not me.

90
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,840
Do I look that awful wearing your clothes?

91
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,880
No, that's not it. You look handsome.

92
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,000
Come.

93
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,320
Since you're this handsome,

94
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,880
I've got to claim you a little.

95
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,400
You're owned.

96
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,600
You can't go anywhere from now on.

97
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,919
Where would I go?

98
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,720
What are you looking at?
I'm starting to feel unconfident now.

99
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,240
You're handsome.

100
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,760
So are you.

101
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,840
Min, the traffic is so bad.

102
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,360
When are we arriving at the restaurant?
I'm hungry.

103
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,320
Hey.

104
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,200
I'm bringing this with me.

105
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,360
Here we go.

106
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,680
Min!

107
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,200
How could you talk to your elder
like that, Little Q?

108
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,000
When I was in your room,

109
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,680
I found out you were born after me.

110
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,400
-So what?
-You're younger than me.

111
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,720
Little Q.

112
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,120
Try calling me "Phi."

113
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Phi Min.

114
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,240
What's with you?

115
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,360
Talk nicely.

116
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,000
Say, "Can Little Q
please have some, Phi Min?"

117
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,880
P…

118
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
-Phi!
-Prick!

119
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,120
All right, Phi Min. Phi Min. Phi Min.

120
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,480
Talk nicely.

121
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,560
"Phi Min, can you please let me eat
this snack with you?"

122
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,640
If you don't say it, I'll eat it up.

123
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,640
Phi Min,

124
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,240
can you please let me eat
this snack with you?

125
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
All right. I'll feed you.

126
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,480
One more bite?

127
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,760
You're as soft as the snack.

128
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,120
How cute.

129
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,800
Great job.

130
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,600
Happy now?

131
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,520
I don't know how to play.

132
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,760
URGENT SALE

133
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,240
Is something wrong?

134
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,480
No.

135
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,560
Actually, today,
I was glad and really happy,

136
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,160
seeing you the way you really are,

137
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,240
but… I was sulking a bit.

138
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,320
I didn't get to talk to you at all.

139
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,640
Come on.

140
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,520
I didn't realize that.

142
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,800
I was always by myself.

143
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,200
Yeah. Don't worry. I understand.

144
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,800
At least I got to know you a bit better.

145
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,320
All right.

146
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,520
I'll let you ask one question about me.

147
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,720
Well then…

148
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,120
tell me something about you.

149
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,040
Let's go with something I don't know.

150
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,680
Actually, I don't enjoy being alone.

151
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,680
I don't like to do things alone

152
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,880
and go out alone.

153
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,840
Sometimes, it feels lonely.

154
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,320
But I have to do that because…

155
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,720
I don't dare open up my heart to anyone,

156
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,720
knowing that if I love someone,

157
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,720
I'll go all in.

158
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,800
I can't stop myself.

159
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,200
If I lose someone again,

160
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,200
I'll be left with no one, Min.

161
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,120
That's why I chose to be alone,

162
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,400
built a wall around myself,

163
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,960
and cut everyone out.

164
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,080
Nobody can affect me.

165
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,840
I'm not strong enough to lose anyone.

166
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,240
Then why could Mhen and I
break your wall and get through it?

167
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,320
At first, I thought I was just going to
meet Mhen and you for a little while.

168
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,560
I didn't expect to bond into a family.

169
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,560
A family?

170
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,640
That means we must stay together.

171
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,280
You're not going to Vancouver, right?

172
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,280
How did you know about that?

173
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,000
Did you overhear my conversation with Dad?

174
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,360
Seriously, I don't want you to go at all.

175
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,000
If something happens to you,

176
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,440
I promise I'll protect you.

177
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,800
As for me,
I don't care what I'm going to face.

178
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,160
I just want us to stay together.

179
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,200
I already said no to my dad.

180
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,600
You promised me
you wouldn't let go of my hands.

181
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,640
So, how could I let go of you?

182
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,400
Are you serious?

183
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,360
I'm not going anywhere.

184
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,640
You aren't going, right?

185
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,520
Thank you, Q.

186
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,800
Thank you too, Min.

187
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,440
The next news update is on the progress
of the warehouse fire case

188
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,280
that led to the discovery
of a large heroin haul.

189
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,200
After a long period of delays, today is
the scheduled court date for the verdict.

190
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,560
This morning, the court summoned Police
Brigadier General Kacha Yuenyongwisutt,

191
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,240
Deputy Commander of
the Narcotics Suppression Bureau,

192
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,640
who is responsible for the case,

193
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,800
to testify as the final witness

194
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,440
before rendering a decision.

195
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,480
SEIZED FOR INVESTIGATION

196
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,839
Don't worry.

197
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,079
Suea.

198
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,800
Handle Kacha's son for me.

199
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,359
-Make sure you don't slip up this time.
-Noted.

200
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,920
Actually, I can skip work. I'll just tell
James I need to stay with you.

201
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,840
Do you want James to scold you or what?

202
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,440
You promised him you'd go, so just go.

203
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,000
-See? That's an undercover officer.
-Thank you.

204
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,800
My dad sent someone to watch over me.

205
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,440
Now I understand why he gave me
so much. This was only 20 baht.

206
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,480
-I should have just asked him for more.
-Stop it, Mhen. Head inside and eat.

207
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,920
Good boy.

208
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,280
Don't worry about me.

209
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,560
I'll be safe.

210
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,200
Okay. But I'll head back quickly anyway.

211
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,080
My wound…

212
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,120
is already healed, you know.

213
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,680
Need another one?

214
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,880
Go ahead. Get to work.

215
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,240
Gotcha.

216
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,880
Sir, Miss Yada is waiting for you.

217
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,480
Please.

218
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,520
I'm also heading to the court.

219
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,440
Do you want to go together?

220
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,680
I handed over the evidence
I got from Phoom to the court already.

221
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,160
Even if I'm not there in person,

222
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,960
the truth about you being the real owner
of the heroin will come out.

223
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,440
I know.

224
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,200
That's why I want you
to testify on my behalf.

225
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,240
-I'm not doing that.
-That was a really quick rejection.

226
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,240
You have no idea that
I'm holding all the aces.

227
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,000
-What is it?
-It's done, Miss Yada.

228
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,400
We've already handled the undercover
officer who was guarding Min's house.

229
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,000
I dealt with all the men
you sent to watch over your son.

230
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,120
All of them. Every single one.

231
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,320
So now you have no one left to help you.

232
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,920
Your only choice is to follow my orders.

233
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,440
Otherwise, I'll kill everyone,

234
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,200
regardless of if they're involved or not.

235
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,600
The lives of the innocent are so important
to someone like you, aren't they?

236
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,760
The sausages are so cold. Try them.

237
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,440
-Are yours even fully cooked?
-I'm not sure either.

238
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,800
-But I'm good with free food.
-Hey. What's up?

239
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,440
How is it going? You returned the son
to his dad already, right?

240
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,520
Why are you smiling?

241
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,880
Don't tell me…?

242
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,840
-What?
-Min!

243
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,840
Return him?

244
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,720
I won't do that. We're dating now.

245
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,920
Min, are you sure you want to date him?

246
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,240
Q and his dad have
so damn many enemies around them.

247
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
You could be in trouble.

248
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,200
I'm not scared of that, bro.

249
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,120
Honestly, the more I learn about this,
the more I want to protect him.

250
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,360
Q and I promised each other that

251
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,000
no matter what happens,
we won't let go of each other's hands.

252
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,200
Wake up, Mr. Leading Man.

253
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,120
If one day you really lose him,

254
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,880
someone like you will blame yourself
for the rest of your life.

255
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,640
Blah, blah, blah.

256
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,200
You didn't listen to my warning,
did you? You'll see.

257
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,520
Mhen. Mhen, stop eating. Follow me.

258
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,040
-What's going on?
-Come on, Mhen.

259
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,320
Follow me.

260
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,040
Hey!

261
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,200
Mhen, hide in here. No matter what
happens, don't leave the room.

262
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,120
30 MINUTES EARLIER

263
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,880
How did we grill them? They're still cold.

264
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,880
Try them.

265
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,240
Are yours even fully cooked?

266
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,640
I'm not sure either.
But I'm good with free food.

267
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,240
Our fridge is filled with these.

268
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,120
Eat a lot, Mhen.

269
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,120
Mhen.

270
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,080
I'll be right back.

271
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,040
Mhen.

272
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,280
-Mhen, follow me. Stop eating.
-What's going on?

273
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,560
-What's going on?
-Come on. Follow me.

274
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,920
Hey, walk slowly!

275
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,880
Your Honor, may I respectfully request to
call the defense witness to the stand?

276
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,920
Permission granted.

277
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,960
Mhen, hide in here.

278
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,400
Lock the door too.

279
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,400
Promise me that no matter what happens,
you won't leave the room.

280
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,280
Mhen, lock the door!

281
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,000
Please help my son.

282
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,000
You're the only one who can help him.

283
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,720
Just tell the court
all the evidence you submitted

284
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,280
was faked by Phoom.

285
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,360
Your only choice is to follow my orders.

286
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,680
Otherwise, I'll kill everyone…

287
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,560
no matter if they're involved or not.

288
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,120
The lives of the innocent are so important
to someone like you, aren't they?

289
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,040
I swear…

290
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,000
before the Emerald Buddha,

291
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,240
the City Pillar Guardian…

292
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
You're good.

293
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,600
…Phra Siam Devadhiraj,

294
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,360
and all sacred beings,

295
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,480
that I…

296
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,080
You've got a lot of fight in you, huh?
Too good, huh?

297
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,280
I will testify before the court…

298
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,120
with absolute truth.

299
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,680
-Ouch!
-You've got a lot in you, huh?

300
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,840
Go.

301
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,120
Hey.

302
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,160
What's with you?

303
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,760
Mhen!

304
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,880
Don't go up there!

305
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,840
Mhen!

306
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,600
Can you confirm whether all the evidence
obtained from Mr. Pokket is authentic?

307
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,200
Mhen!

308
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,840
Your Honor, may I respectfully request
to submit additional evidence?

309
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,200
Permission granted.

310
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,640
Don't!

311
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,960
Don't head inside!

312
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,800
Don't!

313
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,280
Mhen!

314
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,800
Q!

315
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,160
Get all the evidence.

316
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,280
Don't let Kacha get it!

317
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,480
What about Phoom?

318
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,440
-Kill him.
-Understood.

319
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,400
Min. Stop it.

320
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,720
Stop it already.

321
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,680
Q.

322
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,520
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

323
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,160
Q. I'll take you to the hospital.
Q, wake up.

324
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,880
The court acknowledges
the defense's request.

325
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,000
It has been decided that
the hearing will be postponed

326
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,320
in order to examine new evidence
that has just come to light.

327
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Q!

328
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,200
Min, watch out!

329
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,400
Q!

330
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,120
Q!

331
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,120
Q!

332
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,800
Hey, Q!

333
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,440
Q!

334
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,440
Q!

335
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,680
Q, can you hear me?

336
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,240
-Q, can you hear me?!
-Get up!

337
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,520
-Q! Q, wake up!
-Q!

338
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
-Q!
-Q!

339
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,000
Q.

340
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,880
Q, can you hear me?

341
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
Q!

342
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,040
-Hey. Q!
-Q!

343
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,800
Q, no! Q!

344
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,720
Q!

345
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,520
How is Q, Min?

346
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,040
The doctor said he's fine.

347
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,040
He just needs plenty of rest.

348
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,920
And you? How are you feeling?

349
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,880
I'm fine.

350
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,800
I'm okay.

351
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,880
Don't worry.

352
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,600
Take a seat.

353
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,640
Take a seat.

354
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,440
Actually, Suea is working for me.

355
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,520
We're trying to bring charges
against Yada,

356
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,920
a major drug dealer.

357
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And did you succeed?

358
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,960
It has been decided that
the hearing will be postponed

359
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,920
in order to examine new evidence
that has just come to light.

360
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,280
Miss Yada Methathiwat,

361
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,720
we have received information

362
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,920
that you were involved in
the contract killing of Mr. Phoom Pokket.

363
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,880
We would like to invite you for further
questioning at the police station.

364
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,200
Please come with us.

365
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,560
From now on,
this case will target Yada directly.

366
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,280
The situation is becoming more dangerous

367
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,880
for me,

368
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,080
Q,

369
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,120
and all of you.

370
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,800
I know my son well.

371
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,920
When he loves someone,

372
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,440
he goes all in

373
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,720
without caring about
the consequences for himself.

374
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,560
Q doesn't love himself enough
to love someone else.

375
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,520
Let's do this for Q's safety.

376
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,240
Q, can you hear me?! Q!

377
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,320
-Hey. Q!
-Q!

378
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
-You know what?
-What?

379
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,560
When I was hiding in the bathroom,
Q fought better than Min.

380
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,920
Absolutely!

381
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,800
When you're free, teach him,
so his acting can improve.

382
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,760
Yeah, you're right.

383
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,160
Now, his acting is so stiff.

384
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,320
Q doesn't love himself enough
to love someone else.

385
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,800
Let's do this for Q's safety.

386
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,640
Really?

387
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,280
You're even better than my Min?

388
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,719
-How are you feeling?
-I'm okay. It's fine.

389
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,880
-This isn't enough to take me down.
-I heard you almost died.

390
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,080
Who did? Nobody did.

391
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,239
I want to eat delicious stuff already.

392
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,719
I'm sick of hospital food.

393
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,199
-What do you want to eat after you're out?
-Just tell us.

394
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,960
-Jeen and I will buy it for you.
-Right.

395
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,600
Once you get inside the car,
get some rest.

396
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,880
Put your seatbelt on.

397
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,520
We've arrived, Q.

398
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,920
Why did you take me home?

399
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,200
I think you should go to Vancouver.

400
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,360
What do you mean?

401
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,120
My dad told you to do this, right?

402
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,640
-Tell me.
-It's my decision.

403
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,320
That can't be true, Min.

404
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,320
We already promised that
no matter what happens,

405
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,080
we won't let go of each other.

406
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,360
I almost lost you

407
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,440
and Mhen.

408
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,560
I really can't stand seeing that, Q.

409
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,160
I'm sorry I'm breaking the promise.

410
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,600
But you already saw

411
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,000
we really can't do anything about this.

412
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,520
Do you want me to be selfish,

413
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,880
risking my brother's life
for something like this?

414
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,360
I can't do this.

415
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,320
If I agree to go…

416
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,760
what's going to happen between us?

417
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,240
If I agree to go,
we aren't going to break up, right?

418
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,560
Q. I'm just like you.

419
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,840
When I love someone,

420
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,880
I also go all in.

421
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,160
So…

422
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,200
let's break up.

423
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,360
Q.

424
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,480
Before we lose everything
and are both left with nothing…

425
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,960
let go of my hands.

426
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,000
Min.

427
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,160
YUENYONGWISUTT'S HOUSE

428
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,400
4 DAYS LATER

429
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,520
I'll do everything
to keep you from becoming a zombie.

430
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,840
But if I ever turned into one,

431
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,920
you must run away from me.

432
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,200
My life wouldn't matter.

433
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,680
But if I had to watch you die,

434
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,080
I don't think I could handle it.

435
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,600
So, if one day, I become
the reason that you're in danger,

436
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,560
you must run away from me
as far as you can.

437
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,680
It's perfectly fine
if you aren't ready to love me.

438
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,640
All I want is to keep
taking care of you like this.

439
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,640
I like you, Q.

440
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,120
I like you too.

441
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,560
Min!

442
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,920
Open the door for me, Min!

443
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,760
Mhen!

444
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,880
We're sorry, but this number
is not currently in service.

445
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,200
Min…

446
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,560
where are you?

447
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,560
Why did you run away from me?

448
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,840
Can you not do this, Min?

449
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,360
Did he tell you where he went?

450
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,920
Get over him.
I think he's thought it through enough.

451
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,840
You can stay here, but only for tonight.

452
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,600
My car is broken. I can't head back.

453
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,160
-How about a trip?
-I have to work.

454
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,840
Min, wait for me.

455
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,880
You can't go in the water.

456
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,840
-You might get hurt.
-I know you won't let me get hurt.

457
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,680
Q!

458
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,640
Mhen's started to fear what I fear.

459
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,000
I don't think this is worth it.

460
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,080
I can't do it!

461
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,640
I can't let go of you.
