1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,120
I asked because

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,200
I want to understand
the reason behind everything you've done.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,040
Q, let's go!

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,400
I don't want to feel like this anymore.

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,680
I don't want to wake up alone again, Min.

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,600
I don't know if you'll believe
what I'm going to say.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,680
I hate seeing you cry.

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,440
Promise me

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,480
you won't let go of my hands.

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,880
I promise.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,640
I have something important to tell you.

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,920
Phoom, the guy who hired us to kidnap Q,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,040
is dead.

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,560
But your dad
isn't letting this case go at all.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,320
He gave an interview
saying he'd oversee every step closely.

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,800
Are you worried about your dad?
Do you want to talk to him?

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,720
No.

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,560
I have nothing left to say to him.

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,720
Well, then,

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,560
is there anything I can do
to lift your mood?

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,000
It can be anything that stops me
from thinking about all this.

22
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,520
I've got an idea.

23
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,400
What is it?

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,160
Cut.

25
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,560
Slate. Camera A.

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,160
- Okay. Let's check playback.
- Cut. Check playback.

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,320
How was today? Enjoy it?

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,680
Yeah. It was fun.

29
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,280
Min.

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,480
If I really turned into a zombie one day,

31
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,520
would you dare to shoot me?

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,240
Do you trust me or not?

33
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,720
I would never let you turn into a zombie.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,400
But if I ever turned into one,

35
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,160
you must run away from me.

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,560
Why?

37
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,000
My life wouldn't matter.

38
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,640
It's fine if I die.

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,000
But if I had to watch you die,

40
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,200
I don't think I could handle it.

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,760
So, if one day, I become
the reason that you're in danger,

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,560
you must run away from me
as far as you can.

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,720
Got it?

44
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,560
Do you think
I want to be with you so badly?

45
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,080
Is that funny, huh?

46
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,680
From what you told me,
things between you two seem romantic.

47
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,400
What's up with you right now?

48
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,800
I can't hear you.

49
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,000
Get up and talk properly.

50
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,520
This evening, I made a gift for Q

51
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,400
to give to him when I confess my feelings.

52
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,760
What are you doing?

53
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,120
Nothing.

54
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,320
Well, I want to ask you something.

55
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,760
You asked me to promise

56
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,800
not to let go of your hands.

57
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,160
- What am I to you?
- What promise did I make?

58
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,320
Was I sleepwalking?

59
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,560
I didn't do something weird, did I?

60
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,240
Mhen, let's just forget about it.
It's over.

61
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,760
Come on. You haven't even started.
How can you say it's over?

62
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,320
But I think

63
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,440
every time Q was sad,

64
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,640
he hugged you.

65
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,080
His subconscious wants you.

66
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,000
I think you should keep pursuing him.
You have a chance. Trust me.

67
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,920
Really?

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,840
Yeah.

69
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,480
I'll give it a try then.

70
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,920
You're good at it.

71
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

72
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,560
I saw the keyboard
and my hands moved on their own.

73
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,680
No worries.

74
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,600
Can I play with you?

75
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,320
Sure.

76
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,000
- This note, right?
- Yeah.

77
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,520
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

78
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,000
I haven't played in ages.
I've forgotten all the notes.

79
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,240
Wow.

80
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,600
Nice. Now I have someone to practice with.

81
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,400
You're here?

82
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
I've been looking for you.

83
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,240
You saw me, didn't you?

84
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,520
Since you have a new friend,

85
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,000
do you want to go back and talk to him?

86
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,800
Go ahead. I'll wait here.

87
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,400
If I go, you'll wait for me here?

88
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,720
I already made you a promise.

89
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,960
Even if it was when you were sleepwalking
and you don't remember it, I do.

90
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,200
Promise me

91
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,760
you won't let go of my hands.

92
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,440
I promise.

93
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,280
That you promised

94
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,000
not to let go of my hands?

95
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,000
It wasn't sleepwalking that night.

96
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,440
Why are you doing this, then?

97
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,400
Is it because…

98
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,920
you don't want me
to have feelings for you?

99
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,000
But you already know…

100
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,920
that I like you, right?

101
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
Does it make you uncomfortable?

102
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,720
Actually,

103
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,160
I have something for you.

104
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,760
I made it myself.

105
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,280
Show me.

106
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,920
How do I read it then?

107
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,280
"Lq-vey"? Is it "Lq-vy"?

108
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,040
It's pronounced "love."

109
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,000
I just wanted "Q" in the word "love,"

110
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,520
so I removed the letter O
and replaced it with Q.

111
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,800
I don't know if this is too complicated.

112
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,520
Neither this keychain nor you

113
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,840
are complicated at all.

114
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,960
I like it.

115
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,640
But…

116
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,480
I think… I'm the complicated one.

117
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,800
I acted like that about that night

118
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,320
because I didn't know

119
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,000
how I should feel about you.

120
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
It's really hard for me, Min.

121
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,600
I need time to think it over.

122
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,840
I understand.

123
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,880
I really do.

124
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,240
Just take your time, as long as you want.

125
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,520
Don't rush to give me your answer.

126
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
As for this…

127
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,320
I'll keep it for you.

128
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,920
No rush. Think about it carefully.

129
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,480
It's perfectly fine
if you aren't ready to love me.

130
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,080
Can I ask for one thing?

131
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,680
All I want is
to keep taking care of you like this.

132
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,520
Thank you.

133
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,960
That's it.

134
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,560
Have you found out

135
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,400
who's behind this yet?

136
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,040
I haven't, Miss Yada.

137
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,600
Someone told me that Kacha has already
gotten the evidence from Phoom.

138
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,240
How could you slip up like this?

139
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,520
I'm sorry, Miss Yada.

140
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,560
- Miss Yada.
- What is it?

141
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,840
We've managed to recover
some of the CCTV footage.

142
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,280
Ouch!

143
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,080
Q, let's go.

144
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
Suea.

145
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
Prepare the car.

146
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,680
Noted.

147
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,120
- I'll check who's there.
- Okay.

148
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,800
Who are you here to see?

149
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,440
What do you think?

150
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,840
Does it look yummy?

151
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,040
It really does.

152
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,320
You're good at cooking.

153
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,600
Mhen, who is it?

154
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
Min.

155
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,080
Mhen!

156
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
Mhen.

157
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,760
What are you doing here, Suea?

158
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,520
I want to talk to Q.

159
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,200
If you want to talk
to anyone in this house,

160
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,640
you'll have to get through me.

161
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,400
Hand Q over to me,

162
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,760
and I'll let your betrayal slide.

163
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,840
I'll never hand Q over to you.

164
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,240
Q.

165
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,960
I consider that you chose for yourself.

166
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,760
Watch out.

167
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,040
- Min!
- Mhen, don't!

168
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,560
- Min!
- Stop!

169
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,560
Stop it already!

170
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,880
Keep still.

171
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,400
If anyone in this house gets hurt,

172
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,920
I won't talk to any of you.

173
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,320
Just say what you want to say!

174
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,160
Let's continue our discussion
from where we left off.

175
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,480
The same conditions apply.

176
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,880
I want you to cooperate with me
in stopping your dad.

177
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
Then, I can guarantee everyone's safety.

178
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,800
I'm here to take you to my safe house.

179
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,359
Then we can start planning.

180
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,800
Deal?

181
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,160
No, Q! Don't go!

182
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,319
Min!

183
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Q!

184
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,000
Q!

185
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,040
I won't give you much time to decide.

186
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,120
Min!

187
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,840
Stop it already!

188
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,800
Q! No! Q!

189
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,000
Q! No! Don't go, Q!

190
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,000
Q!

191
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,560
Q!

192
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,880
Q! No!

193
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,000
Hold on.

194
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,040
You have no right to do this, Miss Yada.

195
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,920
I already talked to you nicely

196
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
but you didn't agree to back off.

197
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,320
You even robbed evidence from the dead.

198
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,320
I also need to find some help.

199
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,240
What do you say, Mr. Kacha?

200
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,400
Don't waste your time.

201
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,400
Stop creating conditions
to pressure me already.

202
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,720
By doing this,

203
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,320
you're only creating
more legal issues for yourself.

204
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,360
You'd better hurry to your restaurant

205
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,360
because my team is waiting
to search there.

206
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,080
I already have a search warrant.

207
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,160
Please cooperate with the officers,
and your severe penalty might be reduced.

208
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,480
How stubborn your dad is.

209
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,240
If something happens,

210
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,560
your dad is at fault.

211
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,760
If you don't agree to go back peacefully,

212
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,280
my team can escort you.

213
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,040
I think we'd better hurry back.

214
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,040
I'm not letting this end so easily.

215
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,480
Min! Min, are you okay?

216
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,240
Are you hurt?

217
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,640
Kidnapping?

218
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,600
Demanding a ransom?

219
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,800
Working at the casino?

220
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,200
How could you do all that?

221
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,680
- Mhen, I'm sorry.
- It's actually my fault.

222
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,960
Don't be mad at Min.

223
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
Q,

224
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,880
can you not say anything now?

225
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,880
You did all those things
because I'm sick, right?

226
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,080
- It's not that, Mhen.
- Stop lying already.

227
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,600
I don't want to be the reason

228
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,040
you do those things.

229
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,360
Do you think I'm glad

230
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,600
to see you get hurt for me?

231
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,360
Think about it.

232
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,320
If something happens to you,

233
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,600
how would I live?

234
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,920
You said you wanted me to be
healthy and happy like other kids.

235
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,080
I want the same for you too.

236
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,280
I don't need treatment anymore if it means
trading it for something like this.

237
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,320
Mhen.

238
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,840
Come on. I'm sorry.

239
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,440
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

240
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,440
Mhen.

241
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,520
Min.

242
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,120
Yes?

243
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,720
I'd like to talk for a moment.

244
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,840
I received the letter you two sent to me.

245
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,600
- Well…
- I have to apologize on Q's behalf.

246
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,480
He must have caused you a lot of trouble.

247
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm also fed up with him.

248
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
He tends to let his emotions take over.

249
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,560
He's made a non-issue
worse than it already is

250
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,000
when he's supposed to be the person
who understands the situation best.

251
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,960
As an apology…

252
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,520
THREE MILLION BAHT

253
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,640
…I'd like you to accept this sum of money.

254
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,160
I believe it's enough
to save your brother's life.

255
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,320
What about Q?

256
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,320
I must take him to a safe place
as soon as possible.

257
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,480
If I let him act as he wishes like this,

258
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,120
those around him will also be at risk.

259
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,960
Staying away from Q
might be the best thing for you.

260
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,600
Those around him will also be at risk.

261
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,560
Staying away from Q

262
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,240
might be the best thing for you.

263
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,720
Punching a punching bag
with bare hands hurts.

264
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,800
Here, you need to do it like this
so you won't get hurt.

265
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
Put it on slowly.

266
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,160
Keep your guard up.

267
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,640
When punching, don't use your knuckles.

268
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,880
Use the structure of your bones. Here.

269
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,480
Give it a try.

270
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,480
Why are you paying attention to me?

271
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,800
I'm sorry for dragging you into my mess.

272
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,080
I hope the money my dad gave you

273
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,680
can make up for everything.

274
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,000
This is all I can do.

275
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,280
Just like my dad said, I'm bad luck.

276
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,280
Anyone whose life I get involved in…

277
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,440
ends up worse off.

278
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
What do you mean?

279
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,480
You wondered why
a police officer's son like me

280
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,320
is scared of gunshots, right?

281
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
It's because

282
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,360
you weren't the first person
who kidnapped me.

283
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,440
My mom and I were kidnapped
several years ago.

284
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,840
Back then, they wanted my dad
to back off from a major case,

285
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,840
but he wouldn't.

286
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,320
Q, run away quickly before they come back.

287
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,120
- What about you?
- Q.

288
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,440
If you see Dad, tell him to hurry here.

289
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,400
Yes, Mom.

290
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,440
Mom helped me escape.

291
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,400
Dad!

292
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,880
Dad, help!

293
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,640
Dad! Help!

294
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,960
Dad!

295
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,200
Dad! Help!

296
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,080
Dad, help!

297
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,200
In the end…

298
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,120
Mom.

299
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,680
Mom!

300
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,440
Mom! Mom, wake up!

301
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
Mom, wake up!

302
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
Mom!

303
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,280
- Mom!
- Who's there? Don't move.

304
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,440
Get up now.

305
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,760
Even though you didn't shoot me that day,

306
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,760
someday, someone
will shoot me dead anyway.

307
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,240
I don't want anyone who gets involved
with me to die because of me again.

308
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,800
Living by myself is the best way.

309
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,880
I understand what you're saying.

310
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,200
But if you really have to be alone,

311
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,520
will you be happy?

312
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,920
I have no choice, Min.

313
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,360
I don't want to live this kind of life.

314
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,080
I hate it.

315
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,520
But I understand

316
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,480
why I have to be alone

317
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,440
and die alone.

318
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,200
No one should risk their life for me

319
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,960
and my dad anymore,

320
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,320
including you, Min.

321
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,000
You made the right decision,

322
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,400
accepting the money from my dad.

323
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,560
Q.

324
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,040
I didn't take your dad's money.

325
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,440
Not even a single baht.

326
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,760
But I understand everything you said.

327
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,280
Literally everything.

328
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,320
So, stay with me here.

329
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,120
Don't go anywhere.

330
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,200
I promised you

331
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,680
I wouldn't let go of your hands.

332
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,480
The more I learn about your life,

333
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,640
the more I want to take care of you.

334
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,560
I won't let you be alone again.

335
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,680
Stay with me here.

336
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,640
You're just

337
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,600
so damn stupid.

338
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,520
So are you.

339
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,160
Why are you this stupid, huh?

340
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,000
URGENT SALE

341
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,600
What are you doing?

342
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,200
I'm playing the guitar for you.

343
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,760
It might lighten your mood.

344
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,480
Where did you get it?

345
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,800
I didn't know
you had a guitar in your house.

346
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,040
It was in Mhen's room. He keeps it there.

347
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,280
Hand it to me.

348
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,240
Let me have a look.

349
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,680
The guitar strings are old.

350
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,360
They're all rusty now.

351
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,720
That's why it's off-tone.

352
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,200
That sounds so professional.

353
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,480
It's my job.

354
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,800
You think the money I have nowadays
comes from my dad?

355
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,800
See?

356
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,600
It's just that
I don't know anything about you.

357
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,200
You want to get to know me, right?

358
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,280
Of course.

359
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,640
Sure.

360
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,280
Eh? Follow me.
You want to get to know me, don't you?

361
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,400
Bring the motorcycle keys too.

362
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,520
Come on.

363
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,920
Follow me.

364
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,640
Don't be naughty.

365
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,480
You know what?

366
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,960
I'm so protective of this place.

367
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,040
I've never let anyone in here.

368
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,600
So, I'm the first one?

369
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,080
So, what's your job, really?

370
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,160
I'm a music producer.

371
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,400
I create OSTs for films and ads

372
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,600
and songs for clubs.

373
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,160
Why are you doing this job?

374
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,680
It lets me communicate with others

375
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,440
without having to put myself out there.

376
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,080
I like to secretly sit and listen

377
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,480
where I know my song will be played.

378
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,640
Seeing people smile because of my songs

379
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,240
or just sing along…

380
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,720
I feel there are people listening

381
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,360
to what I want to say.

382
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,600
It makes this world feel…

383
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,960
a little less lonely to me.

384
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,200
Are you hurt?

385
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,680
Just blow on it and I'll be fine.

386
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,280
Give it a try.

387
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,080
Blow there too.

388
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,800
Play one song you produced.

389
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,560
Choose any song that represents you.

390
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,720
I want to understand you.

391
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,080
If I love someone with everything I got

392
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,600
Heartbreak awaits, that's the cost

393
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,960
Without anyone, I just feel alone

394
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,920
Why risk my heart in the chaos unknown?

395
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,200
The fears I had started to fade away

396
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,280
When you came along
I had to reassess my way

397
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,560
If I take a chance just this once
Will you promise

398
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,159
Not to leave me in the dust?

399
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:21,679
Having someone to love feels so right

400
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,239
I just realized with you in my sight

401
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,639
Though risks are there, I'm willing to try

402
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,320
As long as you take my hand and fly

403
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,360
Having you here, it feels so good

404
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,000
It's better now than it ever could

405
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,000
It's worth the chance
Just to feel this love

406
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,239
Because you are more than enough

407
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,760
It's so beautiful.

408
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,200
Thank you.

409
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,280
Thank you for allowing me
to get to know you.

410
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,880
I should be the one saying thank you, Min.

411
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,680
Are you still keeping that keychain?

412
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,720
I like you, Q.

413
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,760
I like you too.

414
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,160
Hold on, Min.

415
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,160
What?

416
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,440
You have wounds all over.

417
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,480
Just forget about it.

418
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,120
How can I?

419
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,640
Q.

420
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,200
I told you, we can't do it now.

421
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,520
Come on, Q.

422
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,760
I'll play a song for you.

423
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,640
Get dressed.

424
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
Done.

425
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,640
Show me what song you're playing.

426
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,360
This is another song I made.

427
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,360
"Little Harit was born on Sunday in 2002."

428
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,800
You're younger than me?

429
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,800
Little Q.

430
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,240
You're owned.

431
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,000
You can't go anywhere from now on.

432
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,400
From now on,

433
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,000
the situation will get
even more dangerous.

434
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,120
- Hide in here.
- I'll kill all of you.

435
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,240
Mhen!

436
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,560
I want Q to stay in Vancouver
for some time.

437
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,440
I'll protect you.

438
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,320
If I lose someone again,

439
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,720
I'll be left with no one, Min.

440
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,880
Q!
