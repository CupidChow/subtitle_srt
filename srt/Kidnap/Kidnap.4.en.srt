1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:03,880
Shit!

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,880
The team wants you
to take a break for now.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,400
-I really have no other choice.
-Take it. Check out this place.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,880
-How much do you need?
-300,000 baht, please.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,400
200K. 250K. 300K.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,800
I like you a lot.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,280
Interested in working for me?

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,680
The client already replied,
asking to meet us tomorrow.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,440
Where is that policeman's son?
You said he was with you, didn't you?

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,200
-Are you trying to play dirty?!
-Hold on!

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,480
Q?

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,600
Why are you doing this?

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,920
Because of your dad.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
Are you sure
this is what your son would want?

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,640
If you're really sure…
then shoot me.

16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,680
-Q!
-Min!

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,640
Pond, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,680
That day, my dad didn't take any money
from that woman.

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,920
I know my dad well.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,120
You want me to demand your ransom

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,920
so your dad won't risk himself
with this case, right?

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,760
If you don't want to do it, then don't.

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,760
Q!

24
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
Okay, Q.

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,080
I'll demand your ransom myself.

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,360
YUENYONGWISUTT'S HOUSE

27
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,640
TO KACHA YUENYONGWISUTT

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,640
To Kacha Yuenyongwisutt.

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,640
We have your son.

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,080
If you want your son to be safe,

31
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,960
obey everything written here.

32
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,720
One.

33
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,480
Don't report this
to the police or reporters.

34
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,400
Two.

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,200
Prepare 1,000,000 baht cash

36
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,920
and wait until we contact you again.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,040
And three,

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,160
back off from all the cases
you're in charge of now.

39
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,000
If you fail to comply with any of these,

40
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,480
we can't guarantee your son's safety.

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,960
You don't dare to shoot me, do you?

42
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,960
Yes, if it's you.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,880
What is it again?

44
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,800
I'll sleep on my side tonight.

45
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,640
Actually, I prefer sleeping on my side.

46
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,800
If you sleep like that,
how can we tie our arms?

47
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,960
Come.

48
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,160
Here.

49
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,160
Will it work?

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,960
And then?

51
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,640
Ow.

52
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,840
Hey. I have to sleep like this
the whole night?

53
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,360
-It will make me freaking achy.
-So how about not tying our arms?

54
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,040
If you sleepwalk, what should we do?
Who will take responsibility?

55
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,720
Me.

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,240
Come on. Let's sleep properly.

57
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,840
Sleep like you usually do. Roll over.

58
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,120
Okay.

59
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,680
Take your reward.

60
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,200
Do you think
your dad has read the letter yet?

61
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,840
Once he reads it,
I think he'll back off from the case.

62
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,480
Sleep already.

63
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,520
I'm sleepy.

64
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,720
You'd better worry about yourself first.
Hurry up and run away.

65
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,080
You think I'm that stupid, huh?!
You damn lieutenant!

66
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,160
Don't.

67
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,720
Are you really scared
of the sound of gunfire?

68
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,640
Why do you care so much?

69
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,840
You're worried about things
that don't matter.

70
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm going to sleep.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,480
Who said I care about you?

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,840
What?

73
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,320
TWO DAYS LATER

74
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,000
The next news story takes us back
to the heroin warehouse case.

75
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,800
Earlier today, Police Brigadier General
Kacha Yuenyongwisutt

76
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,960
reiterated to the press that the police
are urgently gathering evidence

77
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,800
to dismantle the entire heroin network.

78
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,080
He emphasized that
they will be increasing manpower

79
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,800
to investigate the case thoroughly.

80
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,640
Sir? How is the heroin case progressing?

81
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,480
We're currently gathering more evidence
to present to the prosecutor.

82
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,320
It shouldn't be long now.

83
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,480
We're confident we'll find
additional evidence

84
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,280
and bring the offenders to justice
according to the law.

85
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,200
Your dad hasn't resigned yet?

86
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
That's right.

87
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,600
How about calling him?

88
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,040
You can fake your voice.
Ask if he's received the letter.

89
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,280
I think he's read it already,

90
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,560
but…

91
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,360
Do you want to box?

92
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,880
Sure.

93
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,760
Come on. The other hand needs one too.

94
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,920
Do it gently!

95
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,000
Why did you punch me?

96
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,280
-Stop overacting.
-Ouch!

97
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,920
Ouch!

98
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,600
All out, really?

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,640
Ouch!

100
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,880
Hey, stop overacting.

101
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,640
Get up.

102
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,200
You're taking full advantage, huh?

103
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,520
All right, I'm serious now.

104
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
I surrender.

105
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,760
Are you satisfied now?

106
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,919
Come.

107
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,600
The wound is fine.
There are no issues at all.

108
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,400
Yes. Thank you.

109
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,120
Patient's relatives,
please proceed to the finance office.

110
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,520
Great job.

111
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,400
Sure, Mr. Hero.

112
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,160
Wait outside.

113
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,200
I'll pay first.

114
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,520
-Let's go have some fun.
-Let's go.

115
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,080
Please wait to pick up your medication
at the next counter.

116
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,480
THAILAND

117
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,080
It's Min, right?

118
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,200
Is that you, Suea?

119
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,000
Miss Yada asked me to call you
to ask if you're ready to work yet.

120
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,280
Mhen, since you've already recovered,
do you want to hang out somewhere?

121
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,720
-Well…
-Try going somewhere.

122
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,880
There he is.

123
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,880
Mhen.

124
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,600
I have to start my new job tomorrow.

125
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,920
What job? Stuntman work?

126
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,720
It's a job at a restaurant,
but it's full-time.

127
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,240
Take good care of yourself from now on.

128
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,440
I always do that, don't worry.

129
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,240
Right. Don't worry.

130
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,040
I'll take care of Mhen.

131
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,720
Let's go.

132
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,160
I'm kidding.

133
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,640
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

134
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,120
Mhen is already hungry.

135
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,000
Be gentle with my brother, okay?

136
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,160
I knew it. You don't trust me.

137
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,280
Min, I'm here.

138
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,640
Whoa. Why did you buy so much stuff?

139
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,880
-These are all your favorite snacks.
-Let me help.

140
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,560
Thanks a lot, Jeen.

141
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,120
Now that you're here,
I feel so much more relieved.

142
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,440
Please take care of him today.
I might be home late.

143
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,320
Sure, Min. I'll take care of him.

144
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,760
As for you,

145
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
behave.

146
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,640
Fine.

147
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,280
Got it.

148
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,160
-Jeen, here you are.
-Yes?

149
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,920
I'll take it now.

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,120
Take 100, then.

151
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,040
Keep it in case
you want to buy something to eat.

152
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,640
-Thank you.
-I'm off.

153
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,000
Don't be naughty.
Please take care of the house for me.

154
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,960
Sure. Don't worry.

155
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,440
Behave well.

156
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,000
-Bye-bye.
-Drive safely.

157
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,880
"Drive safely."

158
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,520
"Don't forget to wear your helmet."

159
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,840
-Let's watch the series Min's in today.
-Fine.

160
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,000
Your job is
to keep your assigned area in order.

161
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,520
If a problem arises,
charge in immediately.

162
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,640
Try to resolve it by talking first.

163
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,400
Use force as a last resort.

164
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,320
Got it?

165
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,240
Yes.

166
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,320
Miss Yada is ready to depart.

167
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,440
Where is she going?

168
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,000
It's not your business.

169
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,440
Just worry about your own business.
Doing your job well is enough.

170
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,640
Yes.

171
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,000
That's Min!

172
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,160
Look at him riding a motorcycle.

173
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,840
He's so cool.

174
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,000
Hold on, Jeen. How do you know that's Min?

175
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,520
We can only see his neck.

176
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,960
Look.

177
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,320
Here it is. Min's got a mole right here.

178
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,560
Let's start with his body.

179
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,080
Min's got broad shoulders…

180
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,720
and an amazing build.

181
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,040
Hey! What are you doing?

182
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
He's super attentive.

183
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,560
He catches every little thing.

184
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,880
He's always ready
to protect those around him.

185
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,680
I don't find him cool at all.

186
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,680
Agreed.

187
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,000
Is something wrong, Mhen?

188
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,400
You can talk to me about anything.

189
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,040
I won't tell anyone.

190
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,000
Kanomjeen doesn't find me cool
like Min, huh?

191
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,520
I've been tutoring her every day.

192
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,080
You like Jeen, right?

193
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,680
Nope. Nonsense.

194
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,920
I don't like her.

195
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,040
Come on, Mhen. I saw it.

196
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,840
When we were watching the series,
you kept watching her, not the TV.

197
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,800
I like her. Happy?

198
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,040
Don't tell anyone.

199
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,600
Kanomjeen fangirls Min
when he rides a motorcycle, right?

200
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,200
Why are you smiling?

201
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,280
-You remember what I taught you, right?
-I do.

202
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
Okay. Let's give it a try. Go for it.

203
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,880
Mhen, be careful.

204
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,120
Go carefully.

205
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,680
Carefully ease into the throttle.

206
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,840
Okay.

207
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,040
Turn slowly, Mhen.

208
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,520
Where have you been?

209
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,680
Hey, relax.
I've got something to show you too.

210
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,640
I asked where you took my brother to.

211
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,600
We just went
for motorcycle riding practice.

212
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,240
"Just"?

213
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,640
Did you really say "just"?

214
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,040
Do you even know the risks
of the illness Mhen has?

215
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,800
If something happened,
how would you take responsibility?

216
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,480
Well, Min,

217
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,920
I've been keeping an eye on Mhen all day,
and there's honestly nothing risky at all.

218
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,080
Jeen.

219
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,000
You know how much I trust you, don't you?

220
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,840
Why didn't you stop them?

221
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,960
Why?!

222
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,920
I'm so damn disappointed in you.

223
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,160
Stop it already!

224
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,000
I just went out to ride a motorcycle.

225
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,400
Was that so wrong?

226
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,080
Even the doctor doesn't boss me around
as much as you do.

227
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,680
Because I'm worried about you!

228
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,560
Don't you understand? Anything you can
be careful about, you should be.

229
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,560
I'm worried about you.

230
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,120
That's why you lock me up like this?

231
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,560
You won't let me do other things
at all, right?

232
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
Be frank with me.

233
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,960
Do you still see me as a human?

234
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,040
You never try to understand me!

235
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,080
Mhen!

236
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,400
Mhen!

237
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,960
Mhen.

238
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,400
Mhen. Come out and talk.

239
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,040
Mhen.

240
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,240
Mhen.

241
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,760
Seriously?

242
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,200
Mhen.

243
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,560
Okay. I give in.

244
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,079
You don't have to open the door.

245
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,880
But we already agreed that
you wouldn't lock the door, didn't we?

246
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,280
If anything happens to you,
you'll be in danger.

247
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,319
Mhen.

248
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,599
Mhen, come out and talk properly.

249
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,640
Jeen, head home now.

250
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,880
Min, I'm really sorry.

251
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,120
I can't take today's pay.

252
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,880
It's all right.

253
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Keep it.

254
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,080
Head home now. It's already late.

255
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,120
Did we really screw up so bad that
you had to lash out at everyone like this?

256
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,400
I've been working my butt off
to make money and take care of everyone,

257
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,080
but this is what you did, Q?

258
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,600
You took my brother out, put him at risk,
and now you're blaming me for being mad?

259
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,640
Risk? Nonsense.

260
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,280
Nobody got hurt today.

261
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,520
Don't be so dramatic, okay?

262
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,080
All of us were so happy
before we came back and saw you.

263
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,120
You were all happy? That's because
you didn't care about anyone!

264
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,280
You only cared about your own feelings,
not about what could happen to my brother!

265
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,200
You're the one not caring about others!

266
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,520
Did you see Mhen laugh and smile today?

267
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,640
What do you think?
Did I look cool riding a motorcycle?

268
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,240
You said you were doing this
for your brother. But are you sure?

269
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,960
I bet Mhen must be happy,

270
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,240
having a brother like you.

271
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,000
URGENT SALE

272
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,280
Mhen, let's go downstairs and eat.

273
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,480
I've prepared dinner for you
so you can take your medicine.

274
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,440
Mhen.

275
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,280
Mhen!

276
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,840
Mhen!

277
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,280
Mhen! Mhen, get up.

278
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,720
Mhen.

279
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,920
Mhen, don't sleep yet.

280
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
-Mhen, can you hear me?
-Hey, what's going on?

281
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,720
Q, call an ambulance!

282
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,800
Mhen, wake up.

283
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,960
Don't sleep.

284
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,920
Min.

285
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,000
Leave me alone.

286
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,000
The patient is awake now.

287
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,600
The patient just has a common cold.

288
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,360
After a bit of rest with IV fluids,
he'll be able to go home.

289
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,160
It's not because of any infection
in Mhen's heart wound, right?

290
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,480
It's not related at all. You can relax.

291
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,120
The cause might be that
his body hasn't fully recovered yet,

292
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,440
and his immune system is still weak.

293
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,680
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

294
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,480
Please excuse me for now.

295
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,800
Be careful.

296
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,760
I'm feeling better now, Min.

297
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm sorry for getting mad at you today.

298
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,000
Jeen, I'm sorry
for chasing you away like that.

299
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,680
Don't worry. I understand.

300
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,040
Honestly, Min,

301
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,680
nothing like this would have happened
at all today if it hadn't rained.

302
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,400
Do you know? I was super happy.

303
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,400
I got to go out
and learn to ride a motorcycle.

304
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,240
I think I can really take care of myself.

305
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,920
I heard you smiled a lot today.

306
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,080
Yeah.

307
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,760
Watch this. Here's proof.

308
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,160
You're pretty smooth.

309
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,440
Min, I want you to see with your own eyes

310
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,120
that your brother is now cooler than you.

311
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,640
Without Q,
I wouldn't get to do this kind of thing.

312
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,560
Don't forget to say sorry to him.

313
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,560
True.

314
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,240
You were too harsh on him.

315
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,000
Why should I say sorry?
We're all grown-ups.

316
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,440
No one's going to make a big deal
out of something this small.

317
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,960
It's good you're happy.

318
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,160
Thanks a lot.

319
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,240
Let's go home.

320
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
What's with you?

321
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,960
When are you going back to your room?

322
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,640
You think my room has no door,

323
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,200
so you can come in anytime?

324
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,400
Hey, I'm staying
because I'm worried about you.

325
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,600
I'm watching over you.

326
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,040
I'm feeling better now.

327
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,520
After a good night's sleep, I'll be fine.

328
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,400
So, let me sleep.

329
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,960
Okay.

330
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,560
I'm going.

331
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,760
You can stay, right?

332
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,240
Q.

333
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,240
I'm coming in, all right?

334
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,560
Q,

335
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,120
I watched the clip already.

336
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,000
Thank you so much
for taking Mhen out today.

337
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,960
He is really happy.

338
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,040
Q.

339
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,080
Q.

340
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,080
Q.

341
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,200
You caught a cold too?

342
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,440
You're burning up.

343
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,240
Wait here. I'll get you some medicine.

344
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,120
Min.

345
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,240
I'm really sorry

346
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,800
for taking Mhen…

347
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,000
It's all right, Q.

348
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,440
It's all right. I'm not mad anymore.

349
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,120
I'm sorry too.

350
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,040
Take care of yourself.

351
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,280
Mhen is alright now,

352
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,840
and so am I.

353
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,600
Rest. I'll get you some medicine.

354
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,760
Okay?

355
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,440
Take him for now.

356
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,920
Stay with him, okay?

357
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,120
Q, take your tee off for a second.
I'll wipe you down.

358
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,680
The other side too.

359
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,520
Done.

360
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,000
I'll get you a t-shirt.

361
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,240
Here. Put this one on.

362
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,400
You're protective of this one, aren't you?

363
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,200
Hey, you can't wear that one.
My brother bought it for me.

364
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,640
-What's the big deal?
-I told you not to wear it.

365
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
Just wear it.

366
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,800
This tee is warm,

367
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,280
so your fever will go down faster.

368
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,400
Come.

369
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,080
-Q, well…
-I'm sorry.

370
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,720
I didn't think things through

371
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,120
and ended up causing a mess for everyone.

372
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,960
I'm the one who should say sorry.

373
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,280
I was too harsh.

374
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,040
I'm sorry.

375
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,560
Actually, I have to thank you
for making Mhen that happy.

376
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,840
I'm his brother, but I can't do it.

377
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,800
No, Min.

378
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,240
Mhen just wants to be cool like you.

379
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
He complained to me every five minutes

380
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,520
that if you were there,

381
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,040
it'd be more fun.

382
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,840
If you don't know how to lie,
then just don't.

383
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,320
I mean it, Min.

384
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,520
Mhen told me

385
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,120
you like to mess with his life.

386
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
I don't get to go out often.

387
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,080
Min doesn't allow me to.

388
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,320
But, deep down,
I know he's worried about me.

389
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,320
But Mhen understands

390
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,760
why you're doing this whole thing.

391
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,720
As for me,

392
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,560
I think you're already a good brother.

393
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,320
I only have Mhen.

394
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,760
I raised myself,

395
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,480
and I raised him too.

396
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,880
Honestly, I don't even know
how to bring up a kid.

397
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,800
But I'm also really scared

398
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,880
of ruining his life.

399
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:01,280
I'm scared that what I'm doing
isn't right or good for Mhen.

400
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,200
No, Min.

401
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,320
If I had someone who loved me

402
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,280
the way you love Mhen,

403
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,360
I wouldn't ask
for anything else in my life.

404
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,000
Take some medicine too.

405
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,160
Your face is starting to turn red.

406
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,120
Just sleep already.

407
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,080
Is something there?

408
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,280
No. Nothing.

409
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,720
Sleep already.

410
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,160
That's the one I bought for Min, isn't it?

411
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,000
Or…?

412
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,400
Q caught a cold.

413
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,440
This shirt is warm, so I lent it to him.

414
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
Yeah.

415
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,120
Let me sit with you.

416
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,560
Snacks for the sick are here!

417
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,920
Min, you aren't off to work?

418
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,840
How can I?

419
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,520
Our house is full of sick people now.

420
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,360
I must stay and take care of them.

421
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,320
See? As soon as I said that,
his symptoms showed.

422
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,680
Since we're all here together,
it's time for a…

423
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,800
How is this night, Mhen?

424
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,080
-I was planning to just check my work.
-What do we have, Jeen?

425
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,920
Come on. It's not often
we get to be together like this.

426
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,520
Food's here!

427
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,560
It's so mouthwatering.

428
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,000
Let's start the movie, shall we?

429
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,200
You're scared of gunshots, aren't you?

430
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,400
There aren't any more. It's over.

431
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,880
Just eat.

432
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,360
3 YEARS AGO

433
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,440
THANKS A LOT FOR KEEPING AN EYE ON HIM.

434
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,000
I've found the evidence!

435
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,480
I've found the evidence
that proves my son is innocent.

436
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,760
-It's Phoom speaking, right?
-Yes.

437
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,600
Can you meet me today?

438
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
I'll hand over all the evidence to you.

439
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,880
Please excuse me, sir.

440
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,880
Sir, we must hurry and go now.

441
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,640
Where do you want me to meet you?

442
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,760
Do you want to eat something?

443
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,480
Nope. I don't really eat breakfast.
It feels too heavy on my stomach.

444
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,920
I know you don't enjoy breakfast,
so I've prepared some snacks for you.

445
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,160
Here you are.

446
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,800
There.

447
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,760
Give me a second.

448
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,960
My hands are busy, see?
I'm cutting my nails.

449
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,120
Fine.

450
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,320
Here.

451
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,720
What a true silver spoon you are.

452
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,360
I'm feeding you,
but you still get your mouth dirty.

453
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,000
Let me wipe it off.

454
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,040
Is it coming off?

455
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,560
Nope, it's still stuck.
I don't know why it's so sticky.

456
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,040
Come on, no.

457
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,920
-That's my mole.
-Really?

458
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,560
Do you have to go that far?

459
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,320
-How long have you been there?
-Since he clipped the first nail.

460
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,760
You've got hands, so hold it yourself.

461
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,640
I already grabbed it for you.

462
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,320
Take it. I'm not done cutting my nails.

463
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,960
-Do you want some?
-I've got a lot.

464
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,360
I can feed myself.

465
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,040
Your breakfast is here. Won't you eat it?

466
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,240
Three, two, action!

467
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,920
Hey!

468
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,280
Jack.

469
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,680
-I told you.
-Hey!

470
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,360
Where are you going?

471
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,160
-Let me go!
-No way.

472
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,840
-I won't let you go with Petchpirun alone!
-Let me go!

473
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,840
This is my problem.

474
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,080
How I die is my business.

475
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,120
Hah, here you are, troublemaker.

476
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,160
Hey, move!

477
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,280
Go!

478
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,520
Ouch!

479
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,080
Min, is Ms. Vee that strong?

480
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,880
Come on. Don't ask. Just keep acting.

481
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,080
I haven't said cut yet.

482
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,440
Just die already!

483
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,000
Don't!

484
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,120
Jack.

485
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,600
You're mad at me, aren't you?

486
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
Why

487
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,080
have you done this much?

488
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,600
I've treated you terribly all this time.

489
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,920
Why are you still protecting me this much?

490
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,400
Are you and Min really just friends?

491
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,760
-Don't we look like friends?
-Not even close.

492
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,560
Go find out what Kacha's weakness is.

493
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,280
Can I quit this job?

494
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,400
Once you're in this circle,
you can't get out.

495
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,160
Is that guy, Min, one of your men?

496
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,440
He's my favorite.

497
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,360
You're with the people
who want my dad dead?

498
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,560
After all this time,
you don't know me at all, do you?

499
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,880
Min!

500
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,160
What kind of person is Min?

501
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,920
He keeps protecting others
but ends up hurting himself.

502
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,880
If Min really has feelings for you,
are you okay with that, Q?
