00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,850
(Previously)
I know my son well.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,800
When he loves someone,

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,600
he goes all in

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,000
without caring about
the consequences for himself.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,390
Q!

6
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,000
Q!

7
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,540
Q doesn't love himself enough to love someone else.

8
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,500
Let's do this for Q's safety.

9
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,910
Before we lose everything
and are both left with nothing,

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,140
let go of my hands.

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,450
Min, where are you?

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,210
Why did you run away from me?

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,268
I guess it must be raining heavily in Bangkok.

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,000
Min,

15
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,908
why did we have to move to Chonburi?

16
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,510
<i>Min,</i>

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,660
<i>where are you?</i>

18
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,060
Why did you run away from me?

19
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,730
<i>Can you not do this, Min?</i>

20
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:22,700
You know what?

21
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,407
I never trusted everything you said.

22
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,600
Stop doing this already.

23
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,360
<i>I really hate you</i>

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,410
<i>for leaving me like this.</i>

25
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,400
<i>Can you come back already?</i>

26
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,300
I don't want to live alone again, Min.

27
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,720
I can't.

28
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,970
<b>EP08 Decision to Leave</b>

29
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,060
I heard Miss Yada is planning to flee overseas.

30
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,960
Someone saw her at the border.

31
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,110
I think she'll hide there until the case cools down.

32
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,770
Please send the information you got to my team.

33
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,560
Yes.

34
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,770
Q.

35
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,300
Why haven't you flown to Vancouver yet?

36
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,100
I'm not going anymore.

37
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,600
But if you feel uneasy

38
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,550
and want to have your men guard me, go ahead.

39
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,500
Q.

40
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,260
Q.

41
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,560
Suea.

42
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,760
You have some free time these days, right?

43
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,010
Yes, Mr.Kacha.

44
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,150
Did Min tell you where he went?

45
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,620
Come on, Q.

46
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,400
I told you I really have no idea.

47
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,020
I'm still feeling slighted, you know.

48
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,110
I see him as my brother,

49
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,250
but look at what he did.

50
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,930
He disappeared without saying a single word to me.

51
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,000
James, can you guess where he might have gone?

52
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,400
I can't,

53
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,310
but I can guess that

54
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,600
he ran away because of Mhen.

55
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,800
For someone like Min,

56
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,400
if it's about his brother,

57
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,950
he can leave everything behind.

58
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,500
I think you should get over him,

59
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,110
He's thought it through enough.

60
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,620
Min.

61
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,970

63
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,860
<i>I promise.</i>

64
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,540
I have three more exams to go.

65
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,620
How could I finish studying in time?

66
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,340
<i>Don't worry, Jeen.</i>

67
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,310
<i>I'll tutor you as always,</i>

68
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,190
<i>but let's make it online this time.</i>

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:13,900
Come on.

70
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,550

<i>Jeen!</i>

74
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:19,820
Who are you talking to, Jeen?

75
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,730
<b>KANOMJEEN</b>

00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,040
Hello, Jeen?

77
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,670
<i>Min, don't hang up!</i>

78
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,720
<i>Tell me where you are now!</i>

79
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,510
<i>Where I'm at is my business.</i>

80
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
<i>It has nothing to do with you.</i>

81
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,660
Stop doing this already, Min.

82
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,660
<i>I'm not going to Vancouver no matter what.</i>

83
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,740
<i>I'll stay here.</i>

84
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,400
I'll find you, Min.

85
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,560
Q.

86
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,900
<i>I didn't run away from you.</i>

87
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,800
<i>I had been selling my house for ages.</i>

88
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,860
<i>After it was sold,</i>

89
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,470
<i>I moved out. That's it.</i>

90
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,570
Whether you're going to Vancouver or staying here

91
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,010
has nothing to do with me.

92
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,100
<i>Stop pretending you don't care about me.</i>

93
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,400
I want to be with you,

94
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,960
and you want to be with me.

95
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,410
<i>I don't want to be with you.</i>

96
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,360
<i>I told you already</i>

97
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,210
I wouldn't risk my brother's life anymore.

98
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,900
<i>I can't risk my life either.</i>

99
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,180
<i>I only have Mhen,</i>

100
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,800
and Mhen only has me.

101
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,770
Since I chose my family,

102
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,980
that means I can't have you in my life.

103
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,100
Is this what you really think, Min?

104
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,810
Exactly.

105
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,520
Forget me already.

106
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,690
<i>I'll forget you, too.</i>

107
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,410
Are Mhen and you doing fine?

108
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,100
We're fine.

Mr. Q still visits Min's house often.

00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,570
Do you want me to announce the sale now, Mr. Kacha?

114
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,800
Otherwise, it'll be pointless to have them move out.

115
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,100
You ordered Min to do this, right?!

116
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,100
What did you say to him?!

117
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,790
I think you'd better calm down.

Where is Min now?!

<i>Now, Min is at his old house in Chonburi.</i>

Give me a second.

Q is with me now, Suea,

122
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,100
but it's already late, so he has to sleep over.

123
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,170
In the morning, I'll let him leave.

124
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,320
Sure.

125
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,710
Who told you I'm heading back?

126
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,200
And who told you I'm letting you stay?

127
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,960
I've already found out that

128
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,740
my dad forced you to stay here.

129
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,100
Stop acting cool already.

130
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,850
I told you nobody forced me to do anything.

131
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,200
- I made my own decision.
- Don't say that.

132
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,300
I won't believe it anyway.

133
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,980
Well said.

134
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,960
You can stay here, but only for tonight.

135
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,710
After you wake up tomorrow, head back.

136
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,460
I don't know.

137
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,210
We'll see. It depends on my mood.

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,410
Ouch, Min.

140
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,100
What happened to your arm again?

141
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,250
I climbed your house in Bangkok.

142
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,730
I told you already not to go back there again.

143
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,970
Stop arguing already.

144
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,550
Let's go to bed.

145
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,430
I'm already sleepy,

146
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,320
but let's bring a blanket to lie down here.

147
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,980
I don't want you to sleep alone, Q.

148
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,510
This house has a scary ghost.

149
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,340
At night,

150
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,860
I hear crying sounds every night,

151
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,420
like 'hoo hoo hoo.'

152
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,900
Just talking about it gives me chills.

153
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,340
Hoo, hoo.

154
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,822
He thinks he looks that cute, huh?

156
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,300
Yeah?

157
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,100
I'm sorry

158
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,200
for being the reason that put you in trouble.

159
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,570
Don't worry at all.

160
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,060
You don't have to say sorry.

161
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,700
You saved me.

162
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,410
I should thank you.

163
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,619
But if you just lived your normal life,

164
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,349
you wouldn't have to face such a thing from the start.

165
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:44,019
Am I right?

166
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,268
You aren't supposed to face
something terrible like this, either.

167
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,610
But I understand that
it's something you've been born with.

168
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,110
It can't be fixed.

169
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,560
Take me as an example.

170
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,465
I can't do anything about this
apart from living with it as happy as I can.

171
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,710
You're this cute.

172
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,970
That's why Min loves you so dearly.

173
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,570
Let's sleep.

174
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,011
You're gossiping about me, huh?

175
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,040
No.

176
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,200
Let's sleep, Mhen.

177
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,300
Mhen, move. I'll sleep here, too.

178
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,020
Turn off the light.

179
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,130
Let's sleep.

180
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,560
Did you really use the same soap as us?

181
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:17,010
Why does your body smell so good?

182
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,970
It doesn't smell the same.

183
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,430
- It isn't?
- Yeah.

184
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,000
I used that one in the bathroom.

185
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,050
You did?

186
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,260
What's with you?

187
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,510
I'm attached to the bolster.

188
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,990
Your bedroom doesn't even have one.

189
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,120
Be quiet. I'll sleep.

190
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,220
Let's sleep.

191
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,660
Q.

192
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,850
Q, you're sleepwalking.

193
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,225
You're heading toward the wall.
You might bump into it.

194
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,210
Let's go back to sleep.

195
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,890
I'm sorry.

196
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,860
I broke our promise.

197
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,770
Min!

198
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,900
My car's broken.

199
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,110
I can't go back anymore.

200
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,220
Hello, mechanic?

201
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,500
There's a car broken in front of my house.

202
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,170
Can you come check it out now, please?

203
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,230
Okay. Thank you so much.

204
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,200
After your car is fixed,

205
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,010
you must head back.

206
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,820
I don't know.

207
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,251
- We'll see.
- Q.

208
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
I'm being serious here.

209
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,370
How many times do I have to say this?

210
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,660
You can't stay here.

211
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,670
You must head back.

212
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,950
Why must I?

213
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,010
Yada and her men have already escaped overseas.

214
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,400
My dad isn't handling a new case, either.

215
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,160
If you make me go back now,

216
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,170
it's like you're breaking up
with me for free. Don't you know?

217
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,420
Don't you regret it?

218
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,008
After your car is fixed, you must head back.

219
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,570
Fine.

220
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,160
Alright.

221
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,850
But while we're waiting,

222
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,742
how about going on a trip?

223
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,705
What attractions do we have here in Chonburi?

224
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:09,565
Show me around.

225
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,670
A trip?

226
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,110
I don't have time for that.

227
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,410
I have to work.

228
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,900
Just take Q to work with you.

229
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,410
You usually take me with you, don't you?

230
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,520
Hey, Min.

231
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,160
What job are you doing?

232
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,160
What do you think?

233
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,210
It's a surf shop.

234
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,610
I teach customers to surf, and I'm also a staff here.

235
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,410
Go buy a drink and sit to wait for me.

236
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,708
I don't want to trouble the shop owner.

237
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,610
That's cool.

238
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,405
Well, hi.

239
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,110
Oh, hi.

240
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:56,800
Excuse me. Can you help me with surfing?

241
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,650
Oh, sure.

242
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,800
- Let's go.
- Okay.

243
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,970
Thank you.

244
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:05,550
Right?

245
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,100
Right.

246
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,770
Like this?

247
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,430
Yes.

248
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay.

249
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,610
Do this for ten seconds.

250
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,720
Are you Min's friend?

251
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,810
Yes.

252
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,470
Thank you.

253
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,960
By the way, how is Min?

254
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,570
He's hard-working and determined.

255
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,700
He's gaining more customers.

256
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,912
As you know, he's handsome and caring.

257
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:23,960
Any customer who came here liked him.

258
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,300
Enjoy.

259
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,592
Okay. Next is Dynamic Stretching.

260
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,245
Right, okay.

261
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,370
So, how do I do this?

262
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,310
You have to run.

263
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,010
On the?

264
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,950
Yeah. Like this.

265
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,010
Thirty seconds.

266
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,540
Right.

267
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,570
Okay.

268
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,008
And next, you have to stretch like this.

269
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,720
Let's go!

270
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:47,220
I'm so excited.

271
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,260
We have to learn how to stand on the board.

272
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,120
Min, wait for me!

273
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm joining you.

274
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,010
Let me talk to a friend.

275
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,610
Okay.

276
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,060
Teach me, too.

277
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,640
I'm also your customer.

278
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,890
But you don't have any basic skills.

279
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,832
You can't get in the water.

280
00:22:05,842 --> 00:22:06,670
You could get hurt.

281
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,400
I know

282
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,910
- you will never let me get hurt.
- Q.

283
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,000
Okay, and first, we have to…

284
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:22,760
Ouch!

285
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,666
Hey, Q!

286
00:22:25,703 --> 00:22:26,370
Ouch!

287
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,860
See? I told you.

288
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,600
Can't you just let me live
a relaxing life for just a day?

289
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,650
Working already tires me off.

290
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,240
But just now,

291
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,800
I didn't mean it to happen.

292
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,250
I had to ask for permission to leave early today.

293
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,360
Get up.

294
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,110
Let's head back.

295
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:23,560
Q.

296
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,010
Q!

297
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,100
Thank you.

298
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,470
Q!

299
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,570
Ouch!

300
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,830
Why are you walking now?

301
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,020
You have a wound. Sands might get into it.

302
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,205
Your foot is injured,
and you're still stopping by everywhere.

303
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,860
I see that you're tired,

304
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,350
so I grabbed something refreshing for you.

305
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,420
Just drink it.

306
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,940
Are you sure you won't drink it?

307
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,360
Little Q even bought this for Phi Min.

308
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,600
Drink a little,

309
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:53,970
so you won't feel hot.

310
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,580
Please, Phi Min.

311
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,710
Phi Min.

312
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,000
Drink some, Phi Min.

313
00:23:59,280 --> 00:23:59,920
Drink some.

314
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,450
You're smiling now.

315
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,660
I'm not.

316
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,343
It just feels refreshing.

317
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,410
Let's head back already.

318
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,650
Wait for me, Min.

319
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,420
Ouch!

320
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,400
Take it.

321
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,410
Get on.

322
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,300
You always make me worry about you.

323
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,770
Hey, that's mine.

324
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,520
What? I haven't drunk it.

325
00:24:53,161 --> 00:24:53,860
You want it this way, right?

326
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,010
Alright. I'm giving in.

327
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,030
Drink it then, Phi Min.

328
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,680
Happy now?

329
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,540
Why didn't you go to Vancouver then?

330
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,170
Do you remember the day we filmed that zombie MV?

331
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah.

332
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,610
I thought of what you said.

333
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,210
You told me to run away
if you ever turned into a zombie.

334
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:25,810
So, I thought you must be doing such a thing.

335
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,810
You protected me,

336
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,010
wanting me to be safe.

337
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,560
You did everything to make me go to Vancouver.

338
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,010
But if you go there,

339
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,820
you'll be safe.

340
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,660
For what, Min?

341
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,210
To be safe but alone?

342
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,410
Previously,

343
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,210
I felt like I was just living a life.

344
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,670
I had nothing.

345
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,309
Though I was lonely,
I didn't dare to open up to anyone.

346
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,510
I had a nightmare every night.

347
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,000
All I could do was cry by myself.

348
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:07,800
You know what?

349
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,533
I just remembered what happiness feels like
now that I'm with you, Min.

350
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,510
I'm sorry for being selfish,

351
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,890
but I want to be with you, Min.

352
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,460
In the end,

353
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,718
I turned out to be the troublemaker.

354
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,765
I've become a zombie.

355
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,200
Now that I'm a zombie,

356
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,720
will you shoot me

357
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,210
or let me bite you?

358
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,240
You'll see.

359
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,600
Q, Min.

360
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,460
They've done fixing the car.

361
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,750
Your leg is hurt, isn't it?

362
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,210
You can't drive.

363
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,700
Stay here one more night.

364
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,170
Is he angry about something?

365
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,160
Min!

366
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:07,570
Mhen!

367
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,470
Min!

368
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:10,500
Mhen!

369
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:18,920
Hey, Q?

370
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,320
You're up already?

371
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,410
By the way,

372
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,660
this red wolf suits you well.

373
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:31,700
Well,

374
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,800
Min allowed you to ride a motorcycle already?

375
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,310
Yeah,

376
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,936
only when I have to go out to buy food.

377
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,917
Also, I lived here when I was a kid.

378
00:28:39,937 --> 00:28:40,874
Everyone here knows each other.

379
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,810
That's why Min allowed me to.

380
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,740
Where is Min now?

381
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,000
He works as a trainer at the gym.

382
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,710
By the way,

383
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,870
Min asked you to take a shower and get dressed.

384
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,040
He'll take us on a trip.

385
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,720
A trip?

386
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,890
Where?

387
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,700
If I tell you, it's not going to be a surprise.

388
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,010
Let's eat.

389
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,020
I'm hungry.

390
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,400
So, where is Min taking us?

391
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:12,760
I won't tell you.

392
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,810
You'll find out soon.

393
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,000
Whose car is that?

394
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,060
I borrowed it from the surf shop's owner.

395
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,260
Why don't we just use my car?

396
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,910
Your car only fits two people.

397
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,870
There are three of us here. How can we use your car?

398
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,100
What are you looking at? Let's get moving.

399
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,620
Now.

400
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,770
Hold on.

401
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,660
Do I look handsome today?

402
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,020
Yeah.

403
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,210
You're already handsome.

404
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,300
Let's go now.

405
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,610
Let's go, Mhen.

406
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,100
How was today?

407
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,170
Did you enjoy it?

408
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:28,720
I did.

409
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,222
What were you thinking bringing me here?

410
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,040
I wanted to apologize for leaving you.

411
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,500
You already did that on the first night I arrived.

412
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:39,930
Huh?

413
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,200
Yeah.

414
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,010
I didn't sleepwalk that night.

415
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,408
So, was that what you did
every time I sleepwalked at night?

416
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,100
Nope.

417
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,604
I just followed what the website suggested.

418
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,550
I did what it said.

419
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:03,310
So, did I look silly pretending
to play it cool with you?

420
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,500
No, you didn't.

421
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,600
I'm glad to know that you still love me.

422
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,840
Did I ever say I love you?

423
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,750
Then say it.

424
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,170
I've got the answer
to your question from yesterday.

425
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,830
You asked if I'd shoot you or let you bite me
if you turned into a zombie.

426
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,970
<b>Q</b>

427
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,210
So,

428
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,900
when are Min and you moving back to Bangkok?

429
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,160
Min said we moved here for good.

430
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,260
He wanted me to continue my study here.

431
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:30,610
But he made that decision then because of you.

432
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,370
I'm not sure...

433
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,000
if he has changed his mind already.

434
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,810
If you really have to live here,

435
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,810
won't you miss Kanomjeen?

436
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,460
Actually...

437
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,310
I already asked her to study here with me.

438
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,540
Snacks and food are here!

439
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,810
I'll go grab some drinks.

440
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,000
It's alright, Mhen.

441
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,530
I'm going to the toilet.

442
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,060
Won't you ask a bit where Mhen is going?

443
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,300
Maybe he's just grabbing some snacks.

444
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,210
You've been less strict with Mhen these days.

445
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,520
Come on.

446
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,980
You used to blame me for being protective of him.

447
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,130
It's good you're doing this.

448
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:12,560
Look at Mhen.

449
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,210
He seems a lot more lively.

450
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,200
I guess it's because he has things to do.

451
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,910
When he's bored, he just chills at the beach.

452
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,714
There's a market down the street from our place.

453
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,790
You know what?

454
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,370
You taught him to ride a motorcycle, right?

455
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,210
Now it's less than 10 meters from our house
to the street with the food shop,

456
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,800
and he rides his motorcycle there.

457
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,910
Is something wrong?

458
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:36,700
No.

459
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,601
I'm just feeling a bit of pain around my wound.

460
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,820
Hey, it's alright.

461
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,700
It's normal.

462
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,460
The wound isn't healed yet,

463
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:48,960
and I've been walking a lot.

464
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,420
Whoa.

465
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,640
The sea is very sweet.

466
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,300
Who told you to tease me?

467
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,417
It's worth teasing, isn't it?

468
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,410
Yesterday, you chased him away.

469
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,600
Today, you asked, “Is your wound hurt, darling, my baby?”

470
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,594
Baby? Nonsense. I never said that.

471
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,272
Come here. Come here. Come here now!

472
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:09,312
What should you do
when running after your brother?

473
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,570
You're cheating.

474
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,530
Here you go.

475
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,250
I can't keep up!

476
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,830
Hey!

477
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:23,820
Q!

478
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,410
Q!

479
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:35,360
It's over.

480
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,210
It's over.

481
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,220
Q, it's over.

482
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,050
It's alright. You're fine.

483
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,710
They were just lighting firecrackers.

484
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,910
Everything is alright now. It's over.

485
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,670
I'll head to my room and sleep, Min.

486
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,310
How about we sleep upstairs tonight?

487
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,533
No, Min.

488
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:22,820
I think I should head back now.

489
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,110
Why?

490
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,960
It's already late. Why not head back tomorrow?

491
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,760
Driving at night is dangerous.

492
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,260
It's fine.

493
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,760
I think I should head back now.

494
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:43,920
But...

495
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,260
But you're okay, right?

496
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,820
Or do you have work early tomorrow?

497
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,480
Min, I've changed my mind.

498
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,100
I think...

499
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,160
I'll go to Vancouver.

500
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:06,900
What do you mean?

501
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:12,520
At first, I came here because I thought
my dad forced you to make this decision.

502
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,410
But now,

503
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:21,520
I can see that you and Mhen are better off
than when you were in Bangkok.

504
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,670
You have your own way of life.

505
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,610
<i>You're already handsome.</i>

506
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,770
Mhen is also really happy.

507
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,500
<i>You're up already?</i>

508
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,570
What you said is true.

509
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:38,470
We shouldn't risk someone else's life like this.

510
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,660
Hey, Q.

511
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,760
But back then,

512
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,801
I said that because I wanted you
to be somewhere safe.

513
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,420
- I didn't mean it like that.
- But it's true, Min.

514
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,700
You also know it's true.

515
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,020
But you told me you wouldn't run away again.

516
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,100
I lied.

517
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,210
Someone like me will always face this.

518
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:07,860
I think...

519
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,110
it's best for me to be alone.

520
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,700
Nope.

521
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,720
- I don't think that at all.
- Min.

522
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:16,920
Earlier today,

523
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,010
when Mhen heard the firecrackers,

524
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,310
he started to fear them just like I do.

525
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,140
<i>Hey!</i>

526
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,010
<i>Q!</i>

527
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,010
See?

528
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:39,140
It's not worth it at all risking our loved
one's life for our own happiness.

529
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,860
So...

530
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,420
So what now?

531
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,370
Do you want me to let you go back to your old life?

532
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,800
Like you told me you were just living day by day?

533
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,800
Parting while alive is
better than parting in death.

534
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:02,000
I think if we stay knowing that...

535
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,820
one day we loved each other so much,

536
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:11,170
and right now you're somewhere happy and safe,

537
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,310
it's really not that bad.

538
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,610
Are you really leaving?

539
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,470
Go back and choose Mhen's life like you always did.

540
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,620
As for me,

541
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,160
I'll just go back and live alone, like before.

542
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,810
Please say goodbye to Mhen for me.

543
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:45,600
Be really happy, okay?

544
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,760
Think that you're doing it for me.

545
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:55,560
Let go of me.

546
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,730
Q.

547
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,410
Q.

548
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:15,940
No.

549
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,620
Q. Q!

550
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,410
Q!

551
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,010
Q!

552
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,160
Q!

553
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,120
Q, pull over!

554
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:46,930
Pull over!

555
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,210
Q.

556
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,500
Q, open the door.

557
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,340
Q!

558
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,560
Q!

559
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,160
Talk to me.

560
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,110
Q, talk to me.

561
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,360
Please.

562
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:13,308
Why are you doing this?

563
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,600
Q, listen up.

564
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,210
I can't let go of you.

565
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,610
How about we figure out a way, Q?

566
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:47,610
- There must be a way for us to be together.
- I won't let you face such a thing again, Min.

567
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,760
I won't let you get back to your life again either, Q.

568
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,990
I know that from now you'll start
building walls around yourself

569
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,730
and isolate from everyone.

570
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,640
You'll never find happiness again.

571
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,100
I won't let that happen.

572
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,310
I'm fine with that.

573
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,900
But I'm not.

574
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,910
Since that day,

575
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:17,002
there hasn't been a single day
I didn't regret letting you go.

576
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,020
Just the thought of you sleeping alone...

577
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,708
made it impossible for me to sleep.

578
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,700
I made a wrong decision once.

579
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,560
I won't make that mistake again.

580
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,710
I'm not afraid of anything anymore, Q.

581
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,100
I just want to be with you.

582
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,610
From now on,

583
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,270
no matter what problem we face,

584
00:42:56,531 --> 00:42:59,610
can we fix it together
and find a way through? Can we do that?

585
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,360
I won't let you go anywhere again.

586
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,210
Stay with me, okay?

587
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,300
Do you understand what I said?

588
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:15,560
You really get it, right?

589
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,500
Yeah.

590
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,410
I love you, Q.

591
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,570
I love you, too, Min.

592
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,450

Is there something Min particularly likes?

594
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,540
I don't know either.

595

<b>PAD THAI? / MOTORCYCLE? / GAMES? / MALA? / ICE-CREAM? / DOGS?</b>

596
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,530
What are you writing down?

597
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,070
No. Nothing.

598
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,410
Hey, Min.

599
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:37,830
We haven't seen each other in ages. Do you miss me?

600
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,320
You couldn't reach me by phone,
so I bet you missed me a lot.

601
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:39,770
<b>THIRD?</b>
James, are Third and Min that close?

602
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,400
James, are Third and Min that close?

603
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:42,960
Are you jealous?

604
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:43,760
Great job, Min.

605
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:44,810
- Just this?
- Amazing job.

606
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,710
Wow.

607
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,130
You're really that jealous?

608
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:47,960
Yeah, of course.

609
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:48,920
You're looking cute when you're jealous.

610
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,820
If you knew I'd get jealous, why did you tease me?

611
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,700
No one fits my type as perfectly as Q does.

612
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,060
Closer.

613
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:54,900
Closer.
