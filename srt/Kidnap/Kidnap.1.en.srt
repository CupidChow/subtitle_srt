1
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,560
Don't move if you want to live!

2
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,680
Slate, please.

3
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,160
Phitsawatrak Nam Tai Sok,
scene 4/13. Cut 1, take 1. Slate.

4
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,880
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,120
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,560
Hey, no worries.

7
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,120
You're a stand-in.
There's no need to act that well.

8
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,000
Just replacing that jerk of a leading man
is good enough for me.

9
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
Hello.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,240
Ryukyu is here.

11
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,200
Reset, please.

12
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,760
-Hurry up.
-This way, please.

13
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,080
And after "action"…

14
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,560
No lines this time.

15
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,000
Hello.

16
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,199
Mama, I'm heading back.

17
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,960
-Are you?
-Yes.

18
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,720
I saved some food for you.

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,200
-Mama, thank you so much.
-No problem.

20
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,600
Eat it when you get home.

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,200
-I'd be in trouble without you.
-Don't worry about it.

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,520
-Goodbye. I'm off.
-Goodbye. Good luck.

23
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,520
RYUKYU
FOOD SUPPORT

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Hello, bro. Got any for me?

25
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,160
-Take four.
-Oh, thank you so much.

26
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,320
Without you, I'd be in trouble.

27
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,600
Thank you so much.

28
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,160
Hey, Min! You're asking
for this much food?

29
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,960
Why not ask the food trucks to park
at your house while you're at it?

30
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,720
Come on, bro.

31
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,680
I have to save some for later.

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,840
There's no more stunt jobs
from you this week.

33
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,200
My brother and I need to eat.

34
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,080
If you're really in need of money,

35
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,400
are you interested in a job
working with real guns?

36
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,760
Hold on, bro.

37
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,880
I'm only in it for the fake guns.
I'm fine being a stuntman.

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,640
If I mess up and end up in jail,
who'll take care of Mhen?

39
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,440
But is this the payment for today?

40
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,400
This little?

41
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,440
All right.

42
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,400
Since you're my dear brother,
I've got a casting opportunity for you.

43
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,360
Interested?

44
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,280
What's the job?

45
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,640
It's for a foreign film. They need
a stuntman who can do some lines.

46
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,000
The pay is pretty good.

47
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,640
How good?

48
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,560
About… ten times.

49
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,640
-What you're holding now.
-Ten times?

50
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,200
Seriously?

51
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,520
But the script is in English.

52
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,480
There. I just forwarded
the details to you.

53
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,120
The audition is tomorrow.
Make sure you nail it.

54
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,640
Don't mess up and embarrass me.

55
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,440
Okay. I'll go home and study the script.

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,800
Thank you so much.

57
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,800
I'm off.

58
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
Goodbye.

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Thanks a lot.

60
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,200
Patient's relative, are you available
to discuss medical bills today?

61
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,280
Here you are.

62
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,440
TOTAL 422,636 THB

63
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,000
MY SAVINGS

64
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,080
Do you want me to adjust the bed again?

65
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,560
-Nope. I'm good.
-Are you sure?

66
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,480
Okay.

67
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,720
Oh, hey, Min, you're here.

68
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,720
Yeah.

69
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,480
The doctor asked me to tell you that
the surgery went well.

70
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,720
He just needs rest
and to follow these instructions.

71
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,240
Okay.

72
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,400
KASEMCHAT HOSPITAL

73
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,160
Please excuse me for now. I don't want to
arrive home late, or Dad will complain.

74
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,280
Okay.

75
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,400
-Hey, Jeen.
-Yes?

76
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,560
Take this.

77
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,040
Min, I told you, I won't take money.

78
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,880
Just treat me to a meal instead.

79
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,400
Take it, Jeen.

80
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,120
You've taken care of him for me
many times.

81
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,360
Consider it as gas money
for your trip home.

82
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Okay?

83
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,680
Keep it.

84
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,640
All right.

85
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,360
Thank you.

86
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,760
Bye-bye. Have a safe trip home.

87
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,440
Bye-bye. See you at home, Mhen.

88
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,400
Bye.

89
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,040
-Bye.
-Bye.

90
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,680
Mhen, let's eat.

91
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,320
This box is for today.

92
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,040
Save these for later.

93
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,800
You won't eat?

94
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,800
I'm good. Go ahead.

95
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,080
Come on.

96
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,280
I just had my pacemaker replaced.
It didn't hurt even a bit.

97
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,520
The surgery's finished
and I'm recovered now.

98
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,080
I'll be home in a few days.

99
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,360
Stop making that sad puppy face.

100
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,720
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

101
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,880
Min, one more thing.

102
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,680
Next time, I don't think
we need to come to this hospital.

103
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,480
I know it's expensive here.

104
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,360
Let's go to a government hospital.
We can use the 30 THB health card.

105
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,280
It's all right, Mhen.
I don't want you to wait in long queues.

106
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,560
Remember? Last time, we waited so long
that your condition almost worsened.

107
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,560
It's just you, Mhen.
I can take care of you.

108
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,880
I'm not a kid anymore. Also,
my heart wall is just slightly thick.

109
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,400
We didn't need to do all this.

110
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,640
Just this? This?

111
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,120
How thick? This?

112
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,120
Just slightly thick? Are you sure?

113
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,039
Yeah.

114
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Come.

115
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,720
You can't move, right? I'll feed you.

116
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,520
URGENT SALE

117
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,040
Hey, Min.

118
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,760
Hello, sir.

119
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,680
How is it going?

120
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,560
When is your house getting sold?

121
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,960
Not yet, but…

122
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,960
Fucking "but" again?

123
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,280
You always come up with your damn excuses.
When are you paying the debt?

124
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,600
It's no small amount.

125
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,880
Sir, I'll pay you soon.

126
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,680
I'll certainly manage to find the money.

127
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,320
Please give me a little more time.

128
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,080
-Sir, I have a bit of money with me now.
-Hey. Stand down.

129
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Please take it.

130
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,440
Is this all you've got?

131
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,320
Yes.

132
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,400
I'll take it as a partial payment for now.

133
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,800
Hello, James?

134
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,480
Hello, Min? Where are you now?

135
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,720
I'm here.

136
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,280
-Where is the audition room?
-On the fourth floor.

137
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Hurry here.
I'll wait in front of the room.

138
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,720
Fourth floor, right?
Okay. All right.

139
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

140
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,800
-It's all stained.
-Hey. What are you doing?

141
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,760
What am I doing?

142
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,240
My sweater is torn now!
How will you take responsibility?

143
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,840
You weren't watching
where you were walking either.

144
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,680
-I saw you with your head down.
-What?

145
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,800
-You won't take responsibility?
-Why should I?

146
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,280
You weren't looking where you were going
either. Your coffee spilled on my shirt.

147
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,680
-How about we call it even?
-Even?! This is expensive!

148
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,600
So what do you want me to do?
I don't have the money to pay for it.

149
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,640
-What was that for?
-You tore mine. I tore yours.

150
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,080
Huh? You can't just do that.

151
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,680
You're so unreasonable!

152
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,720
-So what?
-Hey, what's with you?

153
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,000
-So what?
-What?

154
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,000
Calm down, please.
Please, head to the entrance.

155
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,120
This way, please.

156
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,280
-Don't let me see you again!
-Or what, you spoiled brat?

157
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,200
Follow me, please.

158
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,760
-Don't let me see you again.
-Or what?!

159
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,680
James.

160
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,960
Shit. What happened?

161
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,680
Why did you show up looking like this?

162
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,400
Did I make it in time?

163
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,600
Yeah, you did.

164
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,560
Did you study the script well?

165
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,320
I've almost memorized it all.
I printed it out.

166
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,640
Let me go over my notes one more time
and I'll be good.

167
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,240
Officers have successfully managed
to control a blaze

168
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,040
that broke out at an abandoned
warehouse in Pathum Thani.

169
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,320
Inside, a significant amount
of heroin was found,

170
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,560
which police believe was intended
for international transport.

171
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,280
In addition, two unidentified male bodies
were discovered.

172
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,760
Today, Police Brigadier General
Kacha Yuenyongwisutt,

173
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,280
Deputy Commander
of the Narcotics Suppression Bureau,

174
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,960
expanded the investigation,
revealing that the warehouse owner

175
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,000
is Mr. Panat Pokket, also known as Pond.

176
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,360
MYSTERIOUS BODIES FOUND
IN BURNED WAREHOUSE

177
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,680
The police have now detained
Mr. Panat Pokket as a suspect.

178
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,000
Further investigations are underway.

179
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,720
We have already detained the suspect, the
warehouse owner, for further questioning.

180
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,280
-Do you think someone is behind this?
-We need to investigate further.

181
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,760
We're gathering more evidence

182
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,760
to ensure the culprits are brought
to justice as quickly as possible.

183
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,520
Thank you. Please excuse me for now.

184
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,160
Hey. It's all right.

185
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,640
Let's try again next time.

186
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,560
James.

187
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,480
What's that real gun job you mentioned?

188
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,560
YUENYONGWISUTT'S HOUSE

189
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,280
I'm Yada, a businesswoman.

190
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,240
I'm here today to discuss

191
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,400
a potential business opportunity with you.

192
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,040
I'm not interested in doing
any business with you.

193
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,720
We also know that
the bodies we found in the warehouse

194
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,560
were your men.

195
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Well then, can this help you pretend
to forget the whole thing?

196
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,160
I'd rather proceed
with the evidence we have.

197
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,280
What's right will be acknowledged as such,

198
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,880
and the guilty must face the consequences.

199
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,120
Well then,

200
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,560
I wish you luck, Deputy Commander Kacha.

201
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,560
Dad.

202
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,960
What was that all about?

203
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,560
It has nothing to do with you, Q.

204
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,600
How can it not? So many people were
crowding into our house.

205
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,640
Can't you quit this job?

206
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,240
Why are you risking your life?

207
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,119
-Aren't you afraid of being killed?
-It's my job.

208
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,480
James,

209
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,600
isn't this a restaurant?

210
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,200
This is where I make my money.

211
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,160
Come in.

212
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,360
Min.

213
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,280
Come in.

214
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,200
This way, please.

215
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,920
Confused, huh?

216
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,920
What's this, James?

217
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,920
Welcome to Hidden Dragon.

218
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,840
What do you think? Confused, man?

219
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,080
Pretend you're clueless about everything.

220
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,960
After we greet him,
we'll slip away quickly.

221
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,840
Hello, Suea.

222
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,640
Hello, Suea.

223
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,200
Who did you bring with you?

224
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,640
This is Min, my biological brother.

225
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,680
Why did you bring him?

226
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,200
Whoa. You're looking sharp as always.

227
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,720
I'm glad to see you.

228
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,760
Let's talk if there's a chance.

229
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,960
James, are we really all right?

230
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah.

231
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,920
You came in quietly,
so you'd better leave quietly too.

232
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,080
Here's what you asked me to find.

233
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Thank you, bro.

234
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,800
Thanks.

235
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,440
James.

236
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
What?

237
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,600
What is this job, really?

238
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,520
A kidnapping.

239
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,520
Who are we kidnapping?

240
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,640
His name is Q.

241
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,400
My source said we would find him easily
around Thong Lor or shopping malls.

242
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,080
He likes to hang out by himself.

243
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,360
That's why it's a good chance
for us to kidnap him.

244
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,560
Don't you think so, Min?

245
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,920
Min.

246
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,160
Min!

247
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,840
Yes, bro?

248
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,000
Why are you staring
at his photo that much?

249
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,320
It's as if you're possessed.
Are you even listening?

250
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,840
Yes.

251
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,480
Yeesh. Can you really do this job?

252
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,720
James.

253
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,560
Yes?

254
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,320
What did Q do that displeased someone?

255
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,480
Why does he have to be
kidnapped like this?

256
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,280
I have no idea.

257
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,640
But this is how it is with the rich.

258
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,800
They always get in people's way.

259
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,320
But don't worry.

260
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,560
Once the job is done,
we're out of their lives.

261
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,480
Min, something is strange.

262
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,240
-What is it?
-Your sunglasses.

263
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,520
Is the pattern strange?

264
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,760
It is, and so are you. Take them off.

265
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,720
Min.

266
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Where have you been?

267
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,840
-Didn't you signal me to go buy ice cream?
-I didn't.

268
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,400
I bought one for you.

269
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,880
What's wrong?

270
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,840
Well,

271
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,080
I don't want to do it anymore.

272
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,800
Min… I understand it's difficult,

273
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,040
and if you want to bail now, I get it.

274
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,360
But seriously,
I don't think you have many choices.

275
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,680
MONDAY, MAY 6TH, 11:12 PM.

276
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,520
Are you having fun?

277
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,040
Why are you stressed out?
Do you want to play?

278
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,560
Hey, he moved already.

279
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,520
Asshole. He's a human.
It's normal for him to move, isn't it?

280
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,000
No, I mean, he's leaving the bar already.

281
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,320
Hey, let me have a look.

282
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,600
I'll follow him.

283
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,000
Hey! Make sure nobody sees you.

284
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,440
Handsome and beautiful brother,
would you like to buy some flowers?

285
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,160
What flowers are you selling?

286
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,480
Did your dad force you to do it?

287
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,160
Why did he let you do such a thing?

288
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,520
Why doesn't he pay attention
to you at all? Where is he?

289
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,000
He's over there.

290
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,040
Dad?

291
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,040
Hello, Dad.

292
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,360
Well, then,

293
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,000
I'll take all of them.

294
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,880
Are you going to give them
to those in the bar,

295
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,000
so you can have some friends?

296
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,120
I'm sorry. Sorry.

297
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,320
Here you are. This is for you.

298
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,040
Bro, here you are.

299
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,960
This is for you.

300
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,640
This is for you.

301
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,160
This is for you.

302
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,120
For you, bro.

303
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,960
This is for you.

304
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
Hey!

305
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,360
Hey!

306
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,480
Oh crap!

307
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,760
Hey!

308
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,440
I'm sorry.

309
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,920
You want a flower too?

310
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,520
What the hell are you doing?

311
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,120
Help me.

312
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,400
He's freaking heavy.

313
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,960
Untie me!

314
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,760
Let me go!

315
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,440
Let me go!

316
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,560
I'm going to get the money
from the client.

317
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,160
-Watch him closely in the meantime.
-Let me go!

318
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,280
Let go of me!

319
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,960
Let me go!

320
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,240
Take it.

321
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,400
In case you need it.

322
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,520
Hey!

323
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
Ouch!

324
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,960
You!

325
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,400
I saw your face already. Don't hide.
I remember you now!

326
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,200
Let me go!

327
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,080
Let me go! I'll report you to the police.

328
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,760
Let me go!

329
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,960
Let me go!

330
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,240
Let me go! Why did you kidnap me?

331
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,800
Let me go!

332
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,040
What are you doing?

333
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,400
Don't move if you want to live.

334
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,360
I'm hungry.

335
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,160
Aren't you hungry too?

336
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,480
It's been a whole night.

337
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,320
Even some water will do.

338
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,639
I'm thirsty.

339
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,400
Drunk people get dehydrated, you know.

340
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
I'm hungry!

341
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,600
Hey, I'm thirsty!

342
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,040
-Give me some water.
-Hey!

343
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,199
You're so annoying!

344
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,520
Can't you be quiet, you spoiled brat?

345
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,159
If I give you water,
can you promise you'll behave?

346
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,679
Fine.

347
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,880
Enough.

348
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,320
Are you in need of money?

349
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,880
How much are they giving you?

350
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,000
I'll double it.

351
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,680
If you set me free now,

352
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,400
I'll take you to withdraw
the money right away.

353
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,400
I know you haven't done
something like this before.

354
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,640
It's just that you have no choice, right?

355
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,400
It's not too late to set me free now.

356
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,480
I won't come after you later or anything.

357
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,680
Trust me.

358
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,280
Do you want some more?

359
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,600
Yeah.

360
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,520
Spoiled brat, you're being sneaky, huh?

361
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,960
Since you're this tricky,

362
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,480
no more freaking water for you.

363
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,000
Hello, James?

364
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,320
Have you got the money yet?

365
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,040
Min, the plan has changed.

366
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,920
The client wants you
to shoot him dead now.

367
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,040
What is it?

368
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,240
The pay will be doubled, but…

369
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,000
you must kill Q now.

370
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,400
But…

371
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,600
TOTAL 422,636 THB

372
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,520
MY SAVINGS

373
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,240
When are you paying the debt?

374
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,440
It's no small amount.

375
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,840
URGENT SALE

376
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,760
What are you doing?

377
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,200
Hey! Don't shoot!

378
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,840
Let me go!

379
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,840
Let me go!

380
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,840
Help!

381
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,720
Don't shoot me! Don't!

382
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,040
Let me go! Don't do it!

383
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,600
Is anyone out there?! Don't!

384
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,400
Don't! Help!

385
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,120
Is anyone out there?! Help!

386
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,800
Hey! Don't shoot me! Don't!

387
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,920
Quiet.

388
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,760
Done.

389
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,160
Tell the client to transfer the money now.

390
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,440
From now on, you must stay with me.
Someone wants you dead.

391
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,200
It's this house.
Don't resist.

392
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,920
It might sound a bit strange,
but you can trust me.

393
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,920
I won't hurt you.

394
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,040
That's the bathroom and that's the closet.

395
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,440
How long are you going to keep me here?

396
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,280
Until I sort things out with the client.

397
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,440
Let me go!

398
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,600
Open the door!

399
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,280
-My brother will be home soon.
-And?

400
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,320
Hey, hold on.

401
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,760
I told you not to go anywhere. Q!

402
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,720
Hey, that hurts!

403
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,040
-If it hurts, then stop moving.
-We're back.

404
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,240
Enjoy your time.

405
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,840
Mhen, it's not what you think.

406
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,760
It makes sense.

407
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,040
He's handsome, sleek,
and cute with a silver-spoon vibe.

408
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,560
He's definitely your type.

409
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,640
So… your brother says I'm your type.

410
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,640
What do you say?

411
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,400
Well…
