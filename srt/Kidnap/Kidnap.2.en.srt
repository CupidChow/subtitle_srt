1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What did Q do that displeased someone?
Why does he have to be kidnapped?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,120
But this is how it is with the rich.
They always get in people's way.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,720
But don't worry. Once the job is done,
we're out of their lives.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,520
Here you are.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,600
This is for you.

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,680
Hey! You want a flower too?

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,760
Let me go! Why did you kidnap me?

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,240
Let me go!

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,280
Hey!

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,480
You're so annoying!

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,640
Can't you be quiet, you spoiled brat?

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,880
-Hello, James?
-Min, the plan has changed.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,600
The client wants you
to shoot him dead now.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,120
What is it?

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,200
Don't shoot me! Help!

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,840
Hey! Don't shoot me! Don't!

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,480
-Dad! Dad, help me!
-Don't!

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,080
Help me! Help!

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,320
Quiet!

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,440
Done. Tell the client
to transfer the money now.

21
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,560
Handle the body properly. And send me
proof so I can forward it to them.

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,280
-Noted.
-Don't feel guilty.

23
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,120
Even if you hadn't done it, he would have
been killed eventually anyway.

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,600
Yes.

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,560
From now on, you must stay with me.

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,960
You must stay out of sight.

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,960
Someone wants you dead.

28
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,440
We've arrived. Get out.

29
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,840
Ouch.

30
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,600
Ouch.

31
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,520
Go.

32
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,640
Let go.

33
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,960
Come on.

34
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,920
Let go.

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,440
Hey, walk properly.

36
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,560
Hey. It's this house.

37
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,760
Why did you help me?

38
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,640
How can I be sure you won't hurt me?

39
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,640
So what? You want me to change my mind?

40
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,280
Head inside.

41
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,080
Don't resist.

42
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,680
URGENT SALE

43
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,640
Can you stay here, spoiled brat?

44
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,280
If I can't, then will you send me home?

45
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,960
Why are you stepping back?

46
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,040
I'm just going to untie you.

47
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Fine.

48
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,320
It might sound a bit strange,
but you can trust me.

49
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,600
I won't hurt you.

50
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,200
Hide here with me for now.

51
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,760
Got it?

52
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,920
Yeah.

53
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,320
Ouch!

54
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,280
Hey, where are you going?!

55
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,160
Help!

56
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,160
I told you not to move.

57
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,560
Can't you do that, huh?

58
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,360
Let go! Let me go!

59
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,080
Let go! Let go of me!

60
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,400
Let go!

61
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,400
Let go of me!

62
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,280
-Let me go!
-Don't move!

63
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,240
Ow!

64
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,600
Why the hell are you crying?!

65
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
I threw you on a mat.

66
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,120
Let go of me! Let me go!

67
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,560
Let me go!

68
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,600
Let me go-- What are you doing?

69
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,560
Let go of me!

70
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,920
-Let go!
-Don't move!

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,280
What are you doing to me?

72
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,320
Let go of me!

73
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,240
Let go!

74
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,400
Let me go! Let go of me!

75
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,280
Can't you stay quiet?

76
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,520
Let me go!

77
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,080
Let go of me!

78
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,240
What are you doing to me?

79
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,360
Let go of me!

80
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,520
I'm making you shut up.

81
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,640
Let go of me.

82
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,360
Don't move if you want to live.

83
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,680
Don't move.

84
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,920
Listen up.

85
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,160
I need to fake some proof
and send it to the client

86
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,720
or we'll both be hunted.

87
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,960
I don't want to kill anyone,

88
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,120
and you don't want to die,

89
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,400
so just cooperate, please.

90
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,720
This is my bedroom.

91
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,440
I'm Min.
Call me whenever you need anything.

92
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,480
That's the bathroom and that's the closet.

93
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,000
Go shower now.

94
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
How can I?

95
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,720
If you try to run away again,

96
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,960
I'll keep an eye on you in the bathroom.

97
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,880
You're so scared
of me watching you in there?

98
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,240
In two days, be there at 4:00 p.m.
Let me know when you arrive.

99
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,800
More details will follow soon.

100
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,920
Hey. Don't try to pry it open.
You can't get out.

101
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,240
The hole is too small.

102
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm not doing that!

103
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,160
Take a quick shower and come out.
I'm sleepy.

104
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,120
Hey, you can't wear that one.
My brother bought it for me.

105
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,400
What's the big deal? So what if I wear it?

106
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,800
I told you not to wear it.

107
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,720
Let go. Why are you taking off my tee?

108
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,280
I won't let you wear it.
My brother bought it for me.

109
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,040
-I want to wear it. What's your problem?
-No. My brother bought it for me.

110
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,680
It's emotionally valuable.
Don't you get it?

111
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,600
-I won't let you wear it. Take it off.
-I'm going to wear it.

112
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,360
-Hey…
-My brother bought it for me.

113
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,720
Hey, hold on.

114
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,680
What?

115
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,520
Are you this protective of it

116
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,960
because your brother is already dead?

117
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,000
Fine.

118
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,040
I'm giving it back to you.

119
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,200
Take it.

120
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,880
Why are you laughing?

121
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,800
My brother isn't dead.

122
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,120
He's just not home.

123
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,920
Hey, that one suits you.

124
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,960
It looks cute.

125
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Hey.

126
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,000
My brother isn't dead.

127
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,920
How long are you going to keep me here?

128
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,480
Until I sort things out with the client.

129
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,160
How will you do that?

130
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,680
I'll find the money to return to them
and tell them that

131
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,640
after I threw you away,

132
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,000
someone helped you.

133
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,560
I'll at least clear my off-the-books debt.
Then I'll ask for a new loan.

134
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,520
But after this, I'll just need to keep up
with the interest payments.

135
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,520
I think this works for now,
but I've got to pay off this debt first.

136
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,800
So just let me go home,

137
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,520
and you can handle your own business.

138
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,680
I'd be stupid if I did that.

139
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,240
You now know who I am and where I live.

140
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,600
You know me already.

141
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,960
How can I be sure you won't
bring police here to drag me to jail?

142
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,000
What do I get in return for helping you?

143
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,480
Even if you go home now,
you can't live a normal life.

144
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,120
At least while you're here,
you can be sure nobody is hunting you.

145
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,840
Well then, after your problem is solved,

146
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,520
tell me everything you know about
the person who hired you,

147
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,240
and I won't make a fuss about this.

148
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Eat it up quickly.

149
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
-What?
-This shows your character well.

150
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,040
You want to be a wolf

151
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,840
but can only be a common dog.

152
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,320
I've already agreed to stay here.
You don't have to keep an eye on me.

153
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,320
This is my room and I like sitting here.

154
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,800
If you're sleepy, just sleep.

155
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,200
Where are you going?

156
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,000
-Bathroom.
-That doesn't require untying yourself.

157
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,120
-Give me your hand.
-What are you doing?

158
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,200
If you're stubbornly
going to try to run away all night,

159
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,440
then you need to be
attached to me like this.

160
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,400
No going anywhere.

161
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,400
Do you want to go to the bathroom?
I'll accompany you.

162
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,320
No. I'm going to sleep.

163
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,480
You're sleepy already?

164
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,240
You can go to the bathroom.
I'll take you there.

165
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,960
Goodnight.

166
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Help!

167
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,440
Help!

168
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,640
Dad, help me!

169
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,720
-Help!
-Dad! Help me!

170
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,960
Dad!

171
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,520
Help!

172
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,640
Dad! Help!

173
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,680
-Q. Can you hear me? Q?
-Help! Dad, help!

174
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,280
Q? Relax.

175
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,680
Q, relax.

176
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,720
Q.

177
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,320
Can you hear me?

178
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,160
Everything is all right.

179
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,680
I'm here.

180
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,600
Dad.

181
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,960
I'm here.

182
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,960
Dad.

183
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,200
Shush.

184
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,280
Everything is all right.
Let's get back to sleep.

185
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,960
What's wrong?

186
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,040
Q.

187
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,160
What's wrong?

188
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,120
-What are you doing?
-You were talking in your sleep.

189
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,280
You also cried.

190
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,640
I have a sleepwalking disorder,

191
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,120
but it hasn't shown up for ages.

192
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,920
I don't know why it's suddenly come back.

193
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,200
Dad! Help, Dad!

194
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,000
But you called for your dad too.

195
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,400
Sleepwalkers just say random things.

196
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,720
Why do you care?

197
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,200
Taste it.

198
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,520
It's so sweet.

199
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
It's not that sweet.

200
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Drink some.

201
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,440
You're the worst kidnapper I've ever met.

202
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,400
Do you know that?

203
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,319
I do.

204
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,079
So don't try to run away again.

205
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,200
Then you won't get hurt.

206
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,120
You won't run away again, right?

207
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
It's all red now.

208
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,840
Can I go to sleep already?

209
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,560
It took me a long time to make this drink.
You only drank a little?

210
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,480
Why did you untie me then?

211
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,760
I'll be watching you. If you behave today,
I won't lock you up tomorrow.

212
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,040
Just do whatever.

213
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,320
Hurry up. I'm sleepy.

214
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,200
Hurry up.

215
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,920
Give me a second. It's old.

216
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,040
-I can go now, right?
-Just go.

217
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,920
James, I have something
to talk to you about.

218
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,480
UNKNOWN NUMBER

219
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,880
-Yes?
-Hey.

220
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,520
You said you'd find money to pay the debt.
Have you got any now?

221
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,360
You work as a stuntman, don't you?

222
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,800
If your legs and arms are broken,
you might be in trouble.

223
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,720
Yes.

224
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,320
Certainly.

225
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,440
I'll get you the money
in two days as promised.

226
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,160
Please give me just two days.

227
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,480
JAMES, I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

228
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Open the door!

229
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,480
Open the door!

230
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,960
Min, open the door!

231
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,080
Open the door already!

232
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,840
Hey! Is anyone out there? Open the door!

233
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,000
Min! Let me out!

234
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,240
Open the door!

235
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,160
KANOMJEEN

236
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,920
Open the door!

237
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,560
Open the door! Min!

238
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,640
Open the door!

239
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,400
Is anyone out there? Open the door!

240
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,800
We've been calling you.
Why didn't you pick up?

241
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,400
Mhen and I are arriving soon.

242
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,520
-Mhen will come home on Wednesday, right?
-What a good memory you have.

243
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,840
What day is it today then?

244
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,040
Shit. Jeen, I'm sorry.
Where are you guys now?

245
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,120
-On the way here?
-Yeah. We're arriving soon.

246
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,480
I dropped by to see him after my exam.
He kept whining about going home.

247
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,480
Min, I was sick of the hospital.

248
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,520
Keep resting, Min. See you at home.

249
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,280
-We'll be there soon.
-Is anyone there?

250
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,960
-Okay, Jeen. And sorry.
-No worries--

251
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,840
You got served.

252
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
Why are you laughing?

253
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,240
But it's strange.

254
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,560
Min never messes up when it's about you.

255
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,800
Let me out!

256
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,800
Open the door!

257
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,320
Do I need to die in here
before you'll open the door?

258
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,320
Hold on.

259
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,160
Relax. Listen up.

260
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,040
-My brother will be home soon.
-And?

261
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,400
And my brother can't know you're here!

262
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,560
Stay quiet.

263
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,560
Don't walk loudly.

264
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,440
Don't use the bathroom while he's awake.

265
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
Don't breathe loudly.

266
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,800
Are you crazy?

267
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,760
Who can do such things? I'm a human.

268
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,640
I don't know, but it's a must.

269
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,960
If you fail to do so, you're done for.

270
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,240
Because of you?

271
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,840
You've had me kidnapped for hours,

272
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,400
but all I've got is this bruise,

273
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,560
and I got that from running
and falling myself.

274
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,800
You even blew on the food
before feeding me.

275
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,040
Before you start threatening me,
take a good look at yourself.

276
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,520
Hey, hold on. Where are you going?

277
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,120
Where are you going?

278
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,160
You must stay here in this house
until I find you a new place to hide.

279
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,160
No.

280
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,120
Let me go.

281
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,440
I told you not to go anywhere, Q!

282
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,200
-Ouch! Let go of me!
-No.

283
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,280
-That hurts!
-If it hurts, then stop moving.

284
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,240
-Let go of me! I'm getting out of here!
-Q.

285
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
-Let go of me!
-Q.

286
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,640
Let go of me!

287
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
Go easy.

288
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,440
-It hurts!
-I won't.

289
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,640
-Let go of me!
-Q!

290
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,160
-I'm getting out of here!
-Q.

291
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,760
Let go of me! Let go!

292
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,280
I won't. Stop moving.

293
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,600
-It hurts! Let go of me!
-Just don't move.

294
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,520
Let go of me!

295
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,240
No. If it hurts, then stop moving.

296
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,720
-We're back.
-We're back.

297
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,600
Min, enjoy your time.

298
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,800
We'll wait downstairs.

299
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,240
Mhen, it's not what you think.

300
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,360
Now what?

301
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,480
So this is why you forgot
to pick Mhen up, Min?

302
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,160
But it seems really important.

303
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,080
Right?

304
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,000
What? It's not what you think.

305
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,560
This is a big misunderstanding.
That was just an accident.

306
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,720
Come on, Min.

307
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,760
It makes sense.

308
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,880
He's handsome, sleek,
and cute with a silver-spoon vibe.

309
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
He's definitely your type.

310
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,760
My type? Nonsense.

311
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,400
How would you know my type?

312
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,200
-I haven't dated anyone.
-True.

313
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,560
You're talking nonsense, Mhen.
How could you know?

314
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,440
-Yeah.
-Let's just say I know.

315
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,840
Don't make me say how.
It'll only make you look bad.

316
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,920
We were just rehearsing our script.

317
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,960
Q, you're a stuntman, aren't you?

318
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,400
Yes.

319
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,560
He doesn't look like one.

320
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,560
There are plenty of boy-love
action series out there.

321
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,040
Why can't there be
a good-looking stuntman like him?

322
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,680
A good-looking stuntman like him?

323
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,400
Fine. He's a stuntman.

324
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,800
I bet you were just lying down
rehearsing your script.

325
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,920
Jeen, thanks a lot for picking Mhen up.

326
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,160
No worries.

327
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,920
Here.

328
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,360
Your pay for today.

329
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,800
Come on, Min.

330
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,720
I told you I don't need that.

331
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,240
Mhen is also my friend.

332
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,280
You keep paying me like this.

333
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,520
I feel like I'm your employee.

334
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,280
If you don't take it,
I won't dare to bother you again.

335
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,440
Here.

336
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,440
Thanks a lot.

337
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
Okay. I'll give in.

338
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,840
I'm off.

339
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,080
SIR MHOO

340
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,240
Hello, sir?

341
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,640
What are you doing?

342
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,440
Need my help?

343
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,760
I just had a pacemaker installed.

344
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,240
It's right in the middle of my chest
like Iron Man.

345
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,160
Cool, huh?

346
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,240
Are you still sore?

347
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,800
A super-skilled professor surgeon
performed my surgery.

348
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,520
He specializes in this field.

349
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
It didn't hurt at all.

350
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,960
What about

351
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,360
the medical bills?

352
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,640
Min covered them all.

353
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,840
Hey.

354
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,760
-Did you take all the pills as instructed?
-I just did.

355
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,760
Let's go over
all the instructions once again.

356
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,560
Let's start from the first one.
I'll read it for you.

357
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,160
Listen carefully
and follow the instructions.

358
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,440
-Don't be stubborn. Follow them all.
-Noted.

359
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,200
Good job. You listen too.

360
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,120
Fine.

361
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,760
The doctor said it's on this page.

362
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,200
"What you need to do
after having a pacemaker installed."

363
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,120
"Take the antibiotic pills as prescribed."
You already did, right?

364
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,280
-Yes.
-Okay.

365
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,720
"For the first 7 days, don't lift the arm
on the side the pacemaker was added."

366
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,040
"The arm sling stays on always."

367
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,680
What you're doing now is correct.
Just don't raise your arm.

368
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,320
URGENT SALE

369
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,880
I have something to talk to you about.

370
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,520
I'm going out tomorrow.

371
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,800
I'll quickly handle my problem.

372
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,360
So, if you want to go home any time soon,
don't make any messes and don't run away.

373
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,800
What kind of kidnapper
would say he won't be home?

374
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,360
What should I do then?

375
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,640
Be frank with me.

376
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,400
What made you take this job?

377
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,080
For my brother,
I was willing to do anything.

378
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,360
I promise I'll quickly
put an end to this whole thing.

379
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,960
So tomorrow, please cooperate.

380
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,080
Think of it as doing it for my brother.

381
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,800
Fine.

382
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,960
Do I have to do a pinky swear with you?

383
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,600
I told you I won't run away, so I won't.

384
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,240
So… your brother says I'm your type.

385
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,160
What do you say?

386
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,760
Well…

387
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,840
out of 100…

388
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,560
you get a 0.

389
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,360
Q!

390
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,680
You almost fell down the stairs.

391
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
Are you with me?

392
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,720
I have a sleepwalking disorder.

393
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,920
Let's go back to sleep.

394
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,160
SLEEPWALKING DANGERS

395
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,040
Sleepwalking can be fatal.

396
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,280
You shouldn't wake someone up
when they're doing it

397
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,920
because that will most likely scare
and confuse them,

398
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,000
which could lead to a fight.

399
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,080
Sharp items, vases, and picture frames
should be removed from the bedroom.

400
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,600
Lock the door carefully and tape over
table corners and bed corners

401
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,320
to prevent any accidents.

402
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,120
Standard practice includes embracing
the sleepwalker's waist

403
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,640
and whispering into their ear.

404
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,000
Q, you're just sleepwalking.
Let's go back to sleep.

405
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,000
Let's go back to sleep.

406
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,800
Then, guide the patient
and encourage them to go back to sleep.

407
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,880
Sleep.

408
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,360
Everything is all right.
You were just sleepwalking.

409
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,920
I have to tuck you in every night
so I can have some peace, right?

410
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,040
There I go!

411
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,200
Pay me 4,000 for the hotel.

412
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,640
Are you planning to build a hotel
in every province or what?

413
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,880
I have less than 4,000 with me now.

414
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,080
Just pay up. Come on.

415
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,120
Can I pay with this snack instead?

416
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,600
Fine, but I'm taking the whole box.

417
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,720
Let me have some.

418
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,040
Wait until after the game.

419
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
-I'm sick.
-You can't have any now.

420
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,240
Let me have one.

421
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,720
You just gave them to me.

422
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,320
Let's wait until the game is over.

423
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
Kids, play quietly.

424
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,800
You just got surgery, didn't you?
You might get hurt.

425
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,760
I know that.

426
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,200
Are you off to work?

427
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,840
I'm going out to run an errand.
I'll be back in the evening.

428
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,920
You're staying home all day,
so don't just play.

429
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,120
Eat and take your pills on time. Got it?

430
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,400
Don't be stubborn with Q.

431
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,600
Q, please take care of my brother.

432
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,280
Share some with him too.
Don't just keep them to yourself.

433
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,240
-I'll buy some and give them back to you.
-All right.

434
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,640
Great job.

435
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,560
I'm off.

436
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,200
Good luck.

437
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,040
Fine. Just go already.

438
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,480
Luckily, I have you with me today.

439
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,680
Play with me all day, okay?

440
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,680
Sure thing.

441
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,840
Aren't you going to school?

442
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,240
I'm homeschooled.

443
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,560
Because I get sick often, I often struggle
with my grades. But I study well.

444
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,760
Kanomjeen always asks me to teach her.

445
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,080
How about your parents?

446
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,400
They passed away ages ago.

447
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,360
But Min has been a dad and mom
as well as a brother to me.

448
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,480
Sometimes, he's also like
my younger brother.

449
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,680
When Min loves someone,

450
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,640
he takes care of that person really well.

451
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,240
Really?

452
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,640
But I'm just his friend.

453
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,200
I was just saying.

454
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,360
It's my turn now.

455
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,480
1,000 BAHT NOTES

456
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,560
Full amount, sir.

457
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,280
You're pretty good at this.

458
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,199
But I hope we won't see each other again.

459
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,920
Yes, sir.

460
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,120
Done. Thanks a lot, bro.

461
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,800
Hello, James?

462
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,040
Min, have you handled
all the evidence properly?

463
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,760
Burn whatever you can.

464
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,720
I've just found out that
the boy's dad is Big Kacha,

465
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,360
the famous police officer
who was just in the news.

466
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,320
Police?

467
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,560
What news?

468
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,720
I'll forward it to you.

469
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,720
Damn it. We're freaking screwed.

470
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,520
You can't even get doing wrong right.

471
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,560
I just sent it to you.

472
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,760
Police Brigadier General
Kacha Yuenyongwisutt,

473
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,200
Deputy Commander
of the Narcotics Suppression Bureau,

474
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,240
also known as Big Kacha,
is a hero to many.

475
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,680
He was awarded the Medal of Honor
at the end of last year.

476
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,400
Currently, he is leading an investigation
into a heroin case.

477
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,320
Given the current situation,
an ambush seems imminent.

478
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,000
Hello, Mhen? Is Q still home?

479
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,120
Let me talk to him.

480
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,640
He's just left.

481
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,040
YUENYONGWISUTT'S HOUSE

482
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,600
Who are you here to see?

483
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,080
Is Mr. Q home?
I'm bringing him a document.

484
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,920
Is he available to sign for it himself?

485
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,640
The sender insisted that
it must be delivered directly to him.

486
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,600
Mr. Q isn't home.

487
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,880
Okay. That's all right.

488
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,680
According to reports
on the highway accident involving

489
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,880
Police Brigadier General
Kacha Yuenyongwisutt,

490
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,040
Deputy Commander of the NSB,
who was injured,

491
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,280
police believe, based on CCTV evidence
collected from the area,

492
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,080
that it was meant to intimidate him in his
investigation of a major heroin case.

493
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,400
I'll check the warehouse again later.

494
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,920
Please have our officers secure the area.
It's likely there's still evidence there.

495
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,600
Can't you not investigate this case
anymore? You could be killed.

496
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,240
It's my job.

497
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,280
So righteousness is more important
than Mom's life?

498
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,280
We can't just care about our own lives.

499
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,280
Who is really the one doing that?

500
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,920
I've been gone for three days.
Do you know where I was?

501
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,800
Or is it that protecting your own family

502
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,920
can't give you these medals and positions,
and so you never consider doing it?

503
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,520
Q?

504
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,240
Q, what have you done?!
You told me you wouldn't go anywhere!

505
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,720
We agreed that you'd wait
until I finished handling things.

506
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,320
You took the job to kidnap me…

507
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,760
because your brother is sick, didn't you?

508
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,120
What if…

509
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,200
I hire you to demand a ransom from my dad?

510
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,520
Will you accept the job?

511
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,360
Then you can keep the money.

512
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
All of it.

513
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,560
-Min, let's eat some pizzas.
-Who bought them?

514
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,360
Is he the one who kidnapped me with you?
I recognized his voice.

515
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,920
You can't just randomly let anyone
inside the house like this.

516
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,360
If he's on your side,
I don't see why I should be scared.

517
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,760
Hey! What are you doing?

518
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,960
I'm showing you
that you can't trust anyone easily.

519
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,880
Not even me.

520
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,040
-Shit!
-What's wrong with your damn acting?!

521
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,440
The team wants you to take a break.

522
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
BALANCE 43,800.69

523
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,920
Min. Come here.

524
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,920
Move a bit closer.

525
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,480
You said you were good at it, right?
Why did you get hurt this much?

526
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,040
It's all because of you.
How are you going to make it up to me?

527
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,240
Like this.

528
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,560
The client already replied,
asking you to bring Q along.

529
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,840
Are you meeting the person
who hired you to kidnap me?

530
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,360
Let me come. I want to know
who they are and what they want.

531
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,640
To kill you, obviously.

532
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,600
Don't worry, I've sorted
