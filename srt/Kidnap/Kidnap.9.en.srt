1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,980
(Previously)
Do you want me to announce the sale now, Mr. Kacha?

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,280
Where is Min now?!

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,390
Q is with me now, Suea,

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,340
but it's already late,

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:11,100
so he has to sleep over.

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:11,760
In the morning,

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,030
I'll let him leave.

8
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:13,980
Min!

9
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,860
My car's broken.

10
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,100
I can't go back anymore.

11
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,090
Min asked you to take a shower

12
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,140
and get dressed.

13
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,120
He'll take us on a trip.

14
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,160
Come here.

15
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,260
Come here now!

16
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,320
I think it's best for me to be alone.

17
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,320
I don't think that at all.

18
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,750
I'm sure you can do it.

19
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,520
Please say goodbye to Mhen for me.

20
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,880
Q. Q.

21
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,920
Q!

22
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,040
Q!

23
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,250
Q, pull over!

24
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,170
Q!

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,710
I can't do it.

26
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,780
I can't let go of you.

27
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,240
From now on,

28
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,600
no matter what problem we face,

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,420
can we fix it together

30
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,920
and find a way through?

31
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,840
Heal fast.

32
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,040
Stop it.

33
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,550
Aren't you feeling tired at all?

34
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,630
I'm not tired.

35
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,960
Why?

36
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,420
Didn't I do well?

37
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:58,660
It was…

38
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,850
also my first time.

39
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,780
It's not that.

40
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,000
You did really well last night.

41
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,200
Thank you for getting back together.

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,120
To me,

43
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,520
we never broke up.

44
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,160
You smell so good.

45
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,280
I picked it on purpose.

46
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,980
I knew you'd like it.

47
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,422
How did you know what scent I like?

48
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,675
Opened your door,

49
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,650
and your closet,

50
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,820
that scent was everywhere.

51
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,180
After I got to know you,

52
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,920
whenever I'm with you,

53
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,260
I smell this scent all over your body.

54
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,960
You can remember that so well?

55
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,150
If it's about the person I love,

56
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,040
I know everything.

57
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,650
I can remember everything.

58
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
You're exaggerating.

59
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,900
I'm not.

60
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,150
I mean it.

61
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,130
When I love someone,

62
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,260
I can remember everything about that person.

63
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,530
If you don't believe me, ask me.

64
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,330
Really?

65
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,164
Let's do a quick Q&A.

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,080
Okay.

67
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,900
I'm ready.

68
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,520
What are my favorite colors?

69
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,844
White and orange.

70
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,680
Correct.

71
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,284
My favorite food?

72
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,010
Pizza.

73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,870
My birthdate?

74
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,580
August 4, 2002

75
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,800
at 8.10 AM.

76
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,740
Am I right, Little Q?

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,213
How many moles do I have over my body?

78
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,240
Your whole body?

79
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,250
I'm not sure.

80
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,980
I didn't pay attention to

81
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,760
counting them last night.

82
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:53,670
But if you want me to give an exact answer,

83
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:54,657
I can do that.

84
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,660
Let me count them one more time.

85
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,040
Don't.

86
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,040
If you can't remember it,

87
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,400
just admit it.

88
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,590
There are five on your face,

89
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,640
two on your neck,

90
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,360
and around six on your body.

91
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,470
Am I right?

92
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,500
Maybe.

93
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,790
I never counted either.

94
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,470
Ask me something,

95
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,844
but don't sulk if I get it wrong.

96
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:18,300
Okay.

97
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,630
I'll try then,

98
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,600
but I won't sulk.

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,480
What's my favorite color?

100
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,000
Black.

101
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,260
Why do you think that?

102
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,680
Well,

103
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,640
you always wear black.

104
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:31,368
Also, the jumper you're protective of is black.

105
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,360
Eh? That one doesn't count.

106
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,710
My brother bought it for me.

107
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,390
If he buys me something,

108
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,880
I'm protective of it, no matter the color.

109
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,330
So, what's your favorite color?

110
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,573
Well, it's black.

111
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,440
You're right.

112
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,930
Great job.

113
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,300
Don't say that.

114
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,380
My answer is wrong, right?

115
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,210
Tell me

116
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,550
which color you like.

117
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,950
Just tell me once,

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,480
and I'll remember it.

119
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,200
I don't know either

120
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,750
because I never asked myself.

121
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,980
I've never thought about

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,302
telling my boyfriend my favorite color.

123
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,380
What's wrong?

124
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,782
You're shy

125
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:05,902
because I called you my boyfriend?

126
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,390
You're cute.

127
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,950
Who's shy?

128
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,980
I'm not.

129
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:14,360
Okay, if that's what you said.

130
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
I'm going.

131
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,720
I'd better take a shower now.

132
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,010
Hey.

133
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,250
I even styled it.

134
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,650
I'm going to take a shower.

135
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,160
Make it quick,

136
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,240
or I'll count your moles again.

137
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,220
Why did you yawn like that, Mhen?

138
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,800
I didn't sleep well last night.

139
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,650
Why?

140
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,380
The ghost in this house cried again,

141
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,690
but this time he didn't sob.

142
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,360
He cried, “Min, Min, Min.”

143
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,860
- Min.
- What?

144
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,660
He cried so much that the house was shaking.

145
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,970
I thought Tsunami had hit.

146
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,297
So, I'm sorry on behalf of the ghost.

147
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:58,140
Yeah.

148
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,400
After I make some merit,

149
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,420
it should be fine.

150
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,693
But I'm glad you two are finally together.

151
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:05,970
By the way,

152
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,970
are you moving in together here?

153
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,500
Yeah.

154
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,213
Which congee is Min's?

155
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,330
I'll unpack it for him.

156
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,570
Any of them will do.

157
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,970
He isn't picky.

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,310
He enjoys eating everything.

159
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,480
By the way, Mhen,

160
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,724
is there something Min particularly likes?

161
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,613
Food?

162
00:07:32,648 --> 00:07:33,760
Items?

163
00:07:33,813 --> 00:07:34,746
Or colors?

164
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,440
Why are you asking?

165
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,737
I'm thinking about buying a surprise gift

166
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,740
for my boyfriend.

167
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,740
Whoa.

168
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,740
A surprise gift for your boyfriend?

169
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,560
But honestly,

170
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,560
I don't know either.

171
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,360
Apart from you,

172
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,284
I haven't seen Min like something this much before.

173
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,500
Really?

174
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,560
Boys, what are you talking about?

175
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,450
Hmm?

176
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,430
Is this mine?

177
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,390
Hey!

178
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,850
Hey!

179
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,950
Hey.

180
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,490
Is there really nothing you like at all?

181
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,266
<b>RACING CARS? / THAI RICE NOODLES? / PAD THAI?
/ MOTORCYCLES? GAMES? / MALA? / ICE-CREAM? /DOGS?</b>

182
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:42,960
What are you writing down?

183
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,600
I've seen you writing that since we left home.

184
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,680
No. Nothing.

185
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,570
Let's go.

186
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,400
Are you alright?

187
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,460
Clear.

188
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,370
Here!

189
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,010
One.

190
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,160
One Two.

191
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,220
One Two Three.

192
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,790
One Two Three Four.

193
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:03,980
Again.

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,110
One Two Three Four.

195
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,460
Two Three Four.

196
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,060
Again.

197
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,140
One Two Three Four.

198
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,450
One Two Three Four.

199
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,250
Last one!

200
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,340
One Two Three Four.

201
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,000
Yay.

202
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,460
Thank you.

203
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,430
I'm so exhausted.

204
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,580
My sugar level's dropping.

205
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,580
Feed me some snacks.

206
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,160
I ate them up.

207
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,530
I got carried away eating.

208
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,280
I'm sorry.

209
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,640
It's alright.

210
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,110
I just want to eat a bit.

211
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,150
Mmmm.

212
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,670
That's super sweet.

213
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,000
Can I have one more bite?

214
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,980
Aren't you embarrassed in front of others?

215
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,200
Why should I?

216
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,500
My boyfriend is cute.

217
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,506
Where are you heading to work next?

218
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,900
I have to work at the surf shop at 2 PM.

219
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,100
It's just 11 AM.

220
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,480
Do you want to have lunch?

221
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,080
What do you want to eat?

222
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,830
Choose.

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,120
Eh? Is something wrong?

224
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,670
You suddenly threw lots of questions.

225
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,970
I can't keep up.

226
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,591
Well, I want to know what you like and don't like.

227
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:09,360
I've just noticed that

228
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,360
I don't know much about you,

229
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,980
just like when you told me

230
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,330
you wanted to get to know me more.

231
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,340
What do I like?

232
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,060
As for food, anything will do.

233
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,870
I'm not picky.

234
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,040
Is it because you're not picky,

235
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,142
or do you just not know what you really like?

236
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,580
Come on.

237
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,946
Does it really matter whether I know or not?

238
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,600
Let's put it this way.

239
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,217
I like whatever Mhen likes.

240
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,537
For example, if you want to buy me something,

241
00:10:37,573 --> 00:10:38,710
ask Mhen for some ideas.

242
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,164
I'm your boyfriend, not Mhen's.

243
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,560
Anyway,

244
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,900
I need the answer no matter what.

245
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,510
It's only 11 AM.

246
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,160
We've still got three hours.

247
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,484
Let's try to figure out what you actually like.

248
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,450
Three hours?

249
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,826
I think there's one thing I can do,

250
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,810
but we must head home for that.

251
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,810
Think of something else too, okay?

252
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,570
Eh?

253
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,093
You told me to do what I like, didn't you?

254
00:11:05,128 --> 00:11:05,780
Huh?

255
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,230
Hey.

256
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,410
Come on.

257
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,430
You haven't added any sweetness.

258
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,720
My sugar level has dropped completely.

259
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's go.

260
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,740
Hurry up.

261
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,400
You need to head to work, don't you?

262
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,680
Fine.

263
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,340
I want it well done.

264
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,930
Sure.

265
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,870
You don't like it?

266
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,217
It's spicy.

267
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:35,928
It's spicy.

268
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,900
It's hot.

269
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,630
Nice.

270
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,960
<b>BOK CHOY?</b>

271
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,090
You like it, right?

272
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,880
I do.

273
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,080
Eat some more.

274
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,390
Eat some more.

275
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,270
Here you are.

276
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,120
What have you got?

277
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,550
Let me see.

278
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,640
I don't like ice-cream.

279
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,130
<b>X ICE-CREAM X.</b>

280
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,760
Min.

281
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,390
Yeah?

282
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,364
Seriously, have you found what you like today?

283
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,190
Yes.

284
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,160
It's you.

285
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,346
Come on, seriously.

286
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:51,700
I can't answer.

287
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,973
Since I got to do many things with you,

288
00:12:54,017 --> 00:12:55,400
I enjoyed them all.

289
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,155
I can't decide what I like more.

290
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,973
It means you haven't found what you like.

291
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,220
That's why this is your answer.

292
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,730
Come on.

293
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,955
At least you found out I don't like Mala.

294
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,555
Let's find out what I like later.

295
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,630
Yeah.

296
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,870
Are they filming today?

297
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,260
I'll be right back.

298
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,400
Take it.

299
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,570
I'll be back.

300
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:25,210
<b>FILM SET?</b>

301
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,977
Min, wait for me.

302
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,690
James!

303
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,955
Hey! Min!

304
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,670
Oho.

305
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,920
How have you been doing?

306
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,260
I'm good.

307
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,200
At first,

308
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,770
I thought I wouldn't get to see you again.

309
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,300
So, how is everything?

310
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,020
Are you doing fine?

311
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,270
Yeah.

312
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,850
I just moved house.

313
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,940
Moved?

314
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,493
Are you saying you moved here permanently?

315
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,600
I won't tell you.

316
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,471
Ah, I got it now.

317
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:00,480
So, you all have moved here together.

318
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,210
You went through such a damn mess,

319
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,570
but you two are still together.

320
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,810
I'm totally impressed

321
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,440
by your plum blossom love legend.

322
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:10,820
Shit.

323
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,040
What?

324
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,900
Does this mean.

325
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,031
I'm losing another talented stuntman?

326
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,990
I must be missing you so much, Min.

327
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,990
Come on, James.

328
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,280
But it's fine.

329
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,210
There's nothing better than

330
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,680
seeing my beloved little brother finally settling down.

331
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,540
Plus, you got yourself a silver spoon,

332
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,970
clean, sleek, and sweet-faced boyfriend.

333
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,380
He's totally your type, right?

334
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,490
Are you talking about me?

335
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,284
Min, we haven't met in ages.

336
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,220
Do you miss me?

337
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
<i>James, come check on extras.</i>

338
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,746
All right. Give me a second!

339
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:54,410
Come on. They keep asking for me.

340
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,680
How have you been, Third?

341
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,420
It's really been a while.

342
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,230
Of course.

343
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,360
Since you left,

344
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,710
there's hardly anyone to take on those last-minute,

345
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,970
urgent jobs late at night for me.

346
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,595
By the way, are you still using the same number?

347
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,110
I called your old number,

348
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,010
but it didn't go through.

349
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,004
Yeah, I changed my number.

350
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,820
Why?

351
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,730
You couldn't reach me on the phone,

352
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,950
so you must have missed me a lot.

353
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,950
Give me your phone.

354
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,390
I'll save my new number for you.

355
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,390
Done.

356
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,890
I already saved my new number for you.

357
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,470
Thank you.

358
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,570
Oh, I forgot.

359
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,657
This is Third, the Assistant Director.

360
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,657
This is Q, my boyfriend.

361
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,970
Hello, Q.

362
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,580
Since you two are here,

363
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,400
be extras for us.

364
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,413
I have to watch over that surf shop.

365
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:43,920
The owner didn't tell you

366
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,550
we're using his shop as the location?

367
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,480
Eh?

368
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,973
<i>Wipe their faces.</i>

369
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,906
Yeah, I met them often.

370
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,950
Tee?

371
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,510
I met up with him sometimes,

372
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,400
playing basketball together.

373
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,090
I see.

374
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,600
Ouch!

375
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,804
I'm sorry, James.

376
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,930
I didn't see it.

377
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,440
If something's up, just talk it out.

378
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,440
There's no need to get physical.

379
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,250
Come on.

380
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,440
James,

381
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,130
are Third and Min that close?

382
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,240
It's just us left.

383
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,320
Eh?

384
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,690
Are you jealous?

385
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,860
I'm not.

386
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,240
But look at him.

387
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:43,164
Actually, those two don't really have much of a history.

388
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,982
It's just that Min ended up as a stuntman

389
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,900
because Third invited him.

390
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:51,880
Huh?

391
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,700
Come on, Q.

392
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,550
Look at Third.

393
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,970
He checks off every box on Min's type list.

394
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,933
Back then, with just a couple of inviting words

395
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,120
and a sweet smile,

396
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,380
Min kept following him around.

397
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,640
He didn't even know what a stuntman was

398
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,160
but went along with it

399
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,690
just because Third was cute.

400
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,610
And now, here he is, still doing this job.

401
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,186
But that was ages ago.

402
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,190
There's nothing going on between them now.

403
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,528
See? They're friends.

404
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,160
Let me hold it for you.

405
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,350
It's okay.

406
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,140
It's all right. I'll hold it for you.

407
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,520
It's fine. I can do it.

408
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,430
Friends?

409
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,955
Yeah, they're friends.

410
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,120
After I say action,

411
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,120
every extra, please walk past.

412
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,710
Don't look at the camera.

413
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,920
Handsome Third.

414
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,190
Do you see that the pink flamingo

415
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,180
stands out too much?

416
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,950
It stands out in the frame.

417
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,800
Take it out.

418
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,342
Got it, bro.

419
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:53,970
Sure.

420
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,110
The person next to Min,

421
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,260
please take some rest for now.

422
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,568
Min, only look at me.

423
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,160
Just look at me.

424
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,850
When I raise my hand as a signal,

425
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,670
start walking.

426
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,450
Okay?

427
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,690
We're all set now.

428
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,170
Okay.

429
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,930
Camera, ready.

430
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,760
And action!

431
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:31,662
Cut.

432
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:32,360
Cut.

433
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:32,800
Cut.

434
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,750
Okay.

435
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,750
Great job, everyone.

436
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,980
Great job, Min.

437
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,580
You were so smooth just now.

438
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,270
Just that?

439
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,920
Amazing job.

440
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,960
I changed my hair and put on glasses for you.

441
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:43,820
But you totally stood out just now.

442
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,690
I walked right across the camera like that.

443
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,946
Yeah, you did.

444
00:18:45,982 --> 00:18:46,840
You stood out.

445
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,600
- Okay. It's a pass.
- Thanks a lot, bro.

446
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,080
<b>X FILM SET X</b>

447
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,746
It won't take long.

448
00:18:52,773 --> 00:18:53,650
Just act like you did before.

449
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,900
Just keep walking?

450
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,750
But you already did well.

451
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,470
But I'm still available for jobs.

452
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,186
If you've got any project,

453
00:18:58,213 --> 00:18:59,280
feel free to reach out to me.

454
00:18:59,315 --> 00:19:00,648
<b>THIRD</b>
- You know what?

455
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:03,982
When I couldn't reach you,

456
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,500
I thought you had already given up on being a stuntman.

457
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,690
I already gave you my number.

458
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,350
Got it. I'll reach out to you.

459
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,000
Give me a call.

460
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,110
Sure. I'll call you.

461
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,890
Take the water.

462
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,300
Min.

463
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,950
Drink it.

464
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,440
You're tired, aren't you?

465
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,973
Well,

466
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,110
okay.

467
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,740
It's refreshing.

468
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,520
Thanks.

469
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,720
Yeah.

470
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,453
Min, I'm thirsty.

471
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,700
Feed me.

472
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:40,500
Here you are.

473
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,884
I'll go check my work.

474
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,226
How is it?

475
00:19:53,262 --> 00:19:54,293
Refreshing?

476
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,650
It's so yummy.

477
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,090
Why are you acting strange today?

478
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,420
You called yourself cutely as “I”.

479
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,600
Can't I do that?

480
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,620
You can.

481
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,510
It's cute.

482
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,190
I like it.

483
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,000
You look so happy today.

484
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,460
Of course.

485
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,328
I haven't been on set in a while,

486
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:11,280
so I'm excited.

487
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,370
I missed all the seniors, too.

488
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,560
Which one?

489
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,070
James or Third?

490
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,600
Well, I missed them all.

491
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,430
But I haven't seen Third in even longer.

492
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,130
Give it to me.

493
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,330
Since you're so happy,

494
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,270
just stand in the sun

495
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:25,990
without needing to drink.

496
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,640
Extras, everyone!

497
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,351
Please head to the blocking area

498
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:32,373
in front of the set.

499
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,920
Get to work.

500
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,830
He's cute when being jealous.

501
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,910
You two, just keep chatting

502
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,710
until we call cut.

503
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,270
But keep it down a bit, okay?

504
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,360
We don't want to get picked up by the mic.

505
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:50,835
Okay.

506
00:20:50,862 --> 00:20:51,550
Got it, bro.

507
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,080
Sure.

508
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,910
Okay?

509
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,040
Do you want to talk to me about anything?

510
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,530
Camera, speed.

511
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:02,933
Got it.

512
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,991
Give me a second.

513
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,020
If there's nothing else to talk about,

514
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,680
how about we practice being some characters

515
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,630
and go over some lines?

516
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,800
Let's do this.

517
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,860
I'll play Ryukyu,

518
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,980
and you play his manager.

519
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,880
Deal?

520
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:23,010
And action!

521
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,950
Hey, why do I have to do this job?

522
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,160
Just let a stand-in handle it.

523
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,450
There are plenty of them.

524
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,450
I've got to go to London Fashion Week next week.

525
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,964
So, is it true that the Assistant Director is your type?

526
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,290
I heard reporters talk about it.

527
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,750
Someone already told you?

528
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,040
I asked if it's true or not.

529
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:58,871
If I tell you that Third is really my type,

530
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,040
will you be angry at me?

531
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,350
Whoa.

532
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,960
You're really that jealous?

533
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,140
Yeah, of course.

534
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,822
At first, I thought you enjoyed working on set

535
00:22:19,848 --> 00:22:23,226
but turns out you just followed the guy here.

536
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,573
Q, you think I came to work on set everyday

537
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,980
just because I used to like Third?

538
00:22:31,635 --> 00:22:32,400
Come on.

539
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,800
If it isn't because of Third,

540
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,740
then what's your reason?

541
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,591
I don't know either, seriously.

542
00:22:37,626 --> 00:22:39,310
I've never figured out the answer,

543
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:42,266
but I guess it's probably because

544
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,130
I can try playing another person,

545
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,897
living someone else's life that isn't mine.

546
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:48,820
Also, when I'm on set,

547
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,160
I feel like I can forget the tough things in my life,

548
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,650
while also getting paid.

549
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,820
Why are you smiling?

550
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,930
Nope.

551
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,120
You're not mad anymore, huh?

552
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,260
If you knew I'd get jealous,

553
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,470
why did you tease me?

554
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,190
If I had known being jealous would make you this cute,

555
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,750
I'd tease you about it every day,

556
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,350
all day and night!

557
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,430
Honestly,

558
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,890
no one fits my type as perfectly as you do, Q.

559
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,520
Cut!

560
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,510
Filming is wrapped up!

561
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,950
Yay!

562
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:36,870
It's done now?

563
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,990
Yeah.

564
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,090
No more scenes.

565
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,770
Hey.

566
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,453
You two should stay for the wrap party with us.

567
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,940
But I've only been in three or four scenes.

568
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,460
Why overthink it?

569
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,820
You know everyone,

570
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,820
and they all missed you, too.

571
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,670
Can I bring my boyfriend along?

572
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,808
Of course.

573
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,982
I'm bringing my wife, too.

574
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:56,960
Huh?

575
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,540
You already have a wife?

576
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,580
Yeah.

577
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,973
She's the girl who plays the leading female in this series.

578
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,190
All right.

579
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,702
That's up to you

580
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,330
but all the drinks are free.

581
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,760
I'll catch up in a bit.

582
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,560
We'll clear things up first.

583
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,440
Okay.

584
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,210
Come on. I'll join you soon.

585
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,260
Go ahead.

586
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,560
I missed you both.

587
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,870
That's Third's wife?

588
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,490
I don't know.

589
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,910
I haven't talked to him in ages.

590
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,980
I've also just found out he has a wife.

591
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,950
But I already have a boyfriend, you know.

592
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,110
Wait for me, Min.

593
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,390
Guys, cheers!

594
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,390
Cheers!

595
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,970
I'm jealous of those in love.

596
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,880
You aren't dating anyone?

597
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:01,940
I'm lonely here.

598
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,570
I feel sorry for you.

599
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,180
I'm lonely.

600
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,070
Third, I feel lonely.

601
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,760
Q, come. Cheers.

602
00:25:08,551 --> 00:25:10,380
Wait until it's my turn to date someone.

603
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,570
Wait for that.

604
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,040
I'll book you for my next series, okay?

605
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,240
You, too.

606
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,431
- Min, I'll be right back.
- Joke, hello.

607
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,230
Hey, sis.

608
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,310
Hi, James.

609
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,026
It's been a while.

610
00:25:24,053 --> 00:25:25,380
How have you been?

611
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:26,110
I'm good.

612
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,000
How about you?

613
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,400
I'm good.

614
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,180
Hey, what's his name?

615
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,960
Introduce him to me.

616
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,500
That's Min.

617
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,400
Come.

618
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,560
Sis, take a seat.

619
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,220
Hello, Mangmoom.

620
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:42,800
Hello.

621
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,450
Hello.

622
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,080
Hello.

623
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,690
Hello.

624
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,333
Min, this is Mangmoom.

625
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,720
She's part of the casting team for a major film.

626
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,580
Get to know each other.

627
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,270
Oh, hello, Mangmoom.

628
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,700
This is my name card.

629
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,680
I have a project coming up

630
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,240
and would like you to do the casting for it.

631
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,630
Its scale is as a major streaming series,

632
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,235
and I think you're perfect for the character.

633
00:26:01,262 --> 00:26:01,960
Oh.

634
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,960
Min, I think you should give it a try.

635
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,240
If you get through the casting,

636
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,960
we'll be working together for a long time.

637
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,506
Plus, this series has multiple seasons.

638
00:26:10,542 --> 00:26:12,817
The pay is on par with international films.

639
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,960
You'll get both the money

640
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,960
and a solid portfolio.

641
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,100
It's really worth it.

642
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,960
Well, but I…

643
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,840
Min.

644
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,610
I know what you're about to say.

645
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,480
From what I've seen of you,

646
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,053
there's no damn reason for you not to go.

647
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,640
You might not see it,

648
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,370
but I've seen a lot of stunt performers,

649
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,630
and you're one of the most dedicated.

650
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,990
You've been working hard in this field all along.

651
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,990
If someone thinks you can do it

652
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,260
and move forward,

653
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,630
why not give it a shot?

654
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,930
I really don't want you to miss this opportunity.

655
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,610
It's such a great one.

656
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,100
I'm thirsty now.

657
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,320
I'll go grab a drink.

658
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,410
Thank you.

659
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,930
You can't deny your own heart.

660
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,930
You love this job just as much as anyone else.

661
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,620
Don't get all scared.

662
00:27:26,008 --> 00:27:28,320
<b>FILM SET</b>

663
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:29,857
Have you been secretly taking notes

664
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:31,653
on what I like all this time?

665
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,702
Yeah.

666
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,511
I was planning to buy a surprise gift for you,

667
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,475
but it turns out you like a film set.

668
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,702
I'm not rich enough

669
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,453
to just make a film for you to act in.

670
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,400
Can I have that piece of paper then?

671
00:27:45,342 --> 00:27:45,982
This one?

672
00:27:46,035 --> 00:27:47,111
Yep.

673
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,608
Consider it a heartfelt gift you made for me.

674
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:54,942
Here you are.

675
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:01,730
I'm going to frame it beautifully.

676
00:28:02,124 --> 00:28:03,262
That's a bit much.

677
00:28:03,742 --> 00:28:05,173
It's not.

678
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:07,170
Do you believe me?

679
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:09,066
You're the first person

680
00:28:09,093 --> 00:28:10,924
who actually took the time to figure out

681
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:12,355
what I really like.

682
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,022
I don't even know what I like myself.

683
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,937
Thank you, Q.

684
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,177
So, what are you going to do about the casting?

685
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,973
I know I won't make it anyway.

686
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,644
My acting sucks.

687
00:28:31,671 --> 00:28:32,844
You can see that.

688
00:28:34,382 --> 00:28:36,693
But I agree with James.

689
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:38,690
Since you've already put in so much effort,

690
00:28:39,066 --> 00:28:40,737
if you don't try, you'll never know.

691
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:44,764
As for whether you deserve it or not,

692
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,324
it's really not your decision.

693
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,297
I think you should just give it a try.

694
00:28:49,324 --> 00:28:50,524
It won't hurt to try.

695
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,866
How about Mhen?

696
00:28:55,173 --> 00:28:57,170
You've got me here,

697
00:28:57,226 --> 00:28:58,764
so don't worry about that.

698
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,955
I'll take care of him.

699
00:29:00,257 --> 00:29:01,280
Q.

700
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:05,164
Min.

701
00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:13,960
You're not fighting this battle alone anymore.

702
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,337
Now that you know what you like,

703
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,057
I want you to give your all for what you love.

704
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,528
I'll always be here for you, no matter what.

705
00:29:27,697 --> 00:29:29,084
Thank you.

706
00:29:31,777 --> 00:29:32,871
Thank you so much.

707
00:29:35,413 --> 00:29:37,155
Thank you, too.

708
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:18,746
Hello.

709
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:20,408
I'm Athikhun Mongkolsit.

710
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:21,511
My nickname is Min.

711
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,328
I'm 185 cm tall, weigh 72 kg,

712
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,506
and have special skills in stunts,

713
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,480
shooting, and boxing.

714
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,471
Thank you.

715
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,600
Good boy.

716
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:34,480
You look very handsome.

717
00:30:34,844 --> 00:30:35,760
Do you think it's okay?

718
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:36,906
Yes.

719
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,004
But didn't I sound a bit stiff?

720
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,370
- How about another take?
- Sure thing.

721
00:30:40,862 --> 00:30:42,364
Did you confess your feelings?

722
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,795
- Sounds like you're in the friend zone.
- Cut!

723
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,951
Can you do it with sweet eyes?

724
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,817
Well, it's hard, Mhen.

725
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,315
Q, can you help me then?

726
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,528
I can't act alone.

727
00:30:53,573 --> 00:30:54,337
Me?

728
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,342
Come on.

729
00:30:55,377 --> 00:30:56,620
Please help.

730
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:57,777
Come here.

731
00:30:57,831 --> 00:30:58,791
I just have to stand here, right?

732
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,471
Stand and stare into each other's sweet eyes.

733
00:31:00,515 --> 00:31:01,617
Mhen, I just have to stand here, right?

734
00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:02,542
Stand here.

735
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:03,093
Okay.

736
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:04,140
Sweet eyes, okay?

737
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,951
Three, two, one, action!

738
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,253
What's up?

739
00:31:20,204 --> 00:31:22,200
Did you confess your feelings?

740
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,937
But judging by the look on your face,

741
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,930
it seems like you're in the friend zone.

742
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,782
Hey, hold on.

743
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,333
It feels so satisfying, doesn't it,

744
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,524
to see others get disappointed?

745
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,128
I know you're feeling sad

746
00:31:35,608 --> 00:31:36,915
because I can tell that

747
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,573
you'll never open your heart to anyone

748
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,644
until your situation with Jay comes to an end.

749
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,413
Come on, keep feeling sorry then,

750
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,573
and feel sorry to the fullest.

751
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,315
As for what I said about liking you,

752
00:31:51,484 --> 00:31:52,808
you don't have to think too much about it.

753
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:53,866
Just set it aside for now.

754
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,586
You see how good I am at teasing.

755
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,600
Cut!

756
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,586
Great job.

757
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:01,970
That was very on point.

758
00:32:02,684 --> 00:32:03,822
You're mouthy but deeply in love.

759
00:32:05,315 --> 00:32:06,035
Does it turn out okay?

760
00:32:06,062 --> 00:32:07,733
I have goosebumps all over.

761
00:32:07,768 --> 00:32:09,031
Thanks to you, Q.

762
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:09,955
For just standing still?

763
00:32:09,982 --> 00:32:11,031
Yeah, that's it.

764
00:32:11,066 --> 00:32:11,680
How about this director?

765
00:32:11,715 --> 00:32:14,551
You're also good at it.

766
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,000
Let's get moving.

767
00:32:16,044 --> 00:32:17,324
Let's film an action scene next.

768
00:32:17,697 --> 00:32:18,924
We aren't done yet?

769
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,813
Yeah.

770
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,026
This is already hard enough.

771
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,400
Are you done, Mhen?

772
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,191
Give me a second.

773
00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:26,260
It's almost done.

774
00:32:26,266 --> 00:32:27,120
I can't wait to watch it.

775
00:32:27,173 --> 00:32:27,777
He's too slow, isn't he?

776
00:32:27,804 --> 00:32:28,444
Yeah.

777
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,315
Here you are.

778
00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:30,248
Let us see.

779
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:31,271
I've done the editing.

780
00:32:38,088 --> 00:32:38,897
Hello.

781
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:40,391
I'm Athikhun Mongkolsit.

782
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,924
I'm 185 cm tall, weigh 72 kg,

783
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,906
and have special skills in stunts,

784
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,924
shooting, and boxing.

785
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,066
Because I can tell that

786
00:32:53,111 --> 00:32:55,155
you'll never open your heart to anyone

787
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,146
until your situation with Jay comes to an end.

788
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,288
As for what I said about liking you,

789
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:00,613
you don't have to think too much about it.

790
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:01,386
Just set it aside for now.

791
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,680
You see how good I am at teasing.

792
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,800
Thank you.

793
00:33:08,711 --> 00:33:10,710
See? Whose boyfriend is this?

794
00:33:11,111 --> 00:33:12,355
How talented he is.

795
00:33:14,764 --> 00:33:15,991
Was that my reward?

796
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:16,720
Yeah.

797
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:17,742
That's cute.

798
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:20,540
It's good that you two love each other a lot,

799
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,853
so you'll love me a little less.

800
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,555
Everyone loves their little brother, right?

801
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,324
Hold on.

802
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,551
Stop it.

803
00:33:28,888 --> 00:33:29,680
Okay.

804
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:30,968
I'll play with my boyfriend then.

805
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,817
That's my reward.

806
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,617
Great job.

807
00:33:37,653 --> 00:33:38,880
Good boy.

808
00:33:38,915 --> 00:33:39,857
Great job.

809
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:40,488
Great job.

810
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,284
Yes.

811
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,955
Thank you so much.

812
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:53,502
Yes. Goodbye.

813
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,511
Min,

814
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,408
it's alright.

815
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:16,062
You already did great.

816
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,355
Well, Mangmoom said

817
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,302
I made it!

818
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:31,004
Are you serious?!

819
00:34:31,031 --> 00:34:31,644
Yes!

820
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,568
I'm happy for you!

821
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,906
Great job.

822
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:40,213
You're going to get famous for sure.

823
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:43,520
Whose brother is this?

824
00:34:43,564 --> 00:34:44,790
He's so talented.

825
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:45,480
He's my brother.

826
00:34:46,195 --> 00:34:47,306
Don't forget me if you get famous.

827
00:34:49,368 --> 00:34:54,231
<b>FILM SET</b>

828
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:03,857
Mhen.

829
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:04,302
Yeah?

830
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,160
Where's that old picture frame

831
00:35:06,195 --> 00:35:06,915
that doesn't have anything in it?

832
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,140
I haven't seen it at all since we moved here.

833
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,480
It's in those boxes that haven't been unpacked.

834
00:35:13,164 --> 00:35:15,160
You said you'd unpack them yourself, didn't you?

835
00:35:16,737 --> 00:35:17,368
Okay. It's fine.

836
00:35:17,395 --> 00:35:18,373
I'll handle it.

837
00:36:13,991 --> 00:36:15,555
You're zoning out, huh?

838
00:36:15,582 --> 00:36:16,782
What are you thinking?

839
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,355
Nothing.

840
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,462
I just…don't know how I should feel.

841
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,964
On one hand, I'm happy that I got cast,

842
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,577
but on the other hand, I'm confused.

843
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,795
I don't often get opportunities like this,

844
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,111
and I'm not sure if I deserve it.

845
00:36:35,644 --> 00:36:37,040
You can do it.

846
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,924
I think you deserve to be in this project.

847
00:36:41,306 --> 00:36:42,810
They chose you.

848
00:36:43,697 --> 00:36:45,690
You should be proud of it already.

849
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,973
Don't forget to bring the flower tray

850
00:36:48,951 --> 00:36:50,950
to pay respects to Third,

851
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,022
who brought you into the industry.

852
00:36:53,066 --> 00:36:53,733
Gotcha.

853
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,213
Are you still sulking because of Third?

854
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:57,173
I'm not.

855
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:58,248
You're not?

856
00:36:58,488 --> 00:36:59,937
You're not?

857
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,675
Honestly, apart from Third,

858
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,617
I like a stuntman job for a particular reason.

859
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,391
When I was a kid,

860
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,377
my parents loved renting old DVDs for me to watch,

861
00:37:11,404 --> 00:37:13,160
and the movie I watched the most on repeat

862
00:37:13,217 --> 00:37:14,977
was the first Spider-Man.

863
00:37:15,004 --> 00:37:16,000
Have you ever watched it?

864
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,453
I kind of remember.

865
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,306
Can you remember the last scene?

866
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:26,266
Yeah.

867
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,164
Hey, what are you doing?

868
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:30,835
Come down.

869
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,120
You might hurt yourself.

870
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,368
Come on.

871
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:41,040
I want to be Spider-Man, just like in the movie.

872
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,617
Spider-Man hangs upside down to find MJ.

873
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,280
Don't.

874
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,888
Then, come closer.

875
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,906
Closer.

876
00:37:52,942 --> 00:37:53,768
Closer.

877
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,226
Closer.

878
00:37:55,724 --> 00:37:56,684
Closer.

879
00:37:57,973 --> 00:37:58,968
Let's do this.

880
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,964
Imagine that I'm Spider-Man hanging upside down,

881
00:38:02,008 --> 00:38:03,146
coming down to you, and you're MJ.

882
00:38:03,182 --> 00:38:04,391
I'm hanging upside down right now.

883
00:38:04,426 --> 00:38:05,315
Yeah.

884
00:38:05,342 --> 00:38:06,204
Okay?

885
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,226
I was in the neighborhood.

886
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,551
You are amazing.

887
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,760
Some people don't think so.

888
00:38:21,804 --> 00:38:23,173
But you are.

889
00:38:51,351 --> 00:38:52,142
(Next Episode)
Come here.

890
00:38:52,186 --> 00:38:53,946
Dad, Mom, this is Q,

891
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,906
my boyfriend.

892
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,524
I dreamed about my parents.

893
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,555
Even now, I still wonder
if they're still angry with me

894
00:39:01,582 --> 00:39:02,990
for what I did that day that caused them to die.

895
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,582
Mhen!

896
00:39:05,608 --> 00:39:06,284
Mhen!

897
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,093
Dad, I need your help.

898
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,902
What is it?

899
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,724
I'm really glad that on the days

900
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:12,450
when I have no one,

901
00:39:12,453 --> 00:39:13,626
I still have you.

902
00:39:13,671 --> 00:39:15,760
No matter how you were before,

903
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:17,608
it doesn't matter to me at all.

904
00:39:17,644 --> 00:39:19,600
You're still my good boy, always.
