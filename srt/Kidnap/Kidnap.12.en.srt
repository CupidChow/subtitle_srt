1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,280
(Previously)
I'm sorry this is all I can do for you.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,440
It was just a graze.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,440
You really want to be
the human shield leading man, huh?

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,360
It's my fault.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,600
You didn't do anything wrong.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,440
They're the ones at fault.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,640
I'll always support you, Dad.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,160
I…was worried I'd hurt you,

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,560
so I left the room and made coffee.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,680
All this time,

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,560
I've never wanted to cause you any trouble.

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,760
But all the wounds on my body are
what I chose for myself.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,640
I don't want to see anything happen to you.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,720
TWO WEEKS LATER

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,120
PSYCHOTHERAPY AND DEPRESSION TREATMENT

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,160
PSYCHIATRY DEPARTMENT

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,800
Don't stress out.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,280
I'll take you out for
something delicious after this.

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,320
Yeah.

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,400
I'll come with you next time, every time.

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,480
I promise.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,880
Smile.

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,640
Smile a little more. Come on, keep smiling.

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,800
Mr. Harit Yuenyongwisutt,

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,120
please follow me to the treatment room.

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,160
Yes.

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,080
Good luck.

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,920
Please.

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,400
Q,

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,520
Run away quickly.

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,760
I'm sorry it's been so long since I came.

32
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,440
Well, may I ask what
brings you back, please?

33
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,760
L-Q-V-E

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,440
Therapist,

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,080
is it wrong if I want to get
better for someone else?

36
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,160
That's not wrong at all, Q.

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,080
Some people just want
to recover even for a cat.

38
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,600
Just having you back makes me glad now.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,640
Let's give it another try.

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,800
Yes.

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,720
L-Q-V-E

42
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,640
EP 12 Not Anymore

43
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,000
Last week,

44
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,840
my boyfriend's brother had an accident

45
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
and had to undergo surgery
to replace his pacemaker.

46
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,960
At first, everything seemed fine,

47
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,600
but a few days later,

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,120
Mhen's body started
rejecting the pacemaker,

49
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,640
and his condition worsened.

50
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,560
Mhen,

51
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,800
get better soon, okay?

52
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,080
I'm waiting for our aquarium trip.

53
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,480
I will.

54
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,000
So, the doctors decided
he needed a heart transplant.

55
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,160
Why are you crying?

56
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,080
Hold it in.

57
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,440
You must come out and see me.

58
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,720
Doctor, how did the surgery go?

59
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Congratulations.

60
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,400
The patient is now safe.

61
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,400
The surgery was successful.

62
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,240
Thank you very much!

63
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,760
Min!

64
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,960
Mhen is recovered!

65
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,280
The surgery went well after all.

66
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,000
Based on the latest test results,
there's nothing to worry about.

67
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,200
The new heart is adapting
well to Athipatch's body.

68
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,480
After this, is there anything special
I need to do to take care of him?

69
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,400
Generally, people who undergo
heart transplants can live a normal life.

70
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,680
He no longer needs to worry
about using a pacemaker.

71
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,000
A normal life?

72
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,680
Yes.

73
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,520
So he can use a phone like everyone else?

74
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:11,920
That's right.

75
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,080
And he can wear Bluetooth headphones,

76
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,000
box,

77
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,880
ride a motorcycle,

78
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,840
play sports,

79
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,760
and run around like anyone else?

80
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,200
Exactly. He can do all that.

81
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,560
Just make sure the
wound heals properly first.

82
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,200
Got it, Doctor.

83
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,800
Thank you so much.

84
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,560
Please excuse me for now.

85
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,200
Mhen,

86
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,840
you're fully recovered now.

87
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,200
Great job, Mhen.

88
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,040
From now on, you can
live like normal people.

89
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,680
Yeah.

90
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,800
It's great that the
heart is being used well.

91
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,040
It was meant for one person,

92
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,240
but now it's helping two.

93
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,000
But from now on,

94
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
you can also live your
life like normal people.

95
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,640
Min, you know what?

96
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
You're the best brother in the world.

97
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,880
Great job, Mhen.

98
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,720
If that's the case,

99
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,600
what can I help you with today?

100
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,720
Is it possible for me to
stop having nightmares?

101
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,080
Dad.

102
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,440
Dad.

103
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,800
Dad.

104
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,880
Dad!

105
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,000
Dad, help me!

106
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,120
Dad!

107
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,480
Q. Q. Q.

108
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,600
You're just having a
nightmare. It's all right.

109
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,880
Go back to sleep.

110
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,360
I really want Min to be free.

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,040
All this time,

112
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,640
I never cared about anyone,

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,880
even my own life.

114
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,440
But now,

115
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,480
even if I have to kneel down
and beg you to help heal me,

116
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,480
I'll do it.

117
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,120
Since you're this determined,

118
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm sure you'll feel better this time.

119
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,640
I guess I will,

120
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,280
so Min can finally
get to live his own life.

121
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,160
Well, then,

122
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,480
let's start by discussing the cause again.

123
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,000
Can you tell me about your nightmare again?

124
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,120
Sure.

125
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,640
Great job, Little Q.

126
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,680
There are a lot of people
here. We're in a hospital.

127
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,720
Why are you shy?

128
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,400
People?

129
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,840
There's nobody around.

130
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,960
Why are you shy? Huh?

131
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,280
Nobody is saying anything.

132
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,720
There are so many CCTVs around.

133
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,480
See?

134
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,680
What CCTV? Where are they?

135
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,600
Over there.

136
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,400
Fine.

137
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,680
You did a great job.

138
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,720
Have you packed everything yet?

139
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,200
Yeah.

140
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,800
I checked three times already.

141
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
I can carry it myself.

142
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,440
No.

143
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,840
The doctor said I'm already recovered.

144
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,360
Your wound isn't fully healed,
and you're acting tough already.

145
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,400
- I can carry you.
- Stop it.

146
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,080
If you're all set, let's head home.

147
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,880
I'll give you a ride.

148
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,680
Sure.

149
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,600
Thank you, Min.

150
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,880
So…are you guys heading back
to Chonburi right away?

151
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,400
Well…yes.

152
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,880
Jeen,

153
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,520
why don't you let me send you home?

154
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,200
I'm fine, Min.

155
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,800
It's just around the corner. I can walk.

156
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,160
So Mhen can head back and rest.

157
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,080
Okay.

158
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,320
Honestly,

159
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,480
being around here makes
me miss our old place.

160
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,480
Look, everyone's here.

161
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,960
Jeen, why don't you come hang out
at our old place for a bit?

162
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,320
I'd love to,

163
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,240
but my parents are waiting for dinner.

164
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,760
Oh, really?

165
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,000
Then take Mhen with you
for dinner at your place.

166
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,560
Mhen just complained he's hungry.

167
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,080
Traffic is terrible right now.

168
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,400
By the time we get home,
Mhen's going to be starving.

169
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,880
We'll wait at our old house.

170
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,760
Can I join you for dinner at your house?

171
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,760
It's up to you.

172
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,200
If you want to eat, then go ahead.

173
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,600
Bye-bye.

174
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,480
Bye-bye.

175
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,280
Bye-bye.

176
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,880
I missed this house.

177
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,200
Though I didn't live here long,

178
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,800
I felt a connection to it.

179
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,240
I can't imagine how much you missed it.

180
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,640
This house is like a symbol of my parents.

181
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,800
People have offered to buy it,

182
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,080
but I couldn't bring myself to sell it.

183
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,480
Being here…feels like I'm preserving
something they created for Mhen.

184
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,480
Mhen always had to stay home,

185
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,640
and at least having a nice one
made his life not too bad.

186
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,720
But in the end,

187
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,800
the money spent on his treatment
until he's now recovered

188
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,880
came from selling this house.

189
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,440
If I'd known, I would've
forced myself to sell it sooner.

190
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,440
Min,

191
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,440
I asked my dad,

192
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,320
and he agreed to give me this house.

193
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,240
Huh?

194
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,320
It's to make up for the
trouble his work caused me.

195
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
If I want to bring my
boyfriend to live with me,

196
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,880
that shouldn't be a problem.

197
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,240
Q,

198
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,400
You really don't have to go this far.

199
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,000
Min,

200
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,160
be frank with me.

201
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,800
Do you really want to go
back to live in Chonburi?

202
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,360
If you're staying away just so
you don't inconvenience my dad,

203
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,920
let that go.

204
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,520
I'm doing this for me too.

205
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,120
My studio's here.

206
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,000
Mhen will be close to Kanomjeen,

207
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,480
and you can finally pursue what you love.

208
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,120
From now on,

209
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,280
you don't have to
sacrifice for Mhen's future.

210
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,680
If you really want to work on set again,

211
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,400
how about we start over here together?

212
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,400
So now, you can't break up with me.

213
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,480
This house is my hostage.

214
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
Even without the house,

215
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,000
I wouldn't break up with you.

216
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,760
I called James, asking for a job,

217
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
and he agreed to give me this one,

218
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,080
but he insisted that you come along.

219
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,520
I don't know why, either.

220
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,760
Are you tricking me into
acting as a zombie again?

221
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,520
No idea.

222
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,920
Ride carefully.

223
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm going to speed up now.

224
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,800
So, what's the job, James?

225
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,600
There's no crew here.

226
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,360
It's my project.

227
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,680
Huh?

228
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,720
Well,

229
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,880
I met an investor who
wants to produce a movie.

230
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,800
He's looking for ideas and a team,

231
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,640
so I'm making a pilot to pitch it.

232
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,680
But I need approval
before I get paid, you know.

233
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,280
- Yeah.
- So today, it's just me, you, and Q.

234
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,600
I dare to use you both for free.

235
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Hold on, bro.

236
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,680
When I called you and
asked for the opportunity,

237
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,320
I was talking about a paid job,

238
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,960
not to work for you for free.

239
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,720
Hey.

240
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,280
Who said it's free?

241
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,200
I'll pay you a thousand times
what you earned as an extra.

242
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,200
And so?

243
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,400
But now,

244
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,200
I've got only 1,000 baht.

245
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,160
Can you take that for now?
I won't even take out the 5%.

246
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,280
Wow.

247
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,680
Nope.

248
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,560
Hey.

249
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,320
Hey, come back.

250
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,000
Just think of it as working
in exchange for an opportunity.

251
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,120
Working in exchange for an opportunity?

252
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,320
You were the one who taught me
to cut ties with anyone who says that.

253
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,960
Can't I be an exception?

254
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,200
I can say it.

255
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,280
1,000 baht, right?

256
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,160
Fine. I'll go with that.

257
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,480
But if my acting sucks, don't scold me.

258
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,960
I'll act within the budget.

259
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,680
Yeah.

260
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,960
I know.

261
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Take these and get changed.

262
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,920
Black pants are for you,

263
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,200
and the blue ones are for you, Q.

264
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,640
Here you are.

265
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,680
Where's the restroom?

266
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,000
Go ahead.

267
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,000
Just a thousand baht, and I still have to
pull my underwear up for you to see, James.

268
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,280
Aghhhh.

269
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,160
Lie down.

270
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,840
Quickly.

271
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,160
That's right.

272
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,440
Well, in this scene,

273
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,600
just talk about anything you want to.

274
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,360
I only need the motions,

275
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,680
but hold hands and pat his head.

276
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,400
Do such things.

277
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,720
Be romantic.

278
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,600
Show love.

279
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,360
Okay?

280
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,320
- Okay.
- Okay.

281
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,760
You're paying us 1,000 baht, right?

282
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,440
Yeah.

283
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,520
You keep bringing that up, huh?

284
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,280
What do I have to do?

285
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,240
Nothing.

286
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,600
Pat my head like this.

287
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,800
I'll hold your hand like this.

288
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,280
Look into my eyes.

289
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,880
I'll start the conversation. Okay?

290
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,120
And action!

291
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,880
Back when you were a student,

292
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,600
did you wear a uniform like this?

293
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
Blue pants?

294
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,560
Yeah.

295
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,600
Mine looked exactly like this.

296
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,800
I bet you looked cool.

297
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,880
If we had met back in school,

298
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,680
and our lives hadn't been like this,

299
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,720
would we still have ended up together?

300
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,560
I have no idea where I would run into you.

301
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,000
Maybe at a tutoring class?

302
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,040
Do I look like someone
who'd go to tutoring?

303
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,000
Or in Chonburi?

304
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,200
When my mom was still here,

305
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,760
she used to take me to the fireworks
festival in Chonburi almost every year.

306
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,760
If you were still there
and attended that festival,

307
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,600
we've probably crossed paths there.

308
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,960
Do you want to go there?

309
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,120
I'll take you there this year.

310
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,520
No.

311
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,080
Fireworks sound just like gunshots.

312
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,480
Every time I hear it,

313
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,080
all I can think about are bad memories.

314
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,760
When I came back, the
nightmares started again.

315
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,480
That's why I stopped watching fireworks.

316
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,520
Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut.

317
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,240
Cut already.

318
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,160
I said romantic, guys!

319
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,080
Don't you get it?

320
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,880
Why do you look like sad puppies?

321
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,680
Let's go again.

322
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,680
Got it. You're so strict, bro.

323
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,160
The pay is 1,000 baht,

324
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,000
so put in the effort, okay?

325
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,800
Please.

326
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,640
Okay.

327
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,560
Concentrate,

328
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,800
or I'll dock your pay.

329
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,480
Smile a lot.

330
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,400
Okay.

331
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,480
All right. Follow me.

332
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,400
This is the last scene.
There's nothing much to do.

333
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,480
Just keep running away
through the tall grass.

334
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,080
Q, you run ahead first,

335
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,800
and I'll follow with the camera.

336
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,920
Min, you run alongside me,

337
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,080
and when I give the
cue, run together with Q.

338
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,880
So I run alongside you,

339
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,040
then pick up the pace and pass you, right?

340
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,680
Exactly.

341
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,520
Okay.

342
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,680
Are you okay?

343
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,720
If you aren't, then we
can shoot outside instead.

344
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,840
It's fine, Min.

345
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,000
James and you are here with me.

346
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,960
I think it's fine.

347
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
And action!

348
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,480
Mom! Mom!

349
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,120
Mom!

350
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,720
Min…

351
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,640
Dad!

352
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,200
Dad, help me!

353
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,280
Dad!

354
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,240
Dad!

355
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,240
Q! Q!

356
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,080
- Q.
- Q.

357
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,720
Are you okay?

358
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,040
I'm here. It's okay.

359
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,160
I'm here.

360
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,640
Breathe. Breathe slowly.

361
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,880
How are you feeling?

362
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,760
I think I'm okay now, Min.

363
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,280
It should be fine.

364
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
I'm sorry, Q.

365
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,680
I didn't realize you had trauma.

366
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,360
I just thought you were
really nailing the role.

367
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,200
I was about to recruit
you into the industry.

368
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,600
Stop it.

369
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,560
Q, I'm sorry for making you do this.

370
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,320
Don't worry about it.

371
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,520
Actually, I was curious to see how my
condition was progressing after the treatment.

372
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,640
But today made me realize
it's going to take more time to get better.

373
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,480
Q, listen up.

374
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,040
Our life is like that red tin of cookies.

375
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,400
You know,

376
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,200
there's got to be at least one time you open
it, and there are actual cookies inside,

377
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,480
not a bunch of sewing stuff.

378
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,200
So, as long as you can still go on,

379
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,360
keep opening it.

380
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,480
Don't give up.

381
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,160
Got it?

382
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Why the fuck are you laughing?

383
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,560
James may sound a bit crazy,

384
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,840
but I agree with him.

385
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,440
Keep trying.

386
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,480
One of these times,
it's bound to get better.

387
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,280
When you get the chance,
you sure know how to roast me.

388
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,080
You jerk.

389
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,840
I went out of my way to
find a good job for you.

390
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,240
Is this what you call a good job?

391
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,800
Shhh.

392
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,360
No.

393
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,560
I found one, actually.

394
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,200
I think you should join the casting.

395
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,440
It's a movie.

396
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,600
This character is one on the hero's side.

397
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,800
He's the kind of character
the audience will love.

398
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,000
He dies near the end.

399
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,280
This kind of character
makes the actor famous easily.

400
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,200
It's an action movie.

401
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,200
You're both good-looking
and worked as a stuntman before.

402
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,400
I think you're at an advantage.

403
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,800
But a role like this needs
a lot of skills, James.

404
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,480
Don't you think it's out of my league?

405
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,520
Min, listen up.

406
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,800
- Our life…is like that red tin of cookies.
- Hey, stop here.

407
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,600
Stop it.

408
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Stop it.

409
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,000
Okay. I know. I get it already.

410
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,480
Min, you should go for it.

411
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,800
I want to see you do it.

412
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,880
Think of it as my talent fee for today.

413
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Okay.

414
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,520
I think I should give it a try, too.

415
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,680
Do you want to see my life as cookies?

416
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,000
Thanks a lot, bro.

417
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,200
Casting Room

418
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,320
You guys should quickly get out of here.
Casting Room

419
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,000
If you carry me along, you could
end up dead, too. Casting Room

420
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,120
Seriously, admit the truth and
just leave me behind.

421
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,840
Promise me you won't end up like me.

422
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,080
Min Athikhun.

423
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,400
- It's me.
- Okay. Please head inside.

424
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,400
Sure.

425
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,680
Casting Room

426
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,640
Min, please take a seat.

427
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
This is Deng, our director.

428
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,520
- Why didn't you keep the promise?
- Mhen!

429
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,400
Don't come back here again!

430
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,960
Hello.

431
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,040
You read the script already, right?

432
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,080
- Yes.
- Please hand it to me.

433
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,600
For the first take, just be yourself.

434
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,120
Okay? Let me know when you're ready.

435
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,880
Sure.

436
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,280
I'm ready.

437
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,560
Okay.

438
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,680
Ready and action!

439
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,400
You guys should quickly get out of here.

440
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,120
I'm sorry.

441
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,480
Can I do it again?

442
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,080
Go ahead.

443
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,000
Okay.

444
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,800
Okay. Ready.

445
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,240
Ready and action!

446
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,920
You guys should quickly get out of here.

447
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,600
If you carry me along,
you could end up dead, too.

448
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
Seriously,

449
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,800
admit the truth and just leave me behind.

450
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:12,760
Promise me you won't end up like me.

451
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,880
Don't sacrifice anything for anyone

452
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:26,360
because, in the end, dying
alone here isn't worth it at all.

453
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,400
Please live the rest of your life for me.

454
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,560
Cut.

455
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,520
Okay.

456
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,160
Actually, you did well,

457
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,880
but let me go off-topic a bit.

458
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,200
You remember me, right?

459
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,000
Yes, I do.

460
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,400
And you remember the
trouble you caused, right?

461
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,200
Yes, I do.

462
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,040
I won't ask what happened that day
because it's all in the past.

463
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,480
But tell me now

464
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,240
if I can trust that
something like that won't happen again.

465
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,160
First off, I apologize.

466
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,840
I apologize for what happened that day.

467
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,600
But now, I've grown a lot since then.

468
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,600
I promise it won't happen again.

469
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,280
I'm sorry.

470
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,040
Q!

471
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,400
I made it!

472
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,320
I got that role!

473
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,440
Hey, seriously?

474
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,320
Yep.

475
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,800
You did great.

476
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
If that's so,

477
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,640
do you have any reward for me?

478
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,920
What do you want?

479
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,200
If you feel so scared that your body
can no longer handle it, let me know.

480
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,480
We can sit in the car, watch from there,

481
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,400
and close the roof.

482
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,280
You asked for a reward.

483
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,600
Why didn't you ask for
something you'd like?

484
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,680
You don't even enjoy watching fireworks.

485
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,520
Who said that?

486
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,800
I do enjoy them.

487
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,320
I just don't want you to miss out on
something you like because of past trauma.

488
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,400
I'll take care of you during the fireworks,

489
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,400
and after we return home,
if you have a nightmare,

490
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,080
I'll be here to comfort you. Okay?

491
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,920
Let's give it a try.

492
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,800
Let's go.

493
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:52,960
Are you ready?

494
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm letting go of my hands.

495
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,800
It's nothing.

496
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,080
It's just fireworks sound.

497
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm really letting go this time.

498
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,280
- Watch the fireworks, too.
- I'm watching.

499
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,480
Honestly,

500
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,440
when you hear the bang sound,

501
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,560
if you can think of the
fireworks or today's memory,

502
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,600
that will be nice.

503
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,280
You've made so much progress.

504
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,280
Yeah.

505
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,800
I guess going to see a
therapist actually worked.

506
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,840
What did she ask you to do?

507
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,440
In my latest visit,

508
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,760
she asked me to draw things in my head.

509
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,120
Draw the memories that hurt me in a square.

510
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,160
Then, I must keep
making that square smaller

511
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,960
and that picture will become smaller, too.

512
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,960
She asked me to imagine putting that square
into something which is very tightly sealed,

513
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,560
and throwing it away somewhere
it can't come back to me again.

514
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,000
Draw it on my hand, then,
and I'll throw it away for you.

515
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,280
It's going to be a lot.

516
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,120
I don't mind.

517
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,960
Draw yours, too.

518
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,640
I'll throw it away for you.

519
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,320
Sure.

520
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,600
Done.

521
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,400
Are you ready?

522
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,080
- Go away!
- Go!

523
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,000
Yay!

524
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,200
All gone! All gone!

525
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Never come back!

526
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,000
Never come back!

527
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,720
Min, you know what?

528
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,720
Since that incident,

529
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,960
I never thought I could feel
as happy as I was before.

530
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,800
But today, I'm so damn happy.

531
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,600
Same here.

532
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,080
I never thought I would stop blaming myself

533
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,680
and stop believing I
don't deserve happiness.

534
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,000
Most importantly,

535
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,800
I couldn't feel this way without you.

536
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,800
Thank you, Q.

537
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,480
Thank you, too.

538
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,400
I love you.

539
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,080
I love you, too.

540
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,200
4 MONTHS LATER

541
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,280
How have you been since our last session?
4 MONTHS LATER

542
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,520
4 MONTHS LATER

543
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,400
I think I've gotten a lot better.
4 MONTHS LATER

544
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
4 MONTHS LATER

545
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,080
It's so much better that I could notice
the lives of people around me.

546
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,120
ผมถึงได้รู้ว่า

547
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,680
I realized their lives
have changed a lot recently.

548
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,880
Come on.

549
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,120
I can stay alone.

550
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,280
I'm off to university now.

551
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,320
I'll hang up.

552
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,120
I'm almost running late.

553
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,800
Someone finally fulfilled
what he's been striving for all this time.

554
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,400
LET'S GO TO THE AQUARIUM
AFTER CLASS THIS EVENING.

555
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,760
OK!

556
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,280
This is the new series.

557
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,600
It's my work.

558
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,320
See?

559
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,800
Two of my friends are in it.

560
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,280
Just a second.

561
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,640
No, come on. Take a look at it first.

562
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,640
Someone faced disappointment.

563
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,560
Why would we do that?

564
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,400
Come on. Let's make some changes.

565
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,440
Please take a look at it first.

566
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,600
But he still hasn't given up.

567
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,880
I would like to resign.

568
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,800
I'll try living my kind of life
you once told me to, Mr. Kacha.

569
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:56,960
Sure.

570
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,480
Just make sure you don't end up
in a place like that again.

571
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,200
Thank you.

572
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,600
Someone wanted to start fresh.

573
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,560
Q.

574
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,200
Yeah?

575
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,200
I have something to show off.

576
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,320
What is it?

577
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,600
Here.

578
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,000
Ta-da!

579
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,240
MARKED FOR THE HUNT: MORE
RELENTLESS THAN HELL Ta-da!

580
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:25,280
Ta-da!

581
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,000
Hey?

582
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,080
A movie poster?

583
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,600
What do you think? I'm in it, too.

584
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,600
That's cool.

585
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,440
Looking at everyone closely,

586
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,440
Mr.Warrior.

587
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,360
I realize we're moving
forward all the time.

588
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,040
I've got something to show off, too.

589
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,320
Show me. What is it?

590
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,080
The therapist isn't scheduling me anymore.

591
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,800
She said my condition is better now.

592
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,600
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

593
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,120
And I think I'm also one of them.

594
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,520
My turn.

595
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,480
- Yay!
- Yay!

596
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,080
Thank you.

597
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,680
Thank you.

598
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,400
Thank you.

599
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,760
Hurry up.

600
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,160
What's with you, James?

601
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,920
Relax.

602
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,000
You guys are slow.

603
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,200
What if our characters are dea
by the time we head inside?

604
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
We don't have many scenes, you know.

605
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,760
No spoilers.

606
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,000
Right.

607
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,120
- I'm sorry.
- You're spoiling it.

608
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,960
Let's head inside already.

609
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,920
Hurry up.

610
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,000
It's five of us.

611
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,040
MARKED FOR THE HUNT:
MORE RELENTLESS THAN HELL

612
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,800
Please head inside. MARKED FOR THE
HUNT: MORE RELENTLESS THAN HELL

613
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:19,920
MARKED FOR THE HUNT:
MORE RELENTLESS THAN HELL

614
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,520
As for whether I'll fully heal from my past pain,
MARKED FOR THE HUNT: MORE RELENTLESS THAN HELL

615
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,640
As for whether I'll fully
heal from my past pain,

616
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,280
the answer is unclear.

617
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,840
You look super cool.

618
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,200
But even if I'm not fully healed today,

619
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
I can smile,

620
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,480
laugh,

621
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,400
and cherish time with the people I love.

622
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,840
With that thought,

623
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,280
nothing scares me anymore.

624
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,000
It took you damn forever.

625
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,120
If you're so good, why not help yourself?

626
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,400
That's me.

627
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,880
You're so handsome.

628
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,880
That's Min!

629
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,640
Stop arguing and quickly get out of here.

630
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,200
I'm so damn handsome.

631
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,640
What kind of person are you
to compliment yourself?

632
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,200
Come on.

633
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,920
Fine. You're handsome.

634
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,000
They're closing in, right?

635
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,200
Stop it!

636
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
When you hear the bang sound,

637
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,120
if you can think of the fireworks
or today's memory,

638
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,200
that will be nice.

639
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,200
I love you.

640
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,080
I sleepwalk less now,

641
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,400
but I still have nightmares sometimes.

642
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,400
From now on, there's nothing
to be afraid of anymore.

643
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:37,680
But those nightmares can't hurt me anymore.

644
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,200
Come.

645
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,080
Can we skip the rope tonight?

646
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,800
I'd rather hug you while we sleep.

647
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,480
You might have a nightmare.

648
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,280
We just watched that movie earlier today.

649
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,480
It's totally fine.

650
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,680
I'll see you after I wake up anyway.

651
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,000
How cute you are.

652
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,480
Let's do this, then.

653
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,200
Okay?

654
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,000
Goodnight.

655
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,080
Goodnight.

656
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,600
Let's sleep.

657
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,520
Dad!

658
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,360
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.

659
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,600
It's over now.

660
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,320
I dreamed about you last night.

661
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,600
I bet it was a good dream.

662
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,840
It was amazing.

663
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,840
DIRECTED BY
ATTPORN TEEMAKORN

664
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,960
Ohm has grown so much that
instead of me supporting him,

665
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,640
it's now him supporting me

666
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,240
in looking after the cast.

667
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,600
It's been such a great project to work on.

668
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,120
Dad!

669
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:56,480
Q.

670
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,000
Q.

671
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:57,760
Q.

672
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,680
Min.

673
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,000
I'm begging you.

674
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,840
Take me to my dad.

675
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,760
I'm crying.

676
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,760
When it's fun,

677
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,320
and we're working with that fun energy,

678
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:08,640
I'm like,

679
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,320
"Hey, what are you bringing
to the table in this scene?"

680
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,200
"I've got this one to show.
Can you work with it?

681
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:12,760
Thanks to you.

682
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,400
Thanks to you.

683
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,920
That was beyond my expectations.

684
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,680
I'm proud of you.

685
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,040
You're amazing.

686
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,680
Thank you so much.
