The dealer seems lucky.

43
00:02:20,548 --> 00:02:22,815
Ugh, asking money
for snacks again?

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,149
Later! I'm on a losing streak.

45
00:02:39,122 --> 00:02:42,583
Bro, you deal so fast.

46
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,648
You’re doing it too fast.

47
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:53,569
What are you trying to pull off here?

48
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:55,071
What do you think I’m doing?

49
00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:57,394
You're always winning
because you're cheating.

50
00:02:57,507 --> 00:02:59,134
- How am I cheating you?
- You fuck!

51
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,369
- What tricks are you playing here?
- I'm just playing.

52
00:03:01,394 --> 00:03:04,897
Hey! You fuckers, you have
the balls to fight here.

53
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:07,535
Get out of here!

54
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,941
Don’t fight here!

55
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,339
Leave!

56
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:15,714
How dare you disrespect this place?!

57
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:18,992
Village guards!
They’re fighting!

58
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:20,930
Stop them! Hurry!

59
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:23,253
Fuck you!
We’re grieving our dead here!

60
00:03:23,278 --> 00:03:26,031
Assholes!

61
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:29,847
Fuckers!

62
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:32,548
Stop!

63
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:36,349
- Stop!
- Shit!

64
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:41,980
What the hell!

65
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:43,605
Move out of the way!

66
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:47,878
- I'm so sweaty!
- Hey, look, he's probably a thief!

67
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:57,714
Move!

68
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:08,765
Stop running around here!

69
00:04:09,718 --> 00:04:11,249
Over there!

70
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,085
Which pill is for the kidney?

71
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,001
Okay.

72
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:53,019
It’s this one.

73
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:54,378
Okay. Here you go.
Here’s water.

74
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,430
Son.

75
00:04:56,748 --> 00:04:59,830
Son, where’ve you been?

76
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:01,940
You left so early.

77
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:04,423
I didn’t go far.

78
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:06,798
Have you eaten?

79
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:10,034
You sure? Drink it then.

80
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,102
Hey, Mark!

81
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:13,913
Why don’t you help Mama and Papa?

82
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,289
You’re wasting time on that phone.

83
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,815
They can handle that.

84
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:20,478
You’re a grown man
but you haven’t changed.

85
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:21,626
I might lose this game.

86
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:24,562
Lose? I’ll throw your cellphone.

87
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:27,885
Hey, how did you get that?

88
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:29,320
Oh, son.

89
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:32,345
In the alley.
You know how narrow that is, Papa.

90
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:35,880
- Got in a fight again, didn’t you?
- No.

91
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:37,156
It hurts.

92
00:05:37,414 --> 00:05:41,582
I don’t believe you.
You tried to outrun somebody.

93
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,236
Be careful with those schemes of yours.

94
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,763
- Yes, Papa.
- Oh, hey!

95
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,986
Have you eaten already?

96
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,621
Yes, we just finished.

97
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:52,699
Here, eat.

98
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:55,032
Pass me a glass.

99
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:03,986
- Has my son eaten?
- Yes, he just finished.

100
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:06,066
Brother.

101
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,826
What?

102
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,645
We have our finals this week.

103
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,023
What do you need?

104
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:12,947
Tomorrow's the deadline.

105
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,969
I need to pay the tuition.

106
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:19,620
Let me eat first.
I’ll see what I can do.

107
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,017
Okay.

108
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,877
Where have you been?

109
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:27,069
- Just around.
- Go on, eat.

110
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:32,322
- I'm already eating.
- When I woke up, you were gone.

111
00:06:33,412 --> 00:06:36,974
Aica, let your husband eat first...

112
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:39,126
don’t nag.

113
00:06:39,556 --> 00:06:43,628
You always let him
do what he wants.

114
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,155
Take this to the kitchen.

115
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,642
I’ll take care of this.

116
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:25,826
Take this.

117
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,132
Stop that already.

118
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,450
Hey.

119
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:46,240
What happened to your arm?

120
00:07:46,504 --> 00:07:47,546
Nothing.

121
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:53,155
You always mess up.

122
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,158
Try doing what I’m doing,
think you’ll be good at it?

123
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:57,844
Shut up.

124
00:07:57,869 --> 00:07:58,786
Let me see.

125
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,062
Gently. It hurts!

126
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:04,750
I’ll do it myself.

127
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,877
I’ll do it!

128
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:08,462
Slowly.

129
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:11,841
It stings!

130
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,302
It really hurts.

131
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:20,600
What happened to your
promise that we’ll move out of here?

132
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:28,983
I haven’t saved much yet.
I need to look after Mama and my family.

133
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:30,610
Forget that.

134
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:32,833
Come on.

135
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,704
What?!

136
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:44,624
C'mon I want you.

137
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:50,630
Don’t be loud.

138
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:01,159
Take your towel off.

139
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:58,396
Popoy!

140
00:10:58,421 --> 00:10:59,463
Yes Papa?

141
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:01,013
You have visitors.

142
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:03,179
I’m going out,
just changing my clothes.

143
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,414
Go home early.

144
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:12,706
What’s taking him so long?

145
00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:26,701
- Poy, hurry up!
- Yes.

146
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,163
I’ll go now.

147
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:44,266
Son, where are you going?

148
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,084
I’m just going out with friends.

149
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:47,861
I’ll be back early.

150
00:11:47,886 --> 00:11:50,013
Take care, okay?

151
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:54,063
Popoy, wait.

152
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:01,170
Notice that your mother’s feeling weaker.

153
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:02,196
Yes.

154
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:08,077
Any idea when we can
schedule her for a kidney transplant?

155
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,873
I’ll find a way, Papa.

156
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:16,205
How much do we bet?

157
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:17,205
Open bet.

158
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,584
Open bet? okay.

159
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:51,239
Cards down.

160
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:56,417
So, you lost?

161
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:57,442
Call!

162
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,082
You lose, give it to me.

163
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:28,040
- Sir, good evening.
- Yeah, good evening.

164
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:38,412
Lighter.

165
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,520
The table is available now.

166
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:34,009
What’s the limit here?

167
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:35,386
Open bet.

168
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:37,618
Okay.

169
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,648
How much will you bet?

170
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:41,555
Ten thousand.

171
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:45,343
Can I place a side bet?

172
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:48,148
Fifteen thousand.

173
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:52,026
Game.

174
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:14,622
Down.

175
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:21,723
Lucky start.

176
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:23,290
You win.

177
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:39,974
I’ll put fifty now.

178
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:42,557
Bet?

179
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,690
Bet.

180
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:44,596
Game?

181
00:17:44,621 --> 00:17:45,916
Yes.

182
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,020
Show cards.

183
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:13,692
He won.

184
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,460
I’m so lucky tonight.

185
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,789
You don’t think I saw what you were doing?

186
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:31,921
You fucking cheater.

187
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:33,795
Hey you, motherfucker.

188
00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:46,767
Fuck you all!

189
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:08,357
Fucking morons.

190
00:19:09,123 --> 00:19:12,584
They cheated first.
We're just getting even.

191
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:18,559
Yeah, they knew they couldn't beat us.

192
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,369
Their tricks don't work anymore.

193
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,712
They thought they could fool us.

194
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:27,313
They don’t know who they’re up against.

195
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,137
That stupid fucking guy.

196
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,911
You forgot to lock it.

197
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:26,855
That was closed earlier,
but someone went out.

198
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Really.

199
00:20:28,844 --> 00:20:29,886
What’s the news?

200
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:31,371
Everything’s fine.

201
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,375
These guys had a good start, these just
arrived but they’re having a good game.

202
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,653
- Alright.
- They play fast.

203
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:41,132
- Not like the other day.
- Hey.

204
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:43,662
Hey man!

205
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:46,737
- How are you doing?
- We're okay.

206
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:50,327
Want more drinks?

207
00:20:51,475 --> 00:20:54,603
We still have wine and beer.

208
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:58,065
How many cases have they finished?

209
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,292
Not a lot, but we're kinda tipsy.

210
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:03,403
- He’ll take care of you, okay?
- Alright. Sure, boss.

211
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,782
Just this?

212
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:26,143
The guys on the big
table on the left just started.

213
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:27,420
Really?

214
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:30,072
Just wait a while,
it’ll be a quick payout.

215
00:21:30,097 --> 00:21:32,366
We better collect more.

216
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,483
That’s for sure.

217
00:21:35,148 --> 00:21:37,066
- Okay.
- Want coffee?

218
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:38,123
No.

219
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:39,572
Water?

220
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:42,108
Fuck, just do your job.

221
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:43,735
If you say so.

222
00:22:10,856 --> 00:22:12,483
How much did we score?

223
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:20,480
Hm, fifty. What Ryan got
from the guys downstairs.

224
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:27,404
Then what we won tonight…

225
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:34,911
A hundred and fifty.

226
00:22:35,186 --> 00:22:37,397
- This is fifty.
- That’s good.

227
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,233
- You guys good? Want drinks?
- No, we're fine.

228
00:22:40,382 --> 00:22:41,382
Here you go.

229
00:22:49,989 --> 00:22:51,615
One hundred and fifty.

230
00:23:10,608 --> 00:23:12,382
- Give it to me.
- Here.

231
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:14,639
A hundred seventy.

232
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,168
How much is it again?

233
00:23:24,085 --> 00:23:25,295
A hundred and seventy.

234
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:28,483
So I have two million one seventy.

235
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:12,592
Behave.

236
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,469
Yes, master.

237
00:24:21,147 --> 00:24:22,983
I'm ready master.

238
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,569
Yes! Yes!

239
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:36,580
Behave.

240
00:24:36,805 --> 00:24:38,312
Be patient.

241
00:25:02,683 --> 00:25:06,188
Lie down! Fuck you.

242
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,917
Hey!

243
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,569
Shush!

244
00:25:42,943 --> 00:25:44,794
Behave.

245
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:24,519
So how did it go earlier?

246
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,451
It was a mess.

247
00:26:27,568 --> 00:26:28,610
Why?

248
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:31,314
We offed somebody there.

249
00:26:31,915 --> 00:26:32,916
A Fil-Am.

250
00:26:32,941 --> 00:26:34,519
Hey Bigboy, try to win.

251
00:26:34,544 --> 00:26:36,761
- Who?
- Some stupid Fil-Am.

252
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:38,763
What happened there?

253
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:41,331
The payment.

254
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:43,422
Your share.

255
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:48,417
You too ‘Poy, here’s yours.

256
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,587
Madam.

257
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:55,689
What?

258
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:56,965
Where do we go next?

259
00:26:57,007 --> 00:26:58,133
Home.

260
00:26:58,812 --> 00:27:01,128
- Can I ask for smoke?
- Come on, then.

261
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Echo.

262
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,643
This is for you.

263
00:27:08,685 --> 00:27:09,728
Thank you, madam.

264
00:27:10,311 --> 00:27:11,438
Paeng.

265
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,441
I’m going home.

266
00:27:18,543 --> 00:27:19,543
Beer, boss?

267
00:27:19,677 --> 00:27:21,011
You okay there?

268
00:28:02,655 --> 00:28:06,284
Get off here.

269
00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:16,169
Alright. Thanks.

270
00:28:54,507 --> 00:28:58,002
Your mother collapsed earlier.

271
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:04,134
We need to bring her
to the hospital.

272
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,232
We need money for her dialysis.

273
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,198
Do you have money?

274
00:29:14,316 --> 00:29:15,484
Five thousand.

275
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:16,632
Five thousand?

276
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:19,764
Your mother needs a dialysis.

277
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,335
She needs blood transfusion.
This isn’t enough.

278
00:29:24,456 --> 00:29:26,522
Wait, I’ll just get some more.

279
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,250
Who was that?

280
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:37,969
Who’s that girl in the car?

281
00:29:38,353 --> 00:29:39,577
She’s the boss’ girl.

282
00:29:48,014 --> 00:29:50,158
She just gave me a ride home.

283
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,624
Don’t try to insinuate anything.

284
00:29:57,604 --> 00:29:59,480
You came home late again.

285
00:30:01,357 --> 00:30:06,196
You know I’m trying to earn money.

286
00:30:34,307 --> 00:30:36,017
Here it is, Pa.

287
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:37,809
Okay.

288
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:39,562
I think that’s enough.

289
00:30:39,896 --> 00:30:41,356
I’ll count it first.

290
00:30:41,564 --> 00:30:45,944
But I think this will do,
at least as downpayment.

291
00:30:46,572 --> 00:30:49,533
I'll keep it first.

292
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:52,133
When will we take her to the hospital?

293
00:30:52,158 --> 00:30:55,495
As soon as we can.
What are we waiting for?

294
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:57,955
What time is it?

295
00:30:58,556 --> 00:30:59,766
It’s morning already.

296
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,501
I’ll just rest for a while.

297
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,362
Rest a bit,
while I prepare your mother.

298
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:52,108
Do you have a fever?

299
00:31:53,427 --> 00:31:54,737
Don’t cry anymore.

300
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:57,640
Son! What happened?

301
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,687
He’s crying.

302
00:31:59,712 --> 00:32:05,915
Baby, it's okay. I'm here.

303
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,651
I’m sorry, Mama had to work.

304
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:13,022
- I'll go.
- Okay? Don’t choke.

305
00:32:15,007 --> 00:32:17,991
Everything's alright.

306
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:22,694
You want to play?
You’ve got a lot of toys.

307
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:25,601
What do you want?

308
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:28,296
Mama.

309
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:35,410
Good morning!

310
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:38,421
Oh, you’re home already!

311
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:43,037
You know your daughter isn’t home yet?

312
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:47,732
She’s becoming exactly like you!

313
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,176
You’re both messed up.

314
00:32:50,374 --> 00:32:52,528
So... be quiet.

315
00:32:52,795 --> 00:32:55,548
Before you talk, I have a brilliant idea.

316
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:56,632
Please, not now.

317
00:32:56,657 --> 00:32:58,493
I’ll send you both to rehab.

318
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,811
I’m so tired.

319
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:04,608
Hello Mom, good morning!

320
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,790
Hey!

321
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,881
You’re early today!

322
00:33:12,147 --> 00:33:13,607
Good morning, Dad!

323
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:15,968
You also arrived just now?

324
00:33:16,698 --> 00:33:18,325
I missed you.

325
00:33:20,807 --> 00:33:23,434
As usual, he’s got another
woman’s scent on him, Mom.

326
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,170
How many have you had?

327
00:33:26,525 --> 00:33:28,687
You’re wasting your tuition fees.

328
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:30,772
Stop taking drugs, alright?

329
00:33:30,797 --> 00:33:34,491
- What do you care, Dad?
- This is your last warning.

330
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:38,089
Look, my father’s
concerned about me, Mom!

331
00:33:38,758 --> 00:33:40,385
You shit, you’re disrespecting me?

332
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,286
- You won’t listen to me?
- Rudy.

333
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,729
Fuck you!

334
00:33:43,754 --> 00:33:45,431
Enough!

335
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,225
- I’ll file a case against you two.
- Stop!

336
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,878
Try to hurt me again!
You’re a worthless father!

337
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,147
Enough, Rudy.
I’ll take care of this.

338
00:33:53,952 --> 00:33:56,538
Talk to that child of yours. Fuck.

339
00:33:56,563 --> 00:33:59,483
I’ll have you jailed!
You think I’m joking.

340
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:07,937

I’m getting better.

351
00:35:33,356 --> 00:35:35,358
Don’t worry about me.

352
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,447
You should prioritize your own family now.

353
00:35:42,448 --> 00:35:45,409
Especially your son.

354
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,663
Your son is growing up.

355
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:53,209
Your family needs you.

356
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,586
Put them first.

357
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:57,547
Here.

358
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,880
I’ve eaten enough.

359
00:35:58,965 --> 00:36:00,174
- What?
- I’m full.

360
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:07,268
Felix.

361
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:10,870
Felix.

362
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:25,927
Felix, my son.

363
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:30,681
I know you can hear me.

364
00:37:32,662 --> 00:37:34,463
They will pay for what they did to you.

365
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:42,590
Good morning!

366
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:45,636
- Where’s your chief?
- He’s in an operation, sir.

367
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:51,567
Tell your Chief to come
to me as soon as he can.

368
00:37:51,911 --> 00:37:53,079
We’ll tell him, sir.

369
00:37:55,748 --> 00:37:58,692
Sir looks very angry.

370
00:38:09,982 --> 00:38:11,825
Nurse, nurse.

371
00:38:12,482 --> 00:38:14,234
Yes, sir?

372
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:18,682
This is a referral letter for a dialysis.

373
00:38:30,282 --> 00:38:32,994
- Okay sir, the dialysis room is over here.
- Thank you.

374
00:38:32,994 --> 00:38:35,287
- Come.
- Thank you.

375
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:38,457
You alright?

376
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:41,919
Relax, it won't take long.

377
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:46,173
Mama, I’ll wait here.

378
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:49,493
- We’ll just be here outside.
- Okay. We’ll go in now.

379
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:27,741
You’ll just keep playing that?

380
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:29,589
You’re not a child anymore.

381
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:34,837
You know, ‘Poy, I’ve
been looking for a job.

382
00:39:34,985 --> 00:39:36,653
I’m just not lucky, that’s all.

383
00:39:42,706 --> 00:39:45,542
You know I also need your help.

384
00:39:46,598 --> 00:39:49,601
I can't do everything by myself.

385
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:55,034
Just because you have money
and you shoulder everything?

386
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,936
You think you're better than me?

387
00:40:33,072 --> 00:40:34,698
Buddies,

388
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,410
looks like we’ll have some clarity

389
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,037
about last night’s case.

390
00:40:48,566 --> 00:40:49,855
So we can...

391
00:40:50,808 --> 00:40:52,191
prepare accordingly.

392
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:55,261
We can fix what we need to do.

393
00:40:56,107 --> 00:40:57,942
Boss, the police are there.

394
00:40:58,047 --> 00:40:59,090
Is that so?

395
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:01,298
I’ll take care of it.

396
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:05,898
Hey boss!

397
00:41:06,452 --> 00:41:09,545
- Sir! Good day to you.
- Good afternoon.

398
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:12,987
We came to invite you to the station.

399
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:17,992
Regarding what happened
at the hotel last night.

400
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,452
Oh, at the hotel.

401
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:26,166
Okay, I’ll go to your office.

402
00:41:26,622 --> 00:41:30,542
Alright, sir.
We will wait for you there.

403
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:34,884
- I’ll give you my calling card.
- Okay, sir. We’d appreciate that.

404
00:41:36,302 --> 00:41:38,846
You can reach me there, okay?

405
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:39,871
Thank you, sir.

406
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:43,017
- We’ll wait for you.
- Okay.

407
00:41:44,351 --> 00:41:45,352
Thank you, sir.

408
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:10,502
Hello.

409
00:42:10,745 --> 00:42:11,788
Hello, General!

410
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:13,646
How are you, boss?

411
00:42:15,424 --> 00:42:21,180
Your boys paid me a visit.
Maybe you can talk to them.

412
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:24,657
What trouble did you get into?

413
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:27,358
They want me in for questioning.

414
00:42:29,188 --> 00:42:31,815
I hope we can settle this quietly.

415
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:35,945
Ten million.

416
00:42:35,945 --> 00:42:39,990
Where will I get ten million?

417
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,076
You know I don't get that much.

418
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:43,953
The guy you killed, he’s no small fry.

419
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:46,789
Why? What happened?

420
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,096
Find a way if you want to get out of this.

421
00:43:00,957 --> 00:43:03,049
Please, general.

422
00:43:16,975 --> 00:43:18,822
Produce ten million.

423
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:22,233
Sir, how about...

424
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:25,744
five million?

425
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:37,439
Okay then, let’s settle this.

426
00:43:37,464 --> 00:43:39,133
Fucking bastard.

427
00:43:40,634 --> 00:43:42,720
Motherfucker.

428
00:43:48,984 --> 00:43:52,237
That fucking American we hit.

429
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,796
I didn’t know he’s fucking big-time.

430
00:44:00,034 --> 00:44:01,034
So unlucky.

431
00:44:02,304 --> 00:44:06,902
The general’s asking
for a lot or he won’t help.

432
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:10,513
We need to raise a ton of cash.

433
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,833
As soon as possible.

434
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:15,002
It's stressing me out.

435
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:20,340
When I say ‘lock’,
you lock it in, okay?

436
00:44:20,963 --> 00:44:26,603
Yes, babe, don’t you trust me?

437
00:44:28,035 --> 00:44:29,453
Of course I do.

438
00:44:31,698 --> 00:44:34,079
Come on, let's dance!

439
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:37,174
Let’s dance, come on!

440
00:44:43,822 --> 00:44:46,408
- Come on, babe.
- I’m tired.

441
00:44:46,408 --> 00:44:47,451
Please.

442
00:44:48,243 --> 00:44:49,243
Poy!

443
00:44:50,118 --> 00:44:51,662
Dance with her.

444
00:44:51,687 --> 00:44:53,313
Go.

445
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:59,838
We’ll recover.
Let’s make money!

446
00:47:11,141 --> 00:47:12,450
Show cards.

447
00:47:13,972 --> 00:47:15,766
Lock it in.

448
00:47:15,947 --> 00:47:17,825
Show cards.

449
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,458
You're all trumped! I win!

450
00:47:24,297 --> 00:47:25,507
This is a winner.

451
00:47:25,532 --> 00:47:26,825
We go double?

452
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:28,896
Alright.

453
00:47:32,032 --> 00:47:34,743
I thought you meant I brought you luck.

454
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:38,302
Let's do this!

455
00:47:38,634 --> 00:47:40,529
How much?

456
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:44,192
How much?

457
00:47:45,266 --> 00:47:46,893
I beat you all.

458
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:49,583
Wow.

459
00:47:53,735 --> 00:47:56,865
Aren’t you special?

460
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:14,158
More!

461
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,997
Yes, master.

462
00:48:18,748 --> 00:48:21,497
Show cards.

463
00:48:24,419 --> 00:48:27,638
I won!

464
00:48:28,117 --> 00:48:29,535
My luck’s bad today.

465
00:48:30,537 --> 00:48:31,737
I'm so unlucky.

466
00:48:32,724 --> 00:48:34,099
That's good, boss.

467
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:38,786
One more.

468
00:48:39,602 --> 00:48:40,770
Show cards.

469
00:48:41,411 --> 00:48:45,779
Boss, the other girl in the table...

470
00:48:49,232 --> 00:48:51,068
You're crazy, man.

471
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,646
Five million six hundred
seventy-five thousand.

472
00:49:10,154 --> 00:49:13,654
- More?
- Yes, master.

473
00:49:15,277 --> 00:49:20,691
Yes, yes, more!

474
00:49:25,187 --> 00:49:27,397
I won again!

475
00:49:45,003 --> 00:49:48,810
Show cards.

476
00:49:48,835 --> 00:49:51,300
I won!

477
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:56,744
Flushes, full!
Give me all your money!

478
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:01,431
- My cards are bad.
- I shouldn’t have come today.

479
00:50:03,264 --> 00:50:06,533
You want more?

480
00:50:08,029 --> 00:50:09,736
Show cards.

481
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,859
Double full house.

482
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,978
I beat you all.

483
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,635
Here. That’s one forty thousand.

484
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,887
Already took my cut and the boys’ too.

485
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:41,887
Okay.

486
00:50:43,387 --> 00:50:46,440
Automatic.

487
00:51:19,718 --> 00:51:22,262
Okay, that’s great.

488
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,266
That’s nice.

489
00:51:29,769 --> 00:51:30,979
Something new.

490
00:51:57,090 --> 00:52:00,746
You like that?

491
00:52:01,472 --> 00:52:02,894
You like that?

492
00:52:21,676 --> 00:52:23,004
So?

493
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:26,527
You want some more?

494
00:52:43,534 --> 00:52:45,355
Keep doing it.

495
00:53:07,075 --> 00:53:08,076
Who’s that?

496
00:53:08,577 --> 00:53:09,786
The general.

497
00:53:11,871 --> 00:53:13,707
I have to take the call.

498
00:53:17,502 --> 00:53:19,629
Hello, general.

499
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:20,654
Boss?

500
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:24,691
Yes sir. Agreed.

501
00:53:25,844 --> 00:53:29,306
I love you, general!

502
00:53:31,057 --> 00:53:32,851
Fuck!

503
00:53:41,707 --> 00:53:42,833
Show cards!

504
00:53:47,115 --> 00:53:49,676
Four aces.

505
00:53:50,201 --> 00:53:54,623
Royal flush! Give me your money!

506
00:53:55,885 --> 00:53:58,763
I’ll go to the CR,
somebody take my seat.

507
00:54:02,015 --> 00:54:03,850
Don’t go home.

508
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:06,009
You might not return that to us.

509
00:54:08,094 --> 00:54:09,304
It's my turn.

510
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:14,017
The women have all the luck tonight.

511
00:54:15,793 --> 00:54:19,731
Follow her.
Tell her I have a proposal.

512
00:54:19,817 --> 00:54:21,856
A good one.

513
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:26,256
Miss, you played well earlier.

514
00:55:27,173 --> 00:55:29,884
Depends...

515
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,556
Where’s Mika?

516
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,180
I must tell you something.

517
00:57:40,265 --> 00:57:43,393
- What is it?
- My boss wants to get acquainted with you.

518
00:57:43,713 --> 00:57:45,340
Are you tight with them?

519
00:57:45,645 --> 00:57:46,855
Of course.

520
00:57:47,647 --> 00:57:52,735
Can we meet at Z Bar?

521
00:57:53,211 --> 00:57:55,296
- The Z Bar?
- Yes.

522
00:57:55,321 --> 00:57:58,032
Sure. Make sure you’re there.

523
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,058
Yes.

524
00:57:59,492 --> 00:58:00,910
Thank you.

525
00:59:00,194 --> 00:59:02,947
- What’s your problem?
- What took you so long?

526
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:05,391
Can’t you see I’m taking a dump?

527
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,144
Get out of my way!

528
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,377
Don't feel bad.

529
00:59:45,438 --> 00:59:48,233
That woman is a fucking good hustler.

530
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:54,023
But, you’re better.

531
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:55,858
Really?

532
00:59:56,145 --> 00:59:57,480
Of course.

533
01:00:50,256 --> 01:00:52,607
Put it in.

534
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,474
You feel so good.

535
01:01:01,966 --> 01:01:03,957
You feel so good.

536
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:56,708
Looking for my boss?

537
01:01:59,736 --> 01:02:02,215
- Has he been waiting long?
- Pretty much.

538
01:02:02,966 --> 01:02:03,966
Boss.

539
01:02:05,887 --> 01:02:08,225
Hey. How are you?

540
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,739
Come here, have a seat.

541
01:02:10,512 --> 01:02:14,539
Fuck, what’s that woman doing here?

542
01:02:14,914 --> 01:02:15,915
Just listen.

543
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:21,254
- Mika!
- How are you?

544
01:02:22,152 --> 01:02:26,147
This is what I need.

545
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,096
Join our group.

546
01:02:30,448 --> 01:02:32,575
I know how you work.

547
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:34,475
I'm a hustler, too.

548
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,638
Come on. I'll pay you big money.

549
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:50,756
Everybody’s happy here. Come on!

550
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:09,861
I want twenty-five thousand
every time we play.

551
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:12,114
No questions asked.

552
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:15,266
Anyone got a problem with that?

553
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:21,657
Are we okay with
giving her twenty-five thousand?

554
01:03:22,705 --> 01:03:24,916
We are okay with
twenty-five thousand pesos.

555
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:27,612
Okay, no problem.

556
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:33,284
Cheers to twenty-five thousand.

557
01:03:33,784 --> 01:03:36,787
For the new member of the group!

558
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:44,921
Annoying.

559
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:51,219
Why do you look so down?

560
01:03:52,511 --> 01:03:57,308
Why’s her cut bigger?

561
01:03:58,017 --> 01:04:01,604
Xandra, I need Mika.
We need her.

562
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:02,629
Why?

563
01:04:04,304 --> 01:04:06,871
Because I need money for the general.

564
01:04:07,013 --> 01:04:08,306
If I don’t get it,

565
01:04:08,861 --> 01:04:10,446
I’m in serious trouble.

566
01:04:10,988 --> 01:04:13,157
You just met her.

567
01:04:13,739 --> 01:04:16,283
While I’ve been here
a long time with you.

568
01:04:16,717 --> 01:04:19,879
So I planted and did the hard work,

569
01:04:19,973 --> 01:04:22,375
but someone else reaps it?

570
01:04:24,473 --> 01:04:25,836
Really, Rodolfo.

571
01:04:29,757 --> 01:04:31,384
I know you’re jealous.

572
01:04:32,353 --> 01:04:33,479
Don’t be.

573
01:04:34,053 --> 01:04:35,346
You know me.

574
01:04:46,769 --> 01:04:48,687
I’ll just pay the general.

575
01:04:50,027 --> 01:04:52,238
Things will go back to normal.

576
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:54,573
I promise.

577
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:56,742
Believe me.

578
01:05:00,413 --> 01:05:02,707
I’m not in the mood.

579
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:08,421
I’ll make it up to you.

580
01:05:10,631 --> 01:05:11,841
Just this time.

581
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:14,952
After that I’ll send that girl away.

582
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:19,098
She’s so small next to you.

583
01:05:19,174 --> 01:05:20,466
See her legs?

584
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:21,851
Too short.

585
01:05:24,165 --> 01:05:25,165
Come on.

586
01:05:29,817 --> 01:05:33,051
I’ll make it up to you.

587
01:05:33,482 --> 01:05:35,192
You’re ready, aren’t you?

588
01:05:37,883 --> 01:05:39,885
I’m not in the mood.

589
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:41,662
You'll come around.

590
01:05:41,829 --> 01:05:44,123
I don’t want to.

591
01:05:44,915 --> 01:05:47,542
You don’t feel like it? Wait.

592
01:05:47,846 --> 01:05:49,431
You want to get back at me?

593
01:05:49,456 --> 01:05:52,292
Release your anger? Come.

594
01:05:53,177 --> 01:05:55,971
Punish me.

595
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,377
Do whatever you want.

596
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:00,720
Go ahead.

597
01:06:03,434 --> 01:06:06,605
Eat me too.

598
01:06:08,509 --> 01:06:12,430
You want to chew on it?
Bite it? Anything!

599
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:20,910
Eat your own dick.

600
01:06:21,327 --> 01:06:23,579
You motherfucker.

601
01:06:28,378 --> 01:06:34,382
Hey! Wait! Fuck it!

602
01:06:35,886 --> 01:06:37,534
Wait!

603
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:38,559
Hey!

604
01:06:39,035 --> 01:06:41,097
Fuck!

605
01:06:59,836 --> 01:07:01,338
How’s it going, Rodolfo?

606
01:07:02,287 --> 01:07:04,081
Hello, general.

607
01:07:06,951 --> 01:07:09,453
Where’s my money?

608
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,460
What?

609
01:07:13,087 --> 01:07:14,380
Where's the money?

610
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,674
You're taking too long.

611
01:07:17,355 --> 01:07:19,155
You won't have enough time.

612
01:07:37,738 --> 01:07:42,160
Your hands are really quick.

613
01:07:42,185 --> 01:07:44,229
You impress me.

614
01:07:45,492 --> 01:07:47,927
Where did you learn?

615
01:07:47,952 --> 01:07:49,245
How old are you now?

616
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,308
Twenty-three.

617
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,334
You’re still young.

618
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,779
You'll get even better.

619
01:07:58,716 --> 01:08:02,303
You know there's
something better than this.

620
01:08:03,137 --> 01:08:06,121
I have another mansion, you know.

621
01:08:06,589 --> 01:08:08,589
I'll bring you there sometime.

622
01:08:10,917 --> 01:08:12,597
You'll tour me there?

623
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:14,689
Yeah, I'll tour you everywhere.

624
01:08:20,613 --> 01:08:23,215
What’s this, hey?

625
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,972
We’re talking business.

626
01:08:24,997 --> 01:08:25,951
Just a meeting.

627
01:08:25,976 --> 01:08:28,229
- Ah business?
- Yes.

628
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:31,557
Business? I know you!

629
01:08:31,582 --> 01:08:33,042
This is business, the two of you?

630
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,361
- You’re so sweet to each other!
- Don’t get jealous.

631
01:08:35,386 --> 01:08:37,630
Wait a second.

632
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,050
What do I care about you two?
This is your problem.

633
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:41,817
Don’t drag me into your affair.

634
01:08:41,842 --> 01:08:44,970
You have the nerve to talk to me?

635
01:08:44,995 --> 01:08:46,572
Just relax.

636
01:08:46,597 --> 01:08:49,450
Let go of me! Son of a bitch!

637
01:08:49,475 --> 01:08:50,726
What’s she to you?

638
01:08:51,243 --> 01:08:52,995
Just a business partner, I told you.

639
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:56,482
Go away! Take her outside.

640
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:59,677
Fuck you! You treat me
like this after using me?

641
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:01,046
Madam, let's go.

642
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:03,197
She’s the one who should go, not me!

643
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:04,902
Why’s he sending me away?

644
01:09:04,927 --> 01:09:07,113
Madam, calm down.

645
01:09:11,988 --> 01:09:14,041
Who the fuck’s she?
Shameless bitch.

646
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:19,496
Just relax.

647
01:09:20,607 --> 01:09:22,234
Let go of me.

648
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:26,178
- Go with them. It’s for the best.
- Let’s talk this over.

649
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:29,790
- This is for your own good.
- I'll change.

650
01:09:30,285 --> 01:09:32,284
Let me go!

651
01:09:32,309 --> 01:09:33,727
Just trust us.

652
01:09:34,978 --> 01:09:40,125
Pa, let’s talk it over.
I’ll change, I swear it!

653
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:46,407
- We will visit you, okay?
- We’ll visit you soon Marie, don’t worry.

654
01:09:46,946 --> 01:09:48,198
Wait.

655
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:51,996
- Go with them.
- Let go of me.

656
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,839
Ma!

657
01:09:59,389 --> 01:10:00,932
That’s just how it is.

658
01:10:01,143 --> 01:10:03,519
Better we do this than
to lose her completely.

659
01:10:04,995 --> 01:10:06,705
We just have to do this.

660
01:10:07,344 --> 01:10:13,392
I want to go home!
This is their fault!

661
01:10:35,136 --> 01:10:37,975
- Always listen to us.
- Yes, Papa.

662
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,919
Always listen to Grandpa, okay?

663
01:10:43,396 --> 01:10:46,649
- Very good. Study hard, okay?
- I will.

664
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:54,516
- I love you.
- I love you, Papa.

665
01:11:56,161 --> 01:11:57,371
Hello, general.

666
01:11:58,997 --> 01:12:01,542
Rodolfo. Time’s up.

667
01:12:01,834 --> 01:12:03,335
You’re on your own now.

668
01:12:04,545 --> 01:12:05,838
Yes, sir.

669
01:12:40,635 --> 01:12:42,303
Will he be here later?

670
01:12:42,668 --> 01:12:44,712
There he is.

671
01:12:56,003 --> 01:13:01,160
Sirs, what can I do for you?

672
01:13:01,185 --> 01:13:03,103
- Good afternoon.
- Sir.

673
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:05,297
You seem to have forgotten our boss.

674
01:13:05,897 --> 01:13:07,106
You think so?

675
01:13:07,131 --> 01:13:11,320
Please tell him I’m sorry.
I got quite busy.

676
01:13:13,072 --> 01:13:15,616
Maybe you should halt
your operations for now.

677
01:13:17,743 --> 01:13:19,808
Okay. I’ll fix everything.

678
01:13:20,902 --> 01:13:22,915
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.

679
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:26,710
We’ll count on you.

680
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:35,761
What the fuck.

681
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:38,424
You heard them.

682
01:13:38,587 --> 01:13:40,630
We’ll stop this for now.

683
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:47,940
Close shop.
Secure the place.

684
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,508
Let’s move.

685
01:14:21,598 --> 01:14:24,726
- Can you please go inside right now?
- Who’s that?

686
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:28,063
- No one.
- Who's that?

687
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:30,607
- Just someone from work.
- No, I’ll stay here.

688
01:14:30,607 --> 01:14:33,110
Who’s that woman?

689
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:35,237
Don’t mind it.
What are you doing here?

690
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:37,948
- What were you trying to do?
- Calm down.

691
01:14:37,948 --> 01:14:41,743
- You think you can treat me like that?
- Calm down.

692
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:43,537
We shall talk right now.

693
01:14:43,537 --> 01:14:47,166
- Let’s talk at the other house, okay?
- We talk here and now!

694
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:51,461
- Who is this bitch?
- Nobody, just a business partner.

695
01:14:51,461 --> 01:14:54,256
Business partner?
Why’s she storming here?

696
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:56,800
Because I haven’t
completely given her share.

697
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,928
- I’ll give it to you later!
- I will get my share right now!

698
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:02,931
- Who’s this woman?
- Who am I?

699
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:05,726
Your husband gets
his money through me.

700
01:15:05,726 --> 01:15:08,395
And he gets his pleasure from me.

701
01:15:08,395 --> 01:15:12,733
- You fucking whore!
- No, no! She’s not my whore!

702
01:15:12,733 --> 01:15:16,862
- Go home, for God’s sake!
- Why’d you bring your whore here?

703
01:15:16,862 --> 01:15:19,406
Don’t you ever show yourself here!

704
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:22,351
- Let’s go inside.
- Why did you let that come to the house?!

705
01:15:22,676 --> 01:15:26,138
- She’s from work, not a slut.
- Who’s this whore, Rudy?

706
01:15:26,163 --> 01:15:29,124
- Can you please listen to me?
- Fuck that!

707
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:31,401
You assholes!
Fuck the two of you!

708
01:15:37,591 --> 01:15:41,303
Good news, the doctor called.

709
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:43,098
What did she say?

710
01:15:43,388 --> 01:15:44,932
They found a donor.

711
01:15:54,358 --> 01:15:55,901
- Ma.
- Yes?

712
01:15:57,194 --> 01:15:59,488
We’ll take you to the doctor soon, okay?

713
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:01,033
No need.

714
01:16:02,049 --> 01:16:04,134
I'll always stay by your side.

715
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:05,786
Get your strength back.

716
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:07,412
Thank you, son.

717
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:10,473
Papa and I will make
sure you get well again.

718
01:16:12,376 --> 01:16:16,129
Hang in there, Ma.

719
01:16:23,428 --> 01:16:24,805
Wait here, Pa.

720
01:17:20,481 --> 01:17:21,611
Hello.

721
01:17:21,927 --> 01:17:24,471
Popoy, let’s talk.

722
01:17:29,828 --> 01:17:32,039
Sure.

723
01:17:34,666 --> 01:17:36,293
I’ll wait for you around the corner.

724
01:17:59,149 --> 01:18:00,776
I’ll go somewhere for a while, okay?

725
01:18:46,082 --> 01:18:47,291
What is it, madam?

726
01:18:49,426 --> 01:18:52,494
That fucking Rodolfo.

727
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,081
Asshole.

728
01:19:00,377 --> 01:19:01,377
Why?

729
01:19:01,795 --> 01:19:04,047
He’s your boss too, right?

730
01:19:04,381 --> 01:19:05,966
We serve the same master.

731
01:19:09,483 --> 01:19:12,611
Every penny he has, I earned it too.

732
01:19:13,478 --> 01:19:17,315
Just because he met that pink-haired bitch.

733
01:19:24,568 --> 01:19:26,528
I know the code to his vault.

734
01:19:32,659 --> 01:19:37,664
We can get everything in it.

735
01:19:43,719 --> 01:19:50,293
Madam, our boss has a lot of money, right?

736
01:19:51,443 --> 01:19:55,254
Of course there are CCTVs all around.

737
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:59,035
What you are asking me
is very dangerous.

738
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:01,229
You know everybody there. Right?

739
01:20:05,921 --> 01:20:09,800
I know you can do it.

740
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:13,909
Are you in?

741
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:23,835
Come on, help me out please.

742
01:22:35,675 --> 01:22:40,680
Be careful with this boy of yours,
he’s probably more cunning than you.

743
01:22:41,772 --> 01:22:44,621
I don’t think so.

744
01:22:45,435 --> 01:22:48,980
He still has much to learn.

745
01:23:18,469 --> 01:23:21,312
So, how's your business, by the way?

746
01:23:51,751 --> 01:23:52,919
Show cards.

747
01:23:54,254 --> 01:23:55,254
Nasty.

748
01:23:56,817 --> 01:23:58,903
I won.

749
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:02,137
Lucky...

750
01:24:40,592 --> 01:24:42,116
Good evening, boss.

751
01:24:42,656 --> 01:24:44,334
Good evening, Bogs.

752
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:46,639
Get a haircut.

753
01:25:01,956 --> 01:25:04,632
Alright, boss.

754
01:25:04,657 --> 01:25:07,600
- I’ll just get coffee.
- Okay.

755
01:25:17,434 --> 01:25:19,269
I'm ready.

756
01:25:19,733 --> 01:25:21,256
Come in.

757
01:25:23,553 --> 01:25:25,389
Feel at home, have a seat.

758
01:25:50,495 --> 01:25:51,663
Is this all?

759
01:25:52,429 --> 01:25:54,515
You got a big cut, right?

760
01:25:55,148 --> 01:25:56,374
Don't worry.

761
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:59,319
I'll add more next time.

762
01:26:00,554 --> 01:26:02,687
Especially if you're consistent.

763
01:26:16,307 --> 01:26:20,358
Hey, Bro.
What are you doing here?

764
01:26:20,358 --> 01:26:24,779
I saw someone running
outside the gate a while ago.

765
01:26:24,804 --> 01:26:27,348
Maybe that’s the guy spying on the boss.

766
01:26:29,634 --> 01:26:31,052
I don’t see anything.

767
01:26:31,077 --> 01:26:33,204
I’m sure I saw someone.

768
01:26:35,415 --> 01:26:38,543
Have you eaten?
Have some food first. I’ll take care of it.

769
01:26:38,543 --> 01:26:39,752
Okay.

770
01:26:40,753 --> 01:26:43,756
We have to be careful.

771
01:27:09,407 --> 01:27:10,408
Bend over.

772
01:27:10,927 --> 01:27:11,928
Bend over?

773
01:27:11,953 --> 01:27:14,623
- Yes.
- We didn’t agree on this.

774
01:27:15,182 --> 01:27:16,956
Fuck it.

775
01:27:17,916 --> 01:27:18,916
Okay then.

776
01:27:32,972 --> 01:27:37,260
If you do a good job, I’ll give you more.

777
01:28:12,634 --> 01:28:15,368
Next time, I'll add more money.

778
01:28:16,564 --> 01:28:20,306
In an instant, I doubled
the money I gave you.

779
01:28:21,072 --> 01:28:22,939
I'll double down on you too.

780
01:28:24,941 --> 01:28:29,362
I’ll stick it in wherever I want.

781
01:28:30,224 --> 01:28:32,907
That okay with you?

782
01:28:36,411 --> 01:28:37,571
As long as you pay well.

783
01:28:38,853 --> 01:28:40,653
That's what I like to hear.

784
01:29:07,483 --> 01:29:12,405
- There. What, are you enjoying it?
- Yes. A lot.

785
01:29:14,157 --> 01:29:17,034
I want you to bark.

786
01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:32,550
Louder!

787
01:29:47,565 --> 01:29:52,153
- Can you take more?
- I can.

788
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:55,531
You sure?

789
01:30:34,695 --> 01:30:41,146
Don’t worry, your husband won’t mind as
long as you give him a nice blowjob later.

790
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:46,825
I already sold my car, you know!

791
01:30:50,935 --> 01:30:52,735
Just make sure to win then!

792
01:31:06,503 --> 01:31:08,130
My lucky charm.

793
01:31:16,654 --> 01:31:18,281
What are you doing here, Banong?

794
01:31:21,237 --> 01:31:23,224
Aren’t you something?

795
01:31:23,536 --> 01:31:25,162
You whore!

796
01:31:29,041 --> 01:31:30,041
Bro.

797
01:31:30,393 --> 01:31:31,769
I’m not talking to you.

798
01:31:31,794 --> 01:31:35,298
- This isn’t your territory, calm down.
- I’m not talking to you.

799
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:36,449
Relax.

800
01:31:36,941 --> 01:31:39,861
Banong, go home before
you get embarrassed here.

801
01:31:39,886 --> 01:31:41,638
You fucker!

802
01:31:43,278 --> 01:31:44,976
Are you challenging me?

803
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:47,560
Piece of advice, bro.

804
01:31:47,692 --> 01:31:51,662
Her pussy’s delicious,
but it’s free for all.

805
01:31:51,687 --> 01:31:55,191
That’s fine with me. I know it’s
delicious, I’ve tasted it too, man.

806
01:31:55,224 --> 01:32:00,631
And I like it so much.

807
01:32:00,656 --> 01:32:03,075
Smells great, brother!

808
01:32:04,368 --> 01:32:06,162
You son of a bitch!

809
01:32:10,666 --> 01:32:12,269
What were you saying?

810
01:32:13,836 --> 01:32:23,304
Want me to blow your brains out?
You motherfucker. Huh?

811
01:32:27,058 --> 01:32:28,225
You...

812
01:32:29,644 --> 01:32:31,687
motherfucker.

813
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:36,567
Boss Rudy, maybe we can talk it out.

814
01:32:36,567 --> 01:32:41,948
Open your mouth! Fucker!

815
01:32:41,948 --> 01:32:44,926
- Boss...
- Open it!

816
01:32:44,951 --> 01:32:46,577
Son of a bitch, open it!

817
01:32:48,287 --> 01:32:49,580
Open!

818
01:32:52,382 --> 01:32:54,350
Suck it!

819
01:32:54,752 --> 01:33:00,758
Take back everything you said.
You son of a bitch!

820
01:33:01,234 --> 01:33:03,010
So what now?

821
01:33:03,302 --> 01:33:10,101
The next time you come here...

822
01:33:10,893 --> 01:33:14,480
come with respect.

823
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,481
Fuck you!

824
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:18,526
Don’t be so cocky.

825
01:33:18,526 --> 01:33:21,487
You don’t know who you’re messing with.

826
01:33:21,604 --> 01:33:25,775
You son of a bitch!
Motherfucker!

827
01:33:26,409 --> 01:33:28,285
Next time huh?

828
01:33:28,828 --> 01:33:30,079
Let’s go.

829
01:33:44,301 --> 01:33:46,344
- Boss.
- Yeah?

830
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:52,643
Time to get your shares.

831
01:33:58,399 --> 01:33:59,399
Thanks, boss.

832
01:34:00,484 --> 01:34:01,819
Thank you, boss.

833
01:34:02,157 --> 01:34:03,180
Thank you, boss.

834
01:34:04,118 --> 01:34:05,118
Here.

835
01:34:08,325 --> 01:34:09,535
Go now.

836
01:34:10,161 --> 01:34:12,496
- Okay boss, thank you.
- Okay.

837
01:34:13,372 --> 01:34:16,726
You’re running out of money
because you’ve a lot of women.

838
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:18,252
Save up, boy!

839
01:34:24,438 --> 01:34:27,366
Hey, Popoy, son.

840
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:30,062
I’ve called the hospital,

841
01:34:30,511 --> 01:34:33,806
they told me the donor’s there.

842
01:34:34,751 --> 01:34:35,710
Okay, Pa.

843
01:34:35,735 --> 01:34:39,614
Just bring Mama to the hospital,
I’ll be there.

844
01:34:40,483 --> 01:34:43,047
We need six hundred fifty thousand.

845
01:34:43,389 --> 01:34:46,461
We need to have that in cash.

846
01:34:47,406 --> 01:34:49,116
I’ll take care of it.

847
01:34:49,867 --> 01:34:50,951
Okay, Pa.

848
01:35:00,377 --> 01:35:03,506
I worked hard to earn that money.

849
01:35:32,534 --> 01:35:35,912
Our Father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

850
01:35:35,937 --> 01:35:40,008
Thy kingdom come thy
will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

851
01:36:58,329 --> 01:37:01,258
Popoy, listen well.

852
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:08,898
You have to look for that small
notebook on top of the vault.

853
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:17,969
The last amount that’s written there,
that’s the code, okay?

854
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:21,060
- Okay, madam.
- Don’t forget.

855
01:37:39,495 --> 01:37:42,873
Don’t you dare fail.

856
01:37:43,832 --> 01:37:45,334
I won’t, madam.

857
01:37:45,751 --> 01:37:46,751
Alright then.

858
01:38:28,502 --> 01:38:30,296
Where’s the boss?

859
01:42:39,795 --> 01:42:40,796
Bro?

860
01:42:44,174 --> 01:42:45,467
Fuck!

861
01:42:46,009 --> 01:42:47,010
What?

862
01:42:47,761 --> 01:42:48,762
How?

863
01:42:51,723 --> 01:42:55,352
Fuck it.
Okay, I’ll be there!

864
01:43:06,655 --> 01:43:07,841
Pa.

865
01:43:09,324 --> 01:43:10,659
The money’s there.

866
01:43:13,287 --> 01:43:15,956
- Alright. I must go.
- Wait, Popoy.

867
01:43:17,499 --> 01:43:18,499
Come.

868
01:43:19,418 --> 01:43:24,756
Whatever it is you’re doing with your life,
just be careful.

869
01:43:25,841 --> 01:43:29,344
I hope that God blesses you
for everything you’re doing.

870
01:43:29,845 --> 01:43:34,099
If I could, I’d do what
you’re doing now.

871
01:43:34,124 --> 01:43:35,434
I’m sorry, son.

872
01:43:37,185 --> 01:43:38,186
It’s okay, Pa.

873
01:44:05,672 --> 01:44:07,799
Rod, fuck it somebody got in the house!

874
01:44:07,824 --> 01:44:11,620
You motherfuckers. Fuck you!

875
01:44:12,429 --> 01:44:14,306
Who did this?

876
01:44:15,176 --> 01:44:18,785
- You didn’t see his face?
- He hit me on the head, I don’t know!

877
01:44:18,810 --> 01:44:21,938
When I woke up the vault was
already open, I have no idea!

878
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:25,734
Is it one of us? Huh?

879
01:44:28,070 --> 01:44:29,321
Fuck it all.

880
01:44:36,411 --> 01:44:39,723
This is where he hit me.
He passed this way.

881
01:44:58,934 --> 01:45:01,144
Fuck!

882
01:45:06,926 --> 01:45:08,902
Who’s your enemy?

883
01:45:09,051 --> 01:45:12,447
Wait, let me think.

884
01:45:13,115 --> 01:45:14,950
Let’s look at that—

885
01:45:15,344 --> 01:45:19,705
I checked it already.
He deleted it.

886
01:45:25,102 --> 01:45:28,438
- Bro, wait.
- Who are you working with?

887
01:45:28,463 --> 01:45:32,175
- Who is it, you motherfucker?
- I’ll never betray you.

888
01:45:39,808 --> 01:45:40,934
Fuck!

889
01:45:48,567 --> 01:45:51,987
Who’s been messing with you?

890
01:46:03,498 --> 01:46:08,795
So I planted and did the hard work,
but someone else reaps it?

891
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,177
You motherfucker,
this is how you treat me after using me?

892
01:46:16,511 --> 01:46:18,930
You bastards! Fuck you two!

893
01:46:55,467 --> 01:46:56,760
Where’s Xandra?

894
01:46:58,428 --> 01:47:00,764
- Who are you?
- Where’s Xandra?!

895
01:47:02,182 --> 01:47:03,558
She’s not here.

896
01:47:27,082 --> 01:47:28,416
Where’s the money?

897
01:47:30,377 --> 01:47:31,878
What money?

898
01:47:32,337 --> 01:47:34,214
Where did you put it?

899
01:47:34,214 --> 01:47:37,300
I don’t know what you’re talking about,
what money?

900
01:47:39,678 --> 01:47:40,971
Tell me the truth.

901
01:47:41,012 --> 01:47:43,557
I don’t know anything! Rodolfo!

902
01:47:43,557 --> 01:47:46,434
- Tell me where it is.
- I don’t know anything!

903
01:47:46,434 --> 01:47:49,646
- Give it to me!
- What money?

904
01:47:51,064 --> 01:47:52,482
Give it back.

905
01:47:53,775 --> 01:47:55,277
Who are you?!

906
01:47:55,402 --> 01:47:58,947
Shut the fuck up!
Don’t try to interfere!

907
01:47:58,947 --> 01:48:00,407
Don't hurt them.

908
01:48:01,366 --> 01:48:04,119
I will forgive you.

909
01:48:04,411 --> 01:48:07,581
Just tell me where my money is.

910
01:48:08,081 --> 01:48:10,083
Where’s my money?!

911
01:48:10,333 --> 01:48:11,918
Popoy has it!

912
01:48:17,892 --> 01:48:19,102
Xandra!

913
01:48:24,264 --> 01:48:25,765
You monster!

914
01:48:26,527 --> 01:48:27,527
Damn bitch.

915
01:49:15,482 --> 01:49:21,363
As you know, your Mother’s
kidney transplant was successful.

916
01:49:21,363 --> 01:49:25,116
But sad to say, her body
layer rejected the new kidney.

917
