If we have both Tae Rae and Woong Ki on our team,

700
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,430
would I be able to get any of the parts?

701
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,730
We'll vote for Sub-vocal 1 position.

702

[The killing part acts as the main character who leads the story told by the song]

[The killing part is expected have fierce competition.]

719

I've never gotten to do the killing part before.

720
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,570
So I thought it would be good

721
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,930
if I could show off this stage with a new concept

722
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,080
as the killing part, so I volunteered.

my hidden confidence.

735
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,440

I have something to tell you.

746
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,850
First, our goal for today is to finish verse 1.

747
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,670
I managed to learn to a certain degree

748
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,360
the choreography and the formation,

749
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,110
so I think we can practice up to verse 1.

750
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,210
What's important is

751
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,190
being on time.

752
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,440
Being on time.

753
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,780
Everyone must be on time for the practice time.

754
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,650
I'm thinking that if anyone's late,

755
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,530
they should come in early the next day

756
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,610
by the amount that they're late by.

757
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:06,020
So everyone, please make sure you come on time.

758
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,060
Since he has experience

working as a dance instructor,

760
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,640

764

[The choreo is more difficult than expected]

770

00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,840
He's such a good leader.

772

773

Come on, I can't give him a 100.

774
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,030
I'll give him 90 points.

Hyung, you want to try it once?

776
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,920

The power is good,

778
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,900
but you should lean back a bit diagonally, Hyung.

779
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,380
Yeah, it's like that.

780
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,590

a bit more cute and bubbly, and it fit them more.

810

811

he want to lead.

I'm grateful that he wants to help,

817
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,790
but my style is to have people learn the overall flow and image of the choreo

818
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,810
before moving onto the details.

819
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,190

It's important to learn the details,

but I think we should focus on getting the overall feel for the choreo first.

836

Since we need to work on rotations today,

837
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,850

I questioned if I could pull it off.

This is too difficult.

1250
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:10,280
As much as this Artist Battle is a mission where we need to show our artistic abilities,

1251
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:11,760
it also requires arrangement,

1252

and changing the choreography,

1258
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:29,230
what matters most

1259
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:32,650
is if we can properly

1260
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,460
complete the performance.

1261
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,830

so we might be able to show them a wonderful performance.

1269
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,710
We still have a long way to go,

1270

but we each have our own charms.

1271
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,450
And if we work together, we'll create a synergy effect,

1272
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:55,600
and put on a good performance.

I went on BOYS PLANET to perform that song

1406

Kong's Korean is amazing.

1434

If I were a Star Creator,

1508

would I vote for an idol in his 30s?

1509

1574
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:16,340
I'm really nervous.

1575
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,420
Will they announce us first?

1576
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,240
[Ma Jing Xiang is extremely nervous]

1577
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,990
You want to hold hands?

1578
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:29,060
Before I announce the position of the first survivor,

1579
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:33,230
I will announce the rank that star creators around the world are most curious about.

1580
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:35,350
[The rank that everyone's most curious about?]

1581
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:39,190
That is, the candidates for 28th place, who will survive at the cutoff.

1582
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:40,540
What?

1583
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,360
What! Candidates?

1584
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,440
Right away?

1585
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,550
Already?

1586
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:47,410
This is too much.

1587
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:48,660
I just got goosebumps.

1588
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:52,740
Who will survive in 28th place, and get to perform on the next stage?

1589
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:56,580
I will announce the three trainees who are candidates for 28th place.

1590
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:58,470
Gosh, seriously.

1591
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:01,350
[Who will be the candidates who are at the cutoff for survival?]

1592
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:05,120
My god...

1593
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:08,450
Please!

1594
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:11,060
- Where is Park Ji Hoo?
- Why are you looking for me?

1595
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:13,450
There are so many trainees that are ranked higher than me.

1596
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:16,250
Please save my Yun Seo.

1597
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:18,560
[You should smile]

1598
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,660
There must be many trainees who hope they are not called right now.

1599
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:23,610
- Right.
- If you get called right now, it's really dangerous.

1600
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:25,390
If you get called, then you'll feel so anxious.

1601
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:28,150
- Please...
- Both Jeong Hyeon and Jung Hyun might get called.

1602
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:31,560
I'm scared, seriously.

1603
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,570
Whoa. Wow.

1604
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:39,400
[Candidates for 28th place based on the intermediate vote count at 1 a.m. (KST) on March 17th.]

1605
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,150
Based on the count at 1 a.m.?

1606
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:43,010
It's based on the count at 1 a.m.?

1607
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:45,370
Then things could have changed since then.

1608
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:47,980
Since the voting ended at 10 a.m., things could have changed.

1609
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:50,650
My heart hearts.

1610
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,130
Please, please, please.

1611
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:54,670
We will show who it is!

1612
01:14:56,850 --> 01:14:58,320
Oh!

1613
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,410
[Ma Jing Xiang, Mun Jung Hyun, Cha Woong Ki]

1614
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:02,950
Oh!

1615
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:04,440
Wow, it's Woong Ki hyung!

1616
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,030
Woah, it's Woong Ki hyung!

1617
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:07,660
Oh!

1618
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:09,740
[The three candidates see themselves on the screen]

1619
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:12,490
Is it me? It's me!

1620
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:14,190
Ma Jing Xiang is there!

1621
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:15,740
He's there.

1622
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:17,210
Ma Jing Xiang is there too.

1623
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:20,050
Woong Ki, Ma Jing Xiang, Mun Jung Hyun.

1624
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:23,080
Woong Ki hyung was really anxious until yesterday.

1625
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:27,410
[28th place candidate Cha Woong Ki was ranked 34th in Week 6.]

1626
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:30,150
[28th place candidate Mun Jung Hyun was ranked 30th in Week 6.]

1627
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:33,530
[28th place candidate Ma Jing Xiang was ranked 28th in Week 6.]

1628
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:35,830
[Broke out crying with the hope that he might survive]

1629
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:37,550
The candidates for 28th place are

1630
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:42,980
Trainees Ma Jing Xiang, Mun Jung Hyun, and Cha Woong Ki.

1631
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:47,280
However, these candidates are not based on the final voting results,

1632
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:52,280
but on the intermediate voting results taken 9 hours before the second round of voting ended.

1633
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:56,280
After episode 7 aired, the rankings changed a lot in one day.

1634
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:59,720
That means that the final results could very well be different.

1635
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:03,240
The results can change with 9 more hours of voting.

1636
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:07,100
Does that mean that I can maintain hope?

1637
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:11,030
[Will the candidates for 28th place stay the same for the final results?]

1638
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:15,060
I will announce the position for the first survivor.

1639
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:17,370
Please let it not be our position!

1640
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:19,710
I feel like I'll go nuts. I'm so nervous.

1641
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:22,800
The position for which I will announce the first survivor is...

1642
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:27,020
Vocal & Dance position.

1643
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:29,250

"Love Killa" Team, "Butterfly" Team, and "Home" Team, please come up as well.

1649
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:50,770
They really started this with a bang.

1650
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:54,100
The Vocal & Dance position expressed their colors well

1651
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:58,830
by arranging the song and making the choreography.

1652
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:02,120
[Vocal & Dance position: "Feel Special" Team, "Home" Team, "Butterfly" Team]

1653

And "Love Killa" Team, which had three Top 9 trainees,

1654
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:08,870
received the benefit as the first place team.

1655
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:11,590
Among the 14 trainees that were a part of the Vocal & Dance position,

1656
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:14,420
how many will receive a survivor's seat?

1657
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:18,690
I will announce the survivor results

1658
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:23,340
excluding the eleven Top 9 candidates and the 28th place trainee.

1659
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,080
I'm so nervous.

1660
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,930
The first trainee to sit on a survivor's seat

1661
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:31,350
received the highest rank within Vocal & Dance position.

1662
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:34,010
I feel like it will be in the top 15.

1663
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:35,830
It's the 12th place trainee.

1664
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:38,070
It's the 12th place trainee.

1665

Wow, there's someone in 12th place?

1666

Jong Woo hyung.

1667
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:44,480
I feel like it will be Jong Woo hyung or Seo Won hyung.

1668
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,120
- Seung Eon hyung.
- Seung Eon?

1669
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,860
There's also Seung Eon.

1670
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:54,560
Whoever was in 12th place ranked up quite a bit.

1671
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,680
Last time, Ricky hyung was 12th place.

1672
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,520
Then Ricky is not in 12th place anymore?

1673
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,350
- I probably fell off a bit.
- Top 9?

1674
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:02,060
No, I fell off.

1675
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:03,760
1st place, 1st place?

1676
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:04,910
11th place?

1677
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:06,380
I fell off.

1678
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:08,780
The first trainee to be announced in 12th place

1679
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:12,260
has never gotten 12th place before.

1680
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:14,610
Isn't it possible that someone from Top 9 fell off?

1681
01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:17,000
That would mean it's Matthew hyung, Ji Woong hyung, or Gyu Vin.

1682
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,160
Anything can happen.

1683
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:23,270
The team that the new 12th place trainee was part of was

1684
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:24,700
"Home" Team.

1685
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,790
"Home" Team.

1686
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:29,660
Wow.

1687
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:32,440
It could be Seung Eon.

1688
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,170
Seung Eon did well during the "Home" performance.

1689
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:39,690
[Yoo Seung Eon proved his vocal skills again by showing off his refreshing high notes]

1690
01:18:39,690 --> 01:18:41,980
If it's Jong Woo hyung, that would be legendary.

1691
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:44,660
Jong Woo hyung was on a major upward trend.

1692
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,440
[Survived by ranking up 29 spots.]

1693
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:50,300
He managed to survive by climbing 29 steps.

1694
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:53,370
[His skills were recognized through his performance of "Back Door"]

1695
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:55,830
And received first place on his team for the "Home" stage.

1696
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:57,090
It could be Jay hyung.

1697
01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:59,130
Jay hyung.
- But isn't Jay hyung part of the Top 9?

1698
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:00,780
No way...

1699
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:01,930
It could be Jay?

1700
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:06,640
You received a great gift from Star Creators and got 9th place.

1701
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,630
[On every stage, Jay consistently demonstrated stable vocals]

1702
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,380
12th place... That's daebak.

1703
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:16,980
The trainee in 12th place is...

1704

- Jay!
- Whoa...

H-H-He dropped...

1707
01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:34,920
As expected, as expected.

1708
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,110
You did well.

1709
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:39,260
You worked so hard.

1710
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:41,480
[Jay walks over to the survivor's seats]

1711
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,340
The Top 9 changed.

1712
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,140
Why did Jay drop off so much?

1713
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:49,840
Jay dropped 3 spots and ended up in 12th place.

1714
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,810
Although his rank dropped a bit, he continues to be ranked high.

1715
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:55,740
- He must be disappointed.
-But it's still pretty high.

1716
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:58,120
It's not over until it's over.

1717
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:02,330
By working hard and doing my best for the next performance,

1718
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:04,960
I hope to get the chance of

1719
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,940
going back into the Top 9. Thank you.

1720
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:09,630
So cool!

1721
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:11,070
You're so good!

1722
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:13,070
Yeah, Jay!

1723
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:16,700
But it's a bit disappointing.

1724
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:19,860
What's this?

1725
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:21,770
It must feel strange,

1726
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:24,860
sitting there when he once sat in the middle.

1727
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:27,200
For some reason, I feel upset.

1728
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,840
By ending up in 12th place,

1729
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,410
trainee Jay lost his Top 9 seat to someone else.

1730
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:36,870
Then who will have become the new Top 9 member?

1731
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:39,470
Gosh, this is really...

1732
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:41,710
This isn't easy.

1733
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:44,820
I really can't predict who it will be.

1734
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:49,410
I will announce the next survivor of the Dance & Vocal position.

1735
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:52,930
The rank of the survivor I will announce is...

1736
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:53,940
[15th place]

1737
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:54,980
15th place? That's so high.

1738
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:57,100
I think it will be Seo Won hyung.
- I think it's Seo Won.

1739
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:00,020
- Hyung?
- No, it's either Seung Eon or Jong Woo.

1740
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:01,960
- Seung Eon hyung!
- Seung Eon!

1741
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:04,740
That won't make sense. It won't make any sense at all.

1742
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:06,570
Yoon Jong Woo is not easy.

1743
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,930
Compared to the rank he got during last survivor announcements,

1744
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:12,660
- this 12th place trainee...
- Rose in rank?

1745
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:16,010
If he says that he dropped in rank, that would be a shock.

1746
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:19,910
rose in rank.

1747
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:22,870
Wow, it would feel so good to sit in 15th place.

1748
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:25,760
I was in 15th place last time...

1749
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,890
Then Ricky isn't in 12th, and Takuto isn't in 15th place.

1750
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:33,530
And this trainee with the letter "o" in their name,

1751
01:21:33,530 --> 01:21:35,340
[Seo Won, Yoon Jong Woo, Yoo Seung Eon]

1752
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:38,320
Yoo Seung Eon, Yoon Jong Woo, Seo Won...

1753
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:42,340
ranked in the thirties during the first survivor announcements.

1754
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:44,150
ranked in the thirties.

1755
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:46,040
Ranked in the thirties?

1756
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:49,750
[Zhang Shuai Bo]

1757
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:52,560
[If so...]

1758
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,490
It could also be Zhang Shuai Bo.

1759
01:21:54,490 --> 01:21:57,640
The survivor who was chosen by the Star Creators is...

1760
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:01,330
- Zhang Shuai Bo?
- If it's really Jong Woo hyung, that would be daebak.

1761
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:03,220
Gosh, I'm sweating.

1762
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:05,470
"Home" Team's Yoon Jong Woo!

1763
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:07,520
Wow! Jong Woo hyung!

1764
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,030
Wow! That's crazy!

1765
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:10,800
Yoon Jong Woo!

1766
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:15,060
[Yoon Jong Woo climbed dramatically in rank again, from 38th to 15th place.]

1767
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,070
This is really legendary.

1768
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:19,280
Gosh, you worked so hard.

1769
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,140
For this "Home" performance Yoon Jong Woo did what he usually does

1770
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:25,180
- and ranked up 23 spots to end up in 15th place.
- Yoon Jong Woo did what he usually does.

1771
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:26,880
Wow, daebak.

1772
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,650
He's really amazing.

1773
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:30,660
That hyung really climbed up from the bottom.

1774
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:34,410
Let's find out who the next survivor is.

1775
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:36,190
It's the 17th place trainee.

1776
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:38,400
I predict Seo Won hyung.

1777
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,630
I predict Seung Eon.

1778
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:41,550
This trainee in 17th place

1779
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:45,580
is receiving the love of Star Creators with his bright and cute energy.

1780
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:47,200
Both of them are bright and cute, though.

1781
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:50,030
[Bright and cute]

1782
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:51,780
[Lim Jun Seo is looking at the two bright and cute hyungs]

1783
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:53,050
[And other trainees are looking at Lim Jun Seo like that.]

1784
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:54,450
Jun Seo?

1785
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:57,550
- Jun Seo?
- Jun Seo?

1786
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:02,440
[Discovered bright and cute Lim Jun Seo]

1787
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,430
Jun Seo, you're cute.

1788
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:06,670
I'm cute?

1789
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:07,690
[Doing it one more time for his fan.]

1790
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:11,220
Who will be the trainee who ended up in 17th place?

1791
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:14,030
That trainee is...

1792
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:16,480
Yoo Seung Eon.

1793
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,470
[17th place survivor is Yoo Seung Eon]

1794
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:20,360
["Home" Team members are called one after the next.]

1795
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:21,640
["Home" Team members are called one after the next.]

1796
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,630
"Home" Team is daebak.

1797
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:28,260
So far, all the survivors came from "Home" Team.

1798
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:32,070
- You did well.
- "Home" Team is cool.

1799
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:36,670
I will announce the next survivor from the Vocal & Dance position.

1800
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:39,790
- 21st place.
- No, I think it will be 18th or 19th place.

1801
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:42,010
If it's 19th place, then the rankings would be really close together.

1802
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:42,880
[18th place]

1803
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,490
Oh my god.

1804
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:47,040
This trainee survived in 18th place.

1805
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,710
- They're all in such a high rank.
- 18th place?

1806
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:51,790
This trainee who ended up in 18th place

1807
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:54,500
has performed with a girl group song before.

1808
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,580
- It's Won hyung, it's Won hyung.
- Oh!

1809
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:59,500
- Seo Won!
- This time, it's really Seo Won hyung.

1810
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:04,160
[Seo Won performed a NewJeans song for the Star Level Test.]

1811
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,950
- What!
- Is there anyone else besides me?

1812
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:08,030
- There's Zhang Shuai Bo.
- Oh, Seo Won.

1813
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:09,780
"Feel Special"

1814
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:14,530
["Feel Special" Team performed a TWICE song for the Dual Position Battle]

1815
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:18,630
But Jui hyung also did "Kill This Love"

1816
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:21,080
[Chen Kuan Jui received the benefit by performing a BLACKPINK song at the K vs. G Group Battle]

1817
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:26,710
[Which one of these trainees will survive in 18th place?]

1818
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:28,750
The 18th place trainee is...

1819
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:32,480
Seo Won!

1820
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,540
[18th place survivor is Seo Won.]

1821
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:36,960
Congrats!

1822
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:41,360
[18th place: Seo Won]

1823
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:45,950
Trainee Seo Won showed off his sexy charms through the "Love Killa" stage.

1824
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:49,990
He received a positive evaluation from the Star Creators and managed to survive.

1825
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:51,620
He also got the benefit.

1826
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:56,220
Could we see the fatal facial acting from the "Love Killa" stage again?

1827
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:57,960
Yes. Just a moment.

1828
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:58,650
[You will...]

1829
01:24:58,650 --> 01:24:59,560
[do this here?]

1830
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:05,600
Gosh!

1831
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,710
[You're so cool]

1832
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:10,420
Professionals are different.

1833
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:13,270
So cool! You're so cool, Hyungnim!

1834
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:14,800
Trainee Yoon Jong Woo.

1835
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,500
Your rank rose by 23 places since the last survivor announcements.

1836
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,120
Wow.

1837
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,440
- I knew it.
- I'm so jealous.

1838
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:29,480
I tried my best for every stage thinking that each one was my last.

1839
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:33,030
I wanted to say thank you to all the teammates

1840
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:35,870
that I practiced with for helping me so much.

1841
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:38,180
I will try even harder from now.

1842
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:41,420
So lucky...

1843
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:44,990
Trainee Yoo Seung Eon, please tell us how you feel, having survived.

1844
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:47,040
So cute.

1845
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,780
Honestly...

1846
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:54,500
Don't cry, don't cry!

1847
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,480
Gosh... Don't cry!

1848
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:59,250
I...

1849
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:01,230
Aigoo...

1850
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:08,410
I worried a lot about whether I'd be able to perform on stage again.

1851
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:11,430
To all the Star Creators who allowed me to perform again,

1852
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:15,530
thank you so much.

1853
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:19,910
I will pay back your trust with a good performance on stage.

1854
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:25,090
Hey, you shouldn't cry on such a good day.

1855
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:29,010
Once again, congratulations on surviving.

1856
01:26:29,010 --> 01:26:32,100
Please move to the seat with your rank.

1857
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,930
My Jong Woo is in 15th place.

1858
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:36,890
Congrats, Hyung.

1859
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:38,470
Wow, he's quite amazing.

1860
01:26:38,470 --> 01:26:42,150
From 73rd place to 15th place.

1861
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:43,980
A lot of the members from "Home" Team survived.

1862
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:46,780
This is really high up!
- Yeah, it's very high up.

1863
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:48,920
Four spots are already taken.

1864
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:53,240
No, apart from the Top 9 and the 28th place, the number of remaining seats is

1865
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:56,180
12 seats.

1866
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:59,010

[Shocked]

1869
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,210
Really?

1870
01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:09,030
Will there be any more survivor's seats left for the trainees that are waiting to be called?

1871
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:11,070
Please, please...

1872
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:13,820
12 seats is a bit too little.

1873
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:15,290
Gosh...

1874
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:18,770
I feel like it's going to be tough.

1875
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:22,250
The Vocal & Dance position...

1876
01:27:23,610 --> 01:27:25,420
Has more survivors?

1877
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:27,160
has more survivors.

1878
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:28,370
That's a relief.

1879
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:32,120

This trainee is in 22nd place.

1882
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:37,060
It's high.

1883
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:39,980
Wow... Daebak.
- Man, I would love to get 22nd place.

1884
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:43,640
The trainee in 22nd place was the leader

1885
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:48,150
or the killing part during the Dual Position Battle.

1886

["Feel Special" Team's killing part, Cha Woong Ki]

1888
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:56,710
Can't it be Woong Ki hyung since he was the 28th place candidate based on the intermediate voting results at 1 a.m.?

1889
01:27:56,710 --> 01:27:58,810
If so, then that would be daebak.

1890
01:27:58,810 --> 01:28:02,010
[Which trainee will be in 22nd place?]

1891
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:04,160
It's Chen Kuan Jui.

1892
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:10,320
Congratulations.

[Trainee Chen Kuan Jui also went through a lot emotionally as "Butterfly" Team's leader.]

1894

I heard the "ch" sound, so I thought it was me!

Gosh...

1896
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:26,480
Through his "Butterfly" stage, Trainee Chen Kuan Jui put on a butterfly-like performance.

1897
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:31,650
Trainee Chen Kuan Jui, congratulations for putting on a beautiful performance and surviving.

1898
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:35,060
So cool!

1899
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,580
Jui hyung also ranked up quite a bit.

Yes.

1911
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,660

1913
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:11,010
has another survivor!

1914
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:13,000
has another survivor!

1915
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,050
[23rd place]

1916
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:16,630
It's 23rd place!

1917
01:29:16,630 --> 01:29:18,020
It's the rank right under Chen Kuan Jui hyung.

1918
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,580
We're starting to run out of seats.

1919
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:22,420
But there's too many of us left...

1920
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:26,900
This trainee is loved for his cute looks.

1921
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:28,990
Cute?

1922
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:32,070
Then I'm thinking Brian hyung?

1923
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:34,820
It must be Woong Ki! Or maybe it's Jun Seo?

1924
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:37,200
It's either Jun Seo or Woong Ki.

1925
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,530
Woong Ki!

1926
01:29:38,530 --> 01:29:40,900
The song that this trainee sang for the Dual Position Battle was...

1927
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:43,120
What? The song that he sang?

1928
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,450
This is important.

1929
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:46,020
"Home" or "Butterfly"?

1930
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:48,180
I think it will be "Butterfly".

1931
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:50,520
"Feel Special."

1932
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,070
Woong Ki!

1933
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:54,720
It's either Woong Ki or Zhang Shuai Bo.

1934
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,590
The 23rd place trainee is...

1935
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:01,550
I really hope it's Woong Ki hyung.

1936
01:30:06,310 --> 01:30:08,360
Zhang Shuai Bo.

1937
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:11,490
Wow.

1938
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:12,980
Zhang Shuai Bo also cried a lot.

1939
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:14,460
Go on ahead.

1940
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:16,080
I'll follow you.

1941
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,920
I think he has a lot of global fans.

1942
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:21,370
Are there any left? Will there be any more?

1943
01:30:21,370 --> 01:30:23,580
If there is, there is only one more.

1944
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:26,730
The Vocal & Dance position...

1945
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:31,160
There should be another survivor... Wait, if there is, then we won't have seats.

1946
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:34,250
Please... I want to perform one more stage before I go, please!

1947
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:36,700
Me too.

1948
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,630
has another survivor.

1949
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:47,550
Why are there so many from this position?

1950
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:49,760
Gosh...

1951
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,920
Having a lot of survivors is great,

1952
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,090
- but our seats...
- Will we have our seats?

1953
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:56,330
Is this right?

1954
01:30:56,330 --> 01:30:58,170
There are so many.

1955
01:30:58,170 --> 01:30:59,430
Please...

1956
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:01,410
What will be the rank of the next survivor?

1957
01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:03,550
This trainee is in 26th place.

1958
01:31:04,530 --> 01:31:06,140
This is near the cutoff.

1959
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:08,470
It's a rank that barely survived.

1960
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:09,800
Cai Jin Xin.

1961
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,170
Brian, please.

1962
01:31:11,170 --> 01:31:13,440
Woong Ki...

1963
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:16,750
For the Star Level Test, this trainee has performed

1964
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:21,880
either a NCT 127 or THE BOYZ song.

1965
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,110
It's Cai Jin Xin.

1966
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:25,180
[Cai Jin Xin first appeared on the Star Level Test performing a THE BOYZ song]

1967
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:29,680
But Woong Ki also performed "Bloom Bloom" by THE BOYZ with me.

1968
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,020
Brian and Yun Seo.

1969
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:33,880
They performed "Kick It" by NCT 127.

1970
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:35,120
Please...

1971
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:38,290
I will announce the trainee who will be able to perform on the next stage.

1972
01:31:38,290 --> 01:31:40,500
- Cai Jin Xin!
- Brian, Brian!

1973
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,680
The 26th place trainee is...

1974
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:46,750
We don't know what might have happened. His rank rose by two spots from 28th?

1975
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,780
Cha Woong Ki!

1976
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:50,920
Cha Woong Ki!

1977
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:53,330
[Surprised]

1978
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:55,060

1979
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:57,310
Cha Woong Ki!

1980
01:31:57,310 --> 01:31:58,090
Cha Woong Ki!

1981
01:31:58,090 --> 01:32:01,910
[The 26th place survivor is Cha Woong Ki]

1982
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:04,370
Wow. That's amazing.

1983
01:32:04,370 --> 01:32:05,580
Oh, Woong Ki...

1984
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:07,930
I just got goosebumps. I really got goosebumps.

1985
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:09,330
I really got goosebumps!

1986
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:12,220
Oh no...

1987
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:15,150
- This gave me goosebumps!
- I know!

1988
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:16,920
I feel electrified.

1989
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,110
His rank changed within 9 hours!

1990
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:21,220
He rose by 2 spots!

1991
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:24,150
This is so daebak.

1992
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:26,800
- Woong Ki, you've gone through a lot.
- Woong Ki, congrats!

1993
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,480
Woong Ki, smile!

1994
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,420
Smile! Woong Ki hyung, congratulations!

1995
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:34,450
- Woong Ki hyung is the best.
- I feel a bit emotional right now.

1996
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:36,320
Cha Woong Ki!

1997
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:39,290
If it's like this, then can I get my hopes up?

1998
01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:41,980
That means that the candidate for 28th place changed.

1999
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:43,220
Within 9 hours...

2000
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:46,050
After last week's stage was aired, Trainee Cha Woong Ki

2001
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:50,330
received 133,000 votes in less than 10 hours.

2002
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:54,830
He was at risk of being eliminated in 31st place, but rose 5 spots to survive.

2003
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:57,170
[26th place: Cha Woong Ki]

2004
01:32:57,170 --> 01:32:59,460
He ended up getting the benefit.

2005
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:00,990
Congratulations!

2006
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:02,300
So things can change in a day.

2007
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:04,070
I know. Daebak.

2008
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:07,560
My rank was such a precarious one.

2009
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:09,350
But thankfully,

2010
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:13,620
the Star Creators have given me another chance,

2011
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:15,940
so thank you so much.

2012
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:19,970
Fighting!

2013
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:21,900
Good!

2014
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:26,240
I'll work hard on the next performance as well and survive at the next survivor announcement, too.

2015
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,780
Thank you!

2016
01:33:36,990 --> 01:33:39,500
So envious.

2017
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:42,450
It's not the time for me to celebrate that Woong Ki made it.

2018
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:46,720
Currently, the survivors for Vocal and Dance position consist of one person from "Love Killa" team,

2019
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:50,970
three people from "Home" team, two people from "Feel Special" team, and one person from the "Butterfly" team.

2020
01:33:50,970 --> 01:33:52,750
It's a total of seven members.

2021
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:55,500
Congratulations to all the survivors.

2022
01:33:55,500 --> 01:34:00,430
This is it for the survivor announcement for Vocal and Dance positions.

2023
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:02,610
- This is it?
- This is it.

2024
01:34:02,610 --> 01:34:04,590
This is it.

2025
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:09,710
However, even if your name hasn't been called out,

2026
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:13,530
you can still survive as Top 9 candidate or as No. 28.

2027
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:17,070
So, please wait for the result to the end.

2028
01:34:17,070 --> 01:34:20,630
So many have made it, but many dropped out, too.

2029
01:34:20,630 --> 01:34:23,540
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!

2030
01:34:27,050 --> 01:34:29,340
I think our part announcement is the last one.

2031
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:30,410
- Ours?
- Yes.

2032
01:34:30,410 --> 01:34:33,010
Please do the Rap and Dance next.

2033
01:34:33,010 --> 01:34:35,020
If he announces Vocal and Rap first,

2034
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:37,660
I think I'll lose hope.

2035
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:39,900
There are no spots left.

2036
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:42,970
The second survivor announcement for Boys Planet.

2037
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:46,790
Excluding 11 candidates for Top 9

2038
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:51,950
and one No. 28, nine seats remain.

2039
01:34:51,950 --> 01:34:53,140
[Only nine seats remain for survivors]

2040
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:54,270
Really?

01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:56,720
Only nine? That's all?

2042
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,960
That's too few for sure.

2043
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,530
The next position survivors that I'll announce...

2044
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:03,560
Probably Vocal and Rap?

2045
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,120
Vocal.

2046
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:07,210
- Rap.
- Vocal and Rap position.

Vocal and Rap Position.

2048

- It's finally here.
- It's here.

2049
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:17,760
It's here.

2050
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,180
I'm in big trouble.

2051

My inside is turning over.

2052
01:35:20,730 --> 01:35:23,980
You're either really high or really low in your rankings.

2053
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:27,880
I think lots of unexpected changes will come from that.

2054
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,420
[Vocal and Rap position showed a distinctively different performance through the arrangement and rap making]

2055
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:33,110
Through their vocal and rap making, the four teams

2056
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:36,110
made their performances shine.

2057

[Four teams displayed different appeal on stage]

2058
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:49,950

excluding Top 9 candidates and No. 28?

2060
01:35:52,810 --> 01:35:54,460
Here we go.

2061
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:58,250
- What if there aren't any survivors?
- Oh, no...

- Could it be no one?
- There is.

- There has to be.

2431
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:39,710
only 9 survivor seats are left.

2432

Out of the 20 trainees in Rap & Dance Position,

who will get the seats?

2434
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:47,330
Let's find it out.

[Survivor Announcement Rap & Dance]

2436
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:53,730
Rap & Dance Position expressed their stories well on stage

2437
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:57,910
through rap making and choreography creation.

2438
01:52:57,910 --> 01:53:01,160
[Team Law showed a fierce and powerful performance.]

2439
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:05,760
[Team Zoom showed creative choreography and great rap skills.]

2440
01:53:06,460 --> 01:53:10,460
[Team Gang filled the stage with bright ideas.]

2441
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:15,660
[Team Rush Hour made everyone enjoy with their funky charm.]

2442
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:19,960
Team Law won first place and achieved the benefit after a fierce battle.

2443
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,950
What will be the result of survival and elimination?

2444
01:53:22,950 --> 01:53:27,290
I'll reveal the first survivor.

2445
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:31,210
In Rap & Dance Position, the first survivor's ranking is

2446
01:53:31,210 --> 01:53:32,990
Ranking 13th and 14th should come out here.

2447
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:34,960
13th.

2448
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:37,360
I think it's Kum Jun Hyeon.

2449
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:39,240
Either Jun Jyeon or Han Bin.

2450

Let's go, Haruto.

2452
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:46,020
Jun Hyeon, Han Bin or Haruto. They have the highest chance.

2453
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:48,510
13th place must be Ricky.

2454

given!

2468
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:19,360
Then it's Han Bin hyung or Jun Hyeon.

2469
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:20,600
Then it can't be Ricky.

2470

2471

- I haven't either.
- Get it next time.

2473
01:54:24,990 --> 01:54:26,640
It's Jun Hyeon.

02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:17,900
- You'd make it.
- He has risen a lot.

2605
02:00:20,910 --> 02:00:22,920
[19th place: Wang Zi Hao. 1,600,605 points]

2606

Who can it be?

2611
02:00:35,450 --> 02:00:36,900
The ranking of this survivor

2612
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:39,650
has jumped up recently.

2613
02:00:39,650 --> 02:00:41,420
Jumped up?

2614
02:00:41,420 --> 02:00:43,060
Hey, it can be Lee Jeong Hyeon.

2615
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:44,670
I think it's Lee Jeong Hyeon.

2616

Ye Dam? Ye Dam?

2617
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:48,330
If It's Ye Dam hyung, it'd be legendary.

2618

[Na Kamden showed his stable rapping skills as a sub rapper 1 in Team Law.]

2623
02:00:58,940 --> 02:01:01,020
He was so cool.

2624
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:03,910
- Jeong Hyeon as well.
- Isn't it Jeong Hyeon?

2625
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:07,970
[Lee Jeong Hyeon showed his unexpected rapping skills as a sub rapper 1 in Team Gang.]

2626
02:01:09,270 --> 02:01:12,590
I'll reveal the trainee in 20th place.

02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:34,010
He showed his improvements in the 2nd mission.

2633

His ranking has risen 11 steps

2634
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:41,210
since the first global voting and survived.

2635
02:01:41,210 --> 02:01:43,850
11 steps? Wow.

2636
02:01:43,890 --> 02:01:48,270
I'll continue to announce the survivor in 21st place.

2637
02:01:48,270 --> 02:01:52,290
When I saw the name on this rank, I was surprised.

2638
02:01:52,290 --> 02:01:53,780
Oh, it must be unpredictable.

2639
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:55,040
Kum Jun Hyone?

2640
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,960

2655
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:40,220
Lee Seung Hwan Trainee was pushed away by No. 1 trainee, Sung Han Bin

2656
02:02:40,220 --> 02:02:42,630
when choosing the mission song and

2657
02:02:42,630 --> 02:02:45,500
had to move to Team Gang without any choice.

2658
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:47,840
He prepared for the stage with all his will and guts.

2659
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:52,120
- As a result, he did a great performance and could survive.

First of all, thank you for voting for me, Star Creators.

2662
02:03:01,010 --> 02:03:05,990
And I'm thankful for the Team Law members.

2663
02:03:05,990 --> 02:03:11,030
I will continue to lose (?) my initial commitment.

2664
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:16,620
I won't lose my initial commitment and will do my best. Thank you!

2665
02:03:18,810 --> 02:03:25,410

Thank you for allowing me to be in a high ranking of 20th place, Star Creators.

2670
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:48,640

2671
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:50,820

02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:52,860
- Thank you!
Cool!

2673
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:54,480
Thank you, guys!

2676
02:04:01,610 --> 02:04:03,790
I think I should do harder.

2677
02:04:03,790 --> 02:04:05,490
Thank you!

2678
02:04:08,190 --> 02:04:11,920
Please go back to your rank seat.

2679
02:04:16,860 --> 02:04:19,910
- After Takuto?
I want to survive first.

2680
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:21,790
- Me too.
- Me too.

2681
02:04:21,790 --> 02:04:23,500
I feel anxious.

2682
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:25,460
I feel like I'm ranked 27th.

2683
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:27,110
You can't be 27th.

2684
02:04:27,110 --> 02:04:31,160
Trainees in Rap & Dance position who are waiting to be announced are

2685
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:32,550
fourteen.

2686
02:04:32,550 --> 02:04:33,940
Takuto, Ollie.

2687
02:04:33,940 --> 02:04:39,360
The remaining survivor seats are 24th, 25th, and 27th places. Three seats are left in total.

2688
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:41,390
Oh, really? It sure is.

2689
02:04:41,390 --> 02:04:43,870
Three seats?

2690
02:04:43,870 --> 02:04:46,120
It's really hard to get in.

2691
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:49,300
The probability that two of us will get in out of the three seats?

2692
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:54,000
Then when it's announced this time, one of us has to be called.

2693
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,490
Ollie has a chance.

2694
02:04:55,490 --> 02:04:57,370
I'm scared.

2695
02:04:57,370 --> 02:04:59,710
Mun Jung Hyun, Lee Jeong Hyeon, Ma Jing Xiang, Hiroto,

2696
02:04:59,710 --> 02:05:01,780
Takuto and Ollie.

2697
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:03,640
There are so many who deserve to survive.

2698
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:05,320
Why did Takuto's ranking drop this much?

2699
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:08,260
Maybe Takuto is going to be in the top 10?

2700
02:05:08,260 --> 02:05:09,520
I don't think so.

2701
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:11,790
My heart hurts.

2702
02:05:11,790 --> 02:05:14,460
There's a seat still left for you, hyung.

2703
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:19,020
I'll continue announcing the next survivor in Rap & Dance Position.

2704
02:05:19,020 --> 02:05:19,880
The next ranking is

2705
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:21,900
24th.

2706
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:23,740
It makes me crazy.

2707
02:05:23,740 --> 02:05:24,870
24th place.

2708
02:05:24,870 --> 02:05:26,980
Takuto, please.

2710
02:05:28,580 --> 02:05:30,810
I can do it. I can do it.

2711
02:05:30,810 --> 02:05:32,340
Please.

2712
02:05:33,430 --> 02:05:34,460
Please.

2713
02:05:34,460 --> 02:05:36,760
Let's survive one more time.

2714
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:39,350
Can we survive? Only three seats are left.

2715
02:05:39,350 --> 02:05:42,150
Oh, right. Ma Jing Xiang.

2716
02:05:42,150 --> 02:05:45,390
There are so many people who can survive. There's Hiroto, too.

2717
02:05:45,390 --> 02:05:47,690
In the Dual Position Battle,

2718
02:05:47,690 --> 02:05:50,200
the trainee in 24th place...

2719
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:52,110
Didn't achieve the benefit.

2720
02:05:52,110 --> 02:05:53,790
didn't achieve the benefit.

2721
02:05:53,790 --> 02:05:56,110
He didn't achieve the benefit.

2722
02:05:56,110 --> 02:05:57,720
We didn't get it at all.

2723
02:05:57,720 --> 02:05:59,680
We didn't get it at all.

2724
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:01,830
- Ollie?
- And

2725
02:06:01,830 --> 02:06:04,570

- Went down
Dropped?

2727
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:08,050
went up.

02:06:08,050 --> 02:06:10,070
- Jeong Hyeon hyung?
- That's Lee Jeong Hyeon.

2729
02:06:10,070 --> 02:06:11,990
Jeong Hyeon and Ollie.

02:06:11,990 --> 02:06:14,350

02:06:19,790 --> 02:06:22,020
Or Ye Dam?

2734
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:24,130
I hope it's me.

2735
02:06:24,130 --> 02:06:25,790
Say "I'm going to be ranked 24th today." ten times.

2736
02:06:25,790 --> 02:06:31,880
I'm going to be ranked 24th today. I'm going to be ranked 24th today...

2737
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:35,210

02:06:35,210 --> 02:06:38,450
- Keep going.
I'm going to be ranked 24th today. I'm going to be ranked 24th today...

2739
02:06:38,450 --> 02:06:39,530
Keep going.

2740
02:06:39,530 --> 02:06:41,280
- Your fate is changing.
I said it ten times.

2741
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:42,990
It's Lee Jeong Hyeon.

2742
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:47,990
Oh, what's that?

2743
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:52,520
I told you it'd work.

2744
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:54,340
It really worked.

2745
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:57,020
- Wow, it really worked.
This is really daebak.

2746
02:06:57,020 --> 02:06:58,820
Congratulations.

2747
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:01,480
- That's a relief.

2748
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:03,970
Daebak.

2749

Trainee Lee Jeong Hyeon.

2750
02:07:05,020 --> 02:07:07,850
- You're so cool, Lee Jeong Hyeon.
- With his charismatic visual and rapping with his guts,

2751
02:07:07,850 --> 02:07:10,460
his ranking jumped up. Congratulations.

2752
02:07:10,460 --> 02:07:14,950
Next, I'll announce the trainee in 25th place.

2753
02:07:14,950 --> 02:07:16,800
It's time for Mun Jung Hyun to go.

2754
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:20,410
- Only Takuto left.
What if it's not me?

2755
02:07:20,410 --> 02:07:21,730
Ollie.

2756
02:07:21,730 --> 02:07:22,730
I think it's Mun Jung Hyun.

2757
02:07:22,730 --> 02:07:25,420
Takuto's name needs to be called here.

2758
02:07:25,420 --> 02:07:27,950
Otherwise, Takuto will be eliminated.

2759
02:07:27,950 --> 02:07:30,270
Takuto's ranking dropped this much?

2760
02:07:30,270 --> 02:07:32,470
That can be possible.

2761
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:34,930
And in each team of Rap & Dance Position,

2762
02:07:34,930 --> 02:07:36,070
In the team?

2763
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:37,980
The bottom place?

2764
02:07:37,980 --> 02:07:39,240
If it's the bottom place, it'd be Takuto.

2765
02:07:39,240 --> 02:07:41,270
Top or bottom place?

2766
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:43,920
He's the youngest.

2767
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:46,420
- It's either Ollie or Takuto.
- Ollie.

2768
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:48,210
- I'm also the youngest.
- Right, you're the youngest.

2769
02:07:48,210 --> 02:07:50,650
I'm also the youngest, but there are many youngest guys over there.

2770
02:07:50,650 --> 02:07:53,480
There are so many youngest guys here.

2771

- It's a big drop.

2941
02:16:25,580 --> 02:16:27,300
Is Hoe Taek hyung in 11th place?

2942
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:30,230
As joining in Boys Planet,

2943
02:16:30,230 --> 02:16:33,980
I could feel what it means to enjoy the stage

2944

Since I was able to perform with very talented boys,

2946

That's one benefit difference.

2981
02:18:20,370 --> 02:18:22,150
It's the difference between receiving and not receiving the benefit.

2982
02:18:22,150 --> 02:18:24,820
If Gun Wook is ranked 9th,

2983
02:18:24,820 --> 02:18:26,810
that means there was actually 50,000 points difference.

02:25:08,010 --> 02:25:09,290
I'll return the favor with better songs

3108
02:25:09,290 --> 02:25:13,640
and more confident performances.

3109
02:25:13,640 --> 02:25:15,330
Thank you.

3110
02:25:18,580 --> 02:25:21,240
Tae Rae is lucky 7.

3111
02:25:25,910 --> 02:25:29,900
Let's continue to find out the trainee in 6th place.

3112
02:25:29,900 --> 02:25:31,530
Wow, the fight begins now.

3113
02:25:31,530 --> 02:25:33,900
The seats are filling up.

3114
02:25:33,900 --> 02:25:36,050
Maybe me?

3115
02:25:36,050 --> 02:25:38,520
There are so many talented candidates.

3116
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:41,120
This seat is always the most unpredictable.

3117
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:43,040
- Gyu Vin?
He was in 6th place last time too, right?

3118
02:25:43,040 --> 02:25:44,220
Right.

3119
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:49,620
This trainee in 6th place achieved the benefit from the Dual Position Battle.

3120
02:25:49,620 --> 02:25:53,420
[Han Yu Jin in Team Law achieved the benefit.]

3121
02:25:53,420 --> 02:25:54,860
I got it too.

3122
02:25:54,860 --> 02:26:00,080
[Sung Han Bin and Zhang Hao in Team TOMBOY achieved the benefit.]

3123
02:26:00,080 --> 02:26:01,430
We all got it.

3124
02:26:01,430 --> 02:26:03,410
Everyone got it.

3125
02:26:03,410 --> 02:26:10,200
[Kim Gyu Vin, Kim Ji Woong, and Seok Matthew in Team Love Killa achieved the benefit.]

3126
02:26:11,850 --> 02:26:16,110
He has a unique face and is praised for his good looking.

3127
02:26:16,110 --> 02:26:17,580
They all are.

3128
02:26:17,580 --> 02:26:19,980
They are all famous for their good looking.

3129
02:26:19,980 --> 02:26:21,820
They are all handsome.

3130
02:26:21,820 --> 02:26:24,950
I'll reveal the survivor in 6th place in TOP 9.

3131
02:26:24,950 --> 02:26:28,110
It's 5 million points now.

3132
02:26:29,670 --> 02:26:30,950
That's huge.

3133
02:26:30,950 --> 02:26:32,590
It's a 2 million difference.

3134
02:26:32,590 --> 02:26:37,330
With a total of 5,088,364 points,

3135
02:26:37,330 --> 02:26:39,990
the trainee who made it to 6th place!

3136
02:26:39,990 --> 02:26:42,900
The survivor in 6th place is

3137
02:26:42,900 --> 02:26:45,500
[Which trainee is in 6th place?]

3138
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:48,630
Kim Gyu Vin!

3139
02:26:50,440 --> 02:26:52,020
Kim Gyu Vin!

3140
02:26:52,020 --> 02:26:55,000
[Survivor in 6th place: Kim Gyu Vin]

3141
02:26:55,730 --> 02:27:01,030
Trainee Kim Gyu Vin proved his value again through Love Killa stage.

3142
02:27:01,030 --> 02:27:04,830
As a result, he won first place in the position as well as in his team and

3143
02:27:04,830 --> 02:27:08,610
he got a big benefit of 250,000 points.

3144
02:27:08,610 --> 02:27:11,930
- Gyu Vin hyung keeps his ranking.
- Keeping the ranking is...

3145
02:27:11,930 --> 02:27:14,060
- Trainee Kim Gyu Vin.
- Yes.

3146
02:27:14,060 --> 02:27:17,560
Did you do only Love Killa for several years?

3147
02:27:17,560 --> 02:27:20,210
I still remember this self-introduction of his.

3148
02:27:20,210 --> 02:27:21,810
Did you do only Love Killa for several years?

3149
02:27:21,810 --> 02:27:24,310
[Kim Gyu Vin showed off his witty self-introduction.]

3150
02:27:24,310 --> 02:27:27,280
Did you only do Kick It for several years?

3151
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:29,890
- Oh, he surprised me.
- I got surprised too.

3152
02:27:29,890 --> 02:27:32,600
Please tell us any memorable remarks on survival.

3153
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:37,810

3157
02:27:48,180 --> 02:27:51,150
- Is he doing well?
- I'm always able to

3158
02:27:51,150 --> 02:27:53,300
stay strong because of you.

3159
02:27:53,300 --> 02:27:54,720
Thank you and I love you.

3160
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:56,540
Hmm!

3161
02:27:56,540 --> 02:27:57,890
[Good job, our youngest]

3162
02:27:57,890 --> 02:27:59,170
Wow, he did a good job.

3163
02:27:59,170 --> 02:28:02,360
Why didn't you smile when I spoke English?

3164
02:28:02,360 --> 02:28:04,780
Gyu Vin is speaking well.

3165
02:28:04,780 --> 02:28:08,060
Yes, congratulations again on trainee Kim Gyu Vin's survival.

3166
02:28:08,060 --> 02:28:12,110
Please show us your shining aspect again in the third mission.

3167
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:18,120
I'll reveal the next survivor in 5th place in TOP 9.

3168
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:19,270
Zhang Hao hyung.

3169
02:28:19,270 --> 02:28:21,430
Please go up, Zhang Hao.

3170
02:28:21,430 --> 02:28:23,820
- Are you nervous, hyung?
- Yes.

3171
02:28:27,130 --> 02:28:31,580
The trainee in 5th place is unexpected.

3172
02:28:31,580 --> 02:28:35,910
- Unexpected?
Since the first survivor announcement, this trainee's ranking...

3173
02:28:35,910 --> 02:28:37,620
this trainee's ranking...

3174
02:28:38,380 --> 02:28:39,350
went down.

3175
02:28:39,350 --> 02:28:41,710
[It went down?]

3176
02:28:41,710 --> 02:28:43,600
- Then it's not me?
- No.

3177
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:45,450
Aren't they all dropping except Zhang Hao?

3178
02:28:45,450 --> 02:28:47,790
Whoa...

3179
02:28:47,790 --> 02:28:50,190
I'm getting nervous.

3180
02:28:50,190 --> 02:28:51,500
Ji Woong hyung?

3181
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:53,210
Matthew?

3182
02:28:53,210 --> 02:28:54,930
Yu Jin?

3183
02:28:55,930 --> 02:28:59,750
And in the Dual Position Battle, Vocal and Rap Position...

3184
02:28:59,750 --> 02:29:02,170
[Vocal and Rap Position...]

3185
02:29:02,170 --> 02:29:03,970
He was not part of it.

3186
02:29:03,970 --> 02:29:07,270
That means Han Bin is not a candidate anymore.

3187
02:29:07,270 --> 02:29:10,880
It's one of those three. Yu Jin, Matthew, and Kim Ji Woong.

3188
02:29:10,880 --> 02:29:15,680
He earned a total of 5,751,211 points.

3189
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:18,240
I'll reveal the trainee in 5th place.

3190
02:29:18,240 --> 02:29:21,820
The points keep jumping high at every survivor's announcement.

3191
02:29:21,820 --> 02:29:23,140
Even though one week is short.

3192
02:29:23,140 --> 02:29:25,900
I got 5.5m points when I was ranked 5th.

3193
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:28,080
But they voted for 3 weeks at that time.

3194
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:30,330
The survivor in 5th place is

3195
02:29:30,330 --> 02:29:33,700
- Yu Jin.
- I think it's Matthew hyung.

3196
02:29:33,700 --> 02:29:35,750
Kim Ji Woong.

3197
02:29:35,750 --> 02:29:38,860
[Survivor in 5th place: Kim Ji Woong]

3198
02:29:38,860 --> 02:29:39,900
Kim Ji Woong.

3199
02:29:39,900 --> 02:29:41,270
[Surprised]

3200
02:29:41,270 --> 02:29:45,670
[Everyone is perplexed that his rank dropped by 2 steps.]

3201
02:29:45,670 --> 02:29:47,300
5th place?

3202
02:29:47,300 --> 02:29:48,520
Is Ji Woong hyung?

3203
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:53,990
Kim Ji Woong dominated the stage with her sensuality through the killing part of Love Killa.

3204
02:29:53,990 --> 02:29:57,660
Even though his ranking dropped by 2 steps from the last announcement,

3205
02:29:57,660 --> 02:30:00,790
he had no problem securing his seat in TOP 9.

3206
02:30:00,790 --> 02:30:03,070
- That's unexpected.
- It sure is.

3207
02:30:03,070 --> 02:30:05,290
Besides rankings,

3208
02:30:05,290 --> 02:30:09,420
I think the most important thing is unbreakable heart.

3209
02:30:09,420 --> 02:30:11,370
[What's with that hyung?]

If Star Creators keep watering me,

3212
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:18,810
I'll bloom a huge flower.

3213
02:30:18,810 --> 02:30:21,060
Thank you!

3214
02:30:21,060 --> 02:30:23,890
I'll look forward to your huge flower.

3215
02:30:23,890 --> 02:30:27,880
I'll look forward to your great performance, Trainee Kim Ji Woong.

Who would it be?

3221
02:30:43,370 --> 02:30:47,620
I'll reveal the four candidates who will

3222
02:30:47,620 --> 02:30:49,460
compete fiercely for first place.

3223

- Oh, four of them together?
- I think so.

3228

Oh, Matthew.

3229
02:31:00,740 --> 02:31:01,980
I already know who.

3230
02:31:01,980 --> 02:31:06,070

Han Yu Jin, Seok Matthew, Zhang Hao, Sung Han Bin.

3234
02:31:14,690 --> 02:31:17,690
The final winner of the debut group of the final 9 people will be

3235
02:31:17,690 --> 02:31:20,570
qualified for the killing part of the debut title song

3236
02:31:20,570 --> 02:31:23,720
and given the benefit of having a solo song in their debut album.

3237
02:31:23,720 --> 02:31:26,920
I'll reveal the four candidates for first place in TOP 9.

- Shining Sung Han Bin.
- Sung Han Bin, Han Yu Jin, Zhang Hao,

Matthew, good!

3243
02:31:39,170 --> 02:31:41,560
Two members each from K and G Group.

3244
02:31:41,560 --> 02:31:45,040
These are four candidates for first place in Boys Planet TOP 9.

3245
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:47,990

- They deserve it.

Did the ranking change?

3249
02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:00,090
I'll announce the 4th place first.

I'm so jealous.

3253
02:32:03,880 --> 02:32:07,820
The trainee won first place in about 70 regions

3254
02:32:07,820 --> 02:32:12,860
including U.S., France, Italy, and Switzerland.

3255
02:32:12,860 --> 02:32:16,320
He earned a total of 5,812,430 points.

3256
02:32:16,320 --> 02:32:19,830
I'll introduce the survivor who will sin in Rank 4 seat in TOP 9.

3257
02:32:19,830 --> 02:32:21,850
Since he's ranked first in North America, it can be Matthew.

3258
02:32:21,850 --> 02:32:22,940
I think it's Matthew.

It can be Hao hyung.

3262
02:32:27,630 --> 02:32:29,950
I think Hao hyung will be in 2nd place this time.

3263
02:32:29,950 --> 02:32:31,420
Since he got the benefit as well.

3264
02:32:31,420 --> 02:32:35,280
I don't think the benefits will play a big part between them.

3265
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:37,890
I don't know who it will be at all.

3266
02:32:37,890 --> 02:32:40,060
No matter who it is, it's not strange at all.

02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:15,010
- But he's still amazing.
- Trainee Seok Matthew's ranking

3279
02:33:15,010 --> 02:33:17,310
went a little down from the last time, but

3280
02:33:17,310 --> 02:33:19,770
he still managed to survive at a high rank.

3281
02:33:19,770 --> 02:33:21,530
How do you feel now?

3282
02:33:21,530 --> 02:33:26,490
I'm so thankful that I'm still in TOP 9.

3283
02:33:26,490 --> 02:33:30,800
Star Creators.

3284
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:34,240
Since you send me support and love,

3285
02:33:34,240 --> 02:33:37,970
I'm becoming stronger and happier Matthew.

3286
02:33:37,970 --> 02:33:40,540
I Love You. I Want You.

3287
02:33:40,540 --> 02:33:43,180
Seok Ma-Chew.

3288
02:33:44,100 --> 02:33:45,000
Thank you.

3289
02:33:45,300 --> 02:33:47,080
He's so cute.

3290
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:51,560
I'll look forward to you in the 3rd mission again, Trainee Seok Matthew.

3291
02:33:51,560 --> 02:33:53,630
Matthew hyung.

3292
02:33:53,630 --> 02:33:56,240
Matthew hyung.

3293
02:33:56,240 --> 02:33:59,440
Congrats, hyung!

3294
02:33:59,440 --> 02:34:00,880
[Settling down in TOP 9 with warm hugs]

3295
02:34:00,880 --> 02:34:04,690
Will the 1st place be the same today again?

3296
02:34:08,560 --> 02:34:12,580
I'll reveal the trainee in 3rd place of TOP 3.

3297
02:34:12,580 --> 02:34:14,610
[3rd place]

3298
02:34:14,610 --> 02:34:16,220
The long-awaited TOP 3.

3299
02:34:16,220 --> 02:34:19,550
This trainee in 3rd place was

3300
02:34:19,550 --> 02:34:21,320
No. 1 in China.

3301
02:34:21,320 --> 02:34:24,340
- If he's No.1 in China, it's Hao hyung.
- Isn't it Zhang Hao?

3302
02:34:24,340 --> 02:34:26,500
- In China...
- Then Zhang Hao.

3303
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:28,940
The No.1 in China means a lot.

3304
02:34:28,940 --> 02:34:30,490
It can be Yu Jin.

3305
02:34:30,490 --> 02:34:33,280
Since Yu Jin is popular in China.

3306
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:35,250
As a result of receiving a lot of support,

3307
02:34:35,250 --> 02:34:40,590
he earned 6,045,275 points.

3308
02:34:40,590 --> 02:34:41,720
With this high score,

3309
02:34:41,720 --> 02:34:43,570
- Can 6 million be possible?
he made it to 3rd place.

3310
02:34:43,570 --> 02:34:46,290
Even with our points together, it's lower than that points.

3311
02:34:46,290 --> 02:34:51,100
The trainee in 3rd place who get to survive in Boys Planet is

3312
02:34:51,100 --> 02:34:53,190
[3rd place]

3313
02:34:53,190 --> 02:34:56,150
Han Yu Jin.

3314
02:34:58,240 --> 02:35:00,320
Han Yu Jin won fist place in China?

3315
02:35:00,320 --> 02:35:03,680
- No.1 in China?
- First place in China?

3316
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:05,410
Hao hyung is going up to 2nd place?

3317
02:35:05,410 --> 02:35:07,280
Guys, it's a fight over the center.

3318
02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:09,340
As expected, the two-center is...

3319
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:10,950
Those two people deserve the center.

3320
02:35:10,950 --> 02:35:15,870
While watching survival programs since I was young,

3321
02:35:15,870 --> 02:35:19,780
I thought about how I'd feel if I sat in such a high place.

3322
02:35:19,780 --> 02:35:23,960
I can't believe this and I'm so happy now.

3323
02:35:23,960 --> 02:35:27,600
I'll work harder to be a person who deserves this position.b

3324
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:29,350
Thank you!

3325
02:35:29,350 --> 02:35:30,730
How cute!

3326
02:35:30,730 --> 02:35:32,550
He is a good talker!

3327
02:35:33,940 --> 02:35:35,320
- He's a smart speaker.
- Cute!

3328
02:35:35,320 --> 02:35:39,080
I can't help but ask him to do his famous dance.

3329
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:43,900
[Han Yu Jin's sweeping thigh dance is both sexy and cute.]

3330
02:35:43,900 --> 02:35:46,630
- Go sweep your thigh.
- Is he going to sweep his thigh and shoot?

3331
02:35:46,630 --> 02:35:47,690
Let's go!

3332
02:35:47,690 --> 02:35:49,490
[Beware of hyperstimulation]

02:35:49,490 --> 02:35:50,730
[Cute x Sexy is harmful to the heart.]

3334
02:35:56,130 --> 02:35:58,430
Take his thigh.

3335
02:36:02,180 --> 02:36:03,590
Good job, good job.

3336
02:36:03,590 --> 02:36:05,030
Good job.

3337
02:36:05,030 --> 02:36:06,010
[Han Yu Jin moves to the Rank 3 survivor seat.]

3338
02:36:06,010 --> 02:36:08,520
Han Yu Jin!

3339
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:11,040
We met like this.

3340
02:36:12,900 --> 02:36:16,680
[3rd place: Han Yu Jin. 6,045,275 points]

3341
02:36:16,680 --> 02:36:18,310
They are all centers.

3342
02:36:18,310 --> 02:36:21,180
- Right.
- A battle over the center.

3343
02:36:24,540 --> 02:36:29,430
Now, we only have the long-awaited top 1 announcement left.

3344
02:36:29,430 --> 02:36:33,650
Immovable No. 1 or Reversal No. 1?

3345
02:36:33,650 --> 02:36:39,490
I didn't expect that I would see these two's heartwarming two-shots in person.

3346
02:36:39,490 --> 02:36:41,650
The two really look alike.

3347
02:36:41,650 --> 02:36:46,250
In the Signal Song stage, as a trainee who won 1st place in K group

3348
02:36:46,250 --> 02:36:48,800
and a trainee who won 1st place in G group,

3349
02:36:48,800 --> 02:36:51,580
each of them left a strong impression as the No.1 trainee.

3350
02:36:51,580 --> 02:36:57,150
And today, the two of them stand here as candidates for first place trainees.

3351
02:36:57,150 --> 02:37:02,450
One of them will be in 1st place, and the other will be in 2nd place.

3352
02:37:02,450 --> 02:37:04,600
Before we see who's going to be on the throne,

3353
02:37:04,600 --> 02:37:09,960
let's talk with these two trainees.

3354
02:37:09,960 --> 02:37:11,650
Trainee Sung Han Bin.

3355
02:37:11,650 --> 02:37:16,430
You're left as a candidate for 1st place with Zhang Hao who has great chemistry with you.

3356
02:37:16,430 --> 02:37:20,730
In the Dual Position Battle, he had to give away the No.1 trainee of Team TOMBOY to

3357
02:37:20,730 --> 02:37:24,390
trainee Zhang Hao.

3358
02:37:24,390 --> 02:37:28,510
Are you confident that you'll win first place?

3359
02:37:28,510 --> 02:37:33,930
There is no doubt that I did my best without regret.

3360
02:37:33,930 --> 02:37:35,300
Wow.

3361
02:37:35,300 --> 02:37:37,620
How can he speak so coolly like that?

3362
02:37:37,620 --> 02:37:39,290
Then Trainee Zhang Hao.

3363
02:37:39,290 --> 02:37:42,000
You made it all the way to the first candidate position.

3364
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:47,190
Do you think you can drive the momentum and take first place in TOP 9?

3365
02:37:47,190 --> 02:37:50,810
To be honest, it has been 3 months since the Singal Song.

3366
02:37:50,810 --> 02:37:57,090
It's so amazing that I meet Han Bin again here like this.

3367
02:37:57,090 --> 02:37:59,970
I'm so happy now.

3368
02:37:59,970 --> 02:38:05,520
Since I made it all the way to this place,

3369
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:09,830
I'll try to win first place.

3370
02:38:10,430 --> 02:38:12,300
He's cool.

02:38:14,190 --> 02:38:15,660

3372
02:38:15,660 --> 02:38:20,090

3376

He's so cute.

3377
02:38:34,160 --> 02:38:39,300
Between the two trainees, who will smile in the first place?

3378
02:38:39,300 --> 02:38:41,800
Boys Planets' 2nd TOP 9.

3379
02:38:41,800 --> 02:38:44,630
I'll reveal the survivor in 1st place.

3380
02:38:44,630 --> 02:38:45,950
Finally, 1st place.

3381
02:38:45,950 --> 02:38:47,520
1st place looks so cool.

3382
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:50,520
- Who would it be?
- I think it's definitely Han Bin hyung.

3383
02:38:50,520 --> 02:38:52,860
His ranking is unchangeable.

3384
02:38:52,860 --> 02:38:55,260
I think Hao hyung won this time with the benefit.

3385
02:38:55,260 --> 02:38:59,160
- If Hao hyung takes it away from him, then
- Legendary.

3386
02:38:59,160 --> 02:39:05,160
The first-place trainee earned a total of 7,043,213 points.

a total of 6,128,945 points.

3390
02:39:15,960 --> 02:39:17,770
There's about 900,000 points difference.

3391
02:39:17,770 --> 02:39:19,850
The point difference between them is

3392
02:39:19,850 --> 02:39:23,950
914,268 points.

3393
02:39:23,950 --> 02:39:25,520
That's a big difference.

3394
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:27,810
There's a big gap.

3395
02:39:27,810 --> 02:39:29,820
The No.1 doesn't even need the benefit.

3396
02:39:29,820 --> 02:39:36,020
Between Sung Han Bin and Zhang Hao, who will have the honor

3397

3617
02:52:24,800 --> 02:52:26,170
Are they really going to do a selection?

3618
02:52:26,170 --> 02:52:29,630
- We're Boys Planet Entertainment...
- Casting team.

3619
02:52:29,630 --> 02:52:31,320
Don't come close.

3620
02:52:31,320 --> 02:52:33,260
- They hate it, huh?
- Oh, no!

3621
02:52:33,260 --> 02:52:34,420
He's lying down now.

3622
02:52:34,420 --> 02:52:38,580
Hyung, please! Please come to our team!

3623
02:52:38,580 --> 02:52:42,690
Let's perform together once.

3624
02:52:42,690 --> 02:52:45,170
I think I'm blessed with good people.

3625
02:52:45,170 --> 02:52:47,880
Good people have gathered together

3626
02:52:47,880 --> 02:52:51,230
so I'm so satisfied with my team members.

3627
02:52:54,010 --> 02:52:56,540
What the hell are you doing?

3628
02:52:56,540 --> 02:52:58,760
Are you out of your mind?

3629
02:52:58,760 --> 02:53:01,930
Out of almost 100 candidates, you've come this far.

3630
02:53:01,930 --> 02:53:05,050
And you're in the top ranking.

3631
02:53:06,060 --> 02:53:10,030
What are you trying to do here? Do you guys want to live on Boys Planet forever?

3632
02:53:11,170 --> 02:53:13,330
My head went blank.

3633
02:53:13,330 --> 02:53:15,770
If Matthew does sub vocal 2,

3634
02:53:15,770 --> 02:53:18,020
it feels like this team will liven up more.

3635
02:53:18,020 --> 02:53:21,590
If I were to be changed out,

3636
02:53:21,590 --> 02:53:22,670
I'd rather go to "Switch" team.

3637
02:53:22,670 --> 02:53:26,680
Matthew, you have to consider other members now.

3638
02:53:30,800 --> 02:53:31,830
[Will the first trainee to be removed from that team be the one they're waiting for?]

3639
02:53:31,830 --> 02:53:34,240
And?

3640
02:53:37,640 --> 02:53:41,130
Really?
