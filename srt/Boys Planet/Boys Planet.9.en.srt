[The recruiting teams are visiting Team "Over Me" next]

179
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,670
If we pick someone, he has to join us without resisting.

180
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,310
Oh...

181
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,240
I can't let them see me.

[Starting to hide]

183
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,290
If you choose me, you need to give me the Killing Part.

184
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,240
That's okay.

185
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,920
Sorry.

186
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,390

188

Actually we don't get to choose.

[Relieved]

190
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,160
Team "Switch" really needs a main vocalist.

191
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,500
I'd be really happy to have Jay. Right?

192
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,990
I've performed with him. He's really good.

193
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,470
I thought we could give a great performance together.

194
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,060
You get to be the main vocalist and you get a big part, too.

195
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,070
[He's having a change of heart]

196

198
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,110
[It's Seok Matthew's signature line]

199
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,830
[What's Na Camden's version like?]

[Suddenly realized what he was doing]

202
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,020
Camden normally doesn't go this far.

203
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,500
I really want to perform with Jay before I die.

204
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,050
[We already did once]

205
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,760
[The two teams are leaving after their pitch]

206

I really hope we get Jay.

207

The song really suits me. I want to do it.

208
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,290
I don' think they'd give up on Ricky.

209
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,620
The song suits him.

210
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,650
- I created a rap part at the beginning of the second verse.
- I think Jung Hyeon might come out.

211
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,940
I really poured my everything into it.

212
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,960
The costume, stage design,

213
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,130
choreography, and structure. We just need to keep going with them.

214
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,690
You think Jong Woo might come?

215
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,700
But he has a responsibility as a leader.

216
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,260
If he played a big part as a leader,

217
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,100
he can't easily leave.

218
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,970

235
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,370
The first one I thought of was Jay.

236
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,550
The next one is Zhang Hao.

237

It's those five.

241
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,400
I was disappointed. I worked so hard on it.

242
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,540
I stayed up all night thinking and sorting things out as the leader.

243
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,910
I came up with a schedule, too.

244
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,600
But I got nothing in return.

245
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,820
Was it all a waste?

246
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,380
It's such a disaster.

247
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,350

- Wow!

Someone has to leave right now.

272
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,650

00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,240
[He got pushed out of the team he wanted in Dual Position Battle, too]

353
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,030
[I'm sorry]

354
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,450
He's a bit of a slow learner.

355
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,800
I picked Takuto...

356
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,570
I was sad.

357
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,410
Seo Won and Ollie...

358
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,170
I got zero votes.

359
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,730
[Wang Zi Hao got voted out of Team "Over Me"]

360
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,900
[The new Team "Super Charger" was created]

361
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,860
I was originally in Team "Super Charger."

362
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,540
I thought I should help everyone.

363
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,360
I'll do my best as the leader.

364
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,760
Thank you.

365
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,530
We need to distribute the parts.

366
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,330
[Watching "Super Charger" choreography video first]

367
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,900
[The tight choreography doesn't allow you to rest at all]

368
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,740
It's so hard.

369
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,830
The flow is difficult.

370
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,700
["Super Charger" is a difficult song that everyone was afraid to choose]

371
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,690
[The messed up during the self-assessment despite how much they practiced]

372
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,740
I'm embarrassed.

373
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,510
Aigoo, they must be upset.

374
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,230
Oh my god!

375
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,360
It's really, really, really hard.

376
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,550
Not only that, we're all used to doing upbeat songs,

377
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,110
but we ended up with a dark hip-hop song.

378
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,860
It won't be easy to bring out those qualities.

379
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,500
[The cuties got to perform a dark hip-hop song, "Super Charger"]

380
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,840
So cute!

381
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,170
The concept is so different from our image.

382
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,590
It's so hard and...

383
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,800
I don't think I can pull off "Super Charger" at all.

384
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,110
[Super discouraged]

385
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,770
[The other teams are busy practicing]

386
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,710
[There's a team that's still having a meeting?]

387
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,900
[Team "Super Charger" is still distributing parts]

388
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,680
Let's start with the Killing Part.

389
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,530
Who wants to volunteer?

390
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,890
Who wants the Killing Part?

391
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,130
I do.

392
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,760
[They have to compete because a lot of people want it]

393
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,870
[Some even demand it childishly]

394
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,590
[They're hesitating because they're not used to the song yet]

395
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,440
[Wang Zi Hao carefully decided to speak up]

396
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,200
Haruto is used to the choreography of this song

397
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,030
and I think he's good enough to do the Killing Part.

398
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,430
There isn't enough of time to practice.

399
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:22,010
I don't have the confidence to do the Killing Part.

400
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,240
[They're recommending Haruto to do the Killing Part since he practiced longer]

401
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
[The teammates let Haruto to take the Killing Part, as well]

402
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,670
I got to do the Killing Part

403
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,870
and I'll be the leader for the first time, too.

404
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,040
I felt a bit pressured to do both alone.

405
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,960
Shall we just get it over with?

406
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,950
I think...

407
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,100
I thought it'd suit Wang Zi Hao.

408
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,620
Sub-rapper 1.

409
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,220
2 is Ollie.

410
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,010
Sub-rapper 3, Takuto.

411
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,490
Oong Gi will be the main rapper.

412
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,390
Yes, I'll work hard.

413
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,920
I think it was distributed well based on

414
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,430
everyone's characteristics.

415
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,420
I think we just need to practice a lot.

416
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,840
In the beginning... Super.

417
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,980
[This looks familiar]

418
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,640
[Team "Super Charger" is having a new start with the same moves, but with different members]

419
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,020
There wasn't enough time.

420
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,960
We had a huge disadvantage.

421
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,350
[Takuto can't catch up with the difficult choreography]

422
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,830
[1:1 lesson started immediately]

423
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,080
And then, this. That's right! Okay.

424
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,440
[They're trying it together this time]

425
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,290
[Ollie missed a beat]

426
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,700
[Looking]

427
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,400
[Awkward]

428
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,050
I keep messing it up!

429
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,220
[Takuto is out of it]

430
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,320
- It's not easy.
- It's not easy.

431
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,990
[Even Seo Won messed up]

432

[Looking intensely]

433
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
[The moves are too difficult to learn in a short period of time]

434
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,670
It feels hopeless.

435
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,340
I don't think we could give a good performance.

436
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,440
I'm worried about that the most.

437
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,760
[Four hours before the training]

438
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,820
[Team "Say My Name's" studio is silent]

439
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,820
Really?

440
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,230
If only I knew,

441
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:41,030
I would've been better off to join Team "Switch."

442
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,860
No?

443
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:51,380
I feel like you guys are ditching me a bit.

444
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:00,530
[Matthew started crying]

445
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:07,430
[And he ended up leaving the room]

446

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,760
[Right after the team reshuffling]

449
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,440
Now that our team is complete, let's just focus on the performance and move forward.

450
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,820
Okay, okay.

451
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,440
We need to redistribute parts.

452
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,130
Let's start with the Killing Part. Yoo Jin did the Killing Part originally.

453
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:50,420
Ollie and Yoo Jin will do the Killing Part.

454
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,450
I noticed that Yoo Jin came up with a lot of

455
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:58,480
gestures that suit the song midway through the song.

456
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,380
- It worked well.
- I also think

457
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,600
Yoo Jin would look nice in the center, too.

458
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,160
I think Yoo Jin should do the Killing Part, too.

459
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,450
Yoo Jin will continue supporting us. Let's move on!

460
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,560
Thank you!

461
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,750
I got the Killing Part.

462
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,390
I've never done a Killing Part before. I was so happy.

463
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,150
Really? This is your first time?

464
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,500
- Wow.
- I thought you always did the Killing Parts.

465
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,760
I thought you always did the Killing Parts.

466
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,230
I'll be responsible and work hard since I got it.

467
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,910
The biggest problem right now is...

468
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,280
It's our first challenge.

469
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,590
The biggest challenge.

470
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,170
The main vocalist.

471
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,950
Who wants to be the main vocalist?

472
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,130
Raise your hands.

473
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,320
We should discuss what to do with the main vocalist part.

474
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,330
The main vocalist of this song should lead the choreography

475
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,710
rather than showing off vocal skills.

476
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:05,110
[The main vocalists lead the choreography a lot]

477
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,830
I think it's about getting the feel right.

478
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:13,150
I think Han Bin should be the main vocalist.

479
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,590
Of course, I wanted it.

480
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:22,440
But I thought things would go smoothly if I just switch my position.

481
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,060
So I didn't go for it.

482
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,510
Next is sub vocalist 1.

483
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:30,260
It was originally Matthew's part.

484
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,810
[Sub-vocalist 1 has the second biggest part next to the main vocalist]

485
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,410
But there's Seung Eon, too.

486
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,010
What do you think, Seung Eon?

487
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:47,240
[Yoo Seung Eon didn't go for the main vocalist part]

488
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,530
I think Matthew fits in that part well.

489
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,270
Matthew fits in that part well.

490
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,740
Matthew will continue to be the sub-vocalist 1.

491
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,160
I'm so thankful right now.

492
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:10,670
I was thinking of asking him if he wants to give it a try.

493
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,920
But sub-vocalist 1 was the part I wanted the most.

494
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,090
Let's move on to sub-vocalist 1.

495
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,190
Raise your hand if you want it.

496
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:29,240
I thought it'd be weird to tell him to go for it, too.

497
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,080
Were you afraid he'd just take it?

498
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,630
I was a bit scared because he's so good.

499
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,780
Thank you.

500
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:42,890
[Sub-vocalist 1 is Seok Matthew]

501
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,160
Let's stick with the original plan for the rest.

502
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,740
Let's go for one last time.

503
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,260
[Team "Say My Name" started vocal training]

504
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,540
[Sung Han Bin seems to be worried about something]

505
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,280
Seung Eon and Matthew should've tried out the parts to see which one suit them the most.

506
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,010
But I'm still not used to negotiating things.

507
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:14,980
We tried to move fast rather than trying to redistribute parts.

508
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,680
Seung Eon, can you do this part well?

509
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,960
It's hard because it's so low.

510
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:28,390
[Seung Eon and Matthew struggled with the parts]

511
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,700
I have a lot of regrets.

512

[Four hours before the training]

513
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,860
[Team "Say My Name" is in the middle of the vocal practice]

514

[Thinking hard]

515
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,980
Should we sort things out for a minute and try one more time?

516
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,520
Let's sort things out for a moment.

517
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,690
Do we not have time to switch parts now?

518
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,990
Do we not have time to switch parts now?

519
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,100
- Which ones?
- Seung Eon an Matthew.

520
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,490
I'd like to listen to them singing each other's parts.

521
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,500
Sounds good.

522
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,390
I was worried about that, too.

523
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,990
I thought we should talk about it.

524
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:12,930
Matthew, could you sing the sub-vocalist 2 part, by chance?

525
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,370
- Me?
- Yeah.

526
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:20,120
I want Matthew to sing vocalist 2 part and Seung Eon to sing vocalist 1 part

527
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,680
and see how that would be.

528
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,780
This is kind of my fault. We should've tried singing all the parts yesterday.

529
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,290
But we moved on without doing that.

530
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,840
Let's switch 1 and 2.

531
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,450
[Sub-vocalist 1, Yoo Seung Eon]

532
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,870
[Sub-vocalist 2, Seok Matthew]

533
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:57,620
After listening to that, maybe Seong Eon should be the sub-vocalist 1...

534
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,120
I couldn't understand it. What...

535
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,540
Why?

536
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,850
Sub-vocalist 1 and the main vocalist are kind of basic.

537
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:10,230
Sub-vocalist 2 has more character

538
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,140
and more upbeat.

539
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,930
Since Matthew has a lot of character, if he becomes sub-vocalist 2,

540
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,610
the whole team will shine more, too.

541
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:22,120
You're currently the sub-vocalist 1, so...

542
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,200
This isn't a hidden camera, is it?

543
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,800
It's not. It really isn't!

544
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,770
- We don't have time.
- I can kind of tell.

545
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,310
- No?
- This is for real!

546
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,610
- Really?
- It really isn't a hidden camera.

547
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,290
Really?

548
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,250
I'd be doomed, then.

549
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,880
I'd be doomed, then.

550
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,950
Why?

551
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,830
I'd be doomed if I become sub-vocalist 2.

552
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:52,810
Seong Eon is sub-vocalist 2, but he's good at adlibs.

553
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,820
He can shine in that part.

554
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,300
[Yoo Seung Eon is doing improvising a high-pitched part]

555
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,680
I can't do stuff like that.

556
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,380
If I become sub-vocalist 2, I'd...

557
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,380
just be gone! There's nothing! I can't do it.

558
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,710
I'm just someone passing by.

559
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,280
I'd just be like, "Hello."

560
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,070
It'd mess up all the moves. But I thought we should

561
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:23,730
change quickly if we're going to and go with it.

562
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,950
We have a training session today, too.

563
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,850
I think this is a hidden camera.

564
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,380
No, no.

565
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,800
It's not a hidden camera, Matthew. We really mean it.

566
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,510
For real?

567
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:39,340
[What would Team "Say My Name's" destiny be like?]

568
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,120
[Which team came to the studio next?]

569
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,850
We should get started quickly and leave.

570
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,010
Let's distribute the parts.

571
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,940
Who wants the Killing Part?

572
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,800
[Killing Part should definitely go to Yoon Jong Woo?]

573
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,870
[He started in the 73th place in the first week]

574
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,180
[But he left a strong impression by doing Killing Part in "Back Door"]

575
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,380
[His ranking started skyrocketing]

576
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,020
[Now he's currently on 15th place]

577
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,000
Okay!

578
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,590
I won't do it.

579
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,770
I felt a mix of emotions.

580
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:14,580
But the level of confidence is determined by how many hours you practiced.

581
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,490
I don't have the confidence right now.

582
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:23,270
I just want to be good enough to be on stage right now.

583
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,680
That's what I'm thinking.

584
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,010
I do.

585
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,260
[Park Han Bin volunteered to do the Killing Part]

586
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,990
I've only wanted the Killing Part since I picked the song.

587
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,270
I've only proved myself as a leader.

588
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,600
But I've never been in the center of the stage.

589
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,900
Also, I needed to practice on my own

590
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,600
but I had to worry about my teammates.

591
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,150
So I didn't get a chance to shine on stage.

592
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:53,660
So my goal is to get the Killing Part this time.

593
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,420
Me, too.

594
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,630

[He's showing off his skills by adding facial expressions]

602
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,210
How much did he practice?

603
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,700
[Even the finish was perfect]

604
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,010
You practiced this instead of practicing "En Garde," right?

605
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,340
- I just love this one.
- I see.

606

Let me try to persuade you one last time before we vote!

611

- I'm so desperate!
- Okay, okay!

612
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,720
I joined Team "Switch" because I really wanted the Killing Part.

613
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,940
I gave up "En Garde" and...

614
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,580

This is my first time doing Killing Part.

622
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,420
Of course, there's pressure.

But I'll work as hard as I can.

624

- Of course, not.
- Okay!

Did you practice a bit?

1648

We tried our best to practice up to the verse 1.

First, you've gone through a lot.

1662
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:33,450
Honestly, from watching you guys once like this,

1663
01:25:33,450 --> 01:25:36,440
I don't have any feedback

1664
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:38,850
that I can give you,

1665
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:41,250
since it's lacking preparation.

1666
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:43,330
Since you guys have only had 12 hours to practice,

1667
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:46,030
I'm taking that into account as I'm watching,

1668
01:25:46,030 --> 01:25:48,720
but if you keep going like this, you should be anxious.

1669
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,260
- We would have to be anxious.
- Yes.

1670
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:54,370
If it keeps going like this.

1671
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,060
I would rather have them scold us.

1672
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:01,600
We weren't even at the level where they could scold us,

1673
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:06,440
and they just felt bad for us.

1674
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,570
First, you guys should just learn it.

1675
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:10,490
It's a waste of time to be talking, so just learn.

1676
01:26:10,490 --> 01:26:14,160
When I first made this choreo, I focused less of the moves themselves

1677
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:16,230
and more on expressing the vibe.

1678
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:19,620
The vibe is supposed to be a bit dark

1679
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:21,490
rather than a bright vibe.

1680
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:24,750
This is your part, right?

1681
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:26,990

1716

but we're lacking in time compared to them.

1717
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:52,270
But the shooting date isn't going to be pushed back because of that.

1718
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:54,730

- No.

So, thinking like that is up to you,

but there are many people who were eliminated.

1737
01:28:37,330 --> 01:28:40,140
It's not respectful for those guys.

- But you're not even considering it.
- What?

2259

It's already been decided.

2260
02:01:15,020 --> 02:01:17,810
I have no choice for some reason.

2261
02:01:17,810 --> 02:01:19,560
Rather than switching because of those reasons,

2262
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:21,750
I think you should also understand why

2263
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:23,550
and adjust our opinions together

2264

If I wanted to do the part from the beginning,

2267
02:01:39,850 --> 02:01:43,020
I should've brought it up first.

2268
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:44,800
But I didn't want to be greedy

2269
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:48,250
so I took the part that was available.

2270
02:01:48,250 --> 02:01:51,680
I feel really bad toward Matthew hyung, too.

2271
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:55,720
Seung Eon, you have no reason to feel sorry.

2272
02:01:55,720 --> 02:01:58,530

This is personal for me.

2279
02:02:36,490 --> 02:02:40,600
The reason I wanted to sing sub vocal 1 was because...

2280
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:43,470
more than half of the lyrics are in English.

2281
02:02:43,470 --> 02:02:46,790
