You'll be taking on two positions instead of one in this mission.

00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,610
This is the first position of the Dual Position Battle.

136

By rearranging a song with captivating singing and rapping,

138

149

150
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,880
That sounds the most difficult.

151
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,940
You need to remember that you're performing live.

152
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,130
One thing all positions have in common is that we have to perform live.

153
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,030
It'd be very challenging.

154

- I thought that there was nothing he couldn't do if he tried,

706
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:57,200
so I agreed to it right away.

707
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,580
Our "Love Killa" Team's killing part...

708
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,750
goes to Hyung!

709
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,770
The aura and visuals were more important

710
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,370
and I thought that I could teach him English pronunciation,

711
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:12,210
so I thought that it would be better to give the part to Ji Woong hyung.

712
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:16,160
But it did hurt. I really wanted to do it, too.

713
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,410
[The next team to start preparing for the vocal and dance position mission is...]

714
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:23,150
Finally, our team is established!

715
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,840
Yeah!

716
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,630
I love our team.

717
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,550
Our team is quite balanced.

718
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,550
Really?

719
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,020
Be quiet!

720
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,120
We have two members from Group G and two from Group K.

721
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,040
[A perfect ratio, just like half-and-half chicken]

722
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,800
It's exactly two to two.

723
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,970
[Breaks out laughing]

724
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,790
Also, only the pretty guys are here.

725
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,980
Everyone's pretty.

726
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,380
Pretty, pretty, and pretty.

727
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,300
[Lowers their head at the pretty attack]

728
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:55,500
But I feel like all the other teams in the same vocal and dance positions will do really well,

729
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,790
so that worries me.

730
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,990
Everyone on our team is in danger of having to go home based on their rank,

731
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,990
so that's what worries me the most.

732
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:05,800
[The "Feel Special" Team listens to the song before the parts distribution]

733
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:10,310
["Feel Special" is the only girl group song among the vocal and dance position songs.]

734
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,980
[Tries singing it]

735
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,190
♫ Even if it pierces me ♫

736
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,300
[The team members are struggling with the high key]

737
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,600
I can't sing it.

738
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,300
[They keep trying.]

739
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,040
- Do you want to do the main vocals?
- No.

740
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,810
I can't.

741
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,620
- How about you?
- No.

742
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,660
I really don't want to do it.

743
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,640
I wonder if I chose the song too impulsively.

744
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,600
It didn't seem like it was a key that I could reach.

745
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:48,000
I think I would only be able to do this part.

746
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,340
The only part you can sing is this part, "Everything's alright"?

747
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,650
Yes, you guys can do all the other parts.

748
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,610
[Thinking]

749
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,940
So the important thing is confidence.

750
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,950
if we try singing it even if it doesn't come out right...

751
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,450
[Ends up hiding behind the lyrics sheet the more he sings the high parts.]

752
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:11,450
[Even Lee Dong Gun, the main vocalist of the "Hot Sauce" Team, gives up]

753
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,680
[About to cry]

754
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,150
I really can't do it.

755
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,180
Based on our ranks, this could be our last stage.

756
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,730
Everyone should want to sing more lines

757
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,500
and want to stand in the center one more time!

758
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,740
My skills are too lacking,

759
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,550
so I'll do sub-vocal 3.

760
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,580
I mean, this could be our very last performance!

761
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:38,570
Gosh, this is the first time I've ever had to beg people to take parts!

762
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,430
I expected a scenario where people competed for parts,

763
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,250
but they were pushing away parts instead.

764
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,620
So I worried about how we could move forward...

765
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:50,310
[Will the "Feel Special" Team be able to complete the parts distribution successfully?]

766
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,710
Let me know if there is a part you're confident about and want to take.

767
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,790
I'm confident in any part.

768
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,440
I'm also confident in every part except for the chorus.

769
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,220
- What about you, Jay?
- I'm confident in any part where you sing in chest voice.

770
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,560
I'm not worried about our vocals.

771
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,560
All four of you are so good at singing.

772
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,140
I've performed with Yun Seo before, so I know about him.

773
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,240
[Ji Yun Seo even performed at M Countdown as the main vocalist of "Back Door."]

774

[Yoo Seung Eon demonstrated his refreshing voice as the main vocalist of "VERY NICE"]

776

He's got a vibe that no one can imitate.

780
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,060
I was not sure whether I should go to "Butterfly" or "Home,"

781
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,390
but when I saw Jong Woo hyung pick this, I knew I should come here.

782
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,300
Really?

783
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,490
Why are you guys doing this to me?

784
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:48,160
If you do this, I'll start thinking that I did well to not get into the "Love Killa" Team.

785
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,980
Honestly, I really wanted to do Love Killa.

786
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,540
Please go and stand in the place of the trainee whose place you want to take.

789
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,480
I'm sorry.

790
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,400

I was quite upset.

794

If my rank was a bit higher,

795
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,410
wouldn't I be there with them?

796
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:21,240
At first, I went to the middle and took a look at all the teams.

797
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:26,620
But the team that had good members and a good song was "Home."

798
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,270
I thought that I would be able to make this stage the best.

799
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,950
My goal is to go up to being a candidate to win.

800

Because everything was good except for the unstable notes.
