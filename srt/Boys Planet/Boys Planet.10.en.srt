- Matthew.
- He was the sub vocalist 1,

907

[The teammates suddenly suggested switching positions]

909

I understand that you want to keep your position,

910

but you're not a solo artist.

911

Not yet?

We have to be judged by the Masters so we can do well on stage.

920

Let's practice just one time.

921

Okay.

926
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,240
Should we practice the formation first?

After hearing hurtful words,

932
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:29,050
I had to start practicing right away. That was...

933
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:31,320
kind of hard.

934
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,860
I told him for the team. But I wondered if I shouldn't have.

935
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:38,140
How should I treat Matthew from now on?

We've been practicing more than a week,

948

967
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,440
You need to be able to act out the mood that fits the song,

968
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,160
but because that's lacking right now, your performance is less convincing.

So I considered all day today whether I should talk to you or not.

1019

In any case, I should apologize to you

I understand.

You said we should change the parts because you felt that would lead to a better performance, Hyung.

1023

The reason why I wanted to get the sub-vocal 1 part

1024

is a very selfish one.

1025

It feels like none of us were comfortable

1399
01:17:56,870 --> 01:18:00,880
with the team balance or our individual parts.

1400
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,790
- Okay.
- Like this?

1401
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:04,520
[They begin their dance training with many issues]

1402
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,430
[They start having problems with the rotations from the start]

1403
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:15,110
[They try to move forward for now...]

1404
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,840
[A close call]

1405
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,770
Ricky! Move up.

1406
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:23,820
[The shaky rotation movements continue]

1407
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,570
Move up.

1408
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:31,410
Oh, sorry!

1409
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:33,740
[They up making a major mistake of bumping into each other]

1410
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:35,630
[Master Back Koo Young checks the situation carefully]

1411
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:41,180
[They commit even more mistakes as they progress with with the choreo.]

1412
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,020
["Over Me" Team wasn't able to show good results despit the time they spent practicing.]

1413
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,450
Gosh...

1414
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:52,100
You guys all wanted to do "Over Me," right?

1415
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,820
Yes.

1416
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:56,660
[The sighs that they dread more than negative feedback continue]

1417
01:18:56,660 --> 01:19:00,430
[Nervous]

1418
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:02,360
Didn't you guys practice for a week?

1419
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,820
Yes...

1420
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:08,290
You just folded up a week's worth of time and threw it away.

1421
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:09,900
You just wasted it.

1422
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,260
[Zhang Hao grows deep in thought after Master Back Koo Young's negative feedback.]

1423
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:13,630
Because this choreo has slow sections,

1424
01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:14,970
if the moves aren't synchronized,

1425
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:17,120
then it sticks out. It's really easy to tell.

1426
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:21,000
[Everyone was all over the place with the angle of their motions]

1427
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,650
[The same goes for how high or low they go for their moves]

1428
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:27,450
Unless you move perfectly in sync,

1429
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:31,050
you will immediately get a B when the audience votes.

1430
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:34,960
If "Over Me" Team was disappointing, please press B.

1431
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,920
[On-site voting system]
[If it was a good performance, press the A button.]
[If it was a disappointing performance, press the B button.]

1432
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:39,550
B...

1433
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:42,470
I was worried and wondered

1434
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:44,740
if it was right for me to be the leader.

1435
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:49,560
Since Hao is the leader,

1436
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,200
please lead the practices well.

1437
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:56,290
Things vary considerably depending on how the leader leads the practices.

1438
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:58,170
- Okay?
- Yes.

1439
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:00,320
[After the team received continuous negative feedback]

1440
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,510
What are you concerned about?

1441
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:05,510
[Zhang Hao requested a consultation with Master Solji.]

1442
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:07,050
Being a leader is hard, right?

1443
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:09,050
It's hard. Yes, it was so hard.

1444
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:12,840
Honestly, I thought of multiple different ways to do it,

1445
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,020
but I am concerned about which way would I should lead them.

1446
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,990
When there isn't a lot of time like this,

1447
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:19,600
you have to get rid of some of your emotions.

1448
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,010
You have to be more level-headed and firm.

1449
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:23,000
There's too much work to be done

1450
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,410
for us to think about everyone's feelings right now.

1451
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:28,370
I think it's necessary for you

1452
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:29,640
to become a bit more level-headed and firm.

1453
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:30,980
Yes.

1454
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:34,360
The leader needs to stay firmly grounded.

1455
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:38,990
I was honestly a bit lacking as a leader in that aspect.

1456
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:41,510
[Next morning]

1457

[The team members arrive at the practice time]

1460
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,050
After I finish setting up the rotations by myself,

1461
01:20:56,050 --> 01:21:01,260
I will teach them perfectly.

1462
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:04,090
Ricky, the back center. The two of you, switch.

1464

Okay, Jay, come up a bit more.

1465
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:09,030
Yeah, this is it, this is it.

1466

["Over Me" Team slowly begins to practice synchronizing their choreo]

1467

- Okay.
- Yes.

I want all five members to shine.

1474

I'm going to hold onto them as the leader

1475
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:38,490

- We'll start with Ricky.
- Yes, sir.

1479

Is this how you're going to record?

[Ricky received the most criticism during the vocal training.]

1481
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:55,610
It feels like you're barely trying.

Okay. Your pronunciation is much better than I thought.

He's really good though.

1492
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,800
You emphasized the words "feel" and "fill it up" so well.

1493
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,950
The way you're lowering the last note was

1494

01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:15,290
Not only that, they'll also get a chance to hold a fan meeting.

1740
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:17,070
My gosh!

1741
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:18,170
A fan meeting.

1742
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:19,480
I want to do this the most.

1743
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:21,630
The special benefit is like a foretaste of debuting.

1744
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:23,990
Exactly. It's experiencing the life of an idol.

1745
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:25,530
I want to hear the results quickly.

1746
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:28,730
This won't be easy because everyone did great.

1747
01:36:28,730 --> 01:36:33,200
Which team will be the winner of Artist Battle?

1748
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:36,860
- If it's based on the crowd's reaction on-site, then I think "SuperCharger" had a big reaction.
- Yes.

1749
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:42,100
["SuperCharger" gave an explosive performance.]

1750
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:43,260
Our team needs to take this benefit.

1751
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:45,200
I hope it's us.

1752
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:48,030
Honestly, I'd like to win "Over Me."

1753
01:36:48,030 --> 01:36:50,090
Will it be "Over Me?"

1754
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:51,510
[Dropping his head]

1755
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:54,220
I wasn't feeling very hopeful.

1756
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:57,870
Because "Say My Name" and "En Garde"

1757
01:36:57,870 --> 01:37:01,410
did a fantastic job on stage.

1758
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:02,910
I feel like it'll be Team "En Garde" who wins.

1759
01:37:02,910 --> 01:37:05,000
It could be "Say My Name" too.

1760
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:13,530
["Say My Name" was bubbly and refreshing which gained them a lot of cheers.]

1761
01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:16,960
I think our team will win first place.

1762
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:20,580
If we don't come in first,

1763
01:37:20,580 --> 01:37:23,270
then I think it'll be Team "En Garde."

1764
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:31,700
["En Garde" gave a charismatic performance that was powerful.]

1765
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:35,590
- Please.
- Shout, "En Garde is number one."

1766
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:41,630
- "En Garde is number one."
- "En Garde is number one."

1767
01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:42,980
- Stop.
- All right.

1768
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:47,110
All right, let's find out the results now.

1769
01:37:47,110 --> 01:37:50,320
I just hope the result will be good.

1770
01:37:53,390 --> 01:37:55,310
They revealed it all at once.

1771
01:37:55,310 --> 01:37:56,900
Seeing how "Switch" is the first,

1772
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:58,440
I get a bad feeling.

1773
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:01,360
No, they placed it in order.

1774
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:05,000
I'll reveal Team "Switch's" result first.

1775
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,130
What do we do?

1776
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:08,700
I think they'll be in the 700s.

1777
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:11,300
Maybe around 800?

1778
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:13,720
What?

1779
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:14,890
What?

1780
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:17,030
[The trainees are shocked by the low score.]

1781
01:38:17,030 --> 01:38:18,660
This is...

1782
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,220
[Switch: 432 points]

1783
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:22,570
[Team "Switch's" final scores is 432 points.]

1784
01:38:22,570 --> 01:38:24,480
Their final score is 432 points.

1785
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,700
- What do we do?
- But we don't know the standard.

1786
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:28,410
We don't know the standard yet.

1787
01:38:28,410 --> 01:38:30,530
- Is that okay?
- I don't know.

1788
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:32,510
I have absolutely no idea.

1789
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:36,060
Team "SuperCharger's" result.

1790
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:39,990
We need to get more than 432 points.

1791
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:41,840
I really don't want to come in last.

1792
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,140
Our team needs the benefit.

1793
01:38:44,140 --> 01:38:45,200
What's the result?

1794
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:47,330
[What is Team "SuperCharger's" final score?]

1795
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:49,600
[Team "SuperCharger's" final score is 470 points.]

1796
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,820
- That's high.
- You really don't know.

1797
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:55,870
470 points seems high.

1798
01:38:55,870 --> 01:38:58,050
Their final score is 470 points.

1799
01:38:58,050 --> 01:39:00,990
We have a chance.

1800
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:03,180
We lost.

1801
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:04,580
We lost.

1802
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:06,920
There was quite a bit of difference.

1803
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:10,080
As soon as I saw that I thought, "Oh, we're last."

1804
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:14,770
Gosh...

1805
01:39:14,770 --> 01:39:16,500
Why?

1806
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,150
Why am I asking that?

1807
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:20,030
Team "Over Me's" result.

1808
01:39:20,030 --> 01:39:21,280
They're revealing it right away.

1809
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,080
Please.

1810
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:25,900
Please.

1811
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:27,170
[Zhang Hao came in first with the same score as "SuperCharger's" Haruto.]

1812
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:28,490
We need to see their score.

1813
01:39:28,490 --> 01:39:30,560
I think they'll get over 500 points.

1814
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:36,590
[They received a lot of applause from the Star Creators.]

1815
01:39:36,590 --> 01:39:38,760
Please.

1816
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:41,770
Will Chen Kuan Jui come in first?

1817
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:44,780
I really want to go on "M Countdown."

1818
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:46,350
I'm so desperate.

1819
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:50,560
[What is Team "Over Me's" final score?]

1820
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:51,540
[Shocked]

1821
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:54,670
Wow.

1822
01:39:54,670 --> 01:39:57,140
[Team "Over Me's" final score is 621 points.]

1823
01:39:57,140 --> 01:39:58,690
[They're shocked to see a team get a score in the 600s.]

1824
01:39:58,690 --> 01:39:59,620
It's 621 points.

1825
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:01,070
[The trainees are shocked by the large difference in points.]

1826
01:40:01,070 --> 01:40:02,390
- They're on another level.
- We can't even compare to them.

1827
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:04,090
- We can't go up against them.
- They're on another level.

1828
01:40:04,090 --> 01:40:07,320
- We don't even compare.
- The first two digits are different.

1829
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:09,320
The difference is this big?

1830
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:10,600
- That's a strong score.
- Please.

1831
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:13,660
- Please.
- Their final score is 621 points.

1832
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:15,610
- 621 points?
- We can do it.

1833
01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:18,840
I wish "Say My Name" will win instead.

1834
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:21,560
We can surpass 621 points, Yu Jin.

1835
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:24,890
- Don't get our hopes up like this.
- Seriously.

1836
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:27,450
- It's not over until it's over.
- It's not over.

1837
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:30,160
Honestly, I think this is a battle between "Say My Name" and "En Garde."

1838
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:31,680
It's a battle between those two teams.

1839
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:32,830
[The two teams most likely to win.]

1840
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:36,300
First place...

1841
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:37,430
I'm so nervous.

1842
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:39,020
I really want to have a fan meeting.

1843
01:40:39,020 --> 01:40:40,770
I really did my best

1844
01:40:40,770 --> 01:40:43,770
and I think our performance reflected it.

1845
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:46,980
I am very confident.

1846
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:49,380
Please.

1847
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:51,720
Please.

1848
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,890
- But we need to be prepared.
- Yes.

1849
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:56,550
- They could score higher than us.
- Please.

1850
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:58,590
- What will it be?
- Please.

1851
01:40:58,590 --> 01:41:00,060
I think their score will be in the 7 to 800s.

1852
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:01,720
- I agree.
- It has to be low.

1853
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:03,340
I'm sorry to say this, but their score has to be low.

1854
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:04,530
[My heart...]

1855
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:10,540
[Will Team "Say My Name's" score surpass Team "Over Me's?"]

1856
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:13,320
Wow...

1857
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:17,310
[We can't read the trainees' reactions.]

1858
01:41:17,310 --> 01:41:19,110
612 points!

1859
01:41:19,110 --> 01:41:20,850
Team "Over Me" won.

1860
01:41:20,850 --> 01:41:22,480
Wow...

1861
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,250
"Over Me."

1862
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:26,210
How disappointing.

1863
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:31,080
You fought well.

1864
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:33,110
"Over Me" won.

1865
01:41:33,110 --> 01:41:35,710
Seriously? What are we going to do?

1866
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:37,160
I think our team will win for real!

1867
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:38,720
Please.

1868
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:40,260
So we're fighting against "Over Me?"

1869
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:42,850
- Daebak.
- Hold on. What is going on?

1870
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:44,590
- What a shame.
- That was close.

1871
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:46,460
- It's okay.
- Will "En Garde" win?

1872
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:48,770
Jung Hyun! Pray!

1873
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:50,460
- Jung Hyun hyung put your hands together.
- Please.

1874
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:52,110
- Hold up.
- Please.

1875
01:41:52,110 --> 01:41:53,990
We had the least time...

1876
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:56,300
- to practice.
- to practice.

1877
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:58,030
Why did you say it simultaneously?

1878
01:41:58,030 --> 01:42:01,490
Lastly, it's Team "En Garde's" result.

1879
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:03,530
Please.

1880
01:42:03,530 --> 01:42:05,560
Please let us get first place.

1881
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:08,980
Please let our score be the highest.

1882
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:11,940
Will Team "En Garde"

1883
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:15,680
be able to score higher than Team "Over Me?"

1884
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:17,500
I think "En Garde" will win for sure.

1885
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:20,200
The current trainee in first place is

1886
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:21,930
Zhang Hao from the winning team.

1887
01:42:21,930 --> 01:42:25,960
[Zhang Hao showed his powerful presence as the killing part of "Over Me."]

1888
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:31,000
Will trainee Zhang Hao take the individual benefit of 200,000 points?

1889
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,100
Or will trainee Kim Gyu Vin

1890
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,160
be the winning trainee of the team

1891
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:41,150
and take the benefit for himself?

1892
01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:42,930
A total benefit of 400,000 points,

1893
01:42:42,930 --> 01:42:45,430
the chance to perform on "M Countdown,"

1894
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:48,130
I want to go on "M Countdown" with my team!

1895
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:50,820
and also the chance to hold a fan meeting.

1896
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:53,550
It all comes down to Team "En Garde's" result

1897
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:56,600
on who will enjoy all these benefits.

1898
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,950
Gyu Vin got the individual benefit last time.

1899
01:42:58,950 --> 01:43:00,530
Zhang Hao hyung did too.

1900
01:43:00,530 --> 01:43:03,070
Team "En Garde's" result.

1901
01:43:03,070 --> 01:43:04,330
Don't get your hopes up.

1902
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:05,680
[Stop beating so hard, my heart.]

1903
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:08,670
The final winner of Artist Battle!

1904
01:43:08,670 --> 01:43:12,150
[What will the two teams' fate be?]

1905
01:43:13,890 --> 01:43:15,990
[The trainees are shocked by the final result.]

1906
01:43:19,490 --> 01:43:22,030
Team "En Garde's" result.

1907
01:43:22,030 --> 01:43:23,550
I'm so curious.

1908
01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:25,500
- I want go to "M Countdown."
- Me too.

1909
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:27,910
