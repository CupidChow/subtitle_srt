180
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,170
Thank you, Star Creators!

181
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,790
I got chills. My gosh.

182
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,710
Soley based on the Star Creators' votes,

183
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,960
52 trainees, starting from the 1st place and 52nd place will survive.

184
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,690
And 41 trainees, starting from the 53rd place to 93rd place, will get eliminated.

185
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,370
I really don't want to go home.

186
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,860
It's too cruel.

187
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,550
I need to survive.

188
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,000
And the top 9 represents the debut group.

189
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,450
Who will end up taking these nine seats for the first time?

190
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,510
- Wow.
- The top 9 stage is as pretty as ever.

191
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,930
I can't wait to find out who will end up sitting there.

192
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,010
It'd be so nice to sit there.

193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,200
The trainee who wins the 1st place in the top 9

194
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,000
will get the Killing Part in the debut song

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,430
and get a solo song in the debut album.

196
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,210
He will be rewarded with these amazing perks.

197
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,720
- Wow!
- Solo?

198
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,530
A solo song in the debut album?

199
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,280
Seriously, how?

200
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,720
That's so Daebak.

201
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,790
You get to have a solo song as soon as you debut.

202
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,500
Would Sung Han Bin win the 1st place like he always has?

203
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,440
I don't know.

204
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,350
Seven teams won the last K vs. G Group Battle

205
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,430
and each team took 100,000 scores as a benefit.

206
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,000
After adding up the group scores, the entire Group K

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,020
ended up getting the extra 10,000 scores from the benefit.

208
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,800
What a relief.

209
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,020
How did the benefit scores affect the individual results?

210
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,340
Let's find out starting now.

211
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,060
Oh my gosh.

212
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,710
Here comes the ranking.

213
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,930
For the Boys Planet's first result announcement,

214
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,550
Teams K and G of the K vs. G Group Battle will step forward.

215
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,110
The 11 trainees who qualify for the top 9 in each team and

216
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:17,570
the rest of the survivors up to the 52nd place will be announced in the order of ranking.

217
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,930
Therefore, if your name hasn't been called,

218
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,340
you could survive by either potentially making the top 9, or ending up in the 52nd place.

219
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,050
I desperately want to be in the 52nd place.

220
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,190
We can't lose hope until the end.

221
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,380
So cruel.

222
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,050
After the all teams hear the results,

223
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:42,110
top 9 and the last survivor in the 52nd place will be announced.

224
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,600
If our names don't get called until the end, we should hope for the 52nd place.

225
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,070
I want to be in 52nd place, at least.

226
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,800
You can't rest until the end in the first result announcement.

227
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,250
We'll start...

228
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,330
now!

229
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,460
Should we be happy or not?

230
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,390
I can't help it. I'm tearing up.

231
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,820
I'm tearing up before it even started.

232
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,170
It's okay, it's okay.

233
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,110
- What should we do?
- No, no!

234
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,740
I'm so nervous.

235
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,560
[Which trainees will survive the first result announcement?]

236
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,260
I'll call the teams to face the first result announcement, then.

237
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,950
I think it'd be too hard to do this first.

238
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,420
Which team? Which team?

239
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,970
Wow, why am I so nervous about this?

240
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,660
It could be us. We're located in the No. 1 spot.

241
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,080
- Which team would it be?
- Should we go first?

242
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,900
The first team that will face the announcement first...

243
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,920
- "Back Door!"
- No, there's no way.

244
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,440
"Hot Sauce."

245
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,100
No "Hot Sauce," please.

246
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,410
Is it us?

247
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,390
The camera light lit up.

248
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,300
You're right.

249
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,720
It's Team "Danger!"

250
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,520
You little.

251
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,670
You know how this works.

252
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:00,110
Group K and G's "Danger" teams, please come up on the pedestal on the stage.

253
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,130
- You can do it!
- Fighting!

254
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,390
Seriously! This is too sad for either of us!

255
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,180
This is too nerve wrecking.

256
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,520
I'm so nervous.

257
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,660
Both "Danger" teams showed off their manliness on the stage.

258
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,170
They captured the hearts of the Star Creators

259
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,270
from all over the world.

260
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,710
Group K's "Danger" team

261
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,390
took both the Team Benefit and Group Benefit,

262
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:36,090
and all seven members got a benefit score of 110,000.

263
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,260
I feel so hopeless about this.

264
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:43,410
How many trainees' fate was changed because of the benefit scores?

265
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,210
Among the 14 of Group K and G's "Danger" teams,

266
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:52,980
I'll call the names of the 11 people who qualify for the top 9 and the rest of the survivors up to the 52nd place

267
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,410
- I'm so nervous!
- I feel nervous by just watching.

268
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,760
We shared the building with this team.

269
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,490
We heard so much about them.

270
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,370
I'd like the parts to be redistributed.

271
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,900
If I switch to Rapper 2,

272
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,160
there's no point in picking you guys anymore.

273
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,970
there's no point in picking you guys anymore.

274
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,470
I don't want to switch.

275
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,800
If he can't do it at this point,

276
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,270
we're all going down! This is pointless.

277
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,150
Isn't this where you should be?

278
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,340
Why did you do it like that then?

279
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,280
That's why our team has poor spirit.

280
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,460
Are you saying I was like that from the beginning?

281
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,870
I wasn't.

282
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,950
I wasn't.

283
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,470
I'm so worried that I won't be able to do it.

284
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,960
I got impatient the last few days because I felt anxious.

285
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,270
I'm sorry if I hurt you because of that.

286
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,600
We made up.

287
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,880
[Group K and G's "Danger" teams did their best in rocky situations]

288
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,580
I want all of us to survive.

289
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,080
We should all move on up together.

290
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,800
Seriously...

291
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,940
[What would Group K and G's "Danger" teams' result be?]

292
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,850
This is the first survivor.

293
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,490
He has the highest ranking among the two "Danger" teams.

294
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,110
He was ranked the 13th place.

295
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,630
He was ranked 13th place.

296
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,090
Wow!

297
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,030
13?

298
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,450
That's high.

299
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,670
The trainee in 13th place performed a song from

300
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:31,190
before 2010 in the Star Level Test.

301
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,280
- Seung Hwan!
- Mirotic! Mirotic! Mirotic!

302
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,630
[Lee Seung Hwan performed "Mirotic"]

303
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,770
Maybe it's "Noona, You're So Pretty."

304
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,600
- "Noona, You're So Pretty!"
- This is so fun! I'm telling you!

305

[9th place, Lee Da Eul]

307
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,600
It could be Joon Seo.

308
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,560
Takuto did a song from 10 years ago, too.

309
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,530
I did "Instead of Saying Goodbye."

310

[19th place, Takuto]

312
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,000
I'll announce the trainee in the 13th place.

313
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,500
The first survivor to take the Boys Planet's survivors' seat.

314
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,270
First...

[Who will be the first survivor?]

316
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,160
It's Lee Da Eul!

317
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,950
It changed a lot.

318
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,930
- Da Eul was in the debut team–
- He was in 9th place originally.

319
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,490
- He never failed to be in the top 9.
- No.

[and in 9th place in the second week]

00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,680
This is a huge shift.

323
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,590
Trainee Lee Da Eul went down by four levels since the second week,

324
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,300
but he survived by being in 13th place.

325
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,490
I feel like I don't deserve this ranking,

326
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,360
but if you trust me,

327
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360

Why are there so many high ranking people here?

337

All the high rankings are coming out of "Danger" teams.

338
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,070
It's probably Lee Seung Hwan.

[16th place, Lee Seung Hwan]

352
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,410
The trainee who will continue his dream in 15th place on Boys Planet is...

353
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,760
Takuto!

354
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,280
[Takuto survived by being in 15th place]

355
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,360
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry!

356
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,110
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry!

357
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,690
Takuto is being loved by all the Hyungs.

358
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,490
And he was beloved by the Star Creators, too.

359
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:51,470
So he move up to 15th place, 4 levels higher than the second week's ranking.

360
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,500
The next trainee...

361
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,840
[20th place?]

362
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,700
ended up in the 20th place.

363
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,590
Why are their rankings so high?

364
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,130
I'm getting more and more nervous now.

365
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,720
13th place, 15th place, and 20th place.

366
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,090
The seats are disappearing.

367
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,120
It could be either Seung Hwan or Joon Seo.

368
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,000
Don't you think Seung Hwan will make the top 9?

369
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,230
The one who made 20th place is apparently someone unexpected.

370
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,950
Unexpected? Maybe it's you then.

371
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,990
- No way.
- It could be Ji Ho, too.

372
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,260
It could be Ji Ho!

373
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,850
Joon Seo doesn't have a lot of experience.

374
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,680
And he's a new face.

377
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,630
Will it be, "Everybody looks at us?"

378
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,800
Yang Jun hyung?

Lee Seung Hwan was the leader of Group K's "Danger" team.

390
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,350
He not only brought victory to his team,

391

Everyone, please survive.

397
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,920
This trainee was the singer in his "Danger" team.

398
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,440
I think it's Joon Seo.

399

Woo Seok hyung? Itsuki?

400
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,920

- Who do you think it is?
- Yang Jun.

Ji Ho didn't make it? How about us, then?

439
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,780
Yi Chan was in the 50s.

440
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,070
He needs to survive since he got the benefit, according to our math.

If I led my team better,

451
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,490
Aigoo...

452
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,770

455
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,540
I believe this isn't the end.

456
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,840
I hope we can reunite after improving even more.

457
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:36,170
I'm so glad that I didn't get eliminated,

458
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:41,090
but I'm sad that I can't be with Hyungs.

459
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,750

460
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,510

461
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:54,590
Trainee Takuto, could you express your feeling with your signature greeting?

462
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,470

Let's move to the designated seats now.

465
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,900
In "Danger" teams, three people from Team K survived and one person from Team G survived.

466
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,110
We'll continue with the result announcement of Boys Planet.

467
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,250
I'll call the teams who will face the announcement first.

468
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,850
I think it'll be "Kill This Love."

469
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,800
Everyone thinks it'd be them.

470
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,910
- Could it be "Back Door?"
- The longer we wait, the fewer seats are left.

471
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,270
I just want to be called quickly.

472
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,560
My heart is beating too fast.

473
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,200
It's...

474
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,640

- Let's go for it.

479
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:59,810
"Very Nice" teams showed off everyone's individuality well.

480
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,850
The winning team in the "Very Nice" battle was also Team K.

481
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:06,530
They took both Team Benefit and Group Benefit.

482
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:12,290
Will there be more survivors in Team K because of these benefits?

483
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,310
I think the entire Team K will survive.

484
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,190
This Team K is really strong,

485
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,980
but Team G is consisted of amazing people, too.

486
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,320
I'll reveal the results.

487
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,040
I can feel their pain.

488
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,990
It's because I'm in the same boat.

489
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:38,470
The trainee survived with the highest ranking in "Very Nice" teams was...

490
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,490
ranked in the 17th place.

491
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,130
17th place is the highest?

492
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,670
Some of them might end up in the debut team.

493
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,460
They might make it in the top 9.

494
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,600
The trainee who made the 17th place captured the hearts

495

00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,820
Yes, yes!

527
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,810
It's too funny.

528
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,980
It's Woong Ki hyung.

529
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,700
Ma Jing Xiang! It's him!

530
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,950
Everyone's handsome. I'm not sure.

531
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,750
Also, he has debuted as an idol...

532
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,560
before.

533
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,190
- It's either Dong Yeol hyung or Woong Ki hyung.
- It's either Woong Ki or Seo Won.

534
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,750
It's one of those three.

535
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,450
I think it'd be Dong Yeol hyung for some reason.

536
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,610
- Dong Yeol! You can go that high up!
- No, no. I think it'd be Woong Ki.

537
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,330
I think... it's Seo Won hyung.

538
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,290
Ma Jing Xiang debuted in China.

539
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,490
Really?

540
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,160
[27th place, Ma Jing Xiang]

541
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,180
The second survivor of "Very Nice" team.

542
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,310
That person is...

543
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,200
[17th place, Cha Woong Ki]

544
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,790
[Who will be the second survivor of "Very Nice" teams?]

545
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,760
Seo Won!

546
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,690
- It's Seo Won!
- It's you!

547
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,350
How come you're the one with the impressive looks?

548
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,240
How could it be?

549
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,890
Seo Won, congratulations!

550
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:18,170
Seo Won captured the hearts of Star Creators with his talent and charm

551
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,240
and he survived with a high ranking.

552
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,000
Congratulations.

553
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,120
Only two trainees from Team K survived in the "Very Nice" teams.

554
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,530
Is the next survivor from Team K, too?

555
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,310
Please...

556
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,590
Or is it going to be from Team G?

557
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,300
Let's go ahead and find out.

558
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,510
Please be Team G.

559
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,030
There's only one from Group G.

560
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,030
Takuto is the only one.

561
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,840
The survivor I'm about to announce was...

562
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,720
ranked in 21st place!

563
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,260
The difference isn't that great.

564
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,860
Wow, there are many.

565
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,190
This trainee did the Killing Part

566
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:02,030
and showed off his refreshing charm on stage.

567
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,430
Also he looked great in a beret, too.

568
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,440
- Did Woong Ki wear a beret?
- Beret? No.

569
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,150
[Hold on]

570
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,950
- He did, he did!
- Hold on.

571
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,360
- Are you serious?
- He did!

572
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,690
[Cha Woong Ki pulled off the Killing Part nicely wearing a beret]

573
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,920
[Hiroto also did the Killing Part wearing a beret]

574
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:26,170
We narrowed down to two people now.

575
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:30,000
Will Cha Woong Ki from Team K who got the benefit

576
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,450
survive and continue on with the next mission?

577
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,990
Or could it be Hiroto, who couldn't get the benefit but

578
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:40,030
received a high score survive on Boys Planet?

579
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,960
The trainee who ended up on the 21nd place.

580
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,500
That person is...

581
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,280
Hiroto!

582
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,980
[Hiroto survived by being on the 21st place]

583
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,690
Hiroto!

584
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,430
The second survivor of Group G.

585
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,490
That's how impressive he is.

586
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:07,110
He went down by six levels since the last ranking,

587
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,780
but he was able to survive. Congratulations.

588
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,990
I'll continue with the announcement.

589
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:16,120

[Another high ranking trainee]

591
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,550
They're all in these teams.

Group K.

596
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,080
[Team G is automatically disqualified]

597
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,210
It's either Woong Ki or Dong Yeol hyung.

598
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,200
It'd be either Min Gyu or Woong Ki.

599
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,930
There's Dong Yeol, too, Hyung.

600
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,860
Dong Yeol couldn't have been ranked that high.

601
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,070
It could be Min Gyu hyung, too.

602
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,570
Also...

603
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,930
after the Signal Song Test, his level...

604
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,060
- His level?
- changed.

605
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,420
- Doesn't that apply to everyone?
- Not me.

606
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,490
[He worked without resting for Signal Song Test, but...]

607
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,960
[Jung Min Gyu, no stars]

608

- Really?
- What the hell?

618
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,720
Seriously?

- Who could it be?
- Could it be Min Gyu hyung?

he has a cute face. He got the nickname, "Giant Baby"

Please...

775
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,260
I'm scared! I can't do this.

Or Won Ye Chen hyung?

790

In the Star Level Test, this trainee did...

791
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,040
a duet performance.

792
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,620

[Group G's Yuki is automatically disqualified]

804
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,140
It'd be Daebak if it's Jang Ji Ho.

[Which trainee will survive by being in the 40th place?]

810

It's Lee Dong Yeol!

[Lee Dong Yeol survived by being in the 40th place]

812
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,950
I need to survive. I want to.

813
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:31,570
Will there be another survivor in "Very Nice" teams?

814
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,230
Will there be?

815
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,030
There isn't.

816
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,670
There isn't.

822
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,140
[It's me!]

823

From the Red House to the Blue House.

824
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,590
I hope we get to the top later

825
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,340
and do another duet performance as Our House.

826
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,840

Except for the 11 candidates for the top 9

834
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:45,230
and 52nd place, there are 27 seats left.

835
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,240
It feels like there are not enough left.

836
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,020
There really isn't that many.

837
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:57,510
Before I call more teams for the result announcement,

01:03:57,930 --> 01:03:59,220
[I enjoyed watching you guys.]

1227
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:02,460
[Trainee Jung Min Gyu who tore up the dance battle]

1228
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:06,280
I think it was the most fierce dance battle I've ever seen.

1229
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,710
I'm embarrassed.

1230
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,660
Chen Kuan Jui was pretty much a top.

1231
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:11,050
[Chen Kuan Top]

1232
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:14,570
Then we will continue announcing the survivors.

1233
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:16,290
Please... Which team will be next?

1234
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:18,560
The team that I will announce the survivors for is...

1235
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,960
"Burn It Up"?

1236
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,360
"LOVE ME RIGHT."

1237
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,490
[The third team for the survivor announcement is LOVE ME RIGHT]

1238
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:28,130
What? He's going to announce the "LOVE ME RIGHT" team first?

1239
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,880
- What the...
- The main dish already?

1240
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,740
- Gosh...
- No, no, they can't...

1241
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:35,560
To think we'll see the highlight so soon...

1242
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,880
Honestly, I don't see anyone from here that will get eliminated.

1243
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,220
["LOVE ME RIGHT" Team K and G comes up for the announcement of results]

1244
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:42,020
I just want all of us to survive...

1245
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,620
Wouldn't most of the trainees here survive?

1246
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:47,030
- Won't they all survive?
- So it's not really a good thing to not be called up yet.

1247
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:49,410
Seo Bin is in a precarious position too.

1248
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:52,440
Wumuti is in danger. He was ranked 50th last time.

1249
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:56,300
Wow, this is a strong lineup. Oh my god...

1250
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:02,300
"LOVE ME RIGHT" team was made by trainees who placed first in the signal song test.

1251
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:07,570
Thus, expectations were high for them ever since the team members were chosen.

1252
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:12,710
For the trainees in the "LOVE ME RIGHT" team, whose survival or elimination is unknown...

1253
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:15,080
What fate will they face?

1254
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,120
Please let all of us survive!

1255
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,470
I really hate things like this...

1256
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:21,090
My hands are shaking.

1257
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:23,190
Why am I so nervous?

1258
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:28,240
["LOVE ME RIGHT" Team's first survivor is...]

1259
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,640
Those in the TOP 9 are not going to be announced, right?

1260
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,660
- Up to the 11th place will not be called.
- In 16th place...

1261
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,400
So high!

1262
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,700
I will announce the survivor in 16th place.

1263
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,880
- 16th place?
- It's over there.

1264
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:41,820
[Welcome]

1265
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:43,830
Please just say that it's me. I want to go up there.

1266
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:46,010
I feel like it's going to be Anthony.

1267
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:47,730
Would it be Trainee Haruto?

1268
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:49,300
I feel like his rank went up.

1269
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:52,370
What about that trainee? The ex-TO1 member.

1270
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:55,040
His rank was pretty high.

1271
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:58,910
This trainee has previous experience

1272
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:02,010
participating in a survival program before Boys Planet.

1273
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:04,210
- Oh, there's many...
- Ye Dam hyung.

1274
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,050
[Group K's Lee Ye Dam participated in a boy group survival program before]

1275
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,460
Or Anthonny?
- But, pretty much everyone participated in survival shows.

1276
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,920
[Team G also has trainees with survival show experience, Haruto and Anthonny]

1277
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,560
[Oh Sung Min also participated in "To Be World Class"]

1278
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,970
- It's so hard.
- It's such fierce competition!

1279
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:20,470
I will announce the trainee who survived in 16th place.

1280
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,820
I wish it was me.

1281
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,900
[The survivor in 16th place is a Team G trainee]

1282
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,380
Anthonny. It's Anthonny.

1283
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:31,920
[Is Trainee Anthonny in 16th place?]

1284
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:34,650
It is Haruto!

1285
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:39,120
16th place...

1286
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,600
He got such a high rank.

1287
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,630
His rank went up so much!

1288
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:46,330
I think he can try going for the debut spot.

1289
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:49,420
Hey, go up there.

1290
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:51,980
Congrats, Ruto!

1291
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:54,130
I feel proud of him.

1292
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:57,750
[A stand-out bow]
[The camera is taken aback]

1293
01:06:58,690 --> 01:06:59,780
[Thank you]

1294
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,180
Is he wiping his tears on his pants?

1295
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:04,010
Why am I so jealous?

1296
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:05,400
Oh, please...

1297
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,220
The next survivor from "LOVE ME RIGHT" Team...

1298
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:08,390
My legs are shaking.

1299
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:11,800
was a trainee who ranked 19th.

1300
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,640
We are all ranked pretty high.

1301
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,790
Please...

1302
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:18,060
I feel like they will take up all the high ranks.

1303
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,740
Anthonny, let's go.

1304
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:23,470
The trainee who ranked 19th had a rapid change in rank.

1305
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:26,570
Between Team K and G,

1306
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:31,300
he is in Team G.

1307
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,210
It's either Anthonny or...

1308
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:34,810
- Team G?
- Or Dang Hong Hai...

1309
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:38,350
Jay, it's Jay.

1310
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,540
The trainee who survived in 19th place...

1311
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:43,030
Let's go, let's go.

1312
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:44,970
It's Anthonny.

1313
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:46,690
As expected.

1314
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:49,280
I'm so proud. You did well.

1315
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,370
[No survivors were announced for Team K yet.]

1316
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:55,790
Wow, but this is a bit weird.

1317
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:58,280
Team K got the benefit and yet they haven't been called yet.

1318
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,300
Congrats, Anthonny!

1319
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:03,440
He's ranked pretty high despite not receiving the benefit.

1320
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,810
I'm so happy.

1321
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:07,360
Yeah, I do feel pretty proud of them.

1322
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,980
The next rank...

1323
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:11,820
There might not be much of a gap.

1324
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,810
will be 33rd place.

1325
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:16,050
The rank suddenly dropped.

1326
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,740
This is so different from what I expected.

1327
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:21,830
It's either Sung Min hyung or Lee Jeong Hyeon hyung.

1328
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:25,020
Will it be our team?

1329
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:26,660
Will it be Team G?

1330
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:29,480
I feel like it will be Dang Hong Hai.

1331
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,920
I hope it's from our team.

1332
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:34,260
- This is going to drive me nuts...
- Please...

1333
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:36,990
The level of this trainee is...

1334
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:38,940
Three Stars.

1335
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:41,440
There are too many Three Star trainees.

1336
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:44,230
[3 Stars: Dang Hong Hai and Wumuti]

1337
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:47,880
[3 Stars: Han Seo Bin, Lee Hoe Taek, Lee Jeong Hyeon, Kim Gyu Vin, and Oh Sung Min]

1338
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,980
The trainee who will take the seat of 33rd place...

1339
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:53,000
This is driving me nuts...

1340
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,770
- Please one of our guys...
- Please...

1341
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:56,650
It's either Jeong Hyeon or Sung Min.

1342
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,260
It's Dang Hong Hai!

1343
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,580
[The survivor in 33rd place is Group G's Dang Hong Hai]

1344
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:10,750
[Another survivor came from Team G.]

1345
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:13,840
Gosh, this is quite tough.

1346
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:16,370
What do we do?

1347
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:19,410
- Do I have to go home?
- Hai, congrats.

1348
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:20,950
Congrats.

1349
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:23,500
Then what about Sung Min hyung and Jeong Hyeon hyung?

1350
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,730
It's okay.

1351
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:30,480
[Dang Hong Hai]

1352
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,440
Why aren't anybody from our team getting called?

1353
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,310
Those in the middle ranks are in the middle of a fierce battle.

1354
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:37,010
We will continue

1355
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:39,630
with the announcement of the survivor in 34th place.

1356
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:41,190
It's the rank right below the previous one.

1357
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:42,560
Will it come from Team K now?

1358
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,010
He is a trainee whose pretty smile is his weapon.

1359
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:47,220
It's Oh Sung Min!

1360
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:48,700
Try smiling.

1361
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:50,080
[Arms himself with his weapon]

1362
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,620
- Oh, you got this.
- It's pretty. It's you, Sung Min.

1363
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:57,020
Pretty smile? Is it Wumuti?

1364
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:58,970
Your smile is pretty.

1365
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:01,570
Your smile is the prettiest.
- No.

1366
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:04,360
Jeong Hyeon? Your smile is pretty too.

1367
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,960
No... Seong Min's smile is prettier.

1368
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,410
I will announce the survivor who will remain in Boys Planet.

1369
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:17,310
[Who is the survivor with the pretty smile in 34th place?]

1370
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:19,050
It's Oh Sung Min!

1371
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:22,450
[The survivor in 34th place is Group K's Oh Sung Min]

1372
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:25,180
- Aigoo.
- I mean, your smile is pretty.

1373
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:26,880
It's true Sung Min's smile is pretty.

1374
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,240
It's especially pretty.

1375
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,040
Sung Min, congrats!

1376
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,230
Congratulations!

1377
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:37,050
Is that it?
- No, no, no way.

1378
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:42,940
So far, "LOVE ME RIGHT" Team had 1 survivor from Team K and 3 survivors from Team G.

1379
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:46,030
Trainee Haruto who filled the stage with an awesome rap,

1380
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:48,310
I'm curious to know how you feel about surviving.

1381
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,610
- You did so well!
- You did well.

1382
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:55,950
To all the star creators who helped me to continue my dream,

1383
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:59,700
thank you so much.

1384
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:05,730
To my "LOVE ME RIGHT" Team, who are more important than anything to me...

1385
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:09,930
personally, I'm so happy. I'm proud of us.

1386
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:17,650
I took on this challenge thinking that I wanted to get on stage, even if it was my last time.

1387
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:21,480
It was like a dream to have such good members

1388
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,560
and put on a cool performance,

1389
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:26,430
and hear people call us the Avengers Team...

1390
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:29,650
And now that I've been given another opportunity,

1391
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:32,070
I will continue to show you doing my best

1392
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:34,820
so please continue to cheer for me. Thank you!

1393
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:37,650
Congratulations once again to the trainees who have survived.

1394
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:40,840
Please go to the seat assigned to your rank.

1395
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,730
Am I next to Takuto?

1396
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:46,640
It's nice to have you sit next to me.

1397
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,030
The one who would take the seat next to me was Anthonny.

1398
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:53,300
Let's continue to do our best, even for our friends.

1399
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:57,840
We really have to try hard for our friends.

1400
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:03,450
There are still more survivors to announce for "LOVE ME RIGHT" Team.

1401
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:05,370
- The next survivor...
- Thank you.

1402
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:08,030
was in 39th place.

1403
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:10,320
It's Lee Jeong Hyeon!

1404
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,690
In 42nd place...

1405
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:18,240
It's Lee Ye Dam!

1406
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:20,340
Seriously...

1407
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,970
[39th place survivor is Lee Jeong Hyeon]

1408
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:25,860
[42nd place survivor is Lee Ye Dam]

1409
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:31,560
How nervous must Seo Bin feel standing there?

1410
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:35,080
If Seo Bin survives here too,

1411
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,400
then the entire "LOVE ME RIGHT" Team K will have survived.

1412
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,360
Oh, Seo Bin is still left too.

1413
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:47,330
Will there be a trainee who survives with a rank lower than 42nd among the remaining trainees in "LOVE ME RIGHT" Team?

1414
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:50,460
There is!

1415
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:52,900
- If it is, it's Seo Bin.
- There has to be...

1416
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,820
If there is, our spots will disappear.

1417
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:58,120
[Excluding the TOP 9 and 52nd place, there are just 21 seats left for survivors.]

1418
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,210
In "LOVE ME RIGHT" Team, another survivor...

1419
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,770
There is one.

1420
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:04,660
Please...

1421
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:09,730
Oh! There isn't?

1422
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:15,130
exists.

1423
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:20,330
Wait, I shouldn't be getting happy about this.

1424
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,500
- Please...
- Wumuti.

1425
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,400
I really need you to survive.

1426
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:31,620
- Seo Bin, let's do this.
- You've got the benefit.

1427
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,600
The level of this trainee is 3 Stars.

1428
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,560
- Gosh, this is too much.
- Come on, please!

1429
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:42,640
Wumuti hyung...

1430
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,110
I will announce the name of the trainee.

1431
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:46,870
Seo Bin, Seo Bin.

1432
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:48,680
Wumuti...

1433
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:55,280
[Who will be the survivor in 43rd place between Trainee Han Seo Bin and Wumuti?]

1434
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,640
It's Wumuti!

1435
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:04,020
It's Wumuti!

1436
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:11,480
We still don't know yet.

1437
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,010
He hasn't been eliminated yet.

1438
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:17,550
Wumuti took on the role of Leader and the Killing Part

1439
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:19,760
and put on a magnificent performance.

1440
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,730
His rank went up by 8 since Week 2 rankings.

1441
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,100
This is tough.

1442
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,690
Then for our team, Xuan Hao wil survive.

1443
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:28,530
Xuan Hao was ranked much higher than Wumuti hyung before.

1444
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:34,280
All right. Will there be a survivor with a rank lower than 43rd in "LOVE ME RIGHT" Team?

1445
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,430
- Yes, there is.
- Don't get scared, Seo Bin.

1446
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,700
Please, Seo Bin!

1447
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,570
[Will there be another survivor in "LOVE ME RIGHT" Team?]

1448
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:46,250
In "LOVE ME RIGHT" Team, another survivor...

1449
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:50,220
Come on...

1450
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:52,450
Could there be more survivors?

1451
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,200
- Are there any?
- Oh, please...

1452
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,680
There are none.

1453
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,310
There are none.

1454
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,490
There are none.

1455
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,250
Gosh...

1456
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:26,520
All the survivors apart from the TOP 9 candidates and the 52nd place have been announced.

1457
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:34,180
Man, this is really tough.

1458
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:38,250
Regardless of Team K or G, our "LOVE ME RIGHT" Team

1459
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:42,910
really had pushed each other in friendly competition

1460
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:47,740
and tried our best. So it's a bit upsetting,

1461
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:50,330
but anything is possible,

1462
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:54,210
so I would like for you to cheer up and keep going.

1463
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:56,020
I just got goosebumps.

1464
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,880
Well...

1465
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,380
It's okay.

1466
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:04,740
I believe that my "LOVE ME RIGHT" Team members

1467
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:12,980
helped me and gave me the confidence to perform my role well as leader.

1468
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:20,070
Also, even if there are any members of "LOVE ME RIGHT" Team who are eliminated in Team K or G,

1469
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:23,740
I would like for everyone to keep cheering for their activities outside of Boys Planet.

1470
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,780
Thank you.

1471
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:40,890
For "LOVE ME RIGHT" Team, there are currently 3 survivors from Group K and 4 survivors from Group G.

1472
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:43,160
[The trainees who weren't called return to their seats in the waiting area]

1473
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,860
How many seats are left?

1474
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:47,700
There are 23 seats left apart from the TOP 9.

1475
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,860
There are so many guys who should be getting in...

1476
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:52,080
The next team that I will announce the survivors for...

1477
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,770
Please let it not be "Hot Sauce"

1478
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:55,850
It won't be us, right?

1479
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:58,410
It's "Kill This Love."

1480
01:16:58,410 --> 01:16:59,810
Who will it be?

1481
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:02,170
The next team.

1482
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:04,440
It's "Burn It Up" Team.

1483
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:07,400
[The fourth team for the survivor announcements is "Burn It Up" Team]

1484
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:10,710
"Burn It Up" Team, please come to the front.

1485
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,620
["Burn It Up" Team K and G walk up to the platform]

1486
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:16,510
This team is very precarious.

1487
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:23,340
["Burn It Up" Team K was automatically formed from trainees who weren't chosen]

1488
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:26,200
We're in big trouble.

1489
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,230
This team can have worse results than our team.

1490
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:33,650
What are you talking about? Only one person survived from our team.

1491
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:36,230
- That's right.
- How could any team have it worse than our team?

1492
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:38,140
It's possible.

1493
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:39,860
[83rd - Kei]

1494
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:43,200
[84th - Park Min Seok, 68th - Jung Ho Jin, 92nd - Park Gwan Young]

1495
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,100
[90th - Hyo]

1496
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:48,460
It's okay if none of us make it. We did well.

1497
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:52,420
I feel like at most, there will be two survivors combined from both teams.

1498
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:54,730
Gosh, I shouldn't say stuff like this.

1499
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:58,630
Who will survive?

1500
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:00,720
[41st - Xuan Hao]

1501
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:03,750
[56th - Chen Ren You]
- I really don't know what will happen with this team.

1502
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:08,880
[54th - Yutaka]
- Many trainees in "Burn It Up" Team are in danger.

1503
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,490
I feel like the trainee who had the Killing Part in Team G will survive.

1504
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:21,380
[Because "Burn It Up" Team K won and Group K's overall victory, Team K received the benefit of 110,000 points]

1505
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:25,790
Although Team K received the benefit,

1506
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:31,950
it was the battle with the smallest difference in points.

1507
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:38,580
Will there be a similar number of survivors from each team, seeing how the points difference was small?

1508
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,610
I will reveal the results now.

1509
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:43,380
I feel like there will be one survivor from each team.

1510
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:48,160
Kei, please go to a survivor seat.

1511
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,860
I want to...

1512
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:55,040
Apart from the eleven TOP 9 candidates and the 52nd place,

1513
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:59,050
"Burn It Up" Team's first survivor...

1514
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:01,880
Who is it?

1515
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:04,740
There are none.

1516
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:08,130
There's no survivors at all?

1517
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:11,140
There are none.

1518
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:14,160
What?

1519
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:19,540
- They have no survivors.
- They don't have any survivors?

1520
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:21,030
Oh my god...

1521
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:22,680
All of them were eliminated?

1522
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:25,010
You sure we didn't hear wrong?

1523
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,250
Gosh, this is...

1524
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:29,130
Don't cry, Hyung...

1525
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:31,510
Wow, that's really daebak.

1526
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:34,950
Both "Burn It Up" Team K and G

1527
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:37,070
do not have any survivors for now,

1528
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:41,020
but since there is still the announcement of the TOP 9 candidates and the 52nd place,

1529
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:44,830
please wait to the end for the final results.

1530
01:19:44,830 --> 01:19:46,770
There's still the 52nd place.

1531
01:19:46,770 --> 01:19:52,270
Trainees who haven't yet survived in "Burn It Up" Team K and G,

1532
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:54,170
please return to your seats in the waiting area.

1533
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:57,660
Thank you.

1534
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:01,160
You did well.

1535
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,180
Don't cry, don't cry.

1536
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:07,310
Aigoo...

1537
01:20:08,990 --> 01:20:10,760
There's still 52nd place left.

1538
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,700
Let's hope for surviving at the cutoff.

1539
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:15,440
It's okay.

1540
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,240
Don't give up so quickly.

1541
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,130
I already expected this but it's still upsetting.

1542
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,470
If we received the benefit,

1543
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:26,830
I feel like we could have survived.

1544
01:20:26,830 --> 01:20:30,150
The next team that I will announce the survivors for

1545
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:31,880
"Hot Sauce"?

1546
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:34,900
"Kill This Love"?

1547
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,180
I feel like it'll be us.

1548
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:37,880
It's "Hot Sauce"!

1549
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,960
Wait...

1550
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,200
- Ji Hoo!
- Come on, please...
- Ollie!

1551
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,740
"Hot Sauce" Team, please come up to the front.

1552
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:46,850
Oh, gosh.

1553
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:49,370
This is really scary.

1554
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:50,790
[I'm so nervous]

1555
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,170
This is the first time a fellow Redstart ENM trainee has come up.

1556
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:57,180
I'll try to feel how you felt, Hyungnim.

1557
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:59,590
- But you don't really cry.
- Yes...

1558
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:01,680
I really hope Osuke can survive.

1559
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,290
I know.

1560
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:05,260
[69th - Osuke]

1561
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:12,240
Seeing how "Hot Sauce" Team K received the benefit for winning with the most points among the 14 teams,

1562
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:16,760
so I'm curious to see if they will have the most survivors today.

1563
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:20,670
But, just because the team received the benefit doesn't mean everyone could relax.

1564
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:26,390
Even for "Hot Sauce" Team, some will survive and some will be eliminated.

1565
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:29,470
Please, please, please...

1566
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:33,280
The first survivor to be announced for "Hot Sauce" Team is...

1567
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:39,030
Ollie is pretty popular here.

1568
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:41,900
a trainee who ranked 22nd.

1569
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:45,580
It's high. It's really high.

1570
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:47,430
Ollie?

1571
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:50,140
It's Han Bin.

1572
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:52,430
It could be Do Ha too.

1573
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:56,870
Between Team K and G, the one who ranked 22nd is in...

1574
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:59,220
I think it will be in Team K.

1575
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:01,060
Team G?

1576
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:03,910
- I really don't know.
- Team K.

1577
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:07,590
- It's Park Han Bin.
- Who is it?

1578
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:10,270
It's obviously Han Bin or Ji Hoo.

1579
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:13,900
Do Ha hyung is pretty popular too.

1580
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:15,500
Also,

1581
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:20,130
the last name of this trainee is...

1582
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:25,110
- It's all the same.
- It will be Park, since four of us have the last name of Park.

1583
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:27,610
Park, Park, Park, Park.

1584
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,780
That's right. It's Park.

1585
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:33,950
Why are there so many people with last name of Park here?

1586
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:37,930
The trainee who survived Boys Planet in 22nd place...

1587
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:40,460
I will announce it now.

1588
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:41,700
Who will it be?

1589
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,240
It's Park...

1590
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,980
- Oh, it's Do Ha.
- Han Bin!

1591
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:48,450
You did really well!

1592
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:50,420
Really, you did so well!

1593
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:53,610
[The members congratulate him sincerely with hugs]

1594
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:56,620
We wanted to do that too.

1595
01:22:56,620 --> 01:23:01,510
With his perfectionist leadership that refused to miss a single detail,

1596
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:04,240
Park Han Bin led his team to complete victory.

1597
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,540
I think it would be okay to do a little less of that.

1598
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:12,890
His rank rose by 14 since Week 2 rankings.

1599
01:23:12,890 --> 01:23:16,840
Wow. Congratulations on surviving.

1600
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:24,340
The next survivor on "Hot Sauce" Team survived in 24th place.

1601
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:26,440
It's high.

1602
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,990
I think it's Ollie.

1603
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:30,140
I really wish I got 24th place.

1604
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:32,570
The trainee who ranked 24th

1605
01:23:32,570 --> 01:23:36,260
is a trainee who is improving with each episode.

1606
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:39,030
- Ollie?
- Park Do Ha? Park Do Ha has been improving.

1607
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:41,290
Is it not? I mean, Ollie has been improving too.

1608
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:45,210
Also, as a result of the Signal Song Test,

1609
01:23:45,210 --> 01:23:46,830
Ollie also got No Star.

1610
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:49,000
he received No Star.

1611
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,990
[After the Signal Song Test, Ollie and Park Do Ha both received 0 Stars]

1612
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:56,990
The trainee who was chosen by the star creators...

1613
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,600
I will announce who it is.

1614
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,840
- I really can't figure this one out.
- Hurry, please...

1615
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:04,930
The one who will take the seat of 24th place...

1616
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,770
- Oh my god...
- It's Park Do Ha!

1617
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:13,120
[The survivor in 24th place is Group K's Park Do Ha]

1618
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:19,040
Blue House, Blue House.

1619
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,890
Trainee Park Do Ha, who is known as Blue House...

1620
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:25,080
Although his development is a bit slow,

1621
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:29,280
he is a trainee whose passion and efforts to learn is second to none.

1622
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,080
Congratulations on surviving.

1623
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:35,340
Thank you, thank you.

1624
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:39,780
The next survivor for "Hot Sauce" Team...

1625
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:42,210
ranked 28th.

1626
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:44,590
Why is it so high?

1627
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:47,170
They took all the ranks in the twenties.

1628
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:50,840
It was unexpected that this trainee received this rank.

1629
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:55,770
As such, he's a trainee whose rank has changed quite a bit.

1630
01:24:55,770 --> 01:24:57,150
Osuke?

1631
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:58,690
No way...

1632
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:01,900
- Probably from that team.
- You're right.

1633
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:03,400
The trainee who got the Killing Part?

1634
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,010
I mean, he's pretty good.

1635
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:09,170
[Park Ji Hoo demonstrated an amazing ability to perform the Killing Part during the K vs. G Group Battle]

1636
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:11,900
[49th - Park Ji Hoo]

1637
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:14,860
But there are a lot of trainees who are really popular in Group G too.

1638
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:17,860
Isn't Ollie pretty popular?

1639
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:24,070
I will announce the trainee who ranked 28th.

1640
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,250
Please let it be Park Ji Hoo...

1641
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:30,350
The trainee in 28th place...

1642
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:34,890
[Who will be the third survivor from "Hot Sauce" Team?]

1643
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:36,480
It's Ollie!

1644
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:43,000
You did well.

1645
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,930
Ollie!

1646
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:46,200
Nice!

1647
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:47,800
Oh, yay!

1648
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,150
Trainee Ollie is usually a cute trainee.

1649
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:54,350
But when he practices, he's the charismatic youngest who carries the older members hard.

1650
01:25:54,350 --> 01:25:57,430
That's fine. That's fine.

1651
01:25:57,430 --> 01:26:01,360
He went down 10 steps from 18th place in Week 2.

1652
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,170
But it didn't matter to his survival.

1653
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:08,080
The top ranks are getting filled up, hyung.

1654
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,890
The seats are running out.

1655
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:15,980
The next survivor in Team Hot Sauce...

1656
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:18,780
Thiry-six?

1657
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:21,370
placed 44th.

1658
01:26:21,370 --> 01:26:23,710
Why is the gap so big?

1659
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:26,200
Oh, my god. This is the last one, right?

1660
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,560
The survivor in 44th place was

1661
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:32,400
on the verge of elimination in Week 2.

1662
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:36,010
But his rank went up and he could survive.

1663
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:38,540
Isn't it Hyun Been?

1664
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:39,980
[Park Hyun Been placed 50th in Week 2.]

1665
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:42,030
[Park Hyun Been placed 50th in Week 2.]

1666
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:47,270
The trainee who could step closer to the dream of debuting as an Kpop idol is

1667
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:50,890
[Who will be the fifth survivor from Team Hot Sauce?]

1668
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:52,920
Park Ji Hoo!

1669
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,570
[The survivor in 44th place is Park Ji Hoo.]

1670
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:57,650
I told you that you could survive! I told you!

1671
01:26:57,650 --> 01:26:59,960
You did a good job!

1672
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:02,390
- Congratulations, Ji Hoo!
- Congratulations!

1673
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:07,040
As the MZ generation, Trainee Park Ji Hoo flies on stage

1674
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,390
with a confident look on his face.

1675
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:17,430
He ranked 5 steps up from Week 2.

1676
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:19,330
Congratulations on your survival.

1677
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:21,710
- There will be no more after the 40th place, right?
- No more, no more!

1678
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:23,090
I feel like there should be one more.

1679
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:26,240
40th, 41st, 42nd, 43rd, 44th, 45th, 46th, 47th...

1680
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:27,710
Is it done?

1681
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:33,250
Before we find out the next survivor in Team Hot Sauce,

1682
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:37,290
let's hear from the surviving trainees now.

1683
01:27:37,290 --> 01:27:39,170
There must be more survivors in Team Hot Sauce.

1684
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:41,500
All the K-G members

1685
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:45,130
in Team Hot Sauce...

1686
01:27:45,130 --> 01:27:48,040
In my eyes,

1687
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:52,520
they all looked so beautiful because they practiced so passionately.

1688
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,400
Thank you for following me well.

1689
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,330
You all prepared so hard for the stage.

1690
01:27:57,330 --> 01:28:00,310
So you were awesome. Thank you.

1691
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:08,590
Han Bin hyung led our team so well to the end.

1692
01:28:08,590 --> 01:28:12,310
And he taught me everything I didn't know.

1693
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:14,760
I think Han Bin hyung helped me

1694
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,610
receive the most votes.

1695
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:22,220
And I really appreciate you, Seo Bin.

1696
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:27,480
Thank you.

1697
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:35,580
Once again, congratulations on your survival.

1698
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:40,610
Please move to your rank seat and sit down.

1699
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:43,220
A lot of seats have been filled.

1700
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:45,750
[Will there be any additional survivors from Team Hot Sauce?]

1701
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:51,150
We just announced Park Ji Hoo trainee who was ranked 44th.

1702
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:54,880
Will there be any trainee who survives with a rank lower than 44th?

1703
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,380
Don't you think there are more?

1704
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:58,540
- I think there are more.
- There must be more.

1705
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:01,350
- Hyun Been, let's go.
- I think there are two more.

1706
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:03,660
[The remaining survivable rankings are from 45th to 51st.]

1707
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:06,650
In Team Hot Sauce, there is...

1708
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:08,380
a survivor!

1709
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:15,160
- Good, good, good!
- Hyun Been?
- Why is Hyun Been crying?

1710
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:18,150
It was a really close call.

1711
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:20,350
He's ranked 48th.

1712
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:22,220
48th place?

1713
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:24,640
- That was close.
- Yes, that was so close.

1714
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:27,390
Please let me survive this once. Please...

1715
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:30,440
Just once...

1716
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:32,960
- Hyun Been can do it.
- I hope Hyun Been survives.

1717
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,510
I feel like it's Woo Jin. Woo Jin kept on ranking 40 something.

1718
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:39,890
This trainee...is 05s*.
(05s are those born in 2005.)

1719
01:29:41,390 --> 01:29:43,620
- Aren't all of them born in 2005?
- Yes, all three of them were born in 2005.

1720
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:45,610
- I'm 05s.
- I'm 05s.

1721
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:47,780
- I'm 05s.
- Is this how you do it?

1722
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:49,520
How old are 05s?

1723
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,240
05s are...

1724
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:55,050
just babies.

1725
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:56,280
Right, baby?

1726
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,980
Huh?

1727
01:29:57,980 --> 01:30:00,080
The survivor is...

1728
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,420
Is it Hyun Been?

1729
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:06,150
[The main rapper of Hot Sauce Team K, 05s Park Hyun Been]

1730
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:07,200
Is it Dong Gun?

- Ricky?
- Right, I also think it's Ricky.

2079
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:53,770
- Ricky, it's you.
- It's you. It's you.

2080
01:46:53,770 --> 01:46:56,390
It's definitely you, Ricky.

2081
01:46:56,390 --> 01:47:00,750
[Ricky left an overwhelming presence with Team G's killing part.]

2082
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:04,080
Krystian is hot these days. He must be ranked 12th.

2083
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:07,930
[Krystian shined the stage with his powerful performance.]

2084
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:13,020
It's not me, is it?

2085
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:15,310
I'll reveal the hint.

2086
01:47:15,310 --> 01:47:17,320
The level of this trainee in 12th place is...

2087
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:18,890
All stars.

2088
01:47:18,890 --> 01:47:20,940
- 3 stars!
- or more than that?

2089
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:22,610
He has received 3 stars.

2090
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:24,730
He has received 3 stars.

2091
01:47:24,730 --> 01:47:26,790
We all got 3 stars. Oh, except Jun Hyeon.

2092
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:30,430

2093
01:47:30,430 --> 01:47:32,280
I feel like it's Tae Rae.

2094
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:33,710
It can be Ricky too.

2095
01:47:33,710 --> 01:47:36,670
Who will be the first survivor?

2096
01:47:36,670 --> 01:47:37,750
- Ricky hyung!
- Tae Rae!

2097
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:40,350
Since Ricky didn't get the benefits,

2098
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:42,250
it's definitely Tae Rae.

2099
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:44,950
The trainee who survives in 12th place is...

2100
01:47:49,750 --> 01:47:51,340

- Congratulations!
- Congrats, Ricky.

2107
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:04,070
He'd have been in the TOP 9 if he had the benefits.

2108
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:06,020
Seriously, straight to TOP 9.

2109

2111

The next survivor's rank is...

2112
01:48:14,850 --> 01:48:16,110
14?

2113
01:48:16,110 --> 01:48:18,660
There are many seats on the bottom too.

2114
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:20,900

- Or maybe Kamden?
- Kamden, Kamden.

- Matthew.

2929
02:32:05,810 --> 02:32:09,880
This trainee with the high rank of third place

2930
02:32:09,880 --> 02:32:13,650
has placed first in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Peru,

2931
02:32:13,650 --> 02:32:18,100
Argentina, and Colombia.

2932
02:32:18,100 --> 02:32:19,990
Really?

2933
02:32:19,990 --> 02:32:23,110
Ji Woong hyung has a look

2934
02:32:23,110 --> 02:32:25,840
that would be popular in South America. He's sexy.

2935
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:33,450
His final score is 6,944,462 points.

2936
02:32:33,450 --> 02:32:37,130
He has secured his place as third with a high score.

2937
02:32:37,130 --> 02:32:38,570
It's more than all of our scores combined.

2938
02:32:38,570 --> 02:32:42,420
Some are worried over 100,000 points, but he has 6,900,000 points.

2939
02:32:42,420 --> 02:32:45,330
After the first global voting,

2940
02:32:45,330 --> 02:32:48,590
who will be the trainee who came in third?

2941
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:51,020
I'm curious.

2942
02:32:51,540 --> 02:32:53,390
Third place.

2943
02:32:53,390 --> 02:32:57,030
No. Matthew will be rank 3.

2944
02:32:57,030 --> 02:32:59,080
Ji Woong is rank 2.

2945
02:32:59,080 --> 02:33:00,720
The trainee is none other than...

2946
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:02,970
I'm curious.

2947
02:33:06,190 --> 02:33:08,030
Kim Ji Woong.

2948
02:33:08,990 --> 02:33:10,880
It's Kim Ji Woong.

2949
02:33:13,130 --> 02:33:15,790
So Matthew went up to rank 2?

2950
02:33:15,790 --> 02:33:17,780
Seriously? Is this possible?

2951
02:33:17,780 --> 02:33:19,360
He actually beat him.

2952
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:21,610
- What's going on with Matthew hyung?
- He beat him.

2953
02:33:21,610 --> 02:33:25,630
He went up to rank 5 from rank 32, now he's in rank 2.

2954
02:33:26,820 --> 02:33:31,660
The Star Creators have given me

2955
02:33:31,660 --> 02:33:35,970
a spot in rank 3. I won't stop here,

2956
02:33:35,970 --> 02:33:38,530
and continue to silently tread on forward.

2957
02:33:38,530 --> 02:33:40,890
I love you. Thank you.

2958
02:33:43,830 --> 02:33:45,200
All our expectations were broken.

2959
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:47,130
It's really not going as I expected.

2960

[Trainee Kim Ji Woong gets seated in rank 3's chair]

2961
02:33:53,710 --> 02:33:56,660
Trainee Seok Matthew could be rank 1.

2962
02:33:56,660 --> 02:33:59,620
- That's amazing.
- How is this possible?

2963
02:33:59,620 --> 02:34:02,580
- The two of them met again.
- Older and younger brother.

2964
02:34:02,580 --> 02:34:05,520

2965
02:34:05,520 --> 02:34:08,170
What's happening to us?

2966
02:34:11,670 --> 02:34:15,070
- Think about our first day.
- I know.

2967
02:34:15,070 --> 02:34:17,750
- I think I'll only get 2 Stars.
- 2 Stars? Don't be silly.

2968
02:34:17,750 --> 02:34:20,010
- I'm really scared.
- Don't be.

2969
02:34:20,010 --> 02:34:22,560
Just be yourself.

2970
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:26,530
We're always together and it really makes me feel proud.

2971
02:34:26,530 --> 02:34:28,620
I think I'll remember this forever.

2972
02:34:28,620 --> 02:34:30,230
- Me too.
- All right.

2973
02:34:30,230 --> 02:34:33,750
It's like fate is playing a joke on them.

2974
02:34:33,750 --> 02:34:36,000
The two best friends have become candidates for rank 1.

2975
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,740
Trainee Seok Matthew. You're competing for first place

2976
02:34:38,740 --> 02:34:42,790
with your best friend, Sung Han Bin.

2977
02:34:42,790 --> 02:34:44,490
How do you feel?

2978
02:34:44,490 --> 02:34:45,760
This is seriously like a drama.

2979
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:49,760
I never even imagined this situation.

2980
02:34:49,760 --> 02:34:55,500
When we saw the preview for Boys Planet, we talked about trying out for it.

2981
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:58,630
We just laughed back then. Thinking it was impossible.

2982
02:34:58,630 --> 02:35:02,640
But now that I'm really here,

2983
02:35:02,640 --> 02:35:09,880
for the first time in my life, my dream has become a reality.

2984
02:35:09,880 --> 02:35:15,230
That's sort of how I feel, so I'm very touched.

2985
02:35:24,270 --> 02:35:25,790
Don't cry.

2986
02:35:27,020 --> 02:35:29,910
Then what about you, Trainee Sung Han Bin?

2987
02:35:32,140 --> 02:35:38,840
Starting from when I prepared for Boys Planet with Matthew,

2988
02:35:38,840 --> 02:35:46,840
I always said to him, "Let's move toward our dreams."

2989
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:56,040
Standing here with Matthew has made me realize that my determination was right.

2990
02:35:56,040 --> 02:35:59,700
This will be a very memorable day for me. Thank you.

2991
02:36:02,310 --> 02:36:05,660
Big and unexpected changes keep happening in Boys Planet.

2992
02:36:05,660 --> 02:36:09,590
- Who will be in rank 1?
- I think I'm going to cry.

2993
02:36:09,590 --> 02:36:18,630
- I'll reveal the trainee that will take...
- Don't cry.

2994
02:36:18,630 --> 02:36:20,010
the honorable spot now.

2995
02:36:20,010 --> 02:36:22,890
Gosh, those two are in rank 1 and 2.

2996
02:36:22,890 --> 02:36:26,090

2998

I don't know.

3000
02:36:32,710 --> 02:36:34,090
I have no idea.

Come on.

3002
02:36:35,850 --> 02:36:38,470
He has taken the killing parts for every performance

3003
02:36:38,470 --> 02:36:41,490
and has never given up his spot in first place.

Will trainee Sung Han Bin place first again?

3008
02:36:57,990 --> 02:37:02,920
Or will Seok Matthew take first place

3009
02:37:02,920 --> 02:37:07,440
after rising to become the first-place candidate in lightning speed?

3010

3011
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:16,570
I will reveal him now.

I'm just happy that I'm here.

Which trainee will have the honor of sitting on the winner's seat?

3016
02:37:34,550 --> 02:37:36,640
What a fierce fight, right?

3017
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:38,990
- It's 1st and 2nd place.
- We never know.

We think trainee Sung Han Bin will be rank 1,

3019
02:37:41,590 --> 02:37:43,990
but trainee Seok Matthew could take his place.

3020
02:37:43,990 --> 02:37:45,870
I don't think that'll happen.

3021
02:37:45,870 --> 02:37:47,650

3022

The score gap between the two

3129
02:44:26,690 --> 02:44:31,330
that sealed their fate was only 3,646 points.

3130
02:44:31,330 --> 02:44:34,060
I don't think I'll make it, if that's the difference.

3131
02:44:34,060 --> 02:44:36,700
That's really close.

3132
02:44:38,400 --> 02:44:44,000
Will Trainee Jeong I Chan who showed his chicness during the performance of "Danger" be rank 52?

3133

Or will it be Trainee Yuki who takes the spot with a cute performance of "Very Nice?"

3134
02:44:53,370 --> 02:44:55,410
Yuki did a good job on stage.

3135

Trainee Jeong I Chan remains at Boys Planet as the last survivor.

3148

Trainee's Jeong I Chan's final rank would've gotten him eliminated,

It was the benefit.

To be honest, after my last performance,

3152
02:46:10,330 --> 02:46:16,700
I was very dissatisfied about myself and felt very bad towards my members.
