He's really good at training others.

212

- Shall we?
- Should we just continue where we stopped? We'll be done with this soon.

00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,280
I'm excited!

364
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,510
I think we need to be approved by him to survive.

365

[What will Master Lee say?]

376
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,850
Overall, you're the farthest behind in terms of learning the song.

377
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,490
Min Gyu's voice is really loud.

378
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,380

I was just joking there, but...

382
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,500
if you stick out too much, it'd be kind of funny.

383
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,950
People would only remember that you sang really loudly.

384
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,390
I think you need to tone it down.

385
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:29,570
For the rap part, I think Woo Jin has a very poor sense of rhythm.

[Focused]

388
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,950
When you rap, the beat is like one, two, three, four.

389
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:49,160
If you put energy on the one, two, three, four,

390
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,630
you could follow the beat better.

391
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,110
I think you should practice a lot more.

392
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,740
There's none right now.

393
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,330

I think we need to be approved by him to survive.

397
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,310
Tae Rae, did you always have a voice like that?

398
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,860
Why does it feel like you're pulling the sound back?

399

You sound older than you actually are overall.

402
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:22,470
Tae Rae's voice fits ballads.

403
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,660
Try singing one more time. Let me point it out for you.

404

Look.

405
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,330

[He's bending his voice much]

407
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,430
You should tighten it if you want to sound more upbeat.

408
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,710
You elongate everything too much.

409
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,820
I think he should practice that a lot.

890

Let's make that "Since I came to Korea and even appeared on TV,"

891
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:59,110
"I mistakenly thought that everything was going perfectly."

892

"Holding onto the Korean I cannot speak well,"

894
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:07,720
Holding onto, as in not giving up and letting go.

895

"When I'm alone, my eyes swell."

896

I know... It didn't come out today...

914
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:02,400
But we may not come out next time, too. So let's not get our hopes up.

915
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,410
I'll write about how our Star Level Test performance never aired during the first and second episodes.

916
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:11,530
"I was completely edited out during the first two episodes, but I clenched my fist and survived,"

00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,410
so I want to talk about Seo Bin.

924
