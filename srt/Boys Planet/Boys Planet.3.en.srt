- has ended.

Thanks for your hard work.

183
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,600

184

186

It's not our final level?

187
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,950
Really? Really?

188
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,090
One more chance?

189
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,890
Masters attended tests in separate rooms, right?

190
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:15,550
For that reason, the rooms couldn't have had the same criteria.

191
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:20,980
That's why we watched your Signal Song Test again.

192
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,300
We checked again to see if anyone was judged improperly.

193
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,250
- We could go down, right?
- We can either go up or down.

194
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,030
You can either go up or down.

195
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,550
That's for sure.

196
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,500
They have to be fair.

197
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,160
If I get the All Star taken away, I'll accept it.

198
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,970
What if I go back down? They shouldn't take the stars back, should they?

199
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,550
We'll let you know right now.

200

212
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,220
But he lacks a bit to be given All Star, right?

213

You need two rappers, at least.

We're best friends and rivals, as well.

00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:41,270
He suggested doing Blackpink's song.

882
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:44,620
That was the last song I wanted to do.

883
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,900
- We need to!
- We'll lose if we do "Kill This Love."

884
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,940
Please trust him.

885
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,160
He's never wrong.

886
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,710
I really don't think it should be "Kill This Love."

887
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:56,540
Hyung, please!

888
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,950
To be honest, I can't dance.

889
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,370
It's okay.

890
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:00,990
Hide behind me. Seriously.

891
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,400
Hwan Hee kept insisting he wanted to avoid "Kill This Love."

892
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:09,530
But I insisted even more strongly.

893
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:13,110
So I persuaded Hwan Hee and completed our team.

894
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:16,200
[Group K's "Kill This Love" team was completed]

895
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:22,240
Unfortunately, the ones that weren't chosen will be on the same team.

896
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:26,950
I was definitely a bit disappointed.

897
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:29,350
I felt abandoned, maybe?

898
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,460
I'm embarrassed.

899
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:36,780
There's one more important decision to make for the first mission.

900
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:41,020
You need to pick the mission song to perform.

901
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,890
There are rooms with mission song panels on the wall.

902
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:47,540
Discuss which song you want to perform with the teammates

903
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,510
and grab the panel of the song you want.

904
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,820
The team you'd run into in the studio

905
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:56,300
will be your opponent, who will do a 1:1 battle with you.

906
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:02,880
Except for the "Kill This Love" teams who already was given the song,

907
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,400
the teams with higher-ranking leaders will get to choose the mission song.

908
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:13,600
I thought we would be running, so I was stretching my body.

909
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,280
Like this. I totally didn't expect this.

910

911

Let's discuss this slowly.

912
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,530
I was so happy that I got to choose the song first.

913
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:27,430
I'm so happy. This is also a benefit.

914
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:31,010
Then they'll have to do to the song that's left.

915
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,750
They must feel so upset.

916
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,310
Our team was formed from the seven members who weren't chosen,

917
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,300
and we got the song that nobody chose, so I was pretty upset.

918
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,740
We will officially start choosing the songs.

919
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:46,590
Group K Trainee Lee Hoe Taek's team, please get moving.

920
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,040
- So scary.
- Me, too.

921
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,980
We really can't afford to get the same song...

922
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,570
I was so nervous. Please don't take the song I want.

923
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:59,950
Please, please don't take it.

924

["Kill This Love" is grayed out because it's already taken]

926
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:13,190
There are quite a few to choose from.

927
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:19,520
When I first picked our team members, I chose those who were fresh and young.

928
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,220
That's right. So I'll choose "Love Me Right."

929
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:29,100
I also thought "Love Me Right" would be best to show off our image and energy.

930
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:34,220
[I have a different opinion]

931
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:39,200
I thought if we did "Burn It Up," we could show off our performance abilities with an audience there,

932
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,990
and we could put on an overwhelming stage.

933
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:44,590
Shall we vote between these two since we have seven members?

934
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:46,040
Okay, sounds good.

935
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,310
One, two, three!

936

- Is it okay if I do the main vocal part?
- Of course!

We talked about it in advance before Hwan Hee hyung distributed the parts.

I was a bit upset that I couldn't get the main vocal part.

Was it like there were two suns in the sky?

1125

Rather than having two suns, Hwan Hee hyung is more like the moon,

This is ridiculous.

1143

I wasn't feeling very confident, to be honest.

1217
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:43,010
But Jung Hyun was great, so I thought, "He must take this part for the team's sake."

1218

Raise your hand if you think Seo Won fits the part better.

1219

- Raise your hand if Jung Hyun sounds better.
- I'm nervous.

I think I can pull it off well.

1381
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:31,870

- What do I do?

I ended up not doing very well.

1388
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:55,400
I don't think I did a good job.

1389
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,710
The person who will take the killing part is...

1390
01:13:57,710 --> 01:13:59,600
- Please think of when I performed "Kick It."
- What?

1391
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,610
Please think of when I performed "Kick It."

- Don't say that.

- I'll take it.

1403

So it didn't work out well.

- Yes.

[So, who'd like to be the leader instead of me?]

1412
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:16,110
I think Kamden should be the leader.

1413
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,030
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1414
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:20,820
Can I be the leader?

1415
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:22,950
- Sounds good.
- Yes, okay. I like that.

1416

I'm very confident that I can lead the team.

1417

- Okay!
- Okay, Kamden.

1418
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:34,710
I was the first to volunteer as the leader, and everyone agreed.

I was very worried about them as the leader.

1422
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:49,120
Group K is already choosing their positions. Let's get started.

1424
01:15:52,470 --> 01:15:55,770
- Me.
- I want to do it.

1426
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:02,290
You guys are going to try "Hey, you want to come in," okay?

1427
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:05,600
But...

1428
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,280
Let's not think about the killing part and discuss which parts we want.

1429

[Ricky is taken aback by Krystian's opposing opinion.]

1431
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:18,500
I also think we should choose the other parts first and the killing part should be last.

1432
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,930
I agree with you, but I think he wants to choose the killing part first.

1433

No rush, no rush. Let's not rush.

1438

I wish they would communicate with me more.

1439
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:53,020
But they wouldn't really answer me. We're a team in the end.

1440
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:55,030
It was very frustrating.

1441
01:16:55,030 --> 01:17:02,740
Okay, let's do the next part. I want to be the main rapper.

1442
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:06,060
How about the two of us sing, and you guys vote?

1443
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:09,350
How can we do that when I can't sing the part?

1444

- Yes.

- There are no volunteers?
- We can pick it.

- I'll try.
- "Hey, you want to come in?"

You definitely deserve this part, though.

- I'll let you have it.
- Are you sure?

1451

- Thank you.

- Thank you.
- It'll be hard to dance in sync with me.

1554
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:12,340
You have to hold your moves for a long time. The angle has to be perfect.

1555

01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:05,730
My first pick was "Very Nice," too, that's why I chose them.

1880
01:40:06,910 --> 01:40:08,750
What's the reason you chose "Very Nice"?

1881
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:10,770
First, the choreography is great.

1882
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:13,760
It's incredible.

[The original choreographer is proud]

1884
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:21,180
I thought he was a very powerful rival.

1885
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:23,130
I'll watch Group G first.

1886
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:28,350
Who's in charge of the choreography?

1887
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:31,180
It's Ouju and Cong.

1888
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:34,150
You went from star to 3 stars, right?

1889
01:40:34,150 --> 01:40:36,630
- Three stars. I'm Cong.
- Yes, that's right.

1890
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:38,300
[During the Signal Song Test]

1891
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,800
[Cong pulled off both singing and dancing successfully]

1892
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,340
He did so well.

1893
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:45,520
- Three.
- Yes.
- He deserves it.

1894
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,650
You went up two stars.

1895
01:40:47,650 --> 01:40:49,210
You must be a good dancer, Cong.

1896
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:51,660
- Okay, let's see.
- Yes, sir.

1897
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:57,980
He's the one who made the choreography, so I'm sure he'll be very detailed.

1898
01:40:57,980 --> 01:41:01,210
[Group G will show off what they've been practicing as well as singing live]

1899
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:06,860
[Trainee Cong gets the lyrics wrong from the start]

1900
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:09,130

01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:12,810
[Dancing is not in sync]

1902
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:18,440
[They're all dancing in their own way]

1903

[Group G is incredibly nervous]

1906
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:40,460
I chose the members,

1907
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:44,260
but everyone wasn't as good as I thought.

1908
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:46,680
I'm very nervous.

1909
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:50,360
Your dancing is

1910
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:52,290
not just bad,

1911
01:41:53,570 --> 01:41:56,780
it's a bit embarrassing.

1912
01:41:58,330 --> 01:42:00,530
I did a lousy job with the choreography.

1913
01:42:00,530 --> 01:42:02,780
[Drops his head]

1914
01:42:03,770 --> 01:42:05,290
I'm sorry.

1915
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:08,250
I was very scared.

1916
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:11,040
- The atmosphere was bad.
- We totally flopped.

1917
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,840
I think we needed a lot of work.

1918
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:17,570
Even if you practice more,

1919
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:19,280
I wonder if you'll improve much.

1920
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:22,790
Your dancing is so bad that I'm worried.

1921
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:26,580
Hiroto and Cong, you two will have to help a lot.

1922
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:29,310
- Ouju also.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

1923
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:34,210
To be honest, there were a few guys who couldn't focus.

1924
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:36,140
They were watching Group K practicing.

1925
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:38,720
[Ma Jing Xiang and Ichika practiced alongside Group K]

1926
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:41,810
Or some would go watch the video alone.

1927
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:45,500
[Cong was checking the video alone during the practice]

1928
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,310
Wait, just a second.

1929

He's in his own world.

1930
01:42:51,890 --> 01:42:54,990
I felt like everyone was being selfish.

1931
01:42:54,990 --> 01:42:57,130
I thought that a lot.

1932
01:42:57,130 --> 01:43:00,490
I thought we needed to have an honest conversation.

1933
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:02,970
- Okay, let's talk.
- Okay.

1934
01:43:02,970 --> 01:43:06,490
Honestly, none of you are focused.

1935
01:43:06,490 --> 01:43:08,040
[I agree]

1936
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:09,860
Don't look at Group K.

1937
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:12,560
Don't look at them. We have to focus.

1938
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:16,450
I think I need more personal time to practice.

1939
01:43:16,450 --> 01:43:18,330
Ma Jing Xiang is right, too,

1940
01:43:18,330 --> 01:43:22,930
but that's why we don't have teamwork.

1941
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:25,830
- You're right.
- I think

1942
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:28,760
we lack consideration for one another.

1943
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:34,090
The most important thing is the team benefits.

1944
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:37,480
Without it, we don't have personal benefits either.

1945
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:38,990
You're right.

1946
01:43:38,990 --> 01:43:40,550
Let's be considerate of each other.

1947
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:43,240
- Trust each other and care for each other.
- Teamwork.
