266

00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,030
Their singing was disappointing.

356
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,910
I can see you studied a lot.

357
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,780
I can see you studied a lot.

358
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,710
Ma Jing Xiang.

359
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,400
- I'm sorry to interrupt you.
- Hold on.

360
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,900
But you can't be biased because it's your choreography.

361
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,960
- You seem very excited, Master.
- No.

362
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,470
- His face is red.
- I'm just happy and grateful.

363
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,540
- His tone went up.
- I love this dance.

364
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,840
[Laughing]

365
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,660
I could tell you really tried to mimic the original dance.

366
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,330
So I enjoyed watching it.

367
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,470
I have a different opinion.

368
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,590
I was shocked when I heard you sing.

369
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,920
There were parts when you were very much in tune.

370
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,860
But I realized it was live AR.

371
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,200
Everything else was completely off-tune.

372
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,900
[Nothing was in tune.]

373
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,540
Their singing was terrible.

374
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,950
Good job.

375
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,030
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

376
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,280
They did their best. It was a hard song.

377
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,790
They beat everyone when it comes to looks.

378
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,780
Yes, they're physically the best.

379
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,660
Their appearance deserves All Stars.

380
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,760
We'll take a break to check the cameras.

381
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,150
[The staff checks the system as they take a break.]

382
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,290
Fighting!

383
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:33,140
[The trainees pose for the cameras.]

384
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,020
What are they doing right now?

385
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,680
You know how they show people on screen in baseball games?

386
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,600
I think that's what they're doing.

387
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,600
- You're handsome!
- He looks cool.

388
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,940
- What is he doing?
- That's hilarious.

389
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,680
When he came on the screen

390
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,180
my heart fluttered again.

391
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,840
[One man's heart started to flutter.]

392
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,790
Gosh, seriously.

393
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,500
He's so doe-eyed.

394
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,470
He looked like a deer with flower buds in his eyes.

395
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,290
I was looking for my chance.

396
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,570
I kept glancing at him.

397
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,470
I debated for a long time.

398
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,720
I was desperate.

399
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,120
I didn't want to look back

400
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,100
and have regrets.

401
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,060
I wanted to kiss him.

402
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,000
["Love is the prerogative of the brave." by Mahatma Gandhi]

403
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,030
I thought my heart was being ripped out.

404
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,100
It's all for show.

405
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,920
It was...

406
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,470
pretty fun.

407
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,540
Yes.

408
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,800
- There should be at least one character like me.
- Sure.

409
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,570
Is there a memorable trainee?

410
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:42,070
There's a very sexy-looking guy.

411
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,540
He's super handsome.

412
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,940
What?

413
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,910
I thought he was a model.

414
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,710
[He cheers when the super sexy and handsome guy appears.]

415
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,180
Trainee Kim Ji Woong.

416
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,500
I heard he's 25 years old.

417
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,050
The guy named Ji Woong is so handsome.

418
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,260
He has the face that guys like.

419
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,210
They're good-looking.

420
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,770
- He's really handsome.
- He's good-looking.

421
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,410
- I ran into him in the bathroom, and he stood out.
- Really?

422
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,180
- Trainee Kim Ji Woong.
- Yes.

423
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,760
My gosh, he's shirtless?

424
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,270
We'll be able to see inside if he bends.

425
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,490
Would you like to go put on a shirt if you forgot to?

426
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,960
You're right.

427
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,140
- We're not scolding you.
- Okay.

428
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,090
- It's that your style is...
- It's my concept.

429
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,370
Are you supposed to be the sexy guy?

430
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,910
I was wondering if you were wearing a very deep V-neck shirt.

431
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,460
- No.
- If a V-neck is that deep...

432
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,780
I'll check.

433
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,130
I'll check.

434
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,160
There's nothing.

435
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,740
He got shy.

436
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,930
He looks really tough,

437
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,890
but he's gentle-hearted.

438
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,370
Kim Ji Woong looks very familiar.

439
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:06,630
You're currently an actor.

440
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,160
- You were in "Kissable Lips"...
- Yes.

441
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,400
and "Roommates of Poonduck 304."

442
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,390
- What's with the titles?
- That's the title?

443
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,830
The genre is BL.

444
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,590
Is that so?

445
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,460
He looks like an actor.

446
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,570
I don't care if you're a guy.

447
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,830
[Trainee Kim Ji Woong was the protagonist in dramas about love between men.]

448
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,130
I like you.

449
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,770
You're a top OTT actor.

450
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,300
Is there a reason you haven't given up your dream of becoming an idol?

451
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,110
Don't actors earn more than idols?

452
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:41,620
I debuted once in 2016.

453
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,810
[Trainee Kim Ji Woong debuted in 2016 as INX, a group of 5 boys.]

454
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,830
I debuted and worked when I wasn't ready.

455
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,910
I realized how underprepared I was back then.

456
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,330
Acting is fun.

457
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:56,390
It still doesn't make me as happy as singing and dancing.

458
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,150
I have never given up on my dream to be a singer.

459
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,890
I believe this is my last chance.

460
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,940
I would be grateful if you give me this chance.

461
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,640
- All right, shall we watch their performance?
- Okay.

462
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,080
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

463
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,610
I wonder how sexy they'll be.

464
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,370
We haven't seen a sexy performance yet.

465
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,530
Yes, not yet.

466
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,690
The flower was a prop?

467
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,060
[Mirotic (by TVXQ): Kim Ji Woong, Yoon Jong Woo, Lee Seung Hwan, Jeong I Chan, Jung Hwan Rok]

468
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,810
What?

469
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,230
[They not only captured the hearts of girls but boys too.]

470
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,850
That was so...

471
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,140
We shouldn't have watched it.

472
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,870
- My gosh.
- That made me feel...

473
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,720
I feel strange.

474
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,510
- Seriously.
- I'm feeling weird.

475
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,280
That was very sensuous.

476
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,370
That was a new interpretation of "Mirotic."

477
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:17,470
I've never watched a boy group perform

478
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,360
and feel strange like this.

479
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,590
That was a valuable first experience for me.

480
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,170
- Thank you very much.
- "Valuable first experience"?

481
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,100
I almost fell in love.

482
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,140
- Trainee Yoon Jong Woo.
- Yes.

483
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,180
- You sang an octave lower in the middle.
- He did.
- I liked it.

484
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,090
[Trainee Yoon Jong Woo sang an octave lower than the original song.]

485
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,630
That was a great idea.

486
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,060
- I mean it.
- Thank you.

487
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,150
Did you ever think to lower the octave? Yes or no.

488
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,730
- I only thought of raising it.
- Me too.

489
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,810
While watching your performance,

490
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:53,390
it felt like trainee Ji Woong found his color.

491
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:56,230
He found his color instead of his shirt?

492
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,840
He's good.

493
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,100
- He was very sexy when he danced in the center.
- I agree.

494
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,730
Trainee Yoon Jong Woo...

495
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,570
and Kim Ji Woong.

496
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,090
You got three stars.

497
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,310
[Jung Hwan Rok, Lee Seung Hwan, Jeong I Chan: 2 stars, Yoon Jong Woo, Kim Ji Woong: 3 stars]

498
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,210
[I focused too hard.]

499
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,130
He's the youngest in Group G.

500
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,000
- He's here.
- It's Takuto.

501
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,210
- Takuto!
- Takuto.

502
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,190
- The youngest member of Group G.
- I was waiting for Takuto!

503
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,690
I'm so excited.

504
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,560
I was very nervous when I walked in.

505
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,780
But he started sending me hearts.

506
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,610
I thought, "Does he send hearts to strangers?"

507
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,630
[Yes, I do!]

508
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,770
[I've never met you, but here's my heart!]

509
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,300
Why does he keep sending hearts?

510
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,760
Where is he sending it to?

511
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,990
He seemed different.

512
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,280
He's a peculiar one.

513
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,490
Hello.

514
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,160
[Even his entrance is different.]

515
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,520
[It's like his solo concert.]

516
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,780
I really wanted to see him.

517
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,200
Hello. I'm from Saitama, Japan.

518
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,880
My name is Toyonaga Takuto. Toyonaga Takuto!

519
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,830
[He fell in love.]

520
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,560
Why did you wear gloves?

521
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,720
This is for my performance of "Instead of Saying Goodbye."

522
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,640
- The song by Rain.
- It's for his performance.

523
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,730
This song came out in 2002.

524
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,590
When were you born, Takuto?

525
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,430
I was born in 2007.

526
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,760
2007...

527
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,640
He's the same age as me.

528
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,950
07?

529
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,390
Really? He was just born.

530
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,370

00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,690
All Stars?

708
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,960
"You got All Stars."

709
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,250
- You got three stars.
- Okay, thank you.

710
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,910
Trainee Park Min Seok, you got two stars.

711
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,190
Trainees Lee Jung Hyun

712
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,040
and Kim Tae Rae.

713
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,040
You got three stars.

714
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,270
- I think Han Bin will get All Stars.
- I agree.

715
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,850
- Lastly, trainee Park Han Bin.
- All Stars.

716
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,310
- All Stars.
- All Stars.

717
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,580
[Group K desperately needs All Stars.]

718
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,530
You got All Stars. Congratulations.

719
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,620
[Trainee Park Han Bin gave Group K All Stars.]

720
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:13,380
- This kid was lacking a little.
- Yes.

721
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,300
It can be deceiving when they're dancing in a group.

722
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,270
Trainee Park Han Bin stood out the most for me.

723
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,100
It seemed like he was carrying the entire team on his back.

724
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,310
We might end up getting the song a day later.

725
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:34,570
[What's the last performance that will decide the fate of the two groups?]

726
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,370
- He seems very nervous.
- Yes.

727
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,850
This is nerve-racking for me.

728
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:49,070
He's the leader of the PENTAGON. He's been an idol for seven years.

729
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,610
He's a big senior.

730
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:54,150
I'm sure this wasn't an easy challenge for you.

731
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:58,510
May I ask why you joined BOYS PLANET?

732
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,810
I had hundreds of reasons.

733
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,290
The biggest reason was...

734
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,960
I needed change.

735
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,750
When I got back from my military service

736
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,780
and returned to the group PENTAGON,

737
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,770
things had changed a lot.

738
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:19,270
To be honest...

739
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,730
Why...

740
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,500
I'm sorry.

741
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:33,320
It became hard for us to even work with who we wanted to.

742
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,210
It was the first time we experienced so much rejection.

743
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,520
I thought,

744
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:49,510
"We're no longer appealing enough to work with." It made me so sad.

745
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,210
It felt like I couldn't do much.

746
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:55,440
Whether it be for my member or this situation.

747
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,580
It was hard to overcome the invisible wall.

748
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,950
The only option for me now

749
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,310
is BOYS PLANET.

750
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,990
That's why I'm here.

751
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:11,630
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

752
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,520
It's impossible for us to understand.

753
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,670
How could we understand what he's feeling?

754
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,060
[Another trainee feels a mix of emotions.]

755
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,710
It was so sad.

756
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:25,980
It felt like he said everything that was on my mind.

757
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,750
I'm UP10TION's Hwanhee from TOP Media.

758
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,360
I'm currently in the group NINE.i...

759
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,880
It's been about two years since I debuted as TO1.

760
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,960
I thought everything would work out if I debuted.

761
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,290
However...

762
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,350
There are a lot of participants who have already debuted.

763
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,480
It's like entering the eye of a needle now.

764
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,470
The competition is incredibly fierce.

765
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,540
I think it's getting harder by the day.

766
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,340
The standard has gotten very high, and there are few opportunities.

767
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:00,410
I can't perform just because I want to.

768
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:06,500
I thought a lot about how I won't be able to perform anymore.

769
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,520
I questioned what was in the future for me.

770
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:13,890
I think I'm more desperate because I debuted.

771
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:17,700
I know better than anyone how precious that is.

772
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:22,660
The fact that he didn't give up and tried again

773
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,540
is very difficult, in my opinion.

774
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:30,720
- Okay, please prepare your performance Hoe Taek.
- Okay.

775
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,640
We need to enjoy this.

776
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,470
- I'm looking forward to this.
- Yes, I wonder what he'll perform.

777
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,340
- I'm going to be very objective.
- Of course.

778
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:43,640
- I'm sure that's what he wants.
- I think I'll judge him more strictly.

779
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:48,990
I'm going to dance, sing, and show my determination as Lee Hoe Taek.

780
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:53,740
I plan to burn everything up at this stage.

781
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,150
[What will Lee Hoe Taek perform?]

782
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:58,220
Your Star Levels will be reset.

783
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,620
They plan to bring us down to one star.

784
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,460
I'm going to remain at this level.

785
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,990
Your pitch is an issue.

786
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,970
- Just became an actor.
- I feel terrible.

787
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,200
Hold on.

788
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,990
You can't say you got All Stars if you sing like this.

789
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,470
I think you should be on "Street Man Fighter."

790
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,010
I think you can aim for All Stars.

791
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:13,470
Would you like to go down completely?

792
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:16,210
- I have no talent.
- I was very nervous.

793
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:21,380
[What are the trainees' results?]

794
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,890
[Coming soon]

795
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,650
[The second live voting will be revealed.]

796
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,320
[Who is currently in first place?]

797
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,950
[Shut Down (by BLACKPINK): Lee Hoe Taek]

798
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,250
He's singing "Shut Down"?

799
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,850
The arrangement.

800
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,770
[Standing ovation]

801
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:17,320
Hold back, hold back, hold back...

802
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,430
It was that hand...

803
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,960
I don't want to compliment you this much,

804
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,910
but it'd be tough for you guys to beat him.

805
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,190
Yes.

806
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,020
I can't beat him.

807
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,080
Did you make that arrangement by chance?

808
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,560
Yes, I did it myself.

809
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,730
Of course.

810
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:41,870
He's a genius.

811
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,920
- We'll be discussing.
- Yes, got it.

812
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,550
Is it even necessary to talk about it?

813
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,000
I don't think so.

814
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,760
This makes him an All Star.

815
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,030
He's an All Star.

816
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,480
- Let's get back to our seats.
- Yes.

817
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:56,290
What?

818
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,280
Does anyone disagree?

819
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,540
I have a lot of things to say.

820
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,870
I do understand what you mean.

821
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:09,270
He sacrificed his voice by trying to perform.

822
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,020
There were better performers than him.

823
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,940
I don't think they'll give it to him.

824
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,300
I have a feeling they won't give it to him.

825
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,870
Hoe Taek is sincere too. He participated sincerely to get judged objectively.

826
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:23,360
So in order to judge him sincerely...

827
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,960
I'll announce the result.

828
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,080
Trainee Lee Hoe Taek.

829
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,110
[What would be Hoe Taek's result after the masters varying opinions?]

830
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:40,150
All Star. We'll give you an All Star.

831
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:42,860
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

832
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,400
You worked hard.

833
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,380
You were so impressive.

834
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:51,540
If we don't give it to him, who should we give it to?

835
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,230
- Don't you agree?
- He overcame his lacking performance with his voice.

836
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,420
That's how good he was.

837
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:01,970
I have three stars here because of my dancing skills.

838
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:06,870
I watched a video of myself dancing and was so unimpressed by it.

839
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:10,080
So I'll try my best to improve that.

840
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,590
Thank you.

841
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:12,730
Thank you!

842
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,720
That's all.

843
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,630
We were torn because of that.

844
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:18,090
He's so cool.

845
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,300
I finally got four.

846
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:29,700
I was so happy.

847
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,340
My desire to acknowledge and prove

848
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:36,310
was so great,

849
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:39,990
but I'm grateful that I was allowed to give it a try.

850
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,570
I think I'll try my best.

The Star Level Test has finally ended.

00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:55,390
I'll announce the winning group, who'd be accessing the next

854
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:59,460
test song for BOYS PLANET a day earlier.

855
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,060
K! Please be K!

856
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:04,330
- Please.
- Please, a day earlier...

857
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,880
I think it'd be neck and neck.

858
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,340
[Which would be the final winning team of the Star Level Test?]

859
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,270
Let's start with zero stars.

860
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,350
Group K had five, and Group G had 11.

861
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:17,370
I felt bad that I couldn't contribute to Group G.

862
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:20,420
I caused trouble for my team. I'm sorry, everyone.

863
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,790
And here's for one star.

864
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:25,520
Group K had five, and Group G had 13.

865
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,580
Here's for two stars.

866
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:30,040
Group K had 14, and Group G had 12.

867
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,660
It's so close.

868
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,340
I think we could win.

869
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,810
Here's for three stars.

870
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:38,610
Group K had 14, and Group G had eight.

871
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:39,820
We have a chance. We have a chance!

872
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:40,780
We have a chance.

873
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,000
We might have many All Stars, then.

874
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,550
Lastly, it's All Star.

875
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,540
I haven't been so nervous all day.

876
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,120
Please...

877
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,030
All Star. Group G had five.

Don't be sad that you received zero stars.

I thought of it as an opportunity to get All Star.

941

I have to get All Star no matter what.

952

And the lower your level is, the worse your position on the stage will be.

953

Zero stars, which is the lowest level,

954

955

So they'll perform on the floor.

1961

[His dancing is lacking]

1966

We saw Group K get our results,

1969

but I'm also curious about what Group G got.

1970
01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:43,210
So we need to think about the ratio.

1971
01:46:43,210 --> 01:46:45,530
Since we had a lot of 3 stars, we're at a disadvantage.

1972
01:46:45,530 --> 01:46:49,000
If we don't maintain our levels, we could lose 20 or 30 stars,

1973
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,750
but for them, if just their low-level trainees level up, that's an addition of 30 stars.

1974
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:53,000
Since our Stars ratio was reversed from the start,

1975
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,790
we can't help but be at a disadvantage.

I mean, the thing is...

1999

If I look at his vocals, I can give him All Star based on his potential.

2000

From his potential.

2001
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:19,470

01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:53,780
I feel like you're thinking that

2094
01:53:53,780 --> 01:53:58,140
you're not that bad at dancing...

2095
01:53:58,140 --> 01:53:59,480
Yes.

2096
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:04,530
But what's for sure is that you did the worst out of everyone here.

2097
01:54:04,530 --> 01:54:07,260
- You did the worst out of everyone here.
- Okay, understood.

2098
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:08,960
[Trainee Lee Hoe Taek received negative feedback during dance training.]

2099
01:54:10,230 --> 01:54:14,590
It was upsetting and embarrassing.

2100
01:54:14,590 --> 01:54:18,710
I knew that I was lacking.

2101
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:29,080
My dancing was so bad, even when I saw it.

2102
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:30,980
Why am I so bad at it?

2103
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:33,760
[After the training, Trainee Lee Hoe Taek devotes himself to practice]

2104
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:36,660
[But unlike his desires, he's still too slow at memorizing the choreo]

2105
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:38,410
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

2106
01:54:38,410 --> 01:54:40,090
What was the rhythm for the song again?

2107
01:54:42,940 --> 01:54:45,150
Min Seoung, Ye Dam, when we do this part,

2108
01:54:45,150 --> 01:54:46,670
is there a different feel we're supposed to have?

2109
01:54:46,670 --> 01:54:48,200
Do we just have to hit our chest?

2110
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:49,770
Are we hitting it like this?

2111
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:53,280
[Personally asking for help from other trainees]

2112
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:55,360
Okay, okay, thank you.

2113
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:59,240
But if I was in the situation of having been an artist before I came here,

2114
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:01,020
I don't think I would have been able to ask around like that.

2115
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:04,490
The way he would humble himself before guys much younger than him

2116
01:55:04,490 --> 01:55:07,050
was cool, but as a fan, it hurt to see it.

2117
01:55:07,050 --> 01:55:08,920
I thought that he was amazing.

2118
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:10,150
I'm fine.

2119
01:55:10,150 --> 01:55:13,230
I believe that if you're lacking, then you should learn.

2120
01:55:13,230 --> 01:55:16,820
I feel no shame in asking around to learn.

2121
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:20,910
You twist, and then? Han Bin?

2122

I want to survive no matter what,

2125

[His skills are up to people's expectations.]

2129

[Trainee Lee Hoe Taek forgot the lyrics because he's nervous.]

2131
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:07,560
Oh, he messed up the lyrics.

[Trainee Lee Hoe Taek enters the Star Checking Zone.

[He enters the waiting room while receiving many cheers]

2139
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,610
Of course, he'll be coming to All Star.

2140
01:56:46,610 --> 01:56:50,470
I mean, I'm sorry. I should have done well as a representative.

2141
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:52,860
I'm here.

2142
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:54,850
What?

2143

Group K Lee Hoe Taek levels down from All Star to 3 Star.

2144
01:56:56,860 --> 01:57:01,090
He danced as I had expected him to.

2145
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:05,800
He sang with a completely different rhythm and pitch.

2146
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:09,620
[Trainee Lee Hoe Taek sang in harmony rather than the original pitch]

2147
01:57:10,570 --> 01:57:12,650
We need to make a decision based on what we've seen today,

2148
01:57:12,650 --> 01:57:14,910
but the Lee Hoe Taek of today

2149
01:57:14,910 --> 01:57:17,450
was a bit lackluster.

2150
01:57:17,450 --> 01:57:19,830
Gosh, if things go wrong,

2151
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:23,670
then the results could flip to where Group G wins.

2152
01:57:23,670 --> 01:57:26,310
Why is it so hard to be an All Star?

2153
01:57:26,310 --> 01:57:28,880

Because Keita spent valuable practice time with me,

2201

2264
02:04:32,510 --> 02:04:34,500
[A Group K underdog team that threatens Group G Avengers team appears?]

2265
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:37,080
I think it was the most satisfactory performance I've seen up to this point.

2266
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:40,170
I liked listening to Team G's vocals more.

2267
02:04:40,170 --> 02:04:41,700
[The process of preparing for the mission goes differently than expected]

2268
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:43,790
Right now, Group G is more in sync.

2269
02:04:43,790 --> 02:04:46,360
You guys seem like plain trainees!

2270
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:48,930
[The Avengers Team in crisis! What will be their fate?]

2271
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:52,810
Wow, that's crazy.

2272
02:04:52,810 --> 02:04:56,080
[Finally, the D-Day for K vs. G Group Battle arrives]

2273
02:04:57,790 --> 02:05:00,250
We're desperate to survive.

2274
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:01,860
I'll prove myself.

2275
02:05:04,280 --> 02:05:06,460
This stage could become my last.

2276
02:05:06,460 --> 02:05:10,140
I have even more confidence when I'm on stage.

2277
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:12,090
I feel like we'll win for sure.

2278
02:05:12,100 --> 02:05:14,000
I'll demonstrate my brilliance.
