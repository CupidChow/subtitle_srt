This BOYS PLANET stage that you'll perform one last time.

352
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,850
Fighting!

353
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,310
Thank you for your kind words.

354
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,550
Thanks to these dependable Masters,

355
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:48,410
I think the trainees are a bit more relaxed.

356
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:54,570
And we also have some special guests behind the Masters.

357
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:58,620
You can say they're sunbaes for the BOYS PLANET debut group members.

358
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,170
They made their debut through GIRLS PLANET 999

359
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:04,160
and have become global rising star. Kep1er!

360
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,010
Hello!

361
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:17,200
Kep1er, you must be filled with emotion as it brings back memories.

362
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,750
The leader of Kep1er, Choi Yujin,

363
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,720
how do you feel right now?

364
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,140
Even though a year and six months have passed,

365
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,300
the moment we stood in this place is unforgettable.

366
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,850
The 18 trainees who are so nervous right now...

367
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,880
I'll cheer you on. Fighting!

368
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,120
Thank you.

369
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,170
They must be so nervous right now.

370
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:45,040
I'm sure it's a huge support for the trainees.

371
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,640
And...

372
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,300
here are BOYS PLANET family we can't leave out.

373
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,240
To cheer on these 18 trainees,

374
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,310
we are glad to see all the trainees who have joined us for the final live show.

375
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,440
Hello, everyone!

376
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,130
So many faces that I've missed so much are here.

377
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:23,860
Wumuti, who is here to cheer on your friends.

378
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,870
So, what have you been up to all this time?

379
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:29,740
Please say hello to the Star Creators you haven't seen in a while.

380
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,470
Hello, Star Creators! I'm Wumuti.

381
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:40,310
We're seeing the Star Creators first time in a long while.

382
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,970
I'm so excited.

383
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,300
I think we're just as nervous as when we had to perform.

384
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:51,250
And I think so many Star Creators have come to see the final stage.

385
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:57,900
I'm experiencing the love the Star Creators have for us BOYS PLANET once again.

386
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,940
Yes.

387
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,700
Yes, it's really good to see you.

388
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:08,200
Okay then, please say a word of encouragement to the final 18 trainees as well.

389
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,190
Well, we are also trainees

390
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:18,310
but on the outside, we were working hard as Star Creators ourselves.

391
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:23,260
So, we are looking so forward to today's performances.

392
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,680
So, as much as our anticipation, I hope they don't get nervous and shows us cool performances.

393
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,220
Fighting!

394
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,320
Yes, thank you.

395
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,440
Thanks to your passionate support, I'm sure the trainees feel energized.

396
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:45,750
Now, in a moment, while the Star Creators from all over the world are watching,

397
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,200
the final mission stage will unfold.

398
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,550
The final mission that will determine our trainees' fate,

399
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:57,160
Final Top 9 Battle was delivered last week.

400
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:11,420
In Final Top 9 Battle, they will form two teams of nine members and perform new songs.

401
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:20,240
Those two new songs are titled "Jelly Pop" and "Hot Summer."

402
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:27,990
Since this is the last mission where the debut group will be born,

403
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:33,000
competing for the parts for "Jelly Pop" and "Hot Summer" were extremely fierce.

404
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:45,620
Especially, since the global Star Creators chose the killing part themselves,

405
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,270
all the 18 members did their best

406
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,320
and recorded the killing part evaluation session.

407
00:34:55,170 --> 00:35:00,300
I wonder who ended up being the killing part, chosen by the Start Creators, for each song.

408
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,640
I'm so curious.

409
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,260
That result will be revealed in a moment.

410
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,270
Then before we watch their performances,

411
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:16,820
I will reveal how their final practice and training went.

412
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,680
[The trainees' last day of training has arrived.]

413
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,320
[The air feels different from usual.]

414
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,380
What's going on?

415
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,090
- Come on.
- What are they doing?

416
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,940
- What is this?
- Gosh.

417
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,530
- What is this?
- What's going on?

418
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,200
- What?
- What are they doing?

419
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,880
What are they? Flowers?

420
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,420
In 2, 3!

421
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,760
[They finally reveal their surprise gift!]

422
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,610
[Jumbo carnations have bloomed at Planet Camp.]

423
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,350
[Smiling ear to ear]

424
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,060
[They're so touched.]

425
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,820
They must be carnations.

426
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,980
How adorable.

427
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,990
What kind of carnation are we making, Jong Woo hyung?

428
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,850
One that we can wear on our faces.

429
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,410
We need to draw a sketch, okay?

430
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,380
[He's the type to use his head when drawing sketches.]

431
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,980
- Why are you suddenly bowing?
- I need to measure my head.

432
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,500
[Fumbling]

433
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
[He copies Hoe Taek and bows.]

434
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,720
[Why are they bowing?]

435
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,100
Is my face really this big?

436
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,550
I think my face is pretty small.

437
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,180
Is this my face?

438
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,230
Oh, wait. Maybe it is.

439
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,630
[They're a bit rough and clumsy.]

440
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,750
I'll cut it like this.

441
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,200
[But they're putting their hearts into it for the masters.]

442
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,100
[18 shiny carnations]

443
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,110
It's pretty.

444
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,920
[What kind of flowers will bloom?]

445
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,910
[It's time to make a cake out of love now.]

446
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,140
I think this is right.

447
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,770
Is it?

448
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,940
It's so tiring.

449
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,070
How much longer do I need to stir this?

450
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,750
[One trainee is whisking at an outstanding speed.]

451
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,990
[Keita's super fast whisking]

452
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,890
Oh! It worked!

453
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,120
- I got it!
- It worked!

454
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,240
We finished the fastest.

455
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,800
[They're still awkward.]

456
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:02,010
[The cakes are being coated with various colorful whipped cream.]

457
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,100
You're doing well.

458
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,290
[It's still hard to tell what it is.]

459
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,650
Be careful.

460
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,830
- Okay.
- Nice!

461
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,240
Okay, we're done.

462
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,440
[It's a party of somewhat clumsy talented people.]

463
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,470
Okay.

464
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:18,970
[They made 1 cake per master!]

465
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,440
- You did a great job with yours, Jong Woo.
- Thank you.

466
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,580
- That's high quality.
- Wait, Ricky.

467
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,310
Isn't that poo?

468
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,950
- No, it's not.
- That's poo, Ricky.

469
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:35,360
I'm a flower.

470
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,730
- Daebak.
- How pretty.

471
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,960
[What is it now?]

472
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,380
We made something for you, Master pH-1.

473
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,910
- Melting.
- Crumbling.
- Giggling.

474
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,830
Cake!

475
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:49,000
Thank you so much. Daebak.

476
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,830
- They made it themselves.
- My gosh.

477
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,300
It's definitely not store-bought quality.

478
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,010
It looks handmade?

479
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,900
- Master ONESTAR.
- Master ONESTAR.

480
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,090
- You get one star.
- You get one star.

481
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,030
- Thank you.
- I'll get one star, so you guys get all stars.

482
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,710

Thank you. I'm so grateful.

485
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:18,020
You should be practicing. When did you find the time for this?

486
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,840
- We love you, Noona.
- We love you, Noona.

Thank you!

[The cake lost balance because it's heavy with love.]

491

He threw the cake.]

492
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,620
[No, I saved the cake.]

493
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,810
Sir, how could you?

494
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,490
- I'm sorry.
- Sir!

You made such a pretty cake, Yu Jin. Did you only bake for years?

498
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,440
Did you only practice "Kick It" for years?

499
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,080
Did you practice it for years?

500

525
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:57,810
We have 18 finalists now.

526
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:58,950
I want to sincerely congratulate you all.

527
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,260
[It's the first time the trainees saw the masters after the survivor announcement.]

528
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,930
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

529
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,380
We've worked on audition programs before.

530
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,640
But I think this is the first time that

531
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,940
- I felt like it was a shame because everyone was so talented.
- I agree.

532
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,730
[Touched]

533
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,270
- Which team would like to go first?
- We'll go first!

534
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,920
- Okay!
- We'll go first.

535
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,460
- Okay!
- Let's go!

536
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,000
- Kamden hyung raised his hand though.
- He beat him to it.

537
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,360
- We couldn't say anything.
- He was fast.

538
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,100
The ranks here...

539
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,130
We have trainees in 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th here.

540
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,660
[A whopping 7 trainees from TOP9 are in Team "Hot Summer."]

541
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,850
Ji Woong, is this your first time as a vocalist?

542
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,430
- Yes.
- What?

543
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,970
- You're position was originally a vocalist, right?
- Yes.

544
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,180
[Kim Ji Woong has been taking the rap position for the missions.]

545
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,590
It's about time then.

546
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,120
Who's the temporary killing part?

547
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,780
It's me.

548
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,800
It's his fourth time.

549
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,020
He's a professional killer at this point.

550
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,270
It's Han Bin again.

551
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:58,410
[The evaluation begins for their training.]

552
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,530
I bet they'll look cool.

553
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,260
Great look.

554
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,110
They're good.

555
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,540
They're cool.

556
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,310
Tae Rae is amazing.

557
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,510
- They're good.
- They are.

558
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,280
- You guys are good.
- They're great.

559
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,520
Han Bin performed the killing part.

560
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,650
I think it suits you so well.

561
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:40,280
- Yu Jin is a good dancer.
- He's fantastic.

562
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,140
They gave us such an impactful performance.

563
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,440
There was nothing to tweak.

564
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,560
- Thanks, boys.
- Thank you!

565
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,110
All right, "Jelly Pop." They've got a strong line of vocalists.

566
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,170
They're like the Avengers of vocalists.

567
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:56,460
It's the same case for their dancers too. They're all great.

568
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,330
Gun Wook and Hao is here too.

569
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,090
Jay, you got sub-vocalist 6?

570
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,350
[Shocking news]

571
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:06,850
Which punk did this to our Jay?

572
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:09,450
- Who is it?
- Protect our Han Bin.

573
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,380
It was Han Bin.

574
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,960
Really?

575
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,490
Which part did you originally try for Jun Hyeon?

576
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:20,530
Oh, I...

577
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,640
Why are you laughing?

578
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,200
[They burst our into laughter because of baby Jun Hyeon.]

579
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,950
- It's nothing.
- I was pushed out of "Jelly Pop's" main-vocalist position.

580
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,800
- Really?
- Aigo.

581
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,920
It was trainee Lee Hoe Taek.

582
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,070
[Suddenly reports him]

583
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,550
- What a shame.
- I guess he was confident that he'll do better than me.

584
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,790
He pushed me out easily.

585
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:38,850
I was taken aback.

586
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,550
Who's the killing part?

587
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,710
It's me.

588
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,570
[Congratulations!]

589
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,500
I want you. I love you. Killing part you!

590
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,580
But what if the Star Creators don't pick you?

591
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,390
I just want to have fun.

592
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,920
Yes, that's it.

593
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,650
- He has matured in this sense too.
- Yes.

594
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,560
That's true.

595
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,020
[Evaluation for "Jelly Pop" starts now.]

596
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,730
[Cute and bubbly]

597
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,280
[Yoo Seung Eon shows off his refreshing vocals as sub-vocalist 1.]

598
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:11,410
[Charming them]

599
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:17,790
[The vocalists fill up the performance.]

600
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,590
They're good.

601
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,020
[Stable vocals and perfectly synced choreography]

602
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:28,000
Hoe Taek is really an amazing singer.

603
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,830
[Seok Matthew's killing part is overflowing with energy.]

604
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:33,420
[Satisfied]

605
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,010
Okay!

606
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,430
- They're so good.
- Why are they so good?

607
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,860
- You were amazing!
- They're great.

608
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:42,010
- Have we ever praised them this much until now?
- Seriously.

609
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,400
[Relieved]

610
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,030
They also performed so cleverly. This dance requires a lot of movement.

611
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,530
- Right.
- But,

612
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,430
you balanced your breathing with the dance well.

613
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,520
- I think that's why the vocals projected so well.
- Exactly.

614
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,900
- I loved it. Hoe Taek, you're fantastic.
- Thank you.

615
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,390
- Han Bin, you practiced a lot, right?
- Yes.

616
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,920
I knew it. I could tell.

617
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,410
You practice what facial expressions you'll make

618
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,960
and what you'll do for your part.

619
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,150
- Yes.
- Great job.

620
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,750
I think you'll make a great idol.

621
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,440
Thank you.

622
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,300
[Team "Jelly Pop" received high praise.]

623
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,010
It's rare for us to not worry like this.

624
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,830
- You're right.
- I think it's our first time actually.

625
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:17,730
- I'm really not worried at all.
- I have absolutely no worries.

626
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,230
- It's the same for you guys too. You're equally as good.
- I loved it.

627
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,630
You're all doing well.

628
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,210
I think I learned a lot in the past five months.

629
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:27,390
I think I changed

630
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,170
from small Matthew to a slightly bigger Matthew.

631
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,100
I believe it's all thanks to the masters.

632
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,840
We looked at all the training you've done up until now

633
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,390
and made a report card.

634
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,070
- Na Kamden.
- Yes.

635
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,030
Okay. "8 Mile" Kamden, my brother.

636
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,990
- Thank you.
- Yes.

637
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:47,220
It feels like we're graduating.

638
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,340
Jong Woo. Good work.

639
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:52,360
- Park Han Bin.
- Yu Jin.

640
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,450
- It really feels like it's coming to an end.
- Seriously.

641
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,950
I came all the way here for this.

642
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,650
You're right.

643
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:03,660
Also, we said we'll pick one trainee that shined the brightest.

644
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,800
After the final evaluation,

645
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,630
we'll pick a trainee that shined the brightest by showing the most growth.

646
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,410
- It must be nice.
- It'll be great to get picked.

647
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:12,880
The first Master Awards of Boys Planet.

648
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,950
We'll be giving this award to the trainee that improved the most.

649
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,230
- The king of growth!
- The Growth Award.

650
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,660
Daebak.

651
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,530
There's a gift too! They have an award.

652
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,020
The trainee who'll take this honor is...

653
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,390
Jay.

654
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,400
Gyu Vin improved so much too.

655
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,950
Yu Jin?

656
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,690
Matthew.

657
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,550
Han...

658
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,410
Han Bin.

659
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:39,720
It's trainee Park Han Bin!

660
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:43,100
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

661
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,000
- Park Han Bin shines.
- The king of growth, Park Han Bin.

662
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,270
- I vote for Han Bin.
- Yes, I have to agree with you on that.

663
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:51,830
He could've been more greedy, but he shared the parts.

664
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,040
- He made sure they trained positively.
- I'm okay with Han Bin too.

665
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,760
- Me too.
- I vote for Han Bin too.

666
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,420
- Hard work never betrays you.
- Yes.

667
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,220
Here you go.

668
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,200
What is it?

669
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,660
There's only one in the world.

670
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,300
Congratulations!

671
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,770
- Congratulations, Han Bin!
- You've worked hard.

672
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,540
I felt very proud and happy.

673
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,490
It felt like they acknowledged all the practicing I did.

674
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:18,300
I'm going to remember this moment, engrave it in my heart, and try my best to become a good artist.

675
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,160
Thank you.

676
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,320
I'm nervous.

677
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,600
This is making me more nervous than my school report card.

678
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,770
[Both teams gathered to check the Master's report cards.]

679
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:28,930
This is our last evaluation, right?

680
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,960
Yes, it's our last one for real.

681
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,890
[Lee Jung Hyun is the first to check it.]

682
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,680
My gosh.

683
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:37,830
Oh, they wrote a lot.

684
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:41,950
They put their hearts into this.

685
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,600
[The masters' last evaluation to the 18 trainees.]

686
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,820
[The masters' last letter to the 18 trainees.]

687
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:55,110
[They thought of each trainee and wrote down their honest thoughts about them.]

688
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,430
"Matthew. Do you know that"

689
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:06,340
"your smiley face makes other people incredibly happy?"

690
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:11,350
"I hope you'll continue"

691
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:16,490
"to happily dance and sing. Good job on all your hard work."

692
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:18,430
I was elated.

693
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:21,220
Those few sentences made me so happy.

694
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,700
"Yu Jin, you've done well the past few months."

695
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,530
"It made me happy to see you grow more each day."

696
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:33,840

01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:25,640
- Kim Gyu Big.
- Oh, my god.

1373
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:28,450
How about you draw me and I'll draw you?

1374
01:40:28,450 --> 01:40:29,400
Okay.

1375
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:31,960
Hao is really good.

1376
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:34,120
This is how we should draw each other.

1377
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:35,300
[Who are you?]

1378
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:38,930
- Come on.
- Look at Matthew's face.

1379
01:40:38,930 --> 01:40:41,860
This is Hulk.

1380
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:43,570
- That's Hao hyung, right?
- Yes.

1381
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:44,760
That's a carbon copy of him.

1382
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:46,240
Look at this.

1383
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,360
Look at the difference.

1384
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:49,620
Who drew Doo Bin hyung?

1385
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:50,970
They look the same.

1386
01:40:50,970 --> 01:40:54,550
[All the terrifying ballon trainees are here too!]

1387
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:56,360
[What kind of pajama party will it be?]

1388
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:57,820
Let's do our best, everyone!

1389
01:40:57,820 --> 01:40:59,310
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

1390
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:00,880
We have four minutes left.

1391
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:01,960
Gosh, there are 30,000 people.

1392
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,230
We didn't even start yet.

1393
01:41:03,230 --> 01:41:05,070
What if we go in like this?

1394
01:41:06,140 --> 01:41:07,350
- Like this?
- Yes.

1395
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:08,750
I like it.

1396
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:09,860
Don't do it.

1397
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:10,940
Don't do it?

1398
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:13,950
Do it properly, okay Kamden?

1399
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:19,990
[Their live streaming finally begins!]

1400
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:22,770
- Hello!
- Hello!

1401

[Na Kamden, the passionate man's flamboyant entrance]

1402
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,970
What are you doing?

1403
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:32,590
[Kamden loses his balance out of betrayal.]

1404
01:41:32,590 --> 01:41:34,400
[The trainees arrive in order for the pajama party.]

1405
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,290
[All 18 have arrived!]

1406
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:39,930
Welcome to Boys Planet's pajama party!

1407
01:41:39,930 --> 01:41:42,280
[Welcome, Star Creators!]

1408
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:44,450
Before we begin our party,

1409
01:41:44,450 --> 01:41:46,580
we'll have to welcome our hosts today.

1410
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:47,870
Who will it be?

1411
01:41:47,870 --> 01:41:49,110
[Drumroll]

1412
01:41:49,110 --> 01:41:50,430
Please come on out!

1413
01:41:50,430 --> 01:41:52,660
[Han Yu Jin and Na Kamden walk out to the middle.]

1414
01:41:52,660 --> 01:41:54,940
[Let's do a good job.]

1415
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:57,320
[How dare you?]

1416
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:59,860
[Awkward]

1417
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:00,950
Move over!

1418
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:02,670
[The real hosts of the day appear!]

1419
01:42:02,670 --> 01:42:05,710
I have finally debuted as the official host.

1420
01:42:05,710 --> 01:42:07,820
I've been waiting so long for this.

1421
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:10,110
Yes, they have finally realized our talent.

1422
01:42:10,110 --> 01:42:13,000
But I still...

1423
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,210
Are you nervous?

1424
01:42:14,210 --> 01:42:16,710
We have another subtopic for our pajama party.

1425
01:42:16,710 --> 01:42:18,160
It is none other than...

1426
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:19,920
- Gifts!
- Gifts!

1427
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:22,190
Presents!

1428
01:42:22,190 --> 01:42:24,990
Noona! Please look forward to our party!

1429
01:42:26,410 --> 01:42:29,510
We'll open the first gift.

1430
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,330
- What is it?
- What?

1431
01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:32,840
[What is it?]

1432
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:34,520
- Tell us!
- Tell us!

1433
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:37,560
We have a question for Sung Han Bin, the genius of hearts.

1434
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:42,590
What's the first thing you do after you wake up in the morning?

1435
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:44,960
Should I give the honest answer?

1436
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,510
Were you planning on lying?

1437
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:51,500
- Of course, you have to be honest.
- I rinse my mouth once

1438
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,470
- and take around 7 vitamins.
- 7 pills?

1439
01:42:53,470 --> 01:42:54,970
What, seven pills?

1440
01:42:54,970 --> 01:42:56,220
[Let's see Sung Han Bin's morning routine.]

1441
01:42:58,350 --> 01:42:59,730
I take around seven vitamins.

1442
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:02,360
[Sung Han Bin stars his morning by taking care of his health.]

1443
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:04,340
You must be healthy, everyone!

1444
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:06,150
- Trainee Seok Matthew.
- Yes.

1445
01:43:06,150 --> 01:43:07,990
What's the most recent Korean word you learned?

1446
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:13,440
Oh, I don't know if this is allowed on air.

1447
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,650
- No, don't say it.
- You can't say that word.

1448
01:43:15,650 --> 01:43:17,760
Be safe.

1449
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,750
Don't say stuff like that.

1450
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:22,200
"Totally doable."

1451
01:43:23,930 --> 01:43:26,250
So that's the word you learned.

1452
01:43:27,230 --> 01:43:29,340
- We have a question for trainee Lee Hoe Taek.
- Okay.

1453
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:32,530
When do you find yourself cute?

1454
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:34,030
Pardon?

1455
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:38,980
Right now?

1456
01:43:40,930 --> 01:43:43,230
- Hyung.
- Are you okay?

1457
01:43:43,230 --> 01:43:44,600
[Hoe Taek hyung is always cute.]

1458
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:46,580
In 3, 2, 1.

1459
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:49,400
I...

1460
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,240
Hold up.

1461
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:54,560
- That was no good. Let's try again.
- I'll try again. I'm sorry.

1462
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,300
In 3, 2, 1.

1463
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:59,310
I had a dream. A dream about a ghost.

1464
01:43:59,310 --> 01:44:00,230
[It looks like he saw a real ghost.]

1465
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,420
[Who's the trainee that will get past the shock and answer the next question?]

1466
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:04,850
- Han Yu Jin!
- Yes.

1467
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:08,060
Is there a Hyung that torments you?

1468
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:09,970
[Let's see.]

1469
01:44:09,970 --> 01:44:11,710
- Isn't he right in front of him?
- He's sitting right in front.

1470
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:13,300
- Isn't he right in front of him?
- He's sitting right in front.

1471
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:15,530
Yes, he's right in front of me.

1472
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:18,070
- Gyu Vin hyung.
- When did I ever torment you?

1473
01:44:18,070 --> 01:44:19,160
I saw it too.

1474
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:20,730
- What did you say?
- Yes.

1475
01:44:20,730 --> 01:44:22,100
He touches my face all day.

1476
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:23,940
Marinaded chicken that Yu Jin likes.

1477
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:27,120
[He expresses his love quite aggressively all day.]

1478
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:29,850
Good job, Yu Jin.

1479
01:44:29,850 --> 01:44:32,150
You pretty thing.

1480
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:34,490
Is that so?

1481
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:36,850
- I need to go for my interview.
- Really?

1482
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:40,760
My gosh, you're stuck to him like a piece of rice cake.

1483
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:43,490
We have a question for Jay next.

1484
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:47,500
- Okay.
- There was a moment during "Over Me" that trended.

1485
01:44:48,810 --> 01:44:50,000
[The infamous movement.]

1486
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,780
[He performs an encore of the performance thanks to all the love.]

1487
01:44:52,410 --> 01:44:55,570
[He warms up by ad-libbing.]

1488
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:00,950

1490

Senorita!

1491
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:07,060
Let's get it.

1492
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:09,480
- Lastly, Na Kamden.
- Yes.

1493
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:12,450
You're always leaning at a 45-degree angle.

1494
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:14,120
Can everyone angle yourselves?

1495
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:15,950
Let's go right. Lean to the right.

1496
01:45:15,950 --> 01:45:17,890
This must be comfortable.

1497
01:45:17,890 --> 01:45:21,420
I don't know when I started leaning.

1498
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:23,840
You're doing that right now. Even at this moment.

1499
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,160
- You're leaning right now too.
- I see.

1500
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:27,790
It must be comfortable when he sleeps.

1501
01:45:27,790 --> 01:45:28,590
This is fun.

1502
01:45:28,590 --> 01:45:30,990
What trainee has an interesting sleeping habit?

1503
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:33,530
There's someone to the left of our hosts.

1504
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:37,170
I didn't say anything because I'm a bit scared of him.

1505
01:45:37,170 --> 01:45:39,610
He could be sleeping right now.

1506
01:45:39,610 --> 01:45:42,290
He legitimately sleeps like this.

1507
01:45:42,290 --> 01:45:43,870
- For real.
- Seriously.

1508
01:45:43,870 --> 01:45:45,850
Yes, what is it?

1509
01:45:45,850 --> 01:45:47,790
- He dozed off again.
- I'm sorry.

1510
01:45:47,790 --> 01:45:51,060
- I'm sorry, I know we're live.
- He's still young, so his attention span is short.

1511
01:45:51,060 --> 01:45:53,760
- I'm sorry.
- I'm curious about this too.

1512
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:57,220
Kim Gyu Vin. We were told that you sleep with your face down.

1513
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:59,190
What does this mean?

1514
01:45:59,190 --> 01:46:01,040
- Do we have a photo?
- Let me show you.

1515
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,600
As soon as he arrives,

1516
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:04,550
- let's say this is the wall.
- I think I know.

[Hold your breath and bed dive]

1518
01:46:06,230 --> 01:46:07,770
He sleeps like this.

1519
01:46:07,770 --> 01:46:09,560
That's so accurate.

1520
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:12,080
It's like how a mackerel flies up.

1521
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:15,750
- It's like how fishermen throw frozen tuna.
- Yes!

[Collection of Gyu Vin, the frozen tuna]

1523

I stayed in the same room with this trainee for "Tomboy."

1524
01:46:26,850 --> 01:46:29,520
Hao has a very loud voice when he sings.

1525
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:32,310
But I thought he had a wind instrument up his nose when we were sleeping.

1526

One around this big.

1527
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:37,690
Normally, people snore like this.

1528
01:46:37,690 --> 01:46:40,030
But Hao's snoring sounds like...

1529
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:44,980
I thought he was making music.

1530
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:48,080
I used the same room with Hao hyung and Matthew for "Kill This Love."

1531
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:51,130
They were harmonizing together.

- That...
- He even wears earplugs too.

- Yes.

After all the prep he does?

1551
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:59,260
I was like, "What's going on? Do I need to wear those headphones?"

1552
01:47:59,260 --> 01:48:01,230
He was snoring like this.

1553
01:48:01,230 --> 01:48:03,860
- He didn't want to hear himself snoring.
- That's why he wears those.

02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:43,090
if I really really must to choose,

1713
02:03:43,090 --> 02:03:46,870
it would be Tae Rae, Jeong Hyeon, and

1714
02:03:48,860 --> 02:03:52,830
Han Bin. Our WakeOne trainees...

1715
02:03:52,830 --> 02:03:55,240
I really wanted to see them.

1716
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:59,250

1717

1720
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:16,290
after leaving Boys Planet,

1721
02:04:16,290 --> 02:04:20,120
as a Star Creator, who did you vote for?

1722
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:25,680
Oh, actually, I want to cheer for everyone's dream

1723
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:28,060
and it was difficutl to choose just one person.

1724
02:04:28,060 --> 02:04:30,580
So I borrowed my family members' phones and

1725
02:04:30,580 --> 02:04:36,000
took turns voting for all 18 contestants every day.

1726
02:04:38,180 --> 02:04:42,620
How would you encourage the 18 boys

1727
02:04:42,620 --> 02:04:45,180
who are awaiting the announcement?

1728
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:52,680
Right now you must be very nervous and full of anticipation

1729
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:55,790
but no matter what the result

1730
02:04:55,790 --> 02:04:59,690
I know that this is not the end

1731
02:04:59,690 --> 02:05:03,070

not give up on your dream.

1733
02:05:06,290 --> 02:05:12,120
Even for myself, although I dropped out, I am thinking positively.

1734
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:15,330
So yes,

1735
02:05:15,330 --> 02:05:18,730
I love you all!

1736
02:05:18,730 --> 02:05:22,770

1739
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:33,070
Yes, I'm sure they feel encouraged after hearing your words.

1740
02:05:33,070 --> 02:05:38,790

1742
02:05:42,890 --> 02:05:46,170
This moment right before the announcement seems most nerve-racking.

1743
02:05:46,170 --> 02:05:48,490
How did you feel?

1744
02:05:48,490 --> 02:05:52,400
Wow, at the time, I was really nervous.

1745
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:56,970
All I wanted to do was debut.

1746
02:05:56,970 --> 02:06:00,500
Then for the 18 boys awaiting the announcement,

1747
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:05,890
could you share some words of encouragement?

1748
02:06:05,890 --> 02:06:09,110
Don't be very nervous and

1749
02:06:09,110 --> 02:06:14,150
in my case, my name was called last

1750
02:06:14,150 --> 02:06:19,880
so honestly, I didn't know I was going to debut.

1751
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:26,410
So don't give up until the last moment. Fighting!

1752

Thank you for your good advice.

1753

The first time we saw each other at the interviews

1767
02:07:22,100 --> 02:07:25,830
what were your first impressions?

1768
02:07:27,690 --> 02:07:30,230
Hyung, I'll tell you my first impression of you.

1769
02:07:30,230 --> 02:07:32,770
There was something very intense about you.

1770

Similaer to a sunbae I was scared of in school?

1771
02:07:35,770 --> 02:07:37,700
It was that kind of feeling.

1772
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:42,800
So as I was going up to take my place, I avoided looking at you.

1773
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:45,080
- Really?
- But now that I know you

1774
02:07:45,080 --> 02:07:47,750

For me personally it's Jun Hyeon.

1794

Jun Hyeon was sitting closest to me.

1795
02:08:52,290 --> 02:08:56,330

Seemed like he was quite distracted.

02:52:01,450 --> 02:52:09,360
I will continue to show a more impressive and growing version of Tae Rae after debuting as Zero Base One.

2225
02:52:09,360 --> 02:52:11,450
Thank you so much!

2226
02:52:25,510 --> 02:52:29,080
Trainee Kim Tae Rae, congratulations on your debut.

2227
02:52:30,080 --> 02:52:34,400
Now, please move to your 6th-place seat in the TOP 9.

2228
02:52:42,910 --> 02:52:45,950
Trainee Kim Tae Rae not only has vocal talent

2229
02:52:45,950 --> 02:52:48,770
but also a warm and charming personality like a church oppa.

2230
02:52:48,770 --> 02:52:53,120
I hope that Kim Tae Rae will become an idol loved by fans all over the world,

2231
02:52:53,120 --> 02:52:57,570
with his unique oppa-like charm in Team Zero Base One.

2232
02:53:32,220 --> 02:53:35,670
Now there are only 6 spots remaining.

2233
02:53:35,670 --> 02:53:39,720
Who will sit in the remaining debut team spots?

2234
02:53:39,720 --> 02:53:44,970
Next, I will reveal the trainee in 5th place.

2235
02:53:58,020 --> 02:54:01,780
The 5th place trainee, who will join Team Zero Base One.

2236
02:54:09,510 --> 02:54:19,630
This trainee secured 5th place with a total of 1,386,039 points in the final global vote results.

2237
02:54:31,420 --> 02:54:37,960
And this trainee fills the stage with his unique presence.

2238
02:55:09,350 --> 02:55:13,540
And just like this trainee who grows every week,

2239
02:55:13,540 --> 02:55:18,340
his rank has also risen compared to the last survivor announcement.

2240
02:55:42,450 --> 02:55:47,220
The trainee achieved the dream of debuting by ranking 5th in the TOP 9.

2241
02:56:04,750 --> 02:56:08,220
The trainee in 5th place in the TOP 9 is

2242
02:56:31,750 --> 02:56:35,080
The trainee in 5th place in the TOP 9 is

2243
02:56:50,170 --> 02:56:52,260
Park Gun Wook!

2244
02:57:30,770 --> 02:57:34,750
Congratulations, Trainee Park Gun Wook. Please come out to the stage.

2245
02:57:41,710 --> 02:57:47,070
Trainee Park Gun Wook with outstanding stage presence makes it hard to believe he's only 18 years old.

2246
02:57:47,070 --> 02:57:52,720
An all-around idol has been born with excellent dance, singing, and rapping skills.

2247
02:57:52,720 --> 02:57:54,960
Congratulations on your debut!

2248
02:57:59,610 --> 02:58:03,340
Trainee Park Gun Wook, I'm sure you must have felt nervous about

2249
02:58:03,340 --> 02:58:06,800
not making it into at the final survivor announcement.

2250
02:58:06,800 --> 02:58:10,580
You finally made your debut. How do you feel?

2251
02:58:10,580 --> 02:58:13,840
Well... Whoa!

2252
02:58:13,840 --> 02:58:16,790
Really... Whoa!

2253
02:58:19,820 --> 02:58:27,380
Whoa! To be honest, I really want to cry now.

2254
02:58:27,380 --> 02:58:34,030
I'm so nervous and can't believe it, so tears don't come out.

2255
02:58:35,280 --> 02:58:42,980
In fact, I put down a lot after getting ranked 12th at the last survivor announcement.

2256
02:58:42,980 --> 02:58:48,680
For star creators who supported me,

2257
02:58:48,680 --> 02:58:53,480
let's leave a performance that's not embarrassing at the final stage.

2258
02:58:53,480 --> 02:58:57,980
I made such a commitment and prepared for the final.

2259
02:58:57,980 --> 02:59:03,940
I am grateful for the high rank of 5th place that you have given me.

2260
02:59:03,940 --> 02:59:10,410
First of all, my agency, Jelly Fish. Jelly Fish!

2261
02:59:12,110 --> 02:59:14,840
My fellows in Jelly Fish, thank you so much!

2262
02:59:14,840 --> 02:59:19,390
And Da Yeon sunbaenim in Kep1er from Jelly Fiah, who sits over there.

2263
02:59:19,390 --> 02:59:23,450
Thank you for giving me your endless advice.

2264
02:59:23,450 --> 02:59:30,760
CEO Hwang Se Jun of Jellyfish, Team Leader and nunas in Rookie Development Team, thank you so much!

2265
02:59:30,830 --> 02:59:35,760
I didn't listen a lot,

2266
02:59:35,760 --> 02:59:40,340
but I succeeded like this!

2267
02:59:43,680 --> 02:59:52,260
Yes, and... and my family, Mom, Dad, and my hyung.

2268
02:59:52,260 --> 02:59:56,580
Onga... I call my hyung Onga.

2269
02:59:56,580 --> 02:59:59,860
Onga, thank you so much.

2270
02:59:59,860 --> 03:00:02,050
I'm sorry that I'm so blunt.

2271
03:00:02,050 --> 03:00:05,860
My family, I'm sorry that I complained so much.

2272
03:00:05,860 --> 03:00:08,370
I love you!

2273
03:00:08,370 --> 03:00:13,550
And... I'm sorry, but I really didn't prepare a speech.

2274
03:00:14,750 --> 03:00:21,900
And I am truly grateful for the passion of the 98 trainees who were preparing together for Boys Planet.

2275
03:00:21,900 --> 03:00:24,630
They have helped me grow a lot.

2276
03:00:24,630 --> 03:00:27,520
Hoe Taek hyung, Team En Garde members,

2277
03:00:27,520 --> 03:00:31,550
Hwan Hee hyung, Team Kill This Love, and Team Tom Boy!

2278
03:00:31,550 --> 03:00:37,260
And Kim Gyu Vin, why didn't you mention me in your speech?

2279
03:00:39,370 --> 03:00:42,150
Gyu Vin hyung, I really appreciate you.

2280
03:00:42,150 --> 03:00:44,000
Jun Hyeon!

2281
03:00:48,740 --> 03:00:50,820
I made it!

2282
03:00:54,260 --> 03:00:56,590
Jun Hyeon, I really appreciate you.

2283
03:00:56,590 --> 03:01:00,410
I complained frequently about wanting to debut or feeling inadequate.

2284
03:01:00,410 --> 03:01:04,460
You were always supportive and encouraging me that I can do it.

2285
03:01:04,460 --> 03:01:06,380
I really appreciate you.

2286
03:01:06,380 --> 03:01:12,810
I initially aimed to be satisfied with just having you in Boys Planet.

2287
03:01:12,810 --> 03:01:16,380
But I didn't expect to actually debut until now.

2288
03:01:20,940 --> 03:01:23,060
Thank you so much, Jun Hyeon!

2289
03:01:24,050 --> 03:01:27,310
And lastly,

2290
03:01:27,310 --> 03:01:34,720
star creators who made me come this far!

2291
03:01:35,600 --> 03:01:42,070
I'll show you better performances as Zero Base One Park Gun Wook.

2292
03:01:42,070 --> 03:01:47,800
So please show us a lot of love and interest. Thank you and I love you!

2293
03:01:51,200 --> 03:01:57,230
Yes, I'm curious about what position Trainee Park Gun Wook will take after his debut as an all-rounder.

2294
03:01:57,230 --> 03:01:59,050
Where are you going now?

2295
03:02:00,290 --> 03:02:03,620
Yes, please go up the stairs. Please go ahead.

2296
03:02:07,450 --> 03:02:12,300
Trainee Park Gun Wook has a tender heart despite his usual levelheadedness,

2297
03:02:12,300 --> 03:02:16,190
and so he receives much love from his hyungs.

2298
03:02:16,190 --> 03:02:22,240
Please become a member of Zero Base One that is loved by everyone.

2299
03:02:50,500 --> 03:02:56,090
Next, I will announce the fourth place member of the final TOP9.

2300
03:02:58,690 --> 03:03:07,000
[4th place]

2301
03:03:08,650 --> 03:03:13,910
The next member to debut as Zero Base One is the fourth place trainee.

2302
03:03:19,840 --> 03:03:23,650
This trainee confirmed his debut in fourth place

2303
03:03:23,650 --> 03:03:30,220
by receiving 1,572,089 points for the final results of the global voting.

2304
03:03:38,410 --> 03:03:41,920
This trainee had a strong presence

2305
03:03:41,920 --> 03:03:46,100
during the last Artist Battle.

2306
03:03:46,100 --> 03:03:47,700
I saw that his rank

2307
03:03:47,700 --> 03:03:49,770
had gone up then.

2308
03:04:09,770 --> 03:04:15,660
I will announce the trainee who got fourth place in the final results of the global voting.

2309
03:04:30,110 --> 03:04:33,360
The trainee who got 4th place for the final TOP9...

2310
03:04:40,210 --> 03:04:45,850
Th trainee who will join Zero Base One with the high rank of 4th place is...

2311
03:04:58,040 --> 03:04:59,710
Ricky!

2312
03:05:00,430 --> 03:05:07,670
[4th place in the final TOP9, Ricky]

2313
03:05:21,850 --> 03:05:24,460
[Ricky]

2314
03:05:36,300 --> 03:05:39,780
Congratulations, Trainee Ricky. Please come up to the front.

2315
03:05:39,780 --> 03:05:44,070
[Ricky]

2316
03:05:44,070 --> 03:05:46,170
Did you predict your rank?

2317
03:05:46,170 --> 03:05:49,000
Trainee Ricky is receiving much love from Star Creators all over the world

2318
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:52,460
for his sexy visuals that look straight out of a manga.

2319
03:05:52,460 --> 03:05:56,390
He especially showed off his seductive charms during the "Over Me" stage.

2320
03:05:56,390 --> 03:05:57,780
Congratulations on your debut.

2321
03:05:57,780 --> 03:06:00,170
Thank you.

2322
03:06:00,170 --> 03:06:02,200
Thank you!

2323
03:06:06,250 --> 03:06:10,770
Trainee Ricky, you have achieved your dream of debuting through Boys Planet.

2324
03:06:10,770 --> 03:06:12,940
How do you feel right now?

2325
03:06:15,560 --> 03:06:17,850
I feel amazing.

2326
03:06:25,370 --> 03:06:27,010
Is that all?

2327
03:06:27,010 --> 03:06:28,200
Yes.

2328
03:06:28,200 --> 03:06:30,320
- Actually, no.
- It's not, right?

2329
03:06:30,320 --> 03:06:33,300
Yes.

2330
03:06:33,300 --> 03:06:35,350
First of all,

2331
03:06:36,090 --> 03:06:37,890
Star Creators,

2332
03:06:37,890 --> 03:06:41,820
thank you for recognizing my strengths,

2333
03:06:41,820 --> 03:06:43,830
understanding

2334
03:06:43,830 --> 03:06:49,820
my weaknesses and continuously cheering for me.

2335
03:06:54,340 --> 03:06:58,570
Since elementary school,

2336
03:06:59,660 --> 03:07:03,970
I came to South Korea by myself to chase my dream and trained.

2337
03:07:03,970 --> 03:07:05,080
[Ricky, congrats on your debut!]

2338
03:07:05,080 --> 03:07:10,080
Today feels like a dream.

2339
03:07:10,080 --> 03:07:12,530
Through Boys Planet,

2340
03:07:12,530 --> 03:07:14,560
I really...

2341
03:07:17,210 --> 03:07:19,590
I feel like it's a dream come true.

2342
03:07:19,590 --> 03:07:24,290
[Shen Ricky, hand over your passport. I will confiscate it forever!]

2343
03:07:24,290 --> 03:07:26,070
And...

2344
03:07:29,410 --> 03:07:34,990
thanks to all the Star Creators from the depths of my heart.

2345
03:07:34,990 --> 03:07:38,420
Thank you guys for supporting me

2346
03:07:38,420 --> 03:07:41,890
from the beginning all the way to here.

2347
03:07:41,890 --> 03:07:45,130
And a quick little story,

2348
03:07:45,130 --> 03:07:48,570
this is my first tattoo, the words "role model."

2349
03:07:49,540 --> 03:07:54,020
I did it, not because of who is my role model.

2350
03:07:54,020 --> 03:07:58,140
It stands for how I want to be the role model

2351
03:07:58,140 --> 03:08:01,370
for somebody else in the future.

2352
03:08:03,620 --> 03:08:06,070
Today, I think

2353
03:08:06,070 --> 03:08:08,490
I achieved the first step.

2354
03:08:08,490 --> 03:08:13,380
But there's still a long way to go. It just got started.

2355
03:08:15,120 --> 03:08:19,120
I will bring out the best stages and best music that I can.

2356
03:08:19,120 --> 03:08:22,190
And be the best me that I can. Thank you.

2357
03:08:26,170 --> 03:08:29,760
Trainee Ricky, I sincerely congratulate you.

2358
03:08:29,760 --> 03:08:31,890
- Thank you.
- All right, then.

2359
03:08:31,890 --> 03:08:35,230
Please move to the fourth place seat in the final TOP9.

2360
03:08:42,920 --> 03:08:46,470
Trainee Ricky, who is capable of everything from sexy to cute,

2361
03:08:46,470 --> 03:08:50,160
I look forward to seeing what ways he will capture the hearts

2362
03:08:50,160 --> 03:08:52,870
of star creators around the world in the future.

2363
03:08:52,870 --> 03:08:58,720
Tall and handsome, young and idol. Trainee Ricky, I sincerely congratulate you on your debut.

2364
03:09:31,100 --> 03:09:34,240
Now, I will announce

2365
03:09:34,240 --> 03:09:36,740
the third place for the final TOP9.

2366
03:09:38,130 --> 03:09:46,810
[3rd place]

2367
03:09:50,090 --> 03:09:55,580
This is the trainee who will achieve their dream of debuting by placing 3rd place in the final global voting results.

2368
03:10:03,680 --> 03:10:07,210
For the final global voting results, this trainee received

2369
03:10:07,210 --> 03:10:10,940
1,702,174 points,

2370
03:10:10,940 --> 03:10:13,660
and confirmed his debut in third place.

2371
03:10:23,190 --> 03:10:25,720
Also, this trainee

2372
03:10:25,720 --> 03:10:28,210
have been in the TOP9

2373
03:10:28,210 --> 03:10:30,510
at every survivor announcement.

2374
03:11:02,470 --> 03:11:06,530
I will announce the 3rd place for the final TOP9.

2375
03:11:18,670 --> 03:11:22,580
The trainee who will join Zero Base One in 3rd place,

2376
03:11:32,750 --> 03:11:37,390
the trainee who have finally achieved their dream of debuting by placing 3rd place in the final TOP9 is...

2377
03:11:49,870 --> 03:11:51,680
Seok Matthew!

2378
03:11:52,350 --> 03:11:58,910
[3rd place in the final TOP9, Seok Matthew]

2379
03:12:29,180 --> 03:12:33,170
Trainee Seok Matthew, congratulations. Please come to the front.

2380
03:12:45,700 --> 03:12:49,030
Trainee Seok Matthew captured the hearts of Star Creators

2381
03:12:49,030 --> 03:12:51,310
from his entrance with his sweet smile.

2382
03:12:51,310 --> 03:12:56,750
Also, his vocals stood out in every performance and helped to create a perfect stage.

2383
03:12:56,750 --> 03:13:00,720
Trainee Seok Matthew, I sincerely congratulate you for successfully debuting.

2384
03:13:07,850 --> 03:13:10,890
Canadian oppa, Trainee Seok Matthew!

2385
03:13:10,890 --> 03:13:13,900
How do you feel for achieving your dream of debuting?

2386
03:13:14,770 --> 03:13:16,450
I...

2387
03:13:16,450 --> 03:13:19,590
Honestly, this feels like a dream right now.

2388
03:13:19,590 --> 03:13:25,160
I'd lost much confidence recently. But,

2389
03:13:25,160 --> 03:13:27,500
my hyungs always took care of me

2390
03:13:27,500 --> 03:13:30,660
at the dorms

2391
03:13:30,660 --> 03:13:35,450
and kept telling me that things will go well for me.

2392
03:13:35,450 --> 03:13:39,390
I couldn't really believe them, but being able to be here now,

2393
03:13:39,390 --> 03:13:41,910
I am so grateful.

2394
03:13:41,910 --> 03:13:45,940
Also, the Masters have always encouraged me,

2395
03:13:45,940 --> 03:13:48,180
so I am so grateful to them as well.

2396
03:13:56,400 --> 03:13:59,810
I chased this dream

2397
03:13:59,810 --> 03:14:03,290
for two years.

2398
03:14:04,350 --> 03:14:07,640
Now, to think that I can finally

2399
03:14:07,640 --> 03:14:11,240
live my dream everyday...

2400
03:14:11,240 --> 03:14:13,190
it really feels like a dream.

2401
03:14:13,190 --> 03:14:16,210
So, I am so happy.

2402
03:14:18,670 --> 03:14:23,090
I also want to thank my agency, MNH.

2403
03:14:23,090 --> 03:14:26,000
They always took care of me.

2404
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:32,920
Also, the staff here have taken such good care of me as well.

2405
03:14:34,010 --> 03:14:37,640
My mother and noona have also come today.

2406
03:14:37,640 --> 03:14:39,960
[Congrats! You did it! Matthew, Seokryudans love you!]

2407
03:14:40,870 --> 03:14:44,260
I'm sorry.

2408
03:14:45,260 --> 03:14:46,940
Mom.

2409
03:14:47,710 --> 03:14:51,710
Thank you so much for trusting me

2410
03:14:51,710 --> 03:14:55,470
and letting me come to South Korea.

2411
03:14:55,470 --> 03:14:59,610
I've finally made it here,

2412
03:14:59,610 --> 03:15:04,600
so I will do my best to become a lovely and cool son

2413
03:15:04,600 --> 03:15:07,450
whom you can be proud of.

2414
03:15:08,910 --> 03:15:12,860
I just love you so much, Mom. I missed you.

2415
03:15:16,490 --> 03:15:20,880
And finally, to the Star Creators,

2416
03:15:23,840 --> 03:15:28,080
thank you so much for coming here.

2417
03:15:28,080 --> 03:15:30,010
[Matthew, I used my first ever PTO!]

2418
03:15:30,010 --> 03:15:35,670
I wondered a lot about whether this was the right path for me.

2419
03:15:35,670 --> 03:15:37,180
Thank you all so much

2420
03:15:37,180 --> 03:15:40,630
for sending me so many letters

2421
03:15:40,630 --> 03:15:44,880
telling me that it was the right path for me.

2422
03:15:44,880 --> 03:15:48,580
It's thanks to you all that I was able to reach this point.

2423
03:15:48,580 --> 03:15:50,580
Thank you.

2424
03:15:53,720 --> 03:15:57,270
Trainee Matthew, I sincerely congratulate you.

2425
03:15:58,700 --> 03:16:03,340
Now, please move to the third place seat in the final TOP9.

2426
03:16:10,050 --> 03:16:13,430
With an optimistic mindset, Trainee Seok Matthew never grew complacent with his skills,

2427
03:16:13,430 --> 03:16:19,080
and always worked hard passionately to improve. Thus, he succeeded in finally debuting.

2428
03:16:19,080 --> 03:16:21,670
Star Creators, please continue to tell him,

2429
03:16:21,670 --> 03:16:25,480
"I love you, I want you, Seok Matthew!"

2430
03:17:10,770 --> 03:17:14,190
The final live broadcast of Boys Planet,

2431
03:17:14,800 --> 03:17:16,270
now,

2432
03:17:17,150 --> 03:17:21,630
it's time to announce the 1st and 2nd place for the final TOP9.

2433
03:17:25,600 --> 03:17:30,030
Who are the candidates for 1st place in the final TOP9?

2434
03:17:34,890 --> 03:17:44,780
[1st place candidates]

2435
03:17:44,780 --> 03:17:50,350
The first place for the final debut group will not only get the killing part for the debut title track,

2436
03:17:50,350 --> 03:17:53,940
but they will also get the honor of getting a solo track on the debut album.

2437
03:18:06,880 --> 03:18:10,260
I will now reveal the two 1st place candidates

2438
03:18:12,040 --> 03:18:14,330
on the screen.

2439
03:18:44,510 --> 03:18:49,520
Boys Planet. The final candidates for 1st place.

2440
03:19:32,350 --> 03:19:34,690
Please reveal it right now.

2441
03:20:21,720 --> 03:20:25,350
The first candidate is Trainee Sung Han Bin.

2442
03:20:27,790 --> 03:20:31,660
And the second candidate is Zhang Hao.

2443
03:20:35,330 --> 03:20:39,290
Sung Han Bin and Zhang Hao, please come out to the stage.

2444
03:21:00,010 --> 03:21:03,320
Yes, both of you, please come out to the stage.

2445
03:21:28,690 --> 03:21:31,070
Are they the candidates for 1st place that everyone expected?

2446
03:21:31,070 --> 03:21:35,590
Following the 2nd and 3rd survivor announcements,

2447
03:21:35,590 --> 03:21:39,620
these 2 trainees are nominated for 1st place in this final.

2448
03:21:49,350 --> 03:21:56,390
Who will be the final winner to debut with glory between these two?

2449
03:22:08,370 --> 03:22:13,910
Trainee Sung Han Bin. You became a candidate for 1st place, not to mention the opportunity to debut.

2450
03:22:13,910 --> 03:22:16,020
How do you feel now?

2451
03:22:20,270 --> 03:22:21,750
I...

2452
03:22:22,750 --> 03:22:30,920
I have been gratefully maintaining 1st place as a result of my constant efforts and hard work.

2453
03:22:30,920 --> 03:22:36,870
As I mentioned before, because I have always been aware that things can change,

2454
03:22:36,870 --> 03:22:40,160
I was quite surprised just now.

2455
03:22:41,260 --> 03:22:45,630
Since I've been given the opportunity to be a candidate for the 1st place,

2456
03:22:45,630 --> 03:22:49,240
I would like to maintain the top position.

2457
03:22:49,240 --> 03:22:56,890
And... I am even happier to be on the list of candidates for 1st place along with Hao hyung.

2458
03:22:56,890 --> 03:22:59,060
That's all.

2459
03:22:59,060 --> 03:23:04,260
Okay. Now let's hear how Trainee Zhang Hao feels now.

2460
03:23:04,260 --> 03:23:06,560
Yes...

2461
03:23:06,560 --> 03:23:10,740
Hello, I'm Trainee Zhang Hao.

2462
03:23:13,930 --> 03:23:22,360
Actually, it's hard to put into words how I feel at this moment.

2463
03:23:22,360 --> 03:23:29,190
Well... I couldn't have imagined coming this far.

2464
03:23:29,190 --> 03:23:36,320
So honestly, I didn't prepare for my thoughts on being a candidate for the 1st place.

2465
03:23:41,720 --> 03:23:48,290
Receiving so much love from a lot of star creators

2466
03:23:48,290 --> 03:23:53,230
has also given me confidence in myself. Thank you!

2467
03:24:02,040 --> 03:24:05,200
One of these two will be the 1st-place winner.

2468
03:24:05,200 --> 03:24:08,350
The other person will automatically be the 2nd place.

2469
03:24:18,790 --> 03:24:21,650
The fate of the outcome is...

2470
03:24:37,450 --> 03:24:39,760
It will be revealed shortly.

2471
03:24:56,770 --> 03:25:02,800
Live broadcast of Boys Planet final where a 5th generation K-pop boy group is born.

2472
03:25:02,800 --> 03:25:08,720
Now, I will announce the final 1st place winner of TOP 9.

2473
03:25:16,360 --> 03:25:19,850
The person who is called out among the two candidates will be the 1st-place winner.

2474
03:25:19,850 --> 03:25:23,720
The person who is not called out will automatically be the 2nd place.

2475
03:25:27,150 --> 03:25:34,940
The final global voting results showed a difference of 109,740 points between the 1st and 2nd place.

2476
03:25:40,820 --> 03:25:46,100
Now, I will announce the trainee who has achieved the glorious 1st place

2477
03:25:56,910 --> 03:26:06,150
The final winner has received the most votes from star creators all around the world.

2478
03:26:11,290 --> 03:26:16,600
The trainee who has achieved the most shining 1st place and will debut as a member of Zero Base One is...

2479
03:26:26,240 --> 03:26:28,690
The trainee is...

2480
03:26:40,850 --> 03:26:42,960
Zhang Hao!

2481
03:27:25,080 --> 03:27:27,010
Congratulations, Trainee Zhang Hao!

2482
03:27:27,010 --> 03:27:31,010
You finally made it to the top as the honored 1st place and will debut.

2483
03:27:31,010 --> 03:27:33,510
How do you feel now?

2484
03:27:42,280 --> 03:27:45,100
Is this... dream?

2485
03:27:58,800 --> 03:28:00,400
Okay.

2486
03:28:02,820 --> 03:28:05,960
Let me express my prepared remarks now.

2487
03:28:09,050 --> 03:28:11,040
Let me say this for the last time...

2488
03:28:12,140 --> 03:28:15,670
Hello, I'm Trainee Zhang Hao!

2489
03:28:21,840 --> 03:28:31,360
Most importantly, I sincerely thank the star creators

2490
03:28:32,360 --> 03:28:35,480
who have been supporting me for the last 3 months.

2491
03:28:42,570 --> 03:28:51,160
How much effort and time we put into coming this far...

2492
03:28:51,160 --> 03:28:55,340
I will never forget it.

2493
03:28:55,340 --> 03:29:02,810
The memories of Boys Planet are truly precious to me in my life.

2494
03:29:02,810 --> 03:29:13,200
And to the production team, masters, stage directors of Boys Planet,

2495
03:29:13,200 --> 03:29:24,780
and my fellow trainees who have been running towards the same dream with me, I would also like to express my appreciation

2496
03:29:31,680 --> 03:29:34,680
In the future,

2497
03:29:35,780 --> 03:29:39,220
as Zero Base One's Jang Hao,

2498
03:29:40,890 --> 03:29:47,050
I will continue to shine brighter and bring happiness to all of you.

2499
03:29:47,050 --> 03:29:51,570
Not to forget the initial aspirations of trainee Zhang Hao,

2500
03:29:51,570 --> 03:29:57,840
I'll always be thankful, humble, and work hard.

2501
03:30:03,970 --> 03:30:11,150
And Executive Producer Jung Hae Chang and CEO Lee Sang Gyu of Yue Hua Entertainment.

2502
03:30:11,150 --> 03:30:17,840
Thank you to CEO Park Moo Seong, Team Leader Kim Heeyoung, and Han Mi Yeon nuna.

2503
03:30:20,410 --> 03:30:21,960
Yes...

2504
03:30:23,800 --> 03:30:29,120
It's my honor to be loved by you guys.

2505
03:30:29,120 --> 03:30:34,340
Even though I'm not good at English, in the simplest words,

2506
03:30:34,340 --> 03:30:38,870
I want to express my appreciation.

2507
03:30:38,870 --> 03:30:43,930
I will be the shining star that makes you guys happy.

2508
03:30:43,930 --> 03:30:45,970
This is not the end.

2509
03:30:45,970 --> 03:30:51,550
There are more possibilities waiting for us to find out together.

2510
03:30:54,110 --> 03:30:56,560
- Okay. I sincerely congratulate you.
- I have more...

2511
03:30:57,460 --> 03:30:59,420
- Oh, you have more to say. Please go ahead. I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry.

2512
03:30:59,420 --> 03:31:00,860
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry.

2513
03:31:00,860 --> 03:31:03,100
I will wrap it up quickly.

2514
03:31:05,310 --> 03:31:13,210
I will become a more shining presence on the stage.

2515
03:31:13,210 --> 03:31:15,250
I love you all!

2516
03:31:17,020 --> 03:31:21,950
You all gave me the strength to stand up. Starting today, I'm not only your pride, but I'll be the light of your life.

2517
03:31:21,950 --> 03:31:29,350
I'll give you the courage to pursue your hopes and dreams anytime, anywhere.

2518
03:31:29,350 --> 03:31:32,870
Thank you once again.

2519
03:31:33,770 --> 03:31:35,500
Congratulations from the bottom of my heart.

2520
03:31:35,500 --> 03:31:39,530
Trainee Sung Han Bin, who has automatically become 2nd place in the final TOP 9.

2521
03:31:39,530 --> 03:31:44,520
It's a shame that you missed the 1st place, but you made your debut with a high ranking of 2nd place.

2522
03:31:44,520 --> 03:31:48,740
How do you feel about being a member of Zero Base One?

2523
03:31:49,840 --> 03:31:56,350
First of all, thank you to all the star creators who are here today!

2524
03:31:59,590 --> 03:32:05,980
Thanks to star creators who trusted me and supported me throughout the long journey of Boys Planet,

2525
03:32:05,980 --> 03:32:09,980
I was able to be in this position.

2526
03:32:09,980 --> 03:32:18,120
I firmly believe that the heart supporting someone is never easy or simple.

2527
03:32:18,120 --> 03:32:20,400
Therefore, as each vote is very precious,

2528
03:32:20,400 --> 03:32:27,000
this moment is a really proud result for me.

2529
03:32:27,000 --> 03:32:35,630
And I started pursuing the dream of being an idol relatively late, so the path has been lonely and uncertain.

2530
03:32:35,630 --> 03:32:41,510
But through the program Boys Planet, I had the opportunity to meet star creators,

2531
03:32:41,510 --> 03:32:45,370
and it feels like my once-lonely path has turned into a warm spring day filled with flowers.

2532
03:32:45,370 --> 03:32:48,550
Once again, I sincerely thank you.

2533
03:32:52,280 --> 03:32:55,740
And there's one more thing I want to say.

2534
03:32:55,740 --> 03:33:00,780
Our family members are also here to see me.

2535
03:33:06,370 --> 03:33:10,380
Ah Reum, Han Hye Jeong Mom, and Sung Hyeon Mo Dad.

2536
03:33:10,380 --> 03:33:21,510
Mom and Dad, as parents, have always supported and cheered for me and Ah Reum in our artistic pursuits.

2537
03:33:21,510 --> 03:33:31,190
Now, I want to be a good son who supports and cheers for

2538
03:33:31,190 --> 03:33:36,650
Han Hye Jeong and Sung Hyeon Mo in their lives, not just as a son of Mom and Dad.

2539
03:33:36,650 --> 03:33:44,660
I want to express my gratitude once again to my family for being a source of strength for me.

2540
03:33:46,930 --> 03:33:50,480
And all the member of THE L1VE and Studio GL1DE,

2541
03:33:50,480 --> 03:33:56,720
Thanks to CEO Ravi as well as Director Jeong Eun, who have always supported and encouraged me,

2542
03:33:56,720 --> 03:34:01,970
I've gained a lot of strength. I sincerely thank you.

2543
03:34:01,970 --> 03:34:08,910
Lastly, thanks to the 98 fellow trainees who participated in Boys Planet,

2544
03:34:08,910 --> 03:34:17,450
I gained invaluable experience and became a member of Team Zero Base One.

2545
03:34:17,450 --> 03:34:23,990
Thanks to all the staff, writers, PDs, camera directors of Boys Planet, and

2546
03:34:23,990 --> 03:34:30,320
the wonderful masters, we were able to grow even more.

2547
03:34:30,320 --> 03:34:32,960
I sincerely appreciate you all.

2548
03:34:37,130 --> 03:34:40,110
- Lastly...
- Yes. I'm so sorry. Please go ahead. I'm sorry.

2549
03:34:40,110 --> 03:34:42,640
Let me say something really short.

2550
03:34:42,640 --> 03:34:47,500
Lastly, All-In! As I put my everything on the line,

2551
03:34:47,500 --> 03:34:52,600
I will continue to work hard and be active as Sung Han Bin of Zero Base One,

2552
03:34:52,600 --> 03:34:56,210
without losing my initial intentions. Thank you!

2553
03:34:56,210 --> 03:34:58,510
Yes. Congratulations on the debut of both of you!

2554
03:34:58,510 --> 03:35:03,700
Now, both of you please move to your spots in the final TOP 9.

2555
03:38:03,970 --> 03:38:11,800

2556
03:38:13,590 --> 03:38:17,230
I will announce the trainee in the 9th place in the final TOP 9.

2557
03:38:36,480 --> 03:38:39,880
The last trainee chosen by star creators.

2558
03:38:44,290 --> 03:38:46,110
9th place!

2559
03:39:08,760 --> 03:39:10,870

2560
03:39:29,880 --> 03:39:35,010

2562
03:40:02,490 --> 03:40:04,520
Han Yu Jin!

2563
03:40:37,380 --> 03:40:41,250
Congratulations, Trainee Han Yu Jin. Please come to the front of the stage.

2564
03:40:53,730 --> 03:40:57,840
Trainee Han Yu Jin, who has succeeded in a dramatic debut as the 9th place in the final top 9!

2565
03:40:57,840 --> 03:41:01,980
He has generated a lot of attention with his perfect idol image since his first appearance.

2566
03:41:01,980 --> 03:41:05,830
Despite being born in 2007, he possesses an astonishing charm

2567
03:41:05,830 --> 03:41:09,400
that is sometimes reliable and sometimes innocent like a child.

2568
03:41:09,400 --> 03:41:14,070
He has maintained his position in the top 9 throughout all the survival rounds.

2569
03:41:15,410 --> 03:41:21,190
Trainee Han Yu Jin, you achieved your dream as the last member of Zero Base One.

2570
03:41:21,190 --> 03:41:23,150
How do you feel now?

2571
03:41:25,050 --> 03:41:29,610
First of all, I'd like to thank the star creators

2572
03:41:29,610 --> 03:41:33,760
for making me make it here.

2573
03:41:36,520 --> 03:41:44,870
And Mom, Dad, and younger brother who supported me a lot from the back.

2574
03:41:45,900 --> 03:41:50,560
Have I become your proud son?

2575
03:41:56,520 --> 03:42:00,890

2576
03:42:01,960 --> 03:42:08,090

2580
03:42:25,150 --> 03:42:27,320
hard for me, but...

2581
03:42:27,320 --> 03:42:33,660

2583
03:42:38,240 --> 03:42:44,820
I'd like to thank the star creators for finding my charm

2584
03:42:44,820 --> 03:42:48,630
that I didn't know and still don't know.

2585
03:42:49,630 --> 03:42:56,220
My dream is not just to debut through Boys Planet,

2586
03:42:56,220 --> 03:43:01,190
but to give happiness and love to star creators,

2587
03:43:01,190 --> 03:43:05,640

It was also an honor for me to be part of

2604
03:46:49,800 --> 03:46:51,920
the final conclusion of the Boys Planet journey.

2605
