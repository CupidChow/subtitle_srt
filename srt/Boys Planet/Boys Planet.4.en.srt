I could understand the words.

185
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,130
You only practiced for one day, but your pronunciation is that good.

186
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,040
That means you listened carefully.

187

190
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,260

[Xian Hao was shaky in the Killing Part]

192

That part is right at the beginning.

193

So it's a very important part.

194
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,650
Can you work hard and deliver it?

195

Use your stomach when you breathe in.

208
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,740
And breathe out a little bit here and stop.

209
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,050

I thought everyone would be like that.

355

[Wang Yen Hong is singing the lead singer part]

534
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:32,050
I warn you! Can you sing this part?

535
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,920
You say it's okay to mess up, but your attitude doesn't match.

536

[Sigh]

539
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:54,060
I really don't know what to do right now.

540
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,310
I think this will be our last performance.

541

[Chen Yu Geng saw that he was in danger of getting eliminated]

542

[They're facing each other again after thinking through]

545
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,450
I haven't trained for that long, and I'm a terrible dancer.

546
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,420
I'm so worried that I won't be able to do it.

[Yang Jun is finally showing tears]

548

do well and give a great performance.

550
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,230
I want to, too.

551
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,720
I got impatient the last few days because I felt anxious.

552
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,680
I felt so, so impatient.

553
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,860
I'm sorry if I hurt you because of that.

554
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:54,050
I thought Chen Yu Geng felt pressured as the leader.

555
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:58,640
I thought I should understand how he felt.

556
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,840
I want to apologize, too. I'm sorry.

557
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,650
It's okay.

558
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,010
We both did it for the sake of the performance.

559
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:12,130
The leader and the teammates should encourage each other.

560

[They're greeting each other out of embarrassment]

561

- Don't worry!
- I'm so sorry.

564
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,200
We made up.

565
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,720
The team spirit went down, but it went up again.

566
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,340
I think the atmosphere improved a lot.

I thought you looked cool.

570

You did great. You did great!

571
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,480
It might be because we just had a fight,

572
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,050
but our feelings for each other improved.

573
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:56,630
I think it was a good thing for us to break the barrier between us.

574
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:00,860
We practiced over and over again.

575
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,790
We gained a lot of confidence.

576
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:08,230
We were an abandoned team, and no one expected much of us,

577
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:15,150
but we'll prove that we changed in a few days.

578
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:18,240
I hope you look forward to it.

579
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,830
I hope they do well, but I want our team to do a little better.

Please, do well.

- They must have a lot of thoughts now.
- I'm nervous.

584

Imagine how nervous they must be.

- Don't feel nervous, don't feel nervous!
- My gosh.

586

That's the most nerve-wracking moment.

- I didn't notice any major mistakes–
- There wasn't anything like that.

- There's nothing to compliment about.
- I know.

[Just read the air]

668

I was aware that I was not good at that part.

669

So I thought it was as expected.

670
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,310
I thought other people would think

671
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:36,610
"They're really lacking as a team."

672
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,520

[I don't know what they've been practicing all this time]

680

I completely saw it coming,

681
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,200
but seeing it in person was different.

682
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,420
My name was mentioned in most of the notes.

683
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,600
I couldn't stop looking.

684
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,520
30 of the notes said, "There's nothing to say."

685
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,740
There are too many things to improve on.

686
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,190
I didn't feel like talking about it afterward.

687
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,930
I think the team is lacking in many ways.

688
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,820
Can we overcome this by practicing?

689
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,230
Rather than saying, "Let's improve the quality," at this point...

690
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,810
To be realistic, it'd be a bit better if we

691
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:39,080
redistributed the parts.

692
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,650
First of all, I'm seriously concerned.

693
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:45,860
What if I Chan becomes the lead singer?

694
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:50,380
I think I Chan is at the mercy of his condition, too.

695
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,100
I'm fine with becoming the lead singer.

696
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,570
This part isn't hard for you, is it?

697
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:57,980
I don't find them difficult.

698
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,190
Let's go with I Chan, then.

699
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,080
What I'm thinking is...

700
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,900
Seung Hwan should Da Eul's part,

701
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,520
and Da Eul could do my current part.

702
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,640
That part has a lot of impacts,

703
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,660
but there aren't many lyrics. It's less likely to mess up.

704
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,170
But...

705
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,400
I think I definitely became ambitious.

706
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,090
I want to do this part.

707
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,250
The rap goes on for a long time and balances the whole song.

708
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:29,250
If only Da Eul's okay with it. The beginning part is important.

709
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,840
Since he has that, he can continue with it

710
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,940
- and keep up with the atmosphere–
- I know this is too much,

711
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,500
but if I switch to Rapper 2,

712
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,780
there's no point in picking you guys anymore.

713
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,780

714

715

716

718
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,560
I picked the ones I'm grateful for.

719
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,230
They taught me so much.

720
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,050
I'm so grateful for them, but

721
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,260
I want to get a good part

722
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:15,020
and get a good result by working on the part I messed up.

723
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,740
This might sound selfish, but I think that'd be a good chance for me to grow.

724
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,230
- You think of it as running away.
- Yes, I don't want to switch.

725
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:26,600
If you want to do it, you have to deliver it.

726
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,820
Instead, be responsible for your part...

727
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,770
We'll work hard.

728
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:34,900
I felt so conflicted.

729
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,390
Is this right?

730
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,060
Do I have to say something?

731
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,160
Should I leave him because he's showing enthusiasm?

732
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,680
I think I kept thinking about it.

733
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,440
I thought about that so much.

734
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,610
Switching is definitely the answer,

735
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:52,300
but he's the one with the highest ranking.

736
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,770
That prevented me from speaking up even more.

737
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,430
He must've felt it.

738
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,120
No matter how ambitious you are...

739
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,520
You can be a slow learner, but we've been doing this song for three days.

740
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,820
If he can't do it at this point,

741
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,840
we're all going down! This is pointless.

742
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:15,310
Let's get started. Start the music.

750

[Jeong I Chan became even less confident]

753
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,020
Wow, what should we do?

754
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,230
Geez, what should we do?

755
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,660
Who did I Chan's part before?

756
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,720
- It was originally my part.
- Why did you switch?

757
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,120
My voice was in a really bad condition, and...

758
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,320
Did this happen just today? Or starting yesterday?

759
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,480
No.

760
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,140
It's always been this way.

761
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,870
You should've found the solution, then!

762
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,850
- You're performing immediately after.
- If you just leave things this way,

763
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:10,390
you're all going home.

764
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,000
Wow, this is...

765
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,610
Guys, just like for singing,

766
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:19,190
your emotions are very important in dancing, too.

767
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:21,450
But none of you are feeling the song.

768
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:25,850
Nobody is immersed in the theme of the song.

769
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:28,360
This is where your skills show.

770
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,340
None of your breathing is right.

771
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,110
Anyone can sing standing in the practice room.

772
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,080
But it shows when you perform on stage.

773
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,890
Do you think you can do better later because you'll receive energy from the audience?

774
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:42,050
If you can't do it now, it just doesn't' work out.

775
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:46,740
You need to practice and learn to do your best.

776
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,910
Da Eul, you can't consider yourself an amateur anymore.

777
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,500
You're always smiling, thinking "Although I lack in skill,

778
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,150
I just got started, and Star Creators like me,

779
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:01,150
so I'm okay." You need to wipe that thought clean starting today.

780
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,460
Yes, sir.

781
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,500
If you keep showing that you lack talent,

782
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,710
then that becomes your identity.

783
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:09,010
Okay.

784
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,890
- We'll go over the steps.
- Okay.

785
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:14,940
You know the part where Da Eul comes forward to rap?

786
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,840
You keep forgetting that part.

[They try Lee Da Eul's solo part again]

Da Eul, your motions are very small.

790
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,590
This should be it, right? It's this instead of this, right?

791
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,820
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

792
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,060
You need to be more powerful.

793
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,070
That's right.

794
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:40,370
You should've got this down during the practice.

795
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:41,940
You shouldn't be practicing here.

796
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,450
- How does this make sense?
- I'm sorry.

797
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,900
There's no need to apologize to me.

798
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,050
If you do badly, then it'll affect you negatively.

799

How many times are you going to practice here?

800

I really didn't want to cry.

801

But it felt like everything I practiced went to waste.

1060
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,340
They're doing so well.

1061
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,450
[The door opened.]

1062
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:52,360
[Their eyes opened wide.]

1063
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,570
Wow, look at his face.

1064
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:07,560
He's so cool.

1065
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:23,040
They're crazy.

1066
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,250
Jong Woo is really good.

1067
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,380
[Having a heart attack]

1068
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:42,060
[Making a fuss over the unexpected skin attack]

1069
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:55,970
They're amazing.

1070
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,990
- Wow, they're making a big hit.
- Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!

1071
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:33,600
Jong Woo!

1072
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:46,500
[You can watch the full performance on YouTube or Naver TV.]

1073
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,010
[Time for a standing ovation like a film festival.]

1074
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:54,730
They are so great!

1075
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:56,960
I got goosebumps.

1076
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,010
It's not fair to show his abs.

1077
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:00,440
I could even see his chest.

1078
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,230
It was too provocative.

1079
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:03,960
It's too spicy.

1080
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,600
[The master's waiting room is also heated up.]

1081
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:09,640
They were so awesome. For real!

1082
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:12,490
- I was so overwhelmed.
- Yes, with that energy!

1083
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:15,550
Yu Jin's thigh choreography was amazing.

1084
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:17,450
[Han Yu Jin]

1085
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:18,550
[Kim Tae Rae]

1086
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:19,450
[Kim Ji Woong]

1087
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:20,460
[Ji Yun Seo]

1088
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,490
[Kim Min Seong]

1089
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:22,520
[Kum Jin Hyeon]

1090
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,900
[Yoon Jong Woo]

1091
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:26,850
Is he one star? How can this be possible?

1092
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:28,800
- He must not be one star, right?
- No, he's one star.

1093
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,410
I can't believe it!

1094
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:33,180
- Yoon Jong Woo's killing part goes really well with this song.
- Right.

1095
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:37,040
Wow, Jong Woo is one star, and he's trained only for a year and four months. Wow!

1096
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,980
He stood out very much on the stage.

1097
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:40,480
Rediscovering Jong Woo altogether.

1098
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,790
He did so well. Min Seong was good, too.

1099
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:43,950
Yun Seo did well, too.

1100
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:45,470
I didn't know that Tae Rae sings well this much.

1101
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:47,440
Tae Rae sings well. He sings very well.

1102
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:51,870
Tae Rae sings well.

1103
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:55,660
As reaching the end of the performance, they knew it was going well.

1104
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,190
Then I could feel that they were immersed in the performance and shouting on the stage.

1105
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:02,350
How can they beat this team?

1106
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:04,350
[After Team K's performance]

1107
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:06,170
They did a good job.

1108
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:13,950
Shall we check Group G?

1109
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:17,780
[The choreography starts with Krystian's killing part.]

1110
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,640
[The group dance doesn't match since they haven't mastered the choreography.]

1111
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,030
[The performance ended with a lot of flaws.]

1112
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:39,030
[What's Master Baek's evaluation?]

1113
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:42,140
Since Krystian is taking the killing part...

1114
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:44,340
Well...

1115
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:46,130
I'm not so sure about it.

1116
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:48,390
I'm not sure.

1117
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:50,940
Speaking of Kristian, he is...

1118
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:55,060
not that charismatic.

1119
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,720
The character of this song doesn't suit you.

1120
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,200
This song needs more power.

1121
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:04,150
But when Krystian comes out in the beginning, he looks rather feminine.

1122
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:10,200
The beginning killing part opens up the performance.

1123
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,940
He doesn't have enough aura.

1124
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:18,410
Krystian, your killing part is weak.

1125
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:19,930
Yes, yes.

1126
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:22,730
Okay? Think more about it, alright?

1127
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:25,600
The mood of the song is more masculine.

1128
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,510
That's what Master said, too.

1129
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:31,580
As a leader, I thought we needed to rearrange the parts.

1130
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,480
Do you think we should keep our parts the way they are now

1131
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,780
or should we switch our parts?

1132
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:39,810
I think each person should talk...

1133
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:43,130
The part is important for each person.

1134
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:45,190
But it's actually...

1135
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:48,420
important to go against Team K.

1136
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:52,060
I'm just like... I really just feel like...

1137
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:54,880
it wouldn't be necessary to switch parts...

1138
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,000
I don't know why we're doing this. You know...

1139
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,010
But honestly, I agree with Kamden.

1140
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:04,250
- We need to improve.
- We must win.

1141
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,810
Let's all talk one by one.

1142
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:11,490
I think to beat Team K,

1143
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:19,640
it's best not to show too much gap in skills from Team K in the killing part.

1144
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:23,190
Can't we just do it the way it is?

1145
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:26,950
Do you guys trust me?

1146
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:28,700
It's not a matter of whether we trust you or not.

1147
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:31,690
To be honest, I hope we can show them the best stage.

1148
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:36,260
I think if you are confident with the killing part,

1149
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:40,640
you could beat them again if we revote.

1150
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,450
Yes, yes. So first, this was already voted.

1151
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:48,100
I do want to say that this means so much for me, too.

1152
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,430
Please don't...

1153
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:52,260
rip this out of me.

1154
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:55,710
Do we have to do this?

1155
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:59,410
[Krystian doesn't like the situation where they had to discuss the killing part.]

1156
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:02,540
[Next day]

1157
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:06,300
[Na Kamden, Ricky, and Krystian are each practicing the killing part.]

1158
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:12,480
I'm good at something fierce and strong.

1159
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:18,550
I'm confident that I can do the killing part more fiercely than Team K.

1160
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:20,540
I can do better than Team K.

1161
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:22,500
Who else wants to do the killing part?

1162
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,510
What about Kamden?

1163
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:27,530
What the Teacher said was about being manly.

1164
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,750
I'm confident about being manly.

1165
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:32,600
I hope that you'd trust me, Kamden.

1166
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,730
Yes, I trust you.

1167
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:38,120
I just want to try the killing part.

1168
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,930
[After all, Team G decided to rearrange the killing part.]

1169
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,880
[The first challenger, Na Kamden]

1170
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:53,510
Okay, there.

1171
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:56,350
[The second challenger, Krystian]

1172
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:04,140
[The third challenger, Ricky]

1173
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,020
He is good.

1174
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,150
Feel free to talk.

1175
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:16,210
[Who will be the team members' choice?]

1176
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:17,880
[Hesitating]

1177
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,670
It's okay. It's okay.

1178
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,840
[Ricky takes the killing part now.]

1179
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,800
Thank you.

1180
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,010
- I'll do my best.
- Please make us the winner.

1181
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,400
- Promise! You have to promise.
- Okay.

1182
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:35,800
[Team G is practicing again with the rearranged parts.]

1183
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,850
Brian needs to be seen more in this part.

1184
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:42,570
[Kamden rearranges the choreography focusing on the new killing part.]

1185
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:43,640
Let's...

1186
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,530
[Finds something]

1187
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:47,680
A little bit. Krystian, step up a little bit.

1188
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:51,490
I feel like we shouldn't do that move. Let's just mark the position first.

1189
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:54,560
[Krystian suggests they mark their spots rather than practice moves]

1190
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,150
Okay, okay, okay.

1191
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:00,590
Next position, which is it?

1192
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,790
Next position, which is it?

1193
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:05,790
- What is it?
- This. This move.

1194
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:06,980
Okay. What's the next one?

1195
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:08,800
This one. This one.

1196
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,770
We have to do the formation first, you know?

1197
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:17,720
That's why we're doing this now.

1198
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:25,760
[Team G arranges the formation according to Krystian's suggestion.]

1199
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:32,180
[While moving back, Ricky bumped into Krystian standing behind him.]

1200
01:11:34,450 --> 01:11:37,150
[Krystian should have moved to the side quickly.]

1201
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:39,310
[But]

1202
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:43,430
[Krystian remained in the center, different from the practice.]

1203
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:46,940
I just thought my part was short, and this is the only part I've got.

1204
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:48,930
I want to stand closer to the center.

1205
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,820
Can I do that?

1206
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:57,720
We need to make one perfect picture with the members.

1207
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,130
But doesn't he want to do it?

1208
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,610
[Krystian continues to remain in the center.]

1209
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:05,820
[His route even overlaps with Chen Jian Yu.]

1210
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,230
What are you doing?

1211
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:09,830
After I go, then you go.

1212
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:11,560
Hey, focus. Focus on it.

1213
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,550
Hey, focus. Focus on it.

1214
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:15,770
[The team members are perplexed by the leader's stern lead for the first time]

1215
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:20,680
[Kamden was surprised at himself after raising his voice.]

1216
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:27,530
How can I lead a team in a good direction as a leader?

1217
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:30,720
I don't know what to do.

1218
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,530
[After practice]

1219
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:35,110
Kamden hyung wants to talk.

1220
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:37,640
He said he was a little frustrated.

1221
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:40,260
As a leader, I should lead our team.

1222
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:44,280
I personally think if you let things go as a leader, you will lose.

1223
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,990
Yes, you are right.

1224
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:47,880
Anyway, you have to give a good performance.

1225
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,420
Don't give up.

1226
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:53,410
I'm not going to give up. I won't give up.

1227
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,660
[In the meantime, in Group G's room]

1228
01:12:55,660 --> 01:13:00,100
As a leader, Kamden tried to talk to us gently.

1229
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,720
I think that's why he couldn't talk directly to us.

1230
