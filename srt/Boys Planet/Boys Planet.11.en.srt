- I think it's SUNMI sunbaenim...

179
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,060
SUNMI? Really?

180
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,710
[Master SUNMI watched one episode with the trainees]

181

183

[Star Master Jeon So Mi]

184

00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,980
Hello.

189
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,820
Hello!

190
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,240
I won't be able to sleep tonight.

191
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,920
Her proportions are...

192
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,160
She'd be this tall if she stood next to you.

193
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,360
- What should we do?
- What would happen if I stand next to her?

194
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,770
You can't. You can't stand next to her.

195
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,510
I didn't expect this at all.

196
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,300
Hello, I'm Star Master Jeon So Mi who will be hosting BOYS PLANET's last elimination.

197
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,580
Watching BOYS PLANET, I was reminded of myself as a trainee a lot.

198
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,480
It's not being on a survival show, is it?

199
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,320
- No!
- It's not easy!

200
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,870
I remember hating this studio myself.

201
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,500
[Only the ones who experienced it can understand how nightmarish the studio can be]

202
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,360
- I totally understand.
- Only the ones experienced it know.

203
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,320
After this last elimination,

204
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,120
the final live show will be awaiting you, in which the final debut team will be formed.

205
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,790
Among the 28 trainees,

206
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,830
which 18 of them will join the final live show?

207
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,630
My heart feels weird right now.

208
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,340
Please!

209
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:34,250
Who will end up in the top 9, which was picked by the Star Creators from all over the world?

210
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,230
What if Zhang Hao wins 1st place?

211
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,890
- I think he'd win 1st place this time.
- He could.

212
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,010
Will Han Bin come down in ranking?

213
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,470
Finally?

214
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,700
According to the third Global Voting, we received about

215
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:56,020
3,1750,293 votes from about 182 countries.

216
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,300
We received a massive amount of votes.

217
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,250
You were supposed to pick three.

218
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,550
Entirely based on Global Voting, among the 28 trainees,

219
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,580
total 18 trainees from 1st place to 18th place will survive.

220
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,620
A total of 10 trainees, the ones from 19th place to 28th place will be eliminated.

221
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,030
10 of us need to go?

222
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,430
That's too many.

223
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,270
I'm scared.

224
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,530
After all the ups and downs, who would be the 18 surviving trainees

225
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,490
from the third elimination?

226
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,990
I'm so scared this time, Hyung.

227
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,540
The final elimination of BOYS PLANET will start...

228
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,220

We really reached the end.

232
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,720
- Why is this happening so soon?
- I'm nervous.

233
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,460
- It feels like the first elimination happened just yesterday.
- I know.

234
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,540
- This is the final elimination.
- I know.

235
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,640
- There are not enough seats.
- There really aren't.

236
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,980
What should we do?

237
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,800
I'll call the teams who will face the elimination first.

- Please!
- Oh my god! I'm nervous.

241
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,390
Please step forward if I mention your team name.

242

Look, the camera is shooting us.

244
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,270
Don't shoot! Go away!

245
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,430

Say, "Switch." Please say, "Switch."

250
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,990
I really want to go first.

251
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,510
It's not good to be called late. The seats would be all gone.

252
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,260
It's Team "Switch!"

253
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,510
They say if you're going to be punished, it's better to go first.

254
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,980
I've never felt this nervous before.

255
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,500
The next team that will face elimination is Team "En Garde."

256
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,560
I knew it when the camera was pointing at us.

257
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:57,180
Even though most of the members were assigned late, Team "Switch" gave a great performance.

258
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,920
And Team "En Garde" who was considered a strong contender

259
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,490
delivered a quality performance and met everyone's expectations.

260

- They did so well.
- They were so good.

261
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,650
Since both teams consist of talented trainees,

262
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,290
they received a lot of enthusiasm from the audience.

263
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,810
I wonder what would be their Global Voting ranking.

264
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,110
I'll announce the surviving members of Team "Switch" Team "En Garde."

00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,200
I hope she calls me.

353
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,780
It could be Hoe Taek, too.

354
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,520
And he's known for the strong friendship he has with another trainee.

355
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,920
Gun Wook and Joon Hyun.

356
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,360
It's you and I.

357
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,720
I think it's Joon Hyun.

358
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,460
- Is it Joon Hyun?
- It must be.

359
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,160
Is it you again?

360
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,160
Gyu Bin?

361
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,040
- Gyu Bin will be in the top 9.
- Gyu Bin hyung and...

362
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,630
Hoe Taek also...

363
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,080
[During the musical mission]

364
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,800
- Let's do it together!
- Do you want to?

365
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,770
Please!

366
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,220
Hold on, what should I do?

367
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,140
[There were three members who wanted Hoe Taek]

368
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,730
He won't let me go!

369
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,990
[Could Lee Hoe Taek and Kim Gyu Bin be in line for being in 12th place?]

370
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,020
I'll announce the trainee who ended up in

371
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,290
12th place as the result of the Global Voting.

372
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:02,070
- Oh my god.
- I'd be grateful to be in 12th place.

373
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,300
I really have no idea.

374
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,400
The trainee who ended up in 12th place is...

375
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,000
Geum Joon Hyun?

376
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,430
Park Gun Wook.

377
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,990
[Park Gun Wook's ranking fell from 9th place to 12th place]

378
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,390
Wow!

379
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,060
What's the deal?

380
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,520
Gun Wook is in 12th place?

381
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,380
Congrats!

382
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,230
Congrats, congrats. It's a high ranking.

383
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,050
- Don't give up yet.
- It's okay.

384
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,580
What would happen to the top 9 then?

385
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,810
[I have no idea]

386
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,450
There will be a new top 9, then.

387
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,710
In the second elimination,

388
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,390
Park Gun Wook got in the top 9 for the first time.

389
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,820
It's changing a lot.

390
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,860
Even though he couldn't make it in the top 9 since his ranking went down by three,

391
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,760
he'll be joining the final with a high ranking.

392
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,110
I'm so anxious, I could go crazy.

393
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,490
I'm going crazy.

394
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,650
This is so shocking.

395
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,140
I'll continue announcing the surviving trainees of Team "Switch" and Team "En Garde."

396
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,750
- There must be more.
- Looks like there's more.

397
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,000
Please...

398
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,420
I think the 13th-place trainee will be here, too.

399
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,460
Are there five seats left?

400
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,350
[There are five seats left for surviving trainees]

401
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,480
They need to make some room for us.

402
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,310
Next is 15th place.

403
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,000
What's going on, anyway?

404
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,940
There are no seats left.

405
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,920
15, 16, 17.

406
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,260
15th place?

407
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,880
How about Hoe Taek hyung?

408
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,980
What's happening to him?

409
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,130
I think he'd be in the top 9.

410
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,320
The trainee who ended up in 15th place is

411
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,880
known for silly reactions and has a unique character, as I hear.

412
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,580
[Is it me, then?]

413
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,410
- It's Jong Woo.
- Really?

414
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,260
[He showed so many faces on BOYS PLANET]

415
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,440
[Yoon Jong Woo has showed many characters]

416
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,680
I'll push you! Jong Woo!

417
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,980
Isn't it Joon Hyun?

418
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,780
I can only think of Geum Joon Hyun.

419
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,760
[He has endless reactions]

420
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,630
[Geum Joon Hyun has an irreplaceable character]

421
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,170
It's because you trained me.

422
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,170
[Such an unrivaled character, Geum Jun Hyeon]

423
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,990
I think it's Hoe Taek hyung.

424
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,670
[He bursts in to laughter in all situations]

425
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,170
[He has showed many silly reactions]

426
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,940
[An awkward, but a nice Hyung, Lee Hoe Taek]

427
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,400
And this trainee's MBTI result is...

428
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,610
MBTI? Why all of a sudden?

429
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,780
MBTI?

430
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,990
- Cute.
- Sexy.

431
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,100
It starts with an E.

432
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,810
[He's nervous because he's an ENFP]

433
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,800
Isn't it Geum Joon Hyun?

434
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,660
Joon Hyun, yours starts with an E, right?

435
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,690
Are you an E?

436
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,050
No, he's an I.

437
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,430
It's Joon Hyun.

438
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,680
You showed silly reactions and you're an E, right?

439
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,700
I'm an E.

440
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,560
- Me, too.
- Yours is the same as mine.

441
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,660
- Kamden, are you an E?
- Yes.

442
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,400
Everyone here got E except for me.

443
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,200
[Who will be in 15th place among them?]

444
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,380
That person is...

445
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,200
- Gyu Bin hyung?
- Geum Joon Hyun?

446
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,400
Geum Joon Hyun is in 15th place. Geum Joon Hyun is in 15th place.

447
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,330
It's Yoon Jong Woo.

448
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,770
[15th place, Yoon Jong Woo]

449
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,620
Wow!

450
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,330
It's Yoon Jong Woo!

451
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,940
Congrats! This is crazy!

452
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,030
He kept his ranking.

453
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,120
Congrats, Jong Woo!

454
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,200
Congratulations.

455
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,790
I won't cast my spell anymore.

456
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,070
I don't think it's working.

457
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,280
- It's not so good.
- It's not working.

458
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,010
He maintained the ranking he got in the last elimination

459
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,290
and successfully joined the final.

460
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,060
How impressive.

461
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,720
Except for the 10 trainees who are in line to be in the top 9

462
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,970
and 18th place, the remaining rankings for Team "Switch" and Team "En Garde" are...

463
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,170
16th place and 17th place.

464
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,990
There are only two seats left.

465
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,630
This is Daebak.

466
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,440
The remaining teams must be scared, too.

467
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,250
What if they fill up all the seats?

468
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,360
We're in trouble.

469
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,890
I don't think it's be us this time.

470
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm so scared!

471
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,890
No.

472
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,430
Could there be more surviving trainees in Team "Switch" and Team "En Garde?"

473
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,190
There are.

474
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,470
There are too many talented people here.

475
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,900
There are not enough seats.

476
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,730
I know.

477
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,740
Could there be more surviving trainees?

478
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,770
There has to be.

479
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,770
- Please.
- Please!

480
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,560
Seriously!

481
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,590
There is.

482
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,060
My gosh!

483
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,460
My gosh!

484
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,030
I knew there'd be.

485
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,240
Which ranking could it be?

486
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,610
[Team "Switch" and "En Garde" has the 16th-place trainee, too]

487
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,930
Next is 16th place.

488
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,030
They're taking all of them.

489
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,380
They can't take 17th place, too.

490
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,260
It's either Joon Hyun or...

491
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,800
- What?
- You think his ranking went down by six?

492
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,430
There's Kamden hyung, too.

493
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,260
Please, Na Kamden.

494
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,130
I have no clue.

495
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,580
It's either Seung Hwan or...

496
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,040
- I hope it's Seung Hwan.
- I think it'd be difficult.

497
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,400
There are too many talented people.

498
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,810
The 16th-place trainee who will be joining the final

499
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:48,560
had a huge shift in his ranking that it'd be surprising to anyone.

500
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,290
Could it be Hoe Taek?

501
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,230
It can't be.

502
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,550
- No way.
- It's either Gyu Bin or Hoe Taek.

503
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,550
Gyu Bin being in 16th place is...

504
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:00,160
Gyu Bin was in 16th place in the midterm.

505
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,320
This is so unpredictable.

506
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,210
Comparing to the second elimination, his ranking...

507
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,530
- Did it go up?
- No, it went down.

508
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,070
went down.

509
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,070
It went down.

510
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,370
went down.

511
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:15,000
It could actually be Gyu Bin.

512
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,240
Tae Rae hyung?

513
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,820
No way.

514
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,740
Could it be?

515
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,340
I have no idea right now.

516
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,950
And he never did the Killing Part in any of the missions.

517
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,720
[It's neither Kim Tae Rae nor Keita]

518
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,970
Hoe Taek hyung?

519
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,200
I think it's one of the three in "En Garde."

520
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,470
Hoe Taek didn't do a Killing Part.

521
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,590
Brace yourself. Seriously.

522
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,720
No matter what the result is.

523
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,790
Okay.

524
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,990
The trainee's name is...

525
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,660
Who could it be? I have no clue.

526
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,800
Geum Joon Hyun.

527
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,330
Thank goodness.

528
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,010
Congrats.

529
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,450
Congratulations on going to the final.

530
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,800
Congrats, Joon Hyun.

531
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,320
I feel so nervous right now.

532
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,890
Smile!

533
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,570
He went down a lot.

534
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,450
It's so dangerous.

535
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,150
His ranking went down by six comparing to last time.

536
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,070
But since he's being loved for his unique character,

537
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,200
he'd be moving on to the final by being in 16th place.

538
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,830
It... It changed too much.

539
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:21,520
Trainee Yoon Jong Woo successfully made it to the final as an independent trainee.

540
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,180
Please tell us how you feel.

541
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,450
Since I came here without expecting anything,

542
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,340
my memories here are so precious.

543
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,260
I kept telling to myself to be in the final, at least.

544
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,510
And I ended up being here.

545
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,600
So I reached my goal for the day, at least.

546
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,500
I'd like to thank the Star Creators

547
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,310
who support me one more time.

548
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,990
I really wanted to be on stage one more time.

549
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,210
My goal coming here was

550
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,180
moving on to the final.

551
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,920
Thankfully, I'd be able to join the final

552
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,640
with such a high ranking. I'm relieved.

553
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,000
I'd like to express my love and gratitude

554
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,080
to the Star Creators who support me.

555
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,600
Trainee Park Gun Wook, could you express your joy for surviving by acting cute?

556
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,840
I want to see it!

557
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,590
- I'm looking forward to it!
- I'm looking forward to it!

558

Wow! Cute!

563
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,940
Cool!

564
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,510
Gun Wook hyung, you're cute!

565
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,920
Cute.

566
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,020
I'll try it in Japanese, too.

567
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,300
Why do they like speaking Japanse so much?

568
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,950
- Hello!
- Hello.

569
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,790
I'm...

570
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,020
the cutest.

I'm Geum Joon Hyun.

574
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,830
Thank you!

575
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,900
That's all.

576
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,110
- Good job!
- Why is he so cute?

577
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,280
I'll take your mic away now.

578
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,300
It needs to be confiscated.

579
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,800
Congratulations on making it to the final one more time.

580
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,020
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

[Yoon Jong Woo sat on the 15th place seat]

583
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,630
We still made it.

584
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,070
Let's do it one more time!

585
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,810
[12th place Park Gun Wook and 16th Place Geum Joon Hyun took their seats, too]

586
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,080
There are not enough seats!

587
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,290
[There are only three seats left for the survivors]

588
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,590
There are just three left.

589
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:21,210
I think they'll take 17th place, too.

590
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,820
I'm so nervous.

591
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,160
You're right! It's so wet!

592
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,050
What should we do, Hyung?

593
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:33,160
I think yours would be really high.

594
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,900
I'm so nervous right now.

595
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,490
Two trainees from Team "Switch"

596
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,630
and another two from Team "En Garde" survived so far.

597
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,780
Could there be more surviving trainees in these teams

598
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,040
except for the top 9 and 18th place?

599
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,240
There has to be. Please!

600
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,960
One last seat.

601
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,370
Aigoo!

602
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,690
The trainee that would be called next is...

603
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,550
[Could there be more surviving trainees?]

604
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,780
If they have more,

605

the rest of us...

606
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,660
There must be. But what if there is?

607
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,330
There isn't.

608
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:07,400
There isn't.

609
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,530
[The remaining trainees will either survive or get eliminated]

610
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,680
Top 9, top 9...

611
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,040
- top 9, and top 9.
- Three in the top 9?

612
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,590
Those three would be in the top 9, right?

613
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,810
I think so.

614
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,760
Gyu Bin hyung.

615
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,080
Hoe Taek hyung? Hold on. Hoe Taek hyung...

616
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,720
But even if your name hasn't been called yet,

617
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,790
you could either be in the top 9 or survive by being in 18th place.

618
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,130
I hope you wait until the end.

619
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,730
I think Tae Rae would be in the top 9.

620
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,520
Gyu Bin, Keita, and Tae Rae?

621
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,780
I think the 18th place could be either Hoe Taek or Kamden.

622
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,200
I have no idea!

623
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,740
What would happen, anyway?

624
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,770
I'll continue announcing the surviving trainees...

625
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,980
Before that,

on a very, very nice day,

627
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:00,350
I heard the trainees had a day filled with distrust and suspicion.

628

629
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,510

[Sometime in April, on a spring day]

Chocolate!

641
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,240
Why did they make us come here today?

642
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,430
- Because it's a camping site.
- We need to have a barbecue.

643
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,600
Barbecue.

644
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,340
The place you're invited to is...

645
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,000
an animal forest.

1423
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:04,750

Without the benefits he got as a member of "Over Me",

1552

he would have disqualified as rank 19.

1553

I'd survive in a high rank of 14

1571
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:47,590
so I feel like I'm dreaming. I have no words to describe how I feel right now.

But I'm really grateful

and one person from Team "Say My Name" have survived.

1602

- It's two people.
- Was it always two?

1624
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:32,690
It was 9th, 10th and 11th before, but only 9th and 10th, now.

- I'm relieved.
- Matthew?

1641
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:11,360
His rank really dropped.

1642
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,040
Matthew's a candidate for 9th place?

1643
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,680
That's so unexpected.

1644

1923
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,410
Give us a big laugh out loud for three seconds!

1924
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:11,900
[Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha]

1925
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:13,180
[After such a jolly laugh]

1926
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:15,250
[Suddenly feels embarrassed]

1927
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:16,570
So cute

1928
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:20,800
[4th place Kim Tae Rae moves to his survivor seat.]

1929
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:29,120
It's nice.

1930
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,160
It's nice to sit here again.

1931
01:26:33,790 --> 01:26:36,900
The final survival announcement of Boys Planet.

1932
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:41,500
Now, there is only the announcement of the top three spots in the Top9.

1933
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:42,760
Oh my God.

1934
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:47,530
Who will be the final first place trainee before the debut group is formed?

1935
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:49,770
[1st place candidates]

1936
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:52,930
For the trainee who ends up in first place among the 9 members of the debut group,

1937
01:26:52,930 --> 01:26:55,330
they will get the incredible benefit of getting the killing part of the debut title track,

1938
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:57,950
and get to have their solo song

1939
01:26:57,950 --> 01:27:00,480
included in the debut album.

1940
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,280
Who will get this incredible benefit?

1941
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:08,310
Let's take a look at the three first place candidates who are eyeing first place in the TOP9.

1942
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,700
Who are they? I'm so curious.

1943
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:13,790
Such bad acting...

1944
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:16,090
- The first candidate is...
- Zhang Hao?

1945
01:27:16,090 --> 01:27:18,020
Kim Ji WOong.

1946
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:19,780
[First place candidate in the TOP9, Kim Ji Woong]

1947
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:22,890
So cool!

1948
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:25,620
But I want to try living a week with that face.

1949
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:29,120
I feel like I would stare at my face for the entire week.

1950
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,380
The second candidate is...

1951
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:35,120
Sung Han Bin.

1952
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,570
[First place candidate in the TOP9, Sung Han Bin]

1953
01:27:39,610 --> 01:27:41,620
Group K's center is so handsome.

1954
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:43,750
A proud "Say My Name" member.

1955
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:46,570
Why are everyone's physiques so similar?

1956
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:51,640
The third candidate is Zhang Hao.

1957
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,920
Zhang Hao, let's go.

1958
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,570
As expected.

1959
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,700
Their heights are all the same.

1960
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:00,530
Yeah, they're the same.

1961
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:03,590
They're all 6 feet. Their genes are the same.

1962
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:04,660
Height and visuals...

1963
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:07,070
I will first announce the 3rd place trainee

1964
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:09,690
for the third TOP 9 of Boys Planet.

1965
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:12,550
[3rd place]

1966
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:17,140
- 3rd place...
- Who will it be?

1967
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:18,660
They're so high up in rank.

1968
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:20,810
This trainee who placed 3rd

1969
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:26,750
- received a total of 3,536,122 points.
- 3.53 million...

1970
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:30,170
- Wow, it's not that much different from you.
- What did I get?

1971
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:31,490
3.51 million.

1972
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:34,300
I got 3.5 million. He got 3.51 million, and one of them got 3.53 million.

1973
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:36,470
So close.

1974
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:40,630
I will announce the third place trainee for the third TOP9.

1975
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:45,830
That trainee is...

1976
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:49,820
Kim Ji Woong.

1977
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:53,660
[3rd place survivor is Kim Ji Woong]

1978
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:56,160
The first and second place trainees don't change.

1979
01:28:56,160 --> 01:29:01,320
I am grateful and think of it as an honor

1980
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:05,510
to be able to provide comfort and happiness to others.

1981
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:07,130
Thank you.

1982
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:11,690
He's so cool.

1983
01:29:11,690 --> 01:29:18,800
Could you express how happy you are at surviving with a "Say My Name" version using cute and bright facial expressions?

1984
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,140
He's gotten better at acting cute.

1985
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:22,930
Gosh, I got you!

1986
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:25,240
[His cuteness ability has grown due to Sung Han Bin's special training]

1987
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,930
Right, that's it!

1988
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:36,470
[After remembering his special training in acting cute]

1989
01:29:38,950 --> 01:29:40,770
His ears have gotten red.

1990
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:43,820
I caught you, 3rd place!

1991
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:46,310
I caught you, 3rd place!

1992
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:48,780
What, he caught a mosquito?
- 3rd place. He caught 3rd place.

1993
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:51,250
- Gosh, oh no!
- Ji Woong hyung is so cute.

1994
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:52,560
Aigoo, so cute.

1995
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,770
His ears are about to explode.

1996
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:59,010
Trainee Kim Ji Woong, I look forward to seeing you perform well on the Final Mission stage.

1997
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:04,440
Thanks.

1998
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,250
Congratulations!

1999
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:09,150
3rd place Ji Woong?

2000
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:11,050
You managed to come up.

2001
01:30:11,050 --> 01:30:12,710
That was so unexpected.

2002
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:14,420
Congratulations.

2003
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:23,480
Now is it the battle between the first and second place?

2004
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,020
This is the main match.

2005
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,960
I'm so curious who will get first place.

2006
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,970
- No way it will change, right?
- I wonder...

2007
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:30,160
Who will get first place?

2008
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:33,020
Let's get first place, this time, Zhang Hao hyung.

2009
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:35,030
He did get the benefit of 400,000 points.

2010
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:39,830
Now, it's time to announce the long-awaited first place trainee for the TOP9 of Boys Planet.

2011
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:41,900
[1st place]

2012
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:47,990
Trainee Zhang Hao. This time, you got a major benefit of 400,000 points.

2013
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:51,540
So I think you would have high expectations for getting first place.

2014
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:55,860
If I can rank up

2015
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:59,590
by receiving such a big benefit,

2016
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:01,780
I would love that, of course.

2017
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:04,640
So I do have my hopes up a bit.

2018
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,800
Of course he would have some expectations.

2019
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,860
You really don't know what might happen because of the benefit. Zhang Hao might actually get first place.

2020
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:12,130
Thankfully,

2021
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:17,360
I've always gotten good results for each survival announcement.

2022
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:21,610
Because of that, I am beginning to want to keep my position.

2023
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:25,300
- Of course.
- As expected of Sung Han Bin.

2024
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:32,240
Well, Han Bin, this time,

2025
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:42,070
Han Bin, this time, while I was making the choreo for the Over Me instrumental section... thanks for helping me out.

2026
01:31:42,070 --> 01:31:45,000
You know how there's an instrumental in the middle of "Over Me"

2027
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,750
I want to put in tutting.

2028
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:49,310
[Boys Planet's tutting master, Sung Han Bin]

2029
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:54,690
[His secret weapon shocked everyone during the Star Level Test]

2030
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,980
[He taught him the basics of tutting]

2031
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,990
Let's make a box like this.

2032
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:03,450
Oh, this, this. One more time!

2033
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:07,580
[Sung Han Bin helped him out with coming up ideas for the choreography]

2034
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:14,300
[They completed the choreo with Sung Han Bin's help]

2035
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:18,660
[Zhang Hao perfectly performed the highlight of "Over Me" with Sung Han Bin's help]

2036
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:22,130
We are in the middle of competing with each other,

2037
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:27,000
and yet he taught me all of it without thinking about any of that,

2038
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,810
so I was touched.

2039
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:34,530
Then could we see both of you doing that move together?

2040
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:38,580
Oh, they're going to be in perfect sync.

2041
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:39,980
Seven, eight.

2042
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:49,770
[The centers are so cool]

2043
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:57,710
- So cool!
- They're so cool.

2044
01:32:57,710 --> 01:33:00,800
You two should be best friends forever.

2045
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,540
Yes.

2046
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:05,470
- They're pretty much like family now.
- Who do you think is going to get it?

2047
01:33:05,470 --> 01:33:07,230
I feel like it might be Hao hyung.
- Hao?

2048
01:33:07,230 --> 01:33:11,460
Will Trainee Sung Han Bin who's been keeping his seat in first place like an unbreakable rock

2049
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:14,650
sit in first place again?

2050
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:16,920
It's Group K's Sung Han Bin! Congratulations!

2051
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:20,330
[Sung Han Bin has been outstanding from the start]

2052
01:33:20,330 --> 01:33:23,590
[He's continued to retain his first place seat and gained respect as the center of Boys Planet.]

2053
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:26,450
[Will he be able to retain his seat this time as well?]

2054
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:33,200
Or will Trainee Zhang Hao who received the benefit of 400,000 votes

2055
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:37,080
be able to take first place for the first time?

2056
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:40,240
[Zhang Hao has become the master of concepts after getting the killing part of "Over Me"]

2057
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:43,010
[He received the 400,000 point benefit by becoming the first place team's first place trainee]

2058
01:33:43,010 --> 01:33:45,980
[Will he be able to take over first place with his 400,000 point benefit?]

2059
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:49,800
I will announce the trainee who got the honor of first place.

2060
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,210
I feel like it will be Han Bin.
- Is he impossible to overcome?

2061
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:55,430
I feel like Hao hyung will get first place this time, don't you think?

2062
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:56,810
He's got the benefit.

2063
01:33:56,810 --> 01:33:58,680
I think that could happen.

2064
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:01,140
The trainee in first place is...

2065
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:03,010
If the first place changes, that would be legendary.

2066
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:05,320
Gosh, this drama is fun.

2067
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:07,970
- Do you think it will be Zhang Hao?
- I don't know.

2068
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:09,730
Will the first place trainee defend his place,

2069
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:12,480
or will it be the Zhang Hao's overthrow him?

2070
01:34:18,230 --> 01:34:20,560
It's Sung Han Bin!

2071
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:24,300
It's Sung han Bin.

2072
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:28,430
It doesn't change.
- He's firmly entrenched.

2073
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:30,140
The unwavering first place, Sung Han Bin!

2074
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:34,210
He's really just making history.

2075
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:40,860
Well... for this past Artist Battle mission,

2076
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:45,640
there was such a big benefit on the line,

2077
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:49,160
so I really wasn't able to predict this.

2078
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:53,070
please continue to cheer for me

2079
01:34:53,070 --> 01:34:56,940
so I can run to the finish line as shining as bright as I can be.

2080
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:59,950
My "Say My Name" Team members, I love you.

2081
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,270
He's amazing.

2082
01:35:07,270 --> 01:35:14,280
I am grateful and happy to be able to rank 2nd place again.

2083
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:17,980
I will continue running without stopping.

2084
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:21,940
Please continue being happy through my passion.

2085
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:25,710
A bit more...

2086
01:35:25,710 --> 01:35:28,470
A bit more...

2087
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:31,190
I taught him that.

2088
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:33,640
I will work a bit more harder.

2089
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:37,800
You did well.

2090
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:43,300
Now please move to your rank's seat, starting from 2nd place Trainee Zhang Hao.

2091
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:45,450
Zhang Hao!

2092
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:52,140
Zhang Hao, you're the best!

2093
01:35:56,890 --> 01:35:58,890
God Han Bin is coming.

2094
01:36:00,570 --> 01:36:02,710
Automatic standing ovation.

2095
01:36:04,010 --> 01:36:06,170
His legs gave way.

2096
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:08,750
Sung Han Bin shines!

2097
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:10,530
Han Bin hyung.

2098
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:13,190
- So cool!
- Thank you!

2099
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:18,930
The third TOP9 of Boys Planet is complete!

2100
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:21,090
Congratulations!

2101
01:36:21,090 --> 01:36:23,100
So cool.

2102
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:28,720
Why are we the only ones that are fully still here?

2103
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:30,800
All around us are empty.

2104
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,500
Only our team is full like this.

2105
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:35,270
It's so sad. It's sad that we're talking about this smiling.

2106
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:39,880
Now there is only one survivor seat left, the 18th place seat.

2107
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:41,040
Gosh, it's the 18th place seat.

2108
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:44,260
- The big one's coming.
- This is really major.

2109
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:49,060
Among the 11 trainees left, only one trainee in 18th place will survive

2110
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:53,350
and join the others in the final stage.

2111
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:56,840
Who will be the final survivor?

2112
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:59,580
I will announce the four candidates for 18th place.

2113
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:01,760
4 candidates?

2114
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,610
That's quite a lot of candidates.

2115
01:37:03,610 --> 01:37:05,060
[18th place candidates]

2116
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,760
Seung Hwan? Seo Won? Woong Ki?

2117
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:08,300
It could be Kamden, too.

2118
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:10,970
Definitely Kamden, Haruto, and Wang Zi Hao.

2119
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:12,980
Hiroto, Haruto.

2120
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:14,490
[16th place - Haruto]
[28th - Hiroto]

2121
01:37:14,490 --> 01:37:16,570
Jui hyung also has the benefit.

2122
01:37:16,570 --> 01:37:18,800
But Seung Hwan hyung's rank is pretty high too.

2123
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,610
I really don't know who it could be.

2124
01:37:20,610 --> 01:37:22,350
I hope it includes both members left for "En Garde" Team.

2125
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:24,270
Lee Seung Hwan and Hiroto haven't survived yet.

2126
01:37:24,270 --> 01:37:26,380
These are the four candidates for 18th place.

2127
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:27,710
It's coming.

2128
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:29,730
Please display my face.

2129
01:37:29,730 --> 01:37:31,820
[19th place - Wang Zi Hao]

2130
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:33,760
[26th place - Cha Woong Ki]

2131
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:39,030
Hiroto and Woong Ki.

2132
01:37:39,030 --> 01:37:40,410
Hiroto is there. Hiroto.

2133
01:37:40,410 --> 01:37:45,130
Na Kamden, Wang Zi Hao, Cha Woong Ki, and Hiroto.

2134
01:37:45,130 --> 01:37:48,160
Woong Ki and Wang Zi Hao.
- Wow, Haruto isn't here.

2135
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:51,250
[Haruto is confirmed to be eliminated by not being listed among the 18th place candidates.]

2136
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:54,170
The U.S., China, South Korea, and Japan.

2137
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:55,500
It's one trainee each from each country.

2138
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,350
Wow, that's true.

2139
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:58,860
Wow, what a coincidence!

2140
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:01,320
This is like a summit meeting.

2141
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:04,200
Only one of these four candidates will survive

2142
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:09,330
and get to stand on the final stage that will produce the debut group for Boys Planet.

2143
01:38:09,330 --> 01:38:12,290
This is the second time that Hiroto is facing elimination.

2144
01:38:12,290 --> 01:38:17,350
The candidate for 28th place whom the Star Creators chose as the final survivor...

2145
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:19,510
It's Hiroto!

2146
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:21,290
[And ultimately survived at the brink of elimination]

2147
01:38:21,290 --> 01:38:23,520
[Will he be able to be the final survivor again?]

2148
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:29,600
First, I will announce the trainee who will end up leaving Boys Planet in 21st place.

2149
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,410
It's so cruel...
- Yeah, it is...

2150
01:38:32,410 --> 01:38:34,200
I can't watch.

2151
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:39,850
The trainee who will unfortunately end up leaving Boys Planet in 21st place is...

2152
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:44,630
It's Hiroto.

2153
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:51,210
You did well.

2154
01:38:51,210 --> 01:38:53,210
Oh, Hiroto...

2155
01:38:53,210 --> 01:38:55,620
If we'd just gotten 1st place...

2156
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:59,200
I didn't get a good result because I was lacking, but...

2157
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,600
That's not true.

2158
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,700
I am happy

2159
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:08,130
if the Star Creators were happy

2160
01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:11,100
while cheering for me.

2161
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:12,750
Right, this is only the beginning.

2162
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:14,560
Thank you.

2163
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:17,920
You are not lacking.

2164
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:21,070
None of you are lacking. All of you here are amazing.

2165
01:39:21,070 --> 01:39:22,750
Thank you.

2166
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:29,830
Now, I will announce the trainee who will leave Boys Planet in 20th place among the remaining three candidates.

2167
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:37,710
The trainee who will leave Boys Planet in 20th place is...

2168
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:47,950
Cha Woong Ki.

2169
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:52,300
You did well.

2170
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:55,820
You've done well, Woong Ki. Really...

2171
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,960
You've really worked hard.

2172
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:04,590
When I said that I would appear on Boys Planet,

2173
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,580
I was told by many people that what I want is different from what I can do,

2174
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:13,860
that my time is up,

2175
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:19,290
and that I would learn to face reality.

2176
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:24,940
But I feel like that's not true.

2177
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:27,430
Through Boys Planet,

2178
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:31,380
I was able to learn more about my potential as Cha Woong Ki,

2179
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:34,070
and I will become an ever cooler person.

2180
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:37,300
Woong Ki Boy is just beginning.

2181
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:39,330
Thank you!

2182
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:40,990
So cool!

2183
01:40:42,230 --> 01:40:44,550
Continue to dream of becoming a K-pop idol!

2184
01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:46,200
Yes!

2185
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:51,990
Aigoo, you did well. Aigoo, it's okay.

2186
01:40:53,690 --> 01:40:57,100
Between Na Kamden and Wang Zi Hao who are left,

2187
01:40:57,100 --> 01:41:01,910
I will announce the final 18th place survivor who will move on to the final.

2188
01:41:01,910 --> 01:41:03,810
[18th place]

2189
01:41:03,810 --> 01:41:07,660
The point difference between the two trainees that determined their fate of moving onto the final or not

2190
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:11,110
was 133,706 points.

2191
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:13,430
Gosh, really?
- 130,000?

2192
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:15,630
The results would have been different with the benefit.

2193
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:17,960
Trainee Na Camden has miraculously survived

2194
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:20,500
in ranks at risk of being eliminated.

2195
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:25,490
Will he be able to miraculously survive again by placing 18th?

2196
01:41:25,490 --> 01:41:28,590
Or will "SuperCharger" Team's Trainee Wang Zi Hao

2197
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:33,240
start a new miracle story as the sole survivor of his team?

2198
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:35,530
It would be a shame for either of one of them to be eliminated.

2199
01:41:35,530 --> 01:41:39,040
The trainee who will survive in 18th place is...

2200
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:44,390
[20th place - Na Camden]
- [19th place - Wang Zi Hao]

2201
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:46,600
It's (bleep)!

2202
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:53,140
The trainee who will survive in 18th place is...

2203
01:41:54,460 --> 01:41:59,490
[Nervous]

2204
01:41:59,490 --> 01:42:04,330
[Who will get the final seat in the final in 18th place?]

2205
01:42:04,330 --> 01:42:06,810
It's Na Kamden.

2206
01:42:06,810 --> 01:42:09,350
It's Na Kamden.

2207
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:12,440
[18th place survivor is Na Kamden]

2208
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:14,190
Congratulations.

2209
01:42:16,010 --> 01:42:18,520
Na Kamden, it's so daebak.

2210
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:22,200
[The trainees comfort the two trainees who ended up in two different fates by just one rank.]

2211
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:24,840
You did well.

2212
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:26,830
It's daebak, really.

2213
01:42:26,830 --> 01:42:30,380
Honestly, when I wasn't called before,

2214
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:34,230
I was organizing my thoughts and emptied myself of expectations.

2215
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:39,350
But thank you so much for allowing me to stand on such a big stage such as the final.

2216
01:42:39,350 --> 01:42:41,790
Also, love you, Mom.

2217
01:42:41,790 --> 01:42:43,570
I entered the final!

2218
01:42:43,570 --> 01:42:45,080
[So cute]

2219
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:47,480
Thank you all so much.

2220
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:52,780
Congratulations, Na Kamden!

2221
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:54,870
[Na Kamden moves to the final survivor seat.]

2222
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:57,300
Kamden!

2223
01:43:00,810 --> 01:43:02,680
Congratulations!

2224
01:43:04,730 --> 01:43:06,960
Hyung, we can perform together.

2225
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,670
I'm so happy.

2226
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:14,760
Trainee Wang Zi Hao, it's unfortunate, but you have to leave Boys Planet now.

2227
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:17,740
Please share with us your final thoughts.

2228
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:23,290
I was grateful to be able to experience these times together with everyone.

2229
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:27,900
I will treasure the fact that I was able

2230
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:33,350
to make good memories with you all at this starting point of my life.

2231
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:35,220
Thank you.

2232
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:42,280
It's a bit sad though.

2233
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:45,130
[The entire "SuperCharger" Team wasn't able to move onto the final.]

2234
01:43:45,130 --> 01:43:47,860
- We did our best.
- Yeah.

2235
01:43:49,310 --> 01:43:54,030
The 10 trainees who are wrapping up their journeys in Boys Planet,

2236
01:43:54,030 --> 01:43:56,450
although your journey here is over,

2237
01:43:56,450 --> 01:43:59,790
our relationships made here and your own journeys are not over,

2238
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:03,520
so I will continue to cheer you on so you guys can continue to shine.

2239
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:06,370
You've done well, everyone.

2240
01:44:10,270 --> 01:44:12,250
Thank you.

2241
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:14,740
Star Creators all over the world,

2242
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:18,180
the 18 trainees who survived through your votes

2243
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:24,400
will stand in the final mission stage in Jamsil Stadium next week.

2244
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:31,360
During the live broadcast of the final with around 7,000 Star Creators in attendance,

2245
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:36,220
which 9 trainees will debut as a global K-pop boy group?

2246
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:40,730
Will the trainee that you are rooting for be able to achieve their ultimate goal of debuting?

2247
01:44:40,730 --> 01:44:47,410
Please find out those results by watching the live broadcast of the final for Boys Planet that will air next week.

2248
01:44:47,410 --> 01:44:51,150
And now, we will start the first round of final global voting for Boys Planet

2249
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:55,480
that will determine the members of Boys Planet's debut group.

2250
01:44:55,480 --> 01:45:02,690
Five, four, three, two, one!

2251
01:45:02,690 --> 01:45:05,160
May the voting begin!

2252
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:14,100
Dear Star Creators around the world.

2253
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:18,870
The first round of final global voting has begun.

2254
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:26,430
Please go vote on Mnet Plus, BOYS PLANETS' official app for voting. You can vote once a day.

2255
01:45:26,430 --> 01:45:28,930
Connect to BOYS PLANETS' voting page.

2256
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,100
Pick one trainee, regardless of their groups.

2257
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:37,080

01:54:58,650 --> 01:55:01,880
I really didn't know that I would make it to the finals.

2425
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:05,220
The fact that I made it to the finals makes me happy.

2426
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:09,420
I will work hard and do my best to create the best finale performance.

2427
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:13,730
I shall reveal the true reason why I'm here.
[The true reason why Master Kim Jae Hwan is here!]

2428
01:55:13,730 --> 01:55:14,980
Yes!
[We are curious!]

2429
01:55:14,980 --> 01:55:20,960
I'm here to deliver the final mission that you will be doing for the live broadcast of the finale.

2430
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,530
It's finally the last!

2431
01:55:22,530 --> 01:55:23,950
What's to come has come!

2432
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:25,520
Before I deliver the mission,

2433
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:30,090
I heard that the live broadcast of the finale will be taking place at an amazing place.

2434
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:31,710
Have you all heard?

2435
01:55:31,710 --> 01:55:32,930
Yes!

2436
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:38,170
We will reveal the final stage that you will be going on for the live broadcast!

2437
01:55:38,170 --> 01:55:40,400
- Really?
- I'm excited!

2438
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:41,980
What's that?

2439
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:46,650
[The concept video showcasing the set in Jamsil Indoor stadium, where the finals will take place]

2440
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:50,780
This is a place where successful idols hold their concerts.

2441
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:52,140
Wow, what's that?

2442
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:53,550
I got goosebumps.

2443
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:57,670
There's an extended stage, LED lights, and even a stage lift.

2444
01:55:57,670 --> 01:55:59,790
Wow!

2445
01:55:59,790 --> 01:56:03,010
Is that where the final rankings will be announced?

2446
01:56:03,010 --> 01:56:04,800
My only wish is to sit there.

2447
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,460
I'm getting goosebumps.

2448
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:08,800
Why do I feel like tearing up?

2449
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:11,160
I didn't know it would be that big.

2450
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:13,090
The scale of the set is huge.

2451
01:56:13,090 --> 01:56:17,210
I'm happy to be able to stand on a stage as wide as this.

2452
01:56:17,210 --> 01:56:20,060
I thought a lot about how we should really prepare well for the finals.

2453
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:23,950
There will be 7,000 Star Creators!

2454
01:56:23,950 --> 01:56:27,040
[The hall is a melting pot of emotions]

2455
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:31,980
I shall reveal the anticipated final mission that will be unveiled at the Jamsil Indoor Stadium.

2456
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:34,390
[Excitement]

2457
01:56:34,390 --> 01:56:36,900
The final mission is

2458
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:40,220
the 'Final TOP9 Battle'.

2459
01:56:40,220 --> 01:56:42,560
TOP9 Battle?

2460
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:46,670
The final battle divides all of you into two teams with 9 members each

2461
01:56:46,670 --> 01:56:51,670
to evaluate your potential to enter the debut team.

2462
01:56:51,670 --> 01:56:56,310
The number 9 represents the 9 members that will make it to the debut team.

2463
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:59,890
The harmony of the team members is extremely important.

2464
01:56:59,890 --> 01:57:04,110
You will be performing new songs for the final mission.

2465
01:57:04,110 --> 01:57:07,520
The final mission stage is like a preview of your debut stage.

2466
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:10,300
You're curious about what the songs are, right?

2467
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:12,070
Yes!

2468
01:57:12,070 --> 01:57:15,030
We're curious! Please reveal it quickly!

2469
01:57:15,030 --> 01:57:19,570
I've actually given you hints to the final mission songs.

2470
01:57:19,570 --> 01:57:21,570
[Master Kim Jae Hwan has already given hints?!]

2471
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:24,560
Did anyone realise?

2472
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:26,440
Ginseng Chicken Soup?

2473
01:57:28,030 --> 01:57:31,130
[Is the Ginseng Chicken Soup that everyone ate deliciously with much thought]

2474
01:57:31,650 --> 01:57:34,090
[the hint to the 'Final TOP9 Battle' mission song?]

2475
01:57:34,090 --> 01:57:35,660
Ginseng Chicken Soup!

2476
01:57:35,660 --> 01:57:37,790
What has Ginseng Chicken Soup got to do with this?

2477
01:57:37,790 --> 01:57:39,240
The jelly gummies and handheld fan?

2478
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:42,280
That's right, I think it should be the jelly and fan.

2479
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:44,440
It's jelly!
[Clue 1. Master Kim Jae Hwan prepared jelly for dessert]

2480
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:47,750
[Busy taking in sugar without any suspicions]

2481
01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:49,730
Handheld fan!
[Clue 2. A sudden gift of handheld fans in April, for heat relief]

2482
01:57:49,730 --> 01:57:51,520
Fan.

2483
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:58,100
The presents were hints to the titles of the songs!

2484
01:57:58,100 --> 01:58:00,030
Is the title really 'Ginseng Chicken Soup'?

2485
01:58:00,030 --> 01:58:02,330
[Oh gosh... Jun Hyeon...]

2486
01:58:02,330 --> 01:58:06,320
Let's reveal the first final mission song.

2487
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,800
[Super excited]

2488
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:10,950
It's "Jelly Pop".

2489
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:12,860
"Jelly Pop"!

2490
01:58:12,860 --> 01:58:14,240
Jelly jelly!

2491
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:16,030
The title sounds so cute.

2492
01:58:16,030 --> 01:58:21,980
"Jelly Pop"

2493
01:58:21,980 --> 01:58:23,940
Why is the song so good?

2494

[A killing part where the melody and lyrics stick right to your ears]

2495
01:58:29,870 --> 01:58:33,190
This is very casual and bubbly.

2496
01:58:33,190 --> 01:58:38,690
I thought that there were many killing parts in the song.

2497
01:58:38,690 --> 01:58:41,170
[Applause]

2498
01:58:41,170 --> 01:58:42,720
It's really good! Really good!

[Already shooting hearts at "Jelly Pop"]

2501
01:58:45,750 --> 01:58:47,820
The song sounds really sweet.

2502
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:51,930
As you've seen in the choreography video,

2503
01:58:51,930 --> 01:58:54,340
this is a song where the killing part really stands out.

2504
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:59,250
Who are the trainees who will be performing this song, and who will be doing the killing part?

2505
01:58:59,250 --> 01:59:00,550
We're looking forward to find out.

2506
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:03,670
Next, we have the second final mission song.

2507
01:59:03,670 --> 01:59:07,800
I think the handheld fans that I gifted all of you match perfectly.

2508
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:09,580
What could it be?

2509
01:59:09,580 --> 01:59:11,520
It's "Hot Summer".

2510
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:13,320
It sounds like it might be cute.

2511
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:15,500
I like it already.

2512
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:21,440
"Hot Summer"

2513
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:22,760
I'm going for this.

2514
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:24,410
This is it.

2515
01:59:24,410 --> 01:59:26,900
Wait a second!

2516
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:28,910

This song is mine.

2520
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:43,560
- It's really cool.
- I really want to do this song.

2521
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:45,400
I'm tempted to do the killing part.

2522
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:50,510
Anyone who's watching will know that the killing part is the climax of this song.

2523
01:59:50,510 --> 01:59:53,890
The person in-charge of the killing part for this song

2524
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:56,500
will get the special benefit of using the stage lift

2525
01:59:56,500 --> 02:00:01,790
or a solo scene that will be shown on the LED screen.

2526
02:00:01,790 --> 02:00:05,610
This is truly a good opportunity to make yourself stand out.

2527

About the stage lift,

2528
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:10,110
I was really shocked when I experienced it while performing the signal song.

2529
02:00:10,110 --> 02:00:14,680
I realised for the first time that I could experience such emotions

2530

so I'm craving to experience it again.

2531

I shall announce the method that we will be using to select the song that you would like to perform.

2532

The method is right on the ground!

2533

Written on the ground are the songs and parts of the final mission songs, which decide the members of the debut team.

2542

Wow.

Starting from the lowest ranking,

2544

please go forward and stand at the song and part that you would like to perform.

2545
02:01:04,740 --> 02:01:08,400
We will go by the sequence of your rankings.

2546
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:12,610
If the person is of a lower ranking, you can push him out of his chosen part.

This isn't real, right?

2548

Sorry?

2553

For real?

2554
02:01:30,350 --> 02:01:31,890
I'm scared.

2605
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:11,220
I think that I need to have at least a verse if I were to rap for a song.

02:11:46,700 --> 02:11:49,380
Besides me and Jong Woo hyung, all the other members are in the TOP9.

2761
02:11:49,380 --> 02:11:53,530
I think it's the strongest team that I've ever been in.

2762
02:11:53,530 --> 02:11:55,560
I think it's a perfect team.

2763
02:11:55,560 --> 02:11:58,830
How will we choose our leader?

2764
02:11:58,830 --> 02:12:02,170
[Who will be the leader of this perfect team?]

2765
02:12:02,170 --> 02:12:04,460
Raise your hand if you want to be the leader.

2766
02:12:05,420 --> 02:12:07,510
[The only nominee]

2767
02:12:07,510 --> 02:12:09,430
- Is there really no one else?
- I thought you were the leader.

2768
02:12:09,430 --> 02:12:10,800
It's already been decided.

2769
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:13,650
Jong Woo hyung has always been a good leader.

2770
02:12:13,650 --> 02:12:15,100
Let's go.

2771
02:12:15,100 --> 02:12:17,120
[Team "Home's" leader during the Dual Position Battle]

2772
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:18,240
- Let's win!
- Yes!

2773
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:21,190
[He was the leader of "Over Me" before the re-shuffling for the Artist Battle.]

2774
02:12:21,190 --> 02:12:24,300
The man who will lead our last performance is Yoon Jong Woo.

2775
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:26,610
[Team "Hot Summer's" leader is Yoon Jong Woo.]

2776
02:12:26,700 --> 02:12:32,500
I felt like Jong Woo hyung would be a firm leader who gives clear directions.

2777
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:35,900
All right, we must choose the killing part.

2778
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:38,480
Our Star Creators will be voting...

2779
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:45,130
The Star Creators will decide who will take the killing parts of our final mission.

2780
02:12:45,130 --> 02:12:47,300
I didn't expect this at all.

2781
02:12:47,300 --> 02:12:48,920
There are important steps who must complete,

2782
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:51,230
such as practicing our choreography.

2783
02:12:51,230 --> 02:12:55,390
So, I'm thinking of picking a temporary killing part.

2784
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:00,590
Raise your hands if you want the killing part.

2785
02:13:00,590 --> 02:13:03,450
[Han Yu Jin and Kim Gyu Vin raise their hands before he's even done talking.]

2786
02:13:03,450 --> 02:13:08,720
This may be the last time I perform for our Star Creators.

2787
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:10,900
So I want this part very much.

2788
02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:13,640
That's why I was the first to raise my hand.

2789
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:18,320
It's the final performance, so I'm very eager to take the killing part.

2790
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:20,520
Okay, everyone will try out for it.

2791
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:22,530
- This is how it should be!
- All right.

2792
02:13:23,730 --> 02:13:27,110
I always thought this whenever I got the killing part.

2793
02:13:27,110 --> 02:13:28,750
[Starting with "Here I Am," he's experienced taking on the killing part 3 times.]

2794
02:13:28,750 --> 02:13:31,120
If I'm able to finish the final performance well,

2795
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:35,540
I think I'll reach the goal that I've only been dreaming of.

2796
02:13:35,540 --> 02:13:37,910
That's why I feel more desperate about taking this one.

2797
02:13:37,910 --> 02:13:40,480
[Sung Han Bin is practicing the choreography to win the temporary killing part.]

2798
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:44,120
Han Bin hyung is good too,

2799
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:47,530
but "Hot Summer" is a very sexy song.

2800
02:13:47,530 --> 02:13:50,110
["Hot Summer" is a powerful song that describes a hot summer night.]

2801
02:13:50,110 --> 02:13:53,770
I think I can pull off this part very well.

2802
02:13:53,770 --> 02:13:55,570
So, I'm confident.

2803
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:04,120
[Kim Gyu Vin is watching Sung Han Bin and Han Yu Jin.]

2804
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:09,300
Yu Jin and Han Bin hyung has experience as the killing part.

2805
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:11,440
So I thought I would have a disadvantage,

2806
02:14:11,440 --> 02:14:13,990
since I've never been the killing part before.

2807
02:14:14,830 --> 02:14:16,560
[Kim Gyu Vin was always standing behind the killing part.]

2808
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:19,700
I really want to be the killing part this time.

2809
02:14:19,700 --> 02:14:23,350
It's our last performance and I'm confident I can do a better job.

2810
02:14:23,350 --> 02:14:25,660
I want the killing part no matter what.

2811
02:14:26,410 --> 02:14:30,510
[Who will be the temporary killing part for "Hot Summer?"]

2812
02:14:30,510 --> 02:14:32,280
Raise your hand if you'd like to go first.

2813
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:34,380
- Should I go first?
- Sure, sounds good.

2814
02:14:34,380 --> 02:14:36,310
I can't go after him.

2815
02:14:36,310 --> 02:14:38,640
[They become more nervous with a powerful nominee going first.]

2816
02:14:38,640 --> 02:14:40,970
[1st nominee: Sung Han Bin]

2817
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:47,330
Okay!

2818
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:50,030
[Next up is Han Yu Jin]

2819
02:14:54,130 --> 02:14:56,610
- He's good.
- He's amazing.

2820
02:14:56,610 --> 02:14:59,770
- Yu Jin, you improved so much.
- You improved a ton.

2821
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:05,280
[All the trainees try out for the killing part.]

2822
02:15:05,980 --> 02:15:07,670
Okay!

2823
02:15:07,670 --> 02:15:09,080
Our last nominee, Gyu Vin!

2824
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:10,580
He's our last nominee.

2825
02:15:10,580 --> 02:15:11,990
Gosh, he's tall.

2826
02:15:11,990 --> 02:15:13,230
I'm jealous.

2827
02:15:13,230 --> 02:15:14,800
Fighting!

2828
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:16,080
[How will Kim Gyu Vin interpret the killing part with his tall physique?]

2829
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,700
Why is everyone so good?

2830
02:15:27,700 --> 02:15:28,930
Seriously, everyone is good.

2831
02:15:28,930 --> 02:15:30,280
The future is bright for our team.

2832
02:15:31,930 --> 02:15:36,410
- First of all, I can't move on without praising Yu Jin.
- Right, he's a fantastic dancer.

2833
02:15:36,410 --> 02:15:39,570
- It suits him so well.
- I always knew you were a good dancer.

2834
02:15:39,570 --> 02:15:41,490
But you've gained so much confidence.

2835
02:15:41,490 --> 02:15:44,260
I think I gained a lot of confidence during "Say My Name."

2836
02:15:44,260 --> 02:15:46,370
["Say My Name" Hyung feels proud.]

2837
02:15:47,270 --> 02:15:50,750
Personally, I think Yu Jin is a fantastic dancer.

2838
02:15:50,750 --> 02:15:55,090
Despite his young age, he interpreted the song very well.

2839
02:15:55,090 --> 02:15:57,140
So I think the part would suit him well.

2840
02:15:57,140 --> 02:16:01,090
Let's vote for our temporary killing part.

2841
02:16:01,090 --> 02:16:03,310
In 2, 3.

2842
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:06,780
Gyu Vin, Han Bin, and Yu Jin.

2843
02:16:06,780 --> 02:16:11,200
Then lets have the three of them dance together.

2844
02:16:11,200 --> 02:16:12,470
Together?

2845
02:16:12,470 --> 02:16:15,200
- Let's pick whoever does better.
- This is fun.

2846
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:17,630
Let's pick the trainee that shines brighter.

2847
02:16:17,630 --> 02:16:18,850
It's a new rule.

2848
02:16:18,850 --> 02:16:21,840
I really wanted it.

2849
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:26,450
I think it's doable if I accentuate my tall and long limbs.

2850
02:16:26,450 --> 02:16:29,390
I'm very eager to take the killing part this time.

2851
02:16:29,390 --> 02:16:31,320
They're both great,

2852
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:33,690
but I'm confident too.

2853
02:16:33,690 --> 02:16:36,490
- Ready?
- Yes.

2854
02:16:37,640 --> 02:16:40,390
[Let's do our best.]

2855
02:16:42,370 --> 02:16:43,560
[The 3 kickstart the competition for the killing part.]

2856

[The 3 trainees perform powerfully.]

2857
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:53,010
This is so hard. How can we choose?

2858
02:16:53,010 --> 02:16:55,000
The nominees are all so talented.

2859
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:58,090
The killing part for Team "Hot Summer" is...

2860
02:16:58,090 --> 02:16:59,250
[Will it be Kim Gyu Vin with his impressive physique and ability to express things?]

2861
02:16:59,250 --> 02:17:00,870
[Or Sung Han Bin who dances precisely?]

2862
02:17:00,870 --> 02:17:02,270
[Or Han Yu Jin who gave a powerful performance?]

2863
02:17:02,270 --> 02:17:03,910
Congratulations, Sung Han Bin.

2864
02:17:03,910 --> 02:17:05,870
[Sung Han Bin has been chosen as the temporary killing part.]

2865
02:17:05,870 --> 02:17:07,430
Thank you.

2866
02:17:08,010 --> 02:17:09,840
I'll do my best!

2867
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:12,830
Raise your hand if you think Han Bin suits the killing part.

2868
02:17:12,830 --> 02:17:14,440
[Sung Han Bin got 4 votes out of 6.]

2869
02:17:14,440 --> 02:17:16,900
You should change your name to Sung Killing at this point.

2870
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:17,950
[Laughing]

2871
02:17:17,950 --> 02:17:20,490
Change my name to Sung Killing?

2872
02:17:20,490 --> 02:17:24,430
I hope the part won't be taken from me, so I can deliver a great performance for our last mission.

2873
02:17:24,430 --> 02:17:25,820
Thank you!

2874
02:17:26,550 --> 02:17:28,960
[He's more determined than ever.]

2875
02:17:30,020 --> 02:17:31,800
It was a shame,

2876
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:34,390
but it's only temporary.

2877
02:17:34,390 --> 02:17:40,290
I'm going to give everything I've got and move the Star Creators' hearts.

2878
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:47,200
I don't think I was ever fully invested in everything like this before.

2879
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:52,660
I hope I'll be standing as the killing part for our final performance.

2880
02:17:53,250 --> 02:17:55,820
[Who will the Star Creators choose as "Hot Summer's" final killing part?]

2881
02:17:56,820 --> 02:17:59,080
I want this killing part, no matter what, Yu Jin.

2882
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:00,870
I want it so much.

2883
02:18:00,870 --> 02:18:02,360
Everyone wants it.

2884
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:04,400
This is something that

2885
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:06,680
nobody will yield to anyone.

2886
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:08,090
I should bow.

2887
02:18:08,090 --> 02:18:11,790
[Team "Jelly Pop" is also preparing for the final mission.]

2888
02:18:11,790 --> 02:18:14,580
[Lee Hoe Taek, Yoo Seung Eon, Zhang Hao, Park Gun Wook, Kum Jun Hyeon, Park Han Bin, Na Kamden, Jay, Seok Matthew]

2889
02:18:14,580 --> 02:18:15,830
Everyone...

2890
02:18:15,830 --> 02:18:18,560
- Hyung!
- Yes?

2891
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:21,400
- I'm going to lead!
- Okay, sure. Go ahead.

2892
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:26,890
Will anyone like to try out for the role of "Jelly Pop's" leader?

2893
02:18:27,980 --> 02:18:29,500
[Let there be no one, please.]

2894
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:30,800
Me!

2895
02:18:32,130 --> 02:18:35,090
- Matthew hyung?
- I'd like to volunteer.

2896
02:18:35,090 --> 02:18:36,620
[People are trying out as expected]

2897
02:18:36,620 --> 02:18:38,390
Hoe Taek hyung, are you not going to try?

2898
02:18:38,390 --> 02:18:39,780
[His eyes have never looked so desperate.]

2899
02:18:40,790 --> 02:18:43,270
I would like to try out for it too.

2900
02:18:43,270 --> 02:18:45,840
- Gosh, seriously?
- Why, what is it?

2901
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:49,930
I think I have an energy that draws people's attention when I speak.

2902
02:18:49,930 --> 02:18:51,360
[Trainee Kum Jun Hyeon was especially wild.]

2903
02:18:52,250 --> 02:18:54,290
[No energy has shined brighter than his in all of history.]

2904
02:18:54,290 --> 02:18:56,000
[He grabs attention with his unmatched presence.]

2905
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:01,040
I really wanted to be the leader this time and make a great performance.

2906
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:03,560
- Let's say a word each.
- Appeal to the voters.

2907
02:19:03,560 --> 02:19:05,790
I have a pledge!

2908
02:19:05,790 --> 02:19:08,890
If I become the leader,

2909
02:19:08,890 --> 02:19:11,050
I'll wake up an hour before we have to come in to practice.

2910
02:19:11,050 --> 02:19:13,140
How would that benefit us?

2911
02:19:13,140 --> 02:19:14,990
I'll wake you guys up.

2912
02:19:14,990 --> 02:19:16,600
That's all.

2913
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:20,260
Nobody has pledged anything except for me.

2914
02:19:20,260 --> 02:19:22,590
If I become the leader,

2915
02:19:24,110 --> 02:19:25,910
I have a lot of snacks.

2916
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:28,440
This is a strong one.

2917
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:30,190
How much snacks will you give us?

2918
02:19:30,190 --> 02:19:31,310
I don't need to eat any.

2919
02:19:31,310 --> 02:19:32,560
[Tempting]

2920
02:19:32,560 --> 02:19:33,930
[Do I need to give up this leader sticker?]

2921
02:19:33,930 --> 02:19:36,530
If you ask me to do your laundry or get your food, I'll gladly do it.

2922
02:19:36,530 --> 02:19:38,510
Aigo!

2923
02:19:38,510 --> 02:19:39,720
That was a mistake.

2924
02:19:39,720 --> 02:19:43,140
I can give you individual dance lessons.

2925
02:19:43,140 --> 02:19:46,360
We need to record the song first, right?

2926
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:51,930
I'll stick right by your side until we get the perfect version.

2927
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:56,100
- This is strong.
- But he's nice, so he'd do that whether he's the leader or not.

2928
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:02,950
- Shall we pick the leader?
- If you want trainee Kum Jun Hyeon to be the leader,

2929
02:20:02,950 --> 02:20:04,410
please raise your hand.

2930
02:20:04,410 --> 02:20:06,820
- Okay.
- I hear ruffling noises.

2931
02:20:06,820 --> 02:20:08,020
Please lower your hand.

2932
02:20:08,020 --> 02:20:09,700
You could be the leader.

2933
02:20:09,700 --> 02:20:12,330
- It's possible.
- I'm serious.

2934
02:20:12,330 --> 02:20:14,280
I'll reveal the result.

2935
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:16,890
- This trainee has...
- Yes, what about him?

2936
02:20:18,040 --> 02:20:20,310
never been...

2937
02:20:20,310 --> 02:20:22,140
the killing part.

2938
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:23,260
[Exclaiming]

2939
02:20:23,260 --> 02:20:27,260
- Jun Hyeon, you've never been the killing part?
- Never.

2940
02:20:27,260 --> 02:20:34,330
The trainee who'll be our leader has performed "En Garde" before.

2941
02:20:34,330 --> 02:20:35,760
[Okay, it's all going to plan!]

2942
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:38,720
All right, I'll reveal the result.

2943
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:41,510
Trainee Kum Jun Hyeon is...

2944
02:20:41,510 --> 02:20:45,280
not our leader. It's trainee Lee Hoe Taek.

2945
02:20:46,990 --> 02:20:49,470
I'm going to fight with someone during our practice.

2946
02:20:49,470 --> 02:20:52,440
Thank you!

2947
02:20:52,440 --> 02:20:56,750
I felt like I was someone that the younger trainees could trust.

2948
02:20:56,750 --> 02:21:03,960
I want to do better by sharing positive energy to my members.

2949
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:05,490
[After Team "Jelly Pop" decided their leader]

2950
02:21:05,490 --> 02:21:09,700
We need to choose our temporary killing part to practice.

2951
02:21:09,700 --> 02:21:11,550
Do we have any volunteers?

2952
02:21:12,450 --> 02:21:13,670
[He volunteers for the killing part too.]

2953
02:21:13,670 --> 02:21:15,280
[More people volunteer for it]

2954
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:17,210
The sub rapper only has six seconds.

2955
02:21:17,210 --> 02:21:20,190
The killing part has 38, which is a lot.

2956
02:21:20,190 --> 02:21:23,500
So I wanted the killing part.

2957
02:21:23,500 --> 02:21:25,150
I'm sub-vocalist five.

2958
02:21:25,150 --> 02:21:26,830
My part is quite small.

2959
02:21:26,830 --> 02:21:30,320
Which is why I really want the killing part.

2960
02:21:30,320 --> 02:21:31,960
It's our last performance.

2961
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:35,960
- I'll try out for it too.
- Okay, we'll all try out for it.

2962
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:39,100
I've never been the killing part so far.

2963
02:21:39,100 --> 02:21:40,950
This is our final performance.

2964
02:21:40,950 --> 02:21:44,570
So I wanted to try the killing part even if it's only temporary.

2965
02:21:44,570 --> 02:21:47,810
- Shall we perform chorus one for the killing part tryout?
- Okay.

2966
02:21:47,810 --> 02:21:49,210
I think we'll get the choreography down after watching it 3 or 4 times.

2967
02:21:49,210 --> 02:21:51,050
- Shall we make it quick then?
- Okay.

2968
02:21:51,050 --> 02:21:56,990
[The members of "Jelly Pop" will perform chorus 1.]

2969
02:21:58,460 --> 02:22:00,290
Gosh, my hips are going to dislocate.

2970
02:22:00,290 --> 02:22:03,890
[The team is taken aback by the hard and fast choreography.]

2971
02:22:03,890 --> 02:22:06,230
We can't even dance this move?

2972
02:22:07,250 --> 02:22:08,340
[What?]

2973
02:22:08,340 --> 02:22:10,580
This is really difficult.

2974
02:22:13,210 --> 02:22:16,210
I don't know why Matthew chose sub-vocalist 1,

2975
02:22:16,210 --> 02:22:19,430
when there was sub-vocalist 2.

2976
02:22:19,430 --> 02:22:22,100
I felt pretty horrible at that time.

2977
02:22:22,100 --> 02:22:27,070
I figured I'll do my best and practice for the killing part, even though it's temporary.

2978
02:22:29,780 --> 02:22:31,640
[The battle for the killing part will be a close one.]

2979
02:22:31,640 --> 02:22:35,410
[Who will take the temporary killing part for "Jelly Pop?"]

2980
02:22:35,410 --> 02:22:36,450
Who should go first?

2981
02:22:36,450 --> 02:22:38,870
- Our leader!
- Okay!

2982
02:22:38,870 --> 02:22:40,950
[1st nominee: Lee Hoe Taek]

2983
02:22:44,950 --> 02:22:46,720
[2nd nominee: Park Han Bin]

2984
02:22:54,660 --> 02:22:56,540
- He's good.
- He is.

2985
02:22:56,600 --> 02:23:05,200
[The other trainees try out for the killing part.]

2986
02:23:05,240 --> 02:23:08,660
- Lastly, we have Matthew.
- Matthew Seok!

02:23:08,660 --> 02:23:10,840
In 5, 6, 7, 8.

2988
02:23:18,280 --> 02:23:20,020
[We must acknowledge his cuteness.]

2989
02:23:20,020 --> 02:23:22,760
- We're all done.
- Shall we vote?

2990
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:25,270
I vote for Park Han Bin!

2991
02:23:25,270 --> 02:23:28,740
I also think Han Bin hyung will suit the part.

2992
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:32,150
I personally liked Matthew's bright smile.

2993
02:23:32,150 --> 02:23:34,230
Personally, I liked Jun Hyeon.

2994
02:23:34,230 --> 02:23:35,370
I also vote for Jun Hyeon.

2998

- No, I'm not.
- It sounded like something broke.

3004

I'm just thinking.

3005
02:23:53,470 --> 02:23:55,680
I'll vote for Han Bin hyung.

3006

I vote for Matthew hyung.

3007
02:23:57,740 --> 02:24:01,250
- Because he has such a pretty smile.
- You're both tied with three votes each.

Matthew suits the song so well.

3017
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:30,710
It felt like he was the main character of the song.

- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

I had a lot of worries such as, "Am I not good enough?"

3023

So I'm determined to show my talent to our Star Creators this time.
