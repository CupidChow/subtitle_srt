00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,240
[Dream performance]

182
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,540
[Thank you! We enjoyed it!]

183
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,680
It feels new somehow.

184
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,760
The first case is "Dream performance" as you saw.

185
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,330
A lot of trainees must dream of debuting,

186
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,200
but they must desire to be on stage while preparing for it.

187
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,940
We just watched the BOYS PLANET performances that helped them living their dreams.

188
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,920
Gun Wook reacted a lot watching the performances.

189
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,120
What did you think?

190
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:33,890
Whenever I watch the footage, I get reminded of the atmosphere at the time.

191
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,830
I felt emotional and I also...

192
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,260
couldn't believe I'm that person.

193
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,430
[Agreeing]

194
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,330
How does it feel to watch the performances back to back like this?

195
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,270
There must be parts you haven't seen on screen before.

196
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:53,460
I thought time goes by so quickly.

197
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,150
It feels like it was yesterday when we did those performances.

198
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,970
But it was actually just a few days ago.

199
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,090
He's right.

200
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,980
[So funny]

201
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,970
The first time you were on stage must've been very special.

202
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,420
Which performance do you find the most memorable?

203
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,140
You gave so many performances since when we first met and until the finale.

204
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:23,040
I think it's "Say My Name."

205
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,520
Is it because that was the biggest hit on the chart?

206
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,010
No, no! It's not like that!

207
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,310
It's kind of true.

208
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,860
Was that the reason?

209
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,110
Why do you find "Say My Name" the most memorable?

210
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,770
All the members were able to have fun giving that performance.

211
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,760
We actually had fun instead of acting.

212
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,480
And I could tell the fans were having fun with us, too.

213
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,900
You felt you became one with the fans.

214
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,270
Yes, that was great.

215
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,880
How about Ji Woong, who performed "Say My Name" together? Which one do you find the most memorable?

216
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,960
When we practiced "Say My Name,"

217
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,650
the muscles on my face hurt so much.

218
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,400
Because you had to make cute faces? Can you give me an example?

219
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,120
Which face was the hardest?

220
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,520
Just...

221
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,110
Just this one.

222
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,310
[As lively as a taxidermy]

223
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,880
- It's like a taxidermy version of yourself.
- Yes, yes.

224
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,400
But I was actually able to smile on stage.

225
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,150
I ran into him in the hallway after the performance.

226
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,020
Ji Woong asked me, "Teacher, was I okay?"

227
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,220
So I told him, "You were like a trainee teacher!"

228
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,060
That really hurt my feeling.

229
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,540
Trainee teacher?

230
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,090
How about Hao? Which one do you find the most memorable?

231
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,930
It's the final performance, "Jelly Pop" for me.

232
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,520
"Jelly Pop."

233
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,930
You did the Killing Part, too, right?

234
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,000
That's correct.

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,060
We didn't choose who'd do the Killing Part on our own.

236
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,430
The Star Creators gave it to me as a present.

237
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:59,750
It felt more precious and I wanted to perfect it. That's why I find it more memorable.

238
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:05,360
[Let's watch the Killing Part]

239
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,780
I have a question for Tae Rae.

240
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,440
- You gave so many performances.
- Yes.

241
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,330
Which one was a dream performance for you?

242
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,360
My dream performance.

243
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,880
I think I know.

244
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,260
I think I could guess, too.

245
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,250
There's a performance that comes to mind immediately.

246
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,320
There's only one.

247
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,790
It's my dream to sing while looking at the fans' sparkling eyes

248
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,560
instead of looking at the camera.

249
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,550
I was able to do that in...

250
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,250
"Man In Love."

251
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,620
That's right!

252
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,990
Kim Tae Rae's all-time legendary performance.

253
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,030
"Tae Rae hyung must be crazy."

254
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,150
He sang that so amazingly then.

255
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,130
- You're right.
- You were so great.

256
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,920
Can we hear a little bit of it?

257
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,450
[Looking forward]

258
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:54,560
[Lyrics: Take a good look. I must have fell for you since I feel this way.]

259
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,560
[Premium vocal]

260
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,570
Tae Rae hyung must be crazy.

261
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,940
He must be crazy!

262
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,430
He must be crazy.

263
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,400
There must've been other trainees' performances you wanted for yourself.

264
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,030
Is there one you really wanted but didn't get to?

265
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,650
[Looks like he really wanted to say this]

266
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,610
I really wanted to mention this.

267
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,450
I really wanted to do "Love Killa" so badly.

268
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,130
Really?

269
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,960
So what happened? Did you apply but didn't get it?

270
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:31,700
It's not that. I had to make a decision of a lifetime between "Tomboy" and "Love Killa."

271
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,000
You only lived for 19 years. That was a decision of a lifetime?

272
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,840
- You'd have many more decisions.
- That was the biggest headache.

273
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,470
I'm a huge fan of MONSTA X.

274
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,910
I really wanted to try performing "Love Killa,"

275
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,700
but I was satisfied since they did such a good job.

276
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:55,250
Could we see you doing the main dance move for "Love Killa"?

277
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,180
Yes, I can do it.

278
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,810
[Everyone is focused]

279
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,040
[Energetic 19-year-old's amazing dance move]

280
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,320
[Wow, he's good]

281
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,190
Hey, hey, hey!

282
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,140
That's enough! That's enough!

283
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,660
Sit down.

284
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,600
He's not an adult yet!

285
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,390
Please warn me if you'll be moving your hips a lot.

286
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,650
Ricky also raised his hand because he wanted to mention a performance, too.

287
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,010
I wanted to do "Love Killa" so badly, too.

288
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,680
The one who booted him off is right there!

289
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,170
My dear Ji Woong hyung!

290
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,320
I'm the one who booted him off.

291
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,170
I see.

292
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,390
Can we just see a snippet?

293
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,630
This part.

294
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,820
Yes, that one.

295
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,460
[Ricky got to achieve his dream, too]

296
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,940
Whose part was that?

297
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,450
It was Matthew's.

298
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,840
[Mine]

299
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,350
I'm so excited for ZEROBASEONE's album.

300
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:59,040
I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of masterpieces they come up with.

301
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,660
There's a second video clip waiting for us.

302
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,830
Let's watch it on the screen right now!

303
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,010
Let's watch it!

304
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,680
Let's watch it.

305
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,990
Which clip will it be?

306
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,920
[Curious]

307
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,570
It must be from the finale.

308
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,920
Finale. The elimination was so...

309
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,310
I think it's about these members.

310
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,320
- Ji Woong hyung!
- He's so handsome.

311
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,460
I was nervous.

312
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,010
Kim Ji Woong!

313
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,820
[Applause]

314
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,820
Wow, how did you feel then, Ji Woong?

315
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,670
- It was so thrilling.
- Seriously.

316
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,020
Thank you so much, everyone.

317
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,150
I'm ZEROBASEONE's...

318
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,970
first, Kim Ji Woong.

319
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,320
[Embarrassed]

320
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,960
First Kim Ji Woong?

321
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,130
Is there a second Kim Ji Woong, too?

322
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,640
So funny.

323
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,010
[7th place]

324
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,810
- 7th place!
- Lucky seven.

325
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,180
Didn't I tell you to get ready to go out then?

326
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,630
Yes, you did.

327
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,650
It's Kim Gyu Vin!

328
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,460
Why did you faint all of a sudden?

329
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,600
My goodness.

330
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,660
I heard that's When Gyu Vin started crying

331
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,080
and he stopped just last night.

332
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,660
His eyes are still puffy.

333
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,960
I know!

334
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,540
- Why is your nose so red?
- Last night?

335
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,120
The ones who supported me a lot were Hoe Taek,

336
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,250
Han Bin, Ji Woong...

337
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,350
You should feel bad for this.

338
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:44,520
WIthout them, I couldn't have come this far. That's how supportive they were.

339
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,010
- Thank you so much.
- You cried!

340
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,110
Since Gyu Vin started crying,

341
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,450
everyone else started crying, too.

342
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,940
We did.

343
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:00,590
- I actually prepared my...
- Sentence.

344
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:04,860
I'm sorry, but you did everything while still crying.

345
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,080
- He finished until the end.
- He's a pro, a pro!

346
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,100
He even said, "Sorry, I forgot." I remember.

347
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,890
Was "Sorry, I forgot" on the script, too?

348
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,930
That was also planned.

349
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,720
- 6th place!
- This trainee realized his dream of debuting

350
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,290
by ending up in 6th place.

351
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,040
It's Kim Tae Rae!

352
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,410
What's with my face?

353
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,880
Please keep walking with me...

354
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,280
Tae Rae always prepares his speeches well.

355
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,170
I didn't prepare it.

356
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,640
Really? That means you've been thinking about those things.

357
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,500
Right?

358
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,650
Troublemaker Tae Rae debuted.

359
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,100
This is like a radio show!

360
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,310
What's with the sweet tone?

361
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,730
You're driving me crazy.

362
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,290
"Troublemaker Tae Rae debuted."

363
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,810
I haven't heard the word, "troublemaker" in a while.

364
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,270
Me, neither.

365
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,860
Here's the 5th place trainee who will join ZEROBASEONE.

366
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,780
It's Park Gun Wook!

367
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,540
He was so shocked!

368
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,420
[Left the seat]

369
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,340
[Came back]

370
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,840
I really want to cry right now...

371
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,590
I could feel how happy you were. Seriously!

372
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,960
That's an authentic reaction.

373
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,180
I didn't prepare anything. Seriously.

374
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:22,740
"En Garde" members, Hwan Hee hyung, "Kill This Love" team, "Tomboy" team...

375
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,490
And why did Kim Gyu Vin not mention me in his speech?

376
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,900
I'm curious what position you'd get when you debut.

377
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,080
He's just ignoring him!

378
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,740
I liked how genuine his reaction was.

379
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,480
That was so authentic.

380
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,210
I'll announce the 4th place trainee.

381
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,170
He was giving up.

382
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,340
- I was giving up.
- It's Ricky!

383
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,870
How did you feel then?

384
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,130
[Ricky 1, Ricky 2]

385
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,630
Ricky, how did you feel then?

386
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,150
I couldn't believe it.

387
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,790
You couldn't believe it, right?

388
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,460
I was waiting to be called for 9th place.

389
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,600
I see.

390
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,220
I feel peachy.

391
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,180
"I feel peachy."

392
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,850
Is that it?

393
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,450
Yes.

394
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,850
[Dizzy]

395
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,540
You were out of it then, right?

396
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,510
- You were totally out of it.
- Yes.

397
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,680
[Cute]

398
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,510
I'll announce the 3rd place trainee of the final Top 9.

399
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,070
[It's him]

400
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,690
- Matthew.
- Gosh!

401
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,480
It's Seok Matthew!

402
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,530
I was so nervous then.

403
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,030
I was thinking about my future.

404
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,770
I was wondering if I should go back to Canada or start a part-time job.

405
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,610
- But I was...
- Go back to Canada?

406
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,930
Mom.

407
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,830
You came all the way to Korea because you trusted me.

408
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,940
My gosh.

409
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,330
Did they come from Canada?

410
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,140
- Your mother and sister?
- Yes.

411
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,420
I love you so much, Mom. I missed you.

412
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,260
Wow, this moment...

413
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,900
- It's an amazing moment.
- Everyone knew, but...

414
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,950
- we were still curious.
- Who could it be?

415
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,050
- The whole world was excited.
- We wondered if something could change.

416
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,870
I love this scene with the two of you. Although it's familiar.

417
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,480
The person is...

418
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,400
[We never get sick of seeing these two in this scene]

419
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,350
Zhang Hao!

420
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,370
I skipped dinner before this.

421
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,480
Thankfully, my face looked good.

422
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,010
He's a total pro!

423
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,890
He worried about his face getting puffy even then.

424
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,970
How did you feel then?

425
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,400
Teacher!

426
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,700
[Addicted]

427
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,210
I cried a lot then.

428
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,140
- I sincerely thank you.
- In how many languages did he give the speech then?

429
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,410
Four languages.

430
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,930
He's a genius.

431
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,770
I felt so bad for Min Hyun sunbaenim.

432
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,900
- Because you took so long?
- Yes, I took so long.

433
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,920
I will give you happiness...

434
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:15,130
- Isn't it so cute how the tie is dangling on his sleeves?
- What happened to your tie?

435
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,600
Even the tie got so excited.

436
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,870
I'm still giving my speech.

437
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:24,240
I sincerely thank all the Star Creators who joined us here.

438
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,200
He's such a good speaker.

439
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,390
- Being here right now is so...
- This is like a student president election speech.

440
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,060
It's such a proper speech.

441
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,990
All in. I bet everything I have.

442
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,170
Wow!

443
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:44,490
When you said, "all in," I thought you'd continue in English.

444
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,810
Right, right.

445
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,150
You only prepared the "all in" part.

446
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,600
I worked hard on that part.

447
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,080
I'll announce the trainee in the 9th place, the last chosen one.

448
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,440
- Who was in 9th place?
- Who was it?

449
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,660
- Who was it?
- Who was it?

450
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,580
I don't remember.

451
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,440
- I still get chills.
- Han Yu Jin!

452
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,350
He did popping.

453
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,640
You cried so much!

454
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,790
Were you shocked?

455
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,490
Seriously...

456
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,900
Thank you so much, Star Creators!

457
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,650
- Legend.
- Do I make you proud as a son?

458
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,750
[Hiding his face]

459
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,540
I'm sorry, what did you say, exactly?

460
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,280
I said, "Do I make you proud as a son?"

461
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,020
[Top 9]

462
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,990
- This is so touching.
- I'm tearing up.

463
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:44,450
The second keyword is "Top 9."

464
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:50,590
The moment the Top 9 was announced, we laughed and cried together.

465
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:55,120
There's apparently a rumor circulating among the fans.

466
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,260
They say the entire members took calming supplement together.

467
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,100
Really? Really? All of you?

468
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,070
[What's the truth?]

469
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,810
- Did you all take it? No?
- They wondered if you had a reaction against it.

470
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,800
- You didn't?
- No, we didn't.

471
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,960
No one did?

472
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,830
But we can't just conclude that. Did anyone take it behind everyone's back?

473
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,420
Ricky, you took it!

474
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,860
Ricky took it!

475
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,280
- I always...
- What did you take?

476
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,250
I just had a lot of chocolate bars.

477
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,760
Chocolate bars?

478
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,940
Since I was trying to force myself to calm down,

479
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:37,440
my tongue was getting twisted like this.

480
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,860
Tae Rae also said something

481
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,210
that made me stand up.

482
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,970
"Mom, Dad, and Noona,

483
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,400
Troublemaker Tae Rae debuted!"

484
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,510
I needed to thank my parents.

485
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,630
But I thought I should keep it light.

486
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,420
I wanted to say something like, "I debuted!"

487
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,260
But the word "troublemaker" somehow came out automatically.

488
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,000
What was your MBTI result, Tae Rae?

489
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,180
I did it a long time ago. It was ENTJ.

490
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,190
Yours is the same as mine!

491
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,080
- Really?
- You'll become successful.

492
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,640
One of the fans said,

493
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,100
"Tae Rae is so "T" even when he gives a speech. He's so cool."

494
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,980
Hold on, who has "T" in their MBTI results?

495
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,940
- I'm the only one.
- Really?

496
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,200
- Are you all Fs?
- Yes.

497
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,070
- I'm in trouble.
- How unusual.

498
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:33,810
Another fan said, "Kim Tae Rae is the only T among seven Fs.

499
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:37,040
And Zhang Hao is the only I among seven Es."

500
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,710
- Hao is an I?
- I'm an I.

501
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,000
Really?

502
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,660
Are you all Es?

503
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,850
Your camp must be so loud.

504
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:48,490
This comment below is so funny. "Ricky doesn't know what MBTI is."

505
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,480
- Do you not know?
- That's perfect.

506
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,690
That's it! That's perfect, too!

507
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,890
R.I.C.H. Rich.

508
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,380
RICH?

509
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,050
Yes, it was RICH.

510
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:03,340
We could tell Park Gun Wook was genuinely shocked during the result announcement.

511
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,750
"It's so funny thinking about how Gun Wook mentioned

512
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,980
that Gyu Vin didn't mention him in his speech."

513
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,600
The conflict deepened starting with the third elimination.

514
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,530
It deepened!

515
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,750
That's serious!

516
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,210
We did "En Garde" together.

517
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,980
But he didn't mention me in the speech, and he didn't even make eye contact coming up.

518
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,000
When did I do that?

519
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,720
[Daebak]

520
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,240
I said, "Come on up!"

521
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,660
Without even making eye contact, he went, "Hoe Taek hyung!"

522
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,570
[Audience]

523
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,080
You must've been so disappointed.

524
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,760
It's because of the Killing Part!

525
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,740
[Excited]

526
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,610
[My gosh]

527
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,300
There was beef behind "En Garde."

528
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,490
Let set this aside for a second and ask you honestly.

529
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,940
Are you two getting along right now?

530
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,570
We're fine!

531
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,800
Stop saying weird stuff!

532
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,260
We're really okay.

533
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,410
You must've been so disappointed.

534
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,970
That's enough!

535
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,450
Enough is enough!

536
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:04,690
Everyone must've felt the same way when they heard Ricky's speech.

537
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,110
Who taught you the sentence, "I feel peachy?"

538
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,460
When "New Thing" was really popular,

539
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,480
saying "peachy" after "I feel" stuck with me.

540
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,890
It's like how we learned English sentences.

541
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,770
Whenever I think of "I feel," I think of "peachy."

542
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,610
If you watched that performance a lot, you must now the dance moves, too.

543
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,490
Can you show off your swag?

544
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,250
Yoo Jin knows the dance moves, too.

545
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,170
Let's do it!

546
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,590
[Getting started immediately]

547
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,670
They're synchronized!

548
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,040
[They're totally synchronized as if they practiced together]

549
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,350
[Even the finish is perfect]

550
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,120
What's the deal?

551
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,110
They were in sync, even!

552
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,330
That was great.

553
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,350
They can perform just like that.

554
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,180
It's Zhang Hao's turn now.

555
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,960
Let's read the comments first.

556
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,820
"He's a true idol for preparing the speech in four languages knowing he'd debut one day."

557
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,540
I'm curious about this one!

558
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,390
Let's do a bit of a fact check.

559
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,380
I was really curious, too.

560
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,870
You definitely said you didn't prepare a speech.

561
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:33,540
But you spoke in four languages so naturally.

562
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,080
What happened?

563
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,990
I actually prepared a speech for getting eliminated, too.

564
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,110
- For the elimination?
- I memorized everything.

565
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,120
I wrote everything down in one piece of paper.

566
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,900
I memorized everything while waiting.

567
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,450
Are you normally that prepared for everything?

568
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:53,520
When I get too excited on set,

569
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,820
I can't talk when I'm on the stage.

570
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,380
Since I'm not a native, once I forget,

571
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,220
my mind goes blank.

572
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:07,390
There's another AI in the idol world along with Zhang Hao.

573
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,580
It's Sung Han Bin.

574
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,910
You represent all the AIs.

575
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:14,280
Your speech was so exemplary, too.

576
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,520
Let's read the comments.

577
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,040
"I wonder if they showed the speech on the prompter just for Sung Han Bin.

578
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,110
He speaks so well. He seems like a great person."

579
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:25,840
Sung Han Bin is facing the prompter rumor.

580
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,020
Whenever I prepare a performance,

581
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,500
I think of the Star Creators.

582
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,520
I think I was able to do that because I really meant it.

583
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,820
Even that answer is so exemplary.

584
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,070
- He looked it up just now.
- How do you talk like that?

585
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,520
That's what I'm saying!

586
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,380
By the way, he messed up once.

587
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,760
When? When?

588
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,950
It was during the second elimination. Was it the second one?

589
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:51,040
- The third one.
- The third one!

590
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,930
He tried to speak in English,

591
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,280
but he ended up creating a legendary moment.

592
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,950
- Really?
- It wasn't on TV.

593
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:04,960
For two weeks, I practiced the moment I wake up. Like, "Dear Star Creators..."

594
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,260
- But I ended up totally forgetting the speech.
- So what did you say?

595
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,970
"Dear Star Creators from all over the world,

596
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,750
first of all, I appreciate..." and I got stuck.

597
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,140
- I appreciate... I appreciate...
- He said that four times.

598
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,710
[He kept saying he appreciates]

599
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,020
I appreciate...

600
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,530
And I went, "I'm sorry."

601
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,500
I think my mind went blank.

602
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,330
I don't think anyone was as nervous as this person.

603
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:36,040
It was Han Yoo Jin, who was called last.

604
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,450
Let's read the comments regarding Yoo Jin.

605
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:44,930
"Han Yoo Jin sounded like a protagonist in a web novel. I lost it because it sounded like an epilogue."

606
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,080
What was it?

607
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,050
"Did I make you proud as your son?"

608
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:56,520
"Mom, Dad, and my sister. Did I make you proud as your son?"

609
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,740
That was...

610
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,050
I thought I was talking while crying at normal speed.

611
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:07,090
But it sounded slow, so I thought it was because of the mic resonated the sound.

612
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:10,520
But I was talking slowly.

613
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,970
Let's finish our conversation regarding the speech.

614
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,750
We're all done loosening up from all the talking, right?

615
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,260
- Yes!
- We became more natural now.

616
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,440
Let's star the second chapter now.

617
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,430
It's called "Yes/No Talk."

618
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:28,000
-"Yes/No Talk.
- This sounds fun!

619
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,970
You'll be answering the questions from the Star Creators

620
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,060
and we'll get to hear the back stories, too.

621
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,670
Let's start with the first question.

622
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,930
I'll ask the question. Show us the answer as soon as I say, "One, two, three."

623
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:46,560
I've been surprised to see myself on TV. Yes or No. One, two, three!

624
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,170
Everyone said "Yes" except for Hao?

625
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,670
Were you not surprised because you were prepared?

626
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,340
I always...

627
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,420
thought things through before I did or said anything.

628
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,610
[He's always prepared]

629
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,010
I'm curious when you were surprised.

630
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:08,350
When Tae Rae did the adlib in "Man In Love,"

631
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,660
did you think, "Was my mouth that big?"

632
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,730
It's something similar to that.

633
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,300
Really? What is it? What is it?

634
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,340
You just saw the clip from "Back Door," right?

635
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,540
I sang in high notes a lot in "Switch," too.

636
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:25,320
I thought I was ruining my face too much for singing.

637
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,750
You looked nice.

638
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:32,080
It wasn't neither good or bad, but I was surprised.

639
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,140
I always felt that way whenever I my reactions were filmed.

640
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,670
- Yes.
- I know!

641
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,950
- Should we hear from Ji Woong?
- Yes.

642
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,630
When I was doing the monitoring...

643
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,410
I noticed I was cuter than I thought.

644
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,030
Wow!

645
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,680
[Oh, my God]

646
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,060
Let's do a fact check first.

647
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:56,240
On stage or just normally?

648
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,290
I noticed there are cute sides of me I didn't notice.

649
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,540
He reacted positively.

650
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,630
Ji Woong is very cute.

651
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,250
Really?

652
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,270
[He never thought that before]

653
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,880
I mean...

654
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,430
while we practicing "Say My Name,"

655
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,620
we had to smile while dancing.

656
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,310
Ji Woong kept smiling, but he was trembling right here.

657
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,770
[He couldn't handle his cuteness]

658
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,150
It went, "Brrr."

659
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,380
It was a muscle he never used before.

660
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,040
Let's move on to the second question.

661
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:31,260
There's a member I'm still awkward with in ZEROBASEONE. One, two, three!

662
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,810
Why are there so many?

663
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,660
There are four of you. Is it just between these four?

664
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,880
It might be.

665
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,490
Are these four awkward with each other?

666
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,150
Ji Woong, who is it? Who do you feel awkward with?

667
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,910
Personally, it's...

668
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,870
Hao.

669
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,640
Let me ask Hao, then.

670
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,630
Who's yours?

671
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,110
It's Ji Woong hyung.

672
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,150
They matched! They matched.

673
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,520
I first talked with Ji Woong during "Say My Name," the third mission.

674
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,190
You first talked to him then while filming BOYS PLANET?

675
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:08,730
I think we talked for the sixth or the seventh time by now.

676
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,040
Having a conversation?

677
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,080
Aren't you almost considered enemies?

678
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,980
This afternoon, Ji Woong said,

679
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,270
"Hao, let's get close starting today."

680
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,610
[Shy]

681
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:28,520
I'll approach him first as Hyung from now on.

682
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,270
Are you ready for it, Hao?

683
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,140
Yes!

684
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,120
He's the only "I" among you.

685
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,210
Yes, yes.

686
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,680
Mattehw and Tae Rae.

687
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,050
Who do you feel awkward with?

688
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,290
For me, it's Tae Rae and Ricky.

689
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,930
[Me?]

690
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,040
Who's yours, Tae Rae?

691
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,870
It's Hao and Matthew for me.

692
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,610
[Embarrassed]

693
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,940
Are you okay with me?

694
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,440
- I'm okay.
- I'm sorry.

695
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,210
Why do you feel awkward with Ricky? Do you not have much in common?

696
00:33:55,210 --> 00:34:00,260
Not that I feel awkward. I don't know him so well. There's an image in my head.

697
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,620
Ricky has snacks and money.

698
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,810
[Could Matthew not handle how young and rich he is?]

699
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,340
He has snacks and money!

700
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:11,970
That's the image I have in mind! But I know Ricky is a nice guy. I do!

701
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:17,500
Matthew, we were in the three-star group together when we did the Star Level Test.

702
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,170
I'll leave the team.

703
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,390
[He forgot about those days]

704
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,580
They even worked together before!

705
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,510
Ricky already opened up himself then.

706
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,930
He gave you snacks and opened up his wallet, too.

707
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,150
He already opened himself up.

708
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,680
I don't know why I feel so happy whenever your ears turn red.

709
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,320
These are the things I tried to become close to someone.

710
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,440
Is there anyone who can share that?

711
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,250
When we shoot the music video for, "I Shine,"

712
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,100
Tae Rae was a level above me.

713
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,010
I thought he seemed like a nice guy.

714
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,460
[Embarrassed]

715
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,450
You already started reading his face?

716
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,640
It was a hunch of a 16-year-old?

717
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,490
- He read his face since then.
- He did live long enough.

718
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:59,400
I looked at him thinking I want to say hello.

719
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,930
But I didn't get a lot of chances to do so.

720
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,790
So after it all ended,

721
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:08,370
I said, "Thank you" and that was it.

722
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,990
Do you remember that moment, Tae Rae?

723
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,570
I remember it because...

724
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,100
Even when I was eating in the waiting room...

725
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,000
While I was eating, he was staring at me from distance.

726
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,040
So I stared back at him, too.

727
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,380
He must've kept looking at you with these eyes while you were eating.

728
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,410
While Tae Rae was eating like this, suddenly...

729
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,390
[Longing]

730
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:31,360
He must've looked at you with those eyes like this!

731
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,100
He sat in this direction and stared at me like this.

732
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,350
[He didn't want to miss a moment]

733
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,950
How passionate.

734
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,280
I struggle with striking a conversation.

735
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,690
He's ENFP. It's hard to be friends with you unless someone initiates it.

736
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,180
What's the deal?

737
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:49,350
I hope the members of ZEROBASEONE become friendly with everyone.

738
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,780
Let's move on to the third question.

739
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:57,330
There's a member who you admire as a man.

740
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,370
[Unanimous]

741
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,510
- Wow.
- It's unanimous!

742
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,020
We got unanimous votes for the first time.

743
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,950
You're all impressed with each other.

744
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,470
Who was so cool and when?

745
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,580
Ricky, who did you find so cool?

746
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,270
[He's staring at him]

747
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,220
[It's Ji Woong]

748
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,350
How about you, Ji Woong?

749
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,980
Ricky...

750
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,700
[Heart fluttering]

751
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,780
doesn't get my vote.

752
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,930
[Throwing a curve ball skilfully]

753
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,790
Yes, you should choose someone else to make it interesting.

754
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,840
I choose Ricky.

755
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,300
Oh, Ricky?

756
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,270
Who else do you have?

757
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,390
Han Bin.

758
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,250
Han Bin?

759
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,540
Who's yours, Han Bin?

760
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:43,290
Since we're always on TV, I thought the appearance matters. So...

761
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,950
I was so jealous of Gun Wook's physique.

762
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,050
[Yay]

763
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,890
[Cute]

764
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,230
How about you, Gun Wook?

765
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:57,210
Mine is... I honestly think all of my teammates are cool.

766
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,980
The one who made an impression on me is...

767
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,740
Ji Woong hyung, Yoo Jin, and Han Bin hyung.

768
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,350
Ji Woong, Yoo Jin, and Han Bin.

769
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,480
What did you find so impressive?

770
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,020
Ji Woong is just charismatic even when he's just sitting still.

771
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,670
He's like the David statue.

772
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,850
- Even now.
- Yes, even now.

773
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:19,130
It was when he went, "Hush, hush" wearing a red suit during "Love Killa."

774
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,480
I didn't sound phlegmy like that!

775
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,360
For Han Bin, in the beginning of "Love Me Now,"

776
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,520
you did this thing.

777
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,490
I think I watched that multiple times.

778
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,780
That's how cool he was.

779
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:37,720
Yoo Jin is so young, but he's such a great performer.

780
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,040
I think he'd get so good from now on.

781
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,040
I think he's really something.

"He's really something."

784
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,080
"Something" of ZEROBASEONE.

785
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,450
Yoo Jin, who are you impressed with?

786
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,890
I choose Hao

787
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,420
and Gun Wook hyung, too.

788
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,380
Wow, you're exchanging compliments.

789
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,220
Who are you impressed with, Hao?

790
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,080
Since I worked for the company,

791
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,390
I complimented Yoo Jin a lot.

792
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,830
[Is it Yoo Jin, then?]

793
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,200
So I'll skip Yoo Jin today.

794
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,410
Although you find Yoo Jin cool...

795
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,070
I choose Han Bin and Gun Wook.

796
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,870
Han Bin and Gun Wook.

797
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:21,010
The ones with strong physiques.

798
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,540
I thought someone would pick the one that wasn't mentioned.

799
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,620
I know!

800
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,950
Some of you haven't been mentioned yet.

801

I know!

802

A lot of them are waiting right now.

Let's go one more time.

804
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,830
Hao, is there someone you find cool?

805
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:37,970
Yes, I... Should I go again?

806
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:41,340
So cute!

807
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,580

808
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,040
I choose no one.

809

[I can't lie]

Let's talk to the ones that aren't cool.

812
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,900
There are several of them.

813
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,670
Matthew. Tae Rae. Gyu Vin.

814
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,850
How come you didn't get picked?

815
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:58,480
Matthew, who do you find cool?

816
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,160
Well, Ji Woong hyung. Ricky. Han Bin hyung.

817
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,940
[And?]

818
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,280
And Gun Wook.

819
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:12,670
He's still not choosing Tae Rae and Gyu Vin!

820
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,480
Even though we talked about it so much.

821
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,790
And Tae Rae!

822
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,640
No one mentioned Tae Rae and Gyu Vin.

823
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,970
I think Tae Rae hyung is really cool.

824

I think he's so cool.

825
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,410

- Gyu Vin said you're cool!
- You should've picked him!

You guys, seriously...

832
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,310
Gyu Vin, sorry, I forget.

833
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,990
This is too funny.

834
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,880
You find everyone cool, right?

835
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,040
Each of you has your own position and role.

836
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,720
You share the strengths and learn from each other.

837
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,880
I hope you form a great team together.

838
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,870
Let's move on to the individual Yes/No Talk.

839
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,960
The first subject of the individual Yes/No Talk

840
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,210
is Ricky.

841
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:05,020
Yeah! Ricky!

842
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:10,330
Everyone who watched BOYS PLANET must be curious about this one.

843
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:14,150
I was completely done up from head to toe leaving the camp every day.

844
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,950
One, two, three!

Come on!

848
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,350
I can explain.

849
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,640
Please explain.

850
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,990
I don't do anything whenever I get out of bed.

851
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,470
I get up with my hair sticking up like this.

852
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,830
Really?

853
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:36,160
BOYS PLANET's crew members saw it often.

854
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,100
In the morning, they say, "Ricky, you're young and rich. But what happened to tall and handsome?"

855
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,350
[He lost the handsome part]

856
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:48,180
Really? So we didn't see the full picture on TV?

857
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,870
He gets all dolled up in the bathroom outside.

858
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:54,310
Right!

859
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:57,620
I get dolled up in the bathroom.

860
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,380
And the crew members would say, "Ah, young and rich is back."

861
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:05,310
The second subject can be considered the opposite of Ricky.

862
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,450
[Who could it be?]

863
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,540
It's Tae Rae!

864
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,180
I think I dress well. Yes or no. One, two, three!

865
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,550
[Everyone is cheering]

866
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,140
What a confident man!

867
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,400
- He's about to faint!
- According to the fans' reports,

868
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:28,920
you were being referred to as a "fashion terrorist."

869
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,690
I like the chromatic colors.

870
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,910
- Chromatic colors?
- I like them a lot.

871
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:40,120
So when it comes to comfortable clothes, I always choose chromatic colors.

872
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,730
But I have normal clothes for when I dress up normally.

873
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:49,080
They thought that because I always wore pajamas and tracksuits in the camp.

874
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,860
When they saw me wearing a knitted vest,

875
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:58,090
they said I was dressed by a stylist.

876
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,980
I put that outfit together myself.

877
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,970
[I'm Tae Rae, the fashionista]

878
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:07,530
The third subject of the Yes/No Talk is someone who doesn't need clothes or makeup.

879
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,880
It's Kim Gyu Vin.

880
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,060
It doesn't matter even if he were a fashion terrorist.

881
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,190
I'll ask the question now.

882
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:21,900
I think I'm the No. 1 when it comes to proportions on BOYS PLANET.

883
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,690
One, two, three!

884
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,010

because Gyu Vin's mom has a tiny face.

903

Everyone says I'm cute whenever they see me.

1060
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,650
But I want to become someone cool.

1061
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,220
[But Matthew is still cute!]

1062
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,280
So cute.

1063
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,730
- What should we do? You're cute.
- You sound so cute.

1064
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:18,570
[Matthew can't hide his cuteness]

1065
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:23,960
Alright, Sung Han Bin is the last subject of the individual talk.

1066
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,410
We're very curious about Sung Han Bin,

1067
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:31,560
but we prepared a question that's considered the most popular.

1068
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,560
Let me ask you right now.

1069
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,640
I'm a pro at styling my hair. One, two, three!

1070
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,980
[I'm not a pro!]

1071
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,350
Guys, you're mistaken about this!

1072
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:41,920
- What's this about?
- What does it mean?

1073
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,880
We prepared this because you might be wondering what it's about.

1074
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,800
Let's watch it.

1075
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,040
[Members burst out laughing together]

1076
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,140
[So friendly with one another]

1077
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,250
There are many clips with the curling iron.

1078
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,900
Did you watch them?

1079
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,950
My acquaintances sent them to me

1080
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,490
and said I came out very cute

1081
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:07,560
like the mushroom shaped chocolate cookie.

1082
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,660
Everyone thinks I used the curling iron, but...

1083
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,690
[Then who is the real culprit?]

1084
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:13,300
It was someone else.

1085
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,820
Who was it?

1086
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:15,850
Who's the culprit?

1087
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:17,720
I Chan.

1088
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,680
Oh, it's I Chan!

1089
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,140
Actually when I Chan did it for me, it was styled really well

1090
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:28,970
but right before practice, I moved my head, so all the hair clumped together in the middle.

1091
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:30,820
Oh, like this, like this.

1092
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,290
[Still so cute]

1093
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,670
There are other guys, too.

1094
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:35,820
[Tae Rae and Gyu Vin sporting neat bangs]

1095
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:36,920
That's Gyu Vin and me.

1096
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,560
- Ah, Tae Rae and Gyu Vin.
- Oh, my gosh.

1097
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,350
Did I Chan help with your hair, too?

1098
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:44,920
- Did you?
- For this, I did.

1099
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,770
I did do my own hair and also did Gyu Vin's.

1100
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:50,130
[The main character was Tae Rae]

1101
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:53,200
[Curling iron master, LOL]

1102
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,580
Personally, I don't think it looks bad!

1103
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,260
[Hyung, that's not true]

1104
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:02,430
So if everyone shows up with cute hair, they ask "Did Han Bin do your hair?"

1105
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:03,770
- So that became your image.
- Yes.

1106
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:07,800
So ZEROBASEONE's official hair curler is Kim Tae Rae.

1107
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,190
His role is to be in charge of the curling iron.

1108
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:14,860
May you become friendlier and even closer with each other.

1109
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:18,860
We hope you will become a strong ZEROBASEONE.

1110
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,190
Now we've approached the last corner.

1111
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:23,130
The last corner is me plus you.

1112
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:28,370
The corner means when me and you come together, it becomes we.

1113
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:30,210
The most important component when working with a team

1114
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:33,060
would be the team chemistry

1115
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,650
that binds a team together.

1116
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:38,410
As though we knew this would happen

1117
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:44,310
we caught the moments where ZEROBASEONE members showed such chemistry.

1118
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:48,100
These endearing moments have not been made public anywhere else yet.

1119
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,980
[Endearing]

1120
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,980
We plan to share them during our commentary today.

1121
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,200
[anticipation]
[fear]

1122
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,640
So we will watch which members shared moments of chemistry

1123
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,520
and then talk about them.

1124
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,690
[Show the VCR]

1125
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:06,330
[Show us]
[Anticipation]

1126
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:08,460
I'm so curious. Wow~
[All stars going up to the highest stage]

1127
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,440
[Han Bin standing in the center]

1128
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,210
That was so long ago! Do you guys remember?

1129
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:14,090
Oh, we remember it so clearly.

1130
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,700
- When we were wearing short sleeves.
- Feels so weird now.

1131
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,250
[Super focused]

1132
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,210
Daebak!

1133
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:22,810
That was 5, 6 months ago.

1134
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:25,370
[Han Bin explains one more time]

1135
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:28,420
Wow, I still remember that time like yesterday.

1136
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,710
You guys really worked hard back then.

1137
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:31,750
Did they record that during the night?

1138
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,910
Right.

1139
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,630
We hardly slept back then.

1140
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:40,140
The two of you were on centers for the first time

1141
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:41,490
and got to talk to each other a lot.

1142
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:42,700
- Right.
- Right.

1143
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,700
That would have brought them closer together.

1144
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,460
- That was amazing.
- Back then, everything seemed so amazing.

1145
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,950
Right.

1146
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:53,610
The thing in the front was really neat, too.

1147
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,040
Time really flies.
[Even greets politely]

1148
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,850
[Everything seems fascinating to the new trainees]

[Discovers the camera]

1150
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,010
Oh, that was there!

1151
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,100
Since then you knew how to look into the camera!

1152
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,200
Of course you did!
[I found it right away]

1153
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,120
- Ready to be an idol!
- Yes.

1154
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,230
You've never seen that, right?

1155
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:09,990
Yeah, yeah.

1156
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:13,210
Now that it's released it's cool to see.

1157
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:15,060
[Still awkward taking a shot together]

1158
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:19,410
Han Bin's hair is really nice.

1159
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:23,270
He was like that from the first day.

1160
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:24,960
Right, right.

1161
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:28,620
How did it feel going up together?

1162
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,690
It was really thrilling.

1163
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:32,080
Yeah, really.

1164
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,310
Hao, how did you feel?

1165
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,690
I felt like it was someone else's life.

1166
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,470
- Another person's life?
- Yes.

1167
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,710
Being on stage was like a dream, but to be in the center, too!

1168
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,310
Right.
[The lift rises with the music]

1169
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,080
Wow!
[Feeling admiration seeing it again]

1170
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,240
[A perfect entrance unlike their nervous anticipation]

1171
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,650
Wow!

1172
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,760
But they all look like they have done this many times.

1173
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,710
- Already.
- Yes, they're all very good.

1174
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:59,230
[Centers first stage completed perfectly]

1175
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,650
[The center performers at the first rehearsal deserve to earn a round of applause]

1176
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:06,560
[Proud]

1177
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:10,810
The first pair who have chemistry together are Sung Han Bin and Zhang Hao.

1178
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:13,460
[Pleased]

1179
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,070
- Soulmate duo!
- So...

1180
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:18,380
it's strange that they seem a bit awkward around each other,

1181
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:21,200
yet there's chemistry between them.

1182
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,550
Did you have a feeling back then that you wanted to

1183
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:27,660
become friends with this person or be on the same team?

1184
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,000
[I'm curious-woong, too]

1185
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,760
I felt it right away when we had our first conversation.

1186
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,710
We have something in common.

1187
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:38,910
It felt like talking to myself or looking in the mirror.

1188
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,840
Oh, really?

1189
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,910
How about you, Hao?

1190
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:47,630
To be honest, when I had the interview after Star Level Test,

1191
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:50,940
it was hard for me to remember all the names,

1192
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,520
so I only remembered the name of Sung Han Bin.

1193
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,800
You two were destined to meet.

1194
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,510
- And you two took your first lift in life together, right?
- Yes.

1195
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,400
That time must have been really special for you.

1196
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,910
How did you feel then?

1197
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:10,430
I still remember the view that I saw while riding the lift at that time,

1198
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:13,910
like a scene from my all time favorite movie.

1199
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:16,590
So, whenever I have a hard time,

1200
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,670
I try to recall that moment of the signal song and

1201
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,560
find my way back to my initial motivation.

1202
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,160
I think it's like that. With a slow motion effect on that part...

1203

[Suddenly nervous]

- Right, right, right.
- I agree.

1214

Before Star Level Test, they supported each other so much.

1215
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,890
I could see their chemistry back then. What do you think, Matthew?

1216
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:01,900
The chemistry shifted towards those two.

1217
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,350
I'm jealous.

1218
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,100
I'm jealous.

1219

What's wrong with you, hyung?

1220
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,770
- Jealousy.
- Love triangle.

1221

01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:40,280
Let me introduce the 9 members of the 5th generation K-pop boy group ZEROBASEONE.

1397
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:54,550
From now on, I will forever be grateful for and strive as Zhang Hao of ZEROBASEONE.

1398
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,650
Hello, I'm Zhang Hao.

1399
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:01,160
Hello, I'm Sung Han Bin.

1400
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,630
Hello, I'm Seok Matthew.

1401
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:05,580
Hello, I'm Ricky.

1402
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:07,990
Hello, I'm Kim Tae Rae.

1403
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:09,440
Hello, I'm Park Gun Wook.

1404
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,320
Hello, I'm Kim Gyu Vin.

1405
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,250
Hello, I'm Kim Ji Woong.

1406
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:18,580
Hello, I'm Han Yu Jin.

1407
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:22,960
[Start as ZEROBASEONE]

1408
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,250
I feel like I'm still dreaming.

1409
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,580
It's surreal to me.

1410
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:34,130
I think I'm taking the first step towards my dream.

1411
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:42,280
At first, I thought my debut was the end and the conclusion.

1412
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:45,120
I've recently been thinking that debut is

1413
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:48,510
another opportunity and a new beginning.

1414
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:50,540
I want to show various sides of me and

1415
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:56,240
give my fans a sense of curiosity and anticipation.

1416
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:01,980
I want to show a new side of Matthew, and I'm really excited about it.

1417
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:06,650
I want to show a powerful and sexy Ricky on stage.

1418
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:15,370
Afterwards, I will also show a lovely side of Ricky occasionally offstage.

1419
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:20,770
I want to learn a lot of new things that I didn't know in my life.

1420
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,840
I will work harder and

1421
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:27,410
I will try to go higher.

1422
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:34,790
I wanted to create a team's own identity and show it to many people.

1423
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:39,500
Now, I plan to redraw my dream with ZEROBASEONE.

1424
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:44,150
[To: ZEROBASEONE]

1425
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:48,420
We have a group of truly strong and

1426
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:50,720
perfect members who don't lack anything.

1427
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,650
Oh, so this is how a team is formed!

1428
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:58,720
During that time, we really became much closer.

1429
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,590
I feel truly honored at this moment.

1430
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:05,500
In my journey from 0 to 1,

1431
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:10,750
no one knows what grand result awaits at the end of that journey.

1432
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:16,090
I worked very hard and endured a lot at Boys Planet.

1433
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:20,140
But debut will be less difficult than this, right?

1434
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:23,370
This is only the beginning.

1435
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:26,570
There's still a long way to go.

1436
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:31,970
I want to say to the 8 members that I look forward to working with them.

1437
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:35,330
Let's not lose the fire in our hearts.

1438
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:38,340
Let's work hard together and

1439
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:42,260
become the representative 5th generation boy idol group.

1440
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:44,700
Fighting!
