00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,340
[Which trainee is next?]

169
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,990
- Wait, Canada? [Park Min Seok]
- Oh, it's Group G! [Kim Tae Rae]

170
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,180
He's the first trainee from Group G, right? [Park Min Seok]

171
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,350
Oh, will he be coming out of there? [Mun Jung Hyun]

172
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,810
I would've never imagined someone from Canada.
[What will this Canadian trainee look like?]

173
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,150
Will people with blonde hair and blue eyes show up? [Mun Jun Hyun]

174
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,690
- Hello!
- Hello.

175
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,800
- He's handsome.
- He's good looking.

176
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,370
- Hello.
- Hello.

177
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,740
Hello, I'm Seok Matthew. I'm 21 years old, and I'm from Canada. [Seok Matthew]

178
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,940
I came to Korea to become an idol. [Seok Matthew]

179
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,940
My older sister is a dancer.
[Matthew started dancing because of his sister's suggestion.]

180
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,840
She suggested that I try dancing.

181
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,370
I tried and realized dancing was fun.
[Dancing made him want to become a K-pop idol.]

182
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,050
I decided it was something I had to do.

183
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,700
I want to show my very best.
[Seok Matthew came to Korea alone to fulfill his dream.]

184
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,910
[Which trainee is next?]

185
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,310
- Oh, my gosh.
- Saitama!

186
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,110
We have trainees from Group G coming in back-to-back. [Mun Jung Hyun]

187
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,930
[Saitama, Japan]

188
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,820
My gosh, he has three stickers. [Lim Jun Seo]

189
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,900
I think he'll be good. [Lee Da Eul]

190
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,850
[The trainee with 3 stars, who they think will be good, has arrived at the Star Zone.]

191
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,860
[Does his confidence stem from the fact that he's a boxer?]

192
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,780
Hello, I'm 16-year-old Toyonaga Takuto from Japan. [Takuto]

193
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,580
Please vote for me. [Takuto]

194
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,170
I'll do my best. [Takuto]

195
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,810
Thank you. [Takuto]

196
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,920
What was that? [Staff]

197
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,080
It's to show that I'm a tough guy.

198
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,480
- Awesome.
- Hello.

199
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,190
- Hello!
- Hello.

200
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,800
Was he a boxer? [Park Han Bin]

201
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,230
Can I go up top?

202
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,230
[He scans the Top 9 seats like the tough guy he is.]

203
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,300
I'm a tough guy.
[Is it time to set the tone?]

204
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,980
I'm a tough guy.

205
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,800
[This is my tone! Take it!]

206
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,660
[The boys are charmed.]

207
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,160
He's cute.
[Takuto takes a seat after setting the tone.]

208
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,030
[The Top 9 seats are all taken now.]

209
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,470
But what if the next person [Seok Matthew]

210
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,500
- wants this seat? [Seok Matthew]
- They can steal it.

211
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,400
They can steal it.

212
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,070
[Anyone can take the seat they want from someone sitting in the TOP 9 seats!]

213
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,030
[However, the method of taking the seat is up to the trainee.]

214
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,730
Should I not have sat on the winner's seat? [Mun Jung Hyun]

215
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,580
You can move over there. [Kim Tae Rae]

216
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,920
I can't. I love this spot.

217
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,790
Hello.
[Will the next trainee want a Top 9 seat?]

218
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,440
Please don't come here. [Mun Jung Hyun]

219
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,600
Rock, paper, scissors!
[An endless battle for Top 9 seats.]

220
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,130
I respect you guys.

221
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,260
I can't.

222
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,640
- One, two...
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

223
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,710
Thank you! I get to sit on the winner's seat from the get-go!

224
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,200
I must hold onto it for as long as I can.

225
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,610
I'm proud of you. [Hong Keon Hee]
[These 3 are in the same company as Jun Hyeon.]

226
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,800
Thank you.

227
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,630
[Currently, Kum Jun Hyeon from Redstart is in the winner's seat.]

228
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,350
[Trainees from Group G are next.]

229
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,130
[They have all the trainees' attention.]

230
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,480
[Trainees from Taipei appear.]

231
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,150
What is that? [Mun Jung Hyun]

232
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,180
- Isn't it a magic staff? [Mun Jung Hyun]
- The one you spin? [Kim Tae Rae]

233
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,430
- Yes, the one that Sun Wukong carries.
- I think you're right.

234
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,290
Honestly, I wasn't scared.

235
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,040
Not at that moment.

236
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,830
[Trainee Chen Kuan Jui walks up to the winner's seat.]

237
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,430
But...

238
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,030
It's not right that he did a split.

239
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,390
[Splitting his leg]

240
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,550
I thought he was a snake. He wrapped his leg around his neck.

241
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,270
[The boy whose seat was taken and the boy who took his seat.]

242
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,970
[Trainees from diverse locations and companies have arrived.]

243
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,470
Who's the next team? [Mun Jung Hyun]

244
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,530
It's from Group K!

245
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,170
- It's Jellyfish!
- No way.

246
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,050
[Stomping]

247
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,490
They're arriving so charismatically. [Kim Tae Rae]

248
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,570
[They are all nervous.]

249
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,740
- Hello.
- Hello.

250
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,300
I felt a bit overpowered by them. [Lee Jung Hyun]

251
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,590
Gun Wook, the guy who's very big in stature. [Lee Jung Hyun]

252
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,790
[Proud]

253
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,420
I can take the middle spot.

254
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,920
I can take the middle spot.

255
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,400
I knew it was my spot the moment I saw it. [Park Gun Wook]

256
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,130
- Oh, my gosh!
- He's going straight to the winner's seat? [Lee Seung Hwan]

257
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,960
[Jellyfish's Park Gun Wook heads straight to the winner's spot without hesitation.]

258
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,240
[Group G's Riku is already shaking in the winner's seat.]

259
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,810
His appearance... [Kim Min Hyuk]

260
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,230
His muscles... [Jung Ho Jin]

261
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,800
[What game will they play for the seat?]

262
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,430
Let's do the thigh wrestling game.

263
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,080
That's harsh.

264
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,040
He looks like he's being taken to get scolded. [Yoon Jong Woo]

265
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,700
He's being taken to the room of truth.

266
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,970
[Group G's Riku is being dragged to the room of truth.]

267
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,480
Ready, set, go!

268
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,080
[Is it already over?]

269
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,640
[Yes, it's over.]

270
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,490
[Shaking]

271
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,650
- That's mean. [Mun Jung Hyun]
- It's making me tear up. [Kim Tae Rae]

272
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,350
[Group K's trainee Park Gun Wook took the winner's seat.]

273
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,520
I think it's time for someone from the global team to show. [Choi Woo Jin]

274
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,660
America. [Hong Keon Hee]

275
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,750
[USA]

276
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,450
I got it right. [Choi Woo Jin]

277
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,870
- We can do it, okay. Ready?
- Yes.

278
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,760
We say something. [Jay]

279
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,770
What should we say? [Jay]

280
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,460
[What will the American trainees' chant be?]

281
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,830
- We can do it!
- We can do it? Okay.

282
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,070
- We can do it!
- We can do it!

283
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,630
[The American trainees who are fluent in Korean head out.]

284
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,300
Hello. Hi.

285
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,490
- Look at their physical appearance. [Choi Woo Jin]
- What's with their proportions? [Hong Keon Hee]

286
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,940
- Hello.
- Hello!

287
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,970
I'm embarrassed to walk around with my legs.
[Group G trainees have very good proportions.]

288
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,090
[Shanghai, China]
[Group G trainees with unusually long legs arrive.]

289
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,360
What's with their heights? [Kum Jun Hyeon]

290
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,170
It's like their arms and legs were stretched out. [Kum Jun Hyeon]

291
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,690
Are they all models?

292
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,640
Why is he so handsome? [Jang Yeo Jun]

293
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,710
I'm Dang Hong Hai from Vietnam.

294
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,390
His face is tiny. [Mun Jung Hyun]

295
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,250
I'm jealous. [Kim Tae Rae]

296
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,930
We have trainees from Tokyo, Japan [Jang Yeo Jun]

297
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,450
and Beijing, China too. [Jang Yeo Jun]

298
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,500
It's super global. [Mun Jung Hyun]

299
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,280
[Who is the next global trainee?]

300
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,190
[Osaka, Japan]

301
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,030
- Osaka!
- Osaka!

302
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,300
[What pops into the trainees' heads when they think of Osaka?]

303
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,620
LE SSERAFIM's Kazuha is from Osaka. [Wumuti]

304
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,740
- Twice's Sana is from there too. [Wumuti]
- You're right.

305
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,330
Osaka!
[What represents Osaka for Takuto?]

306
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,600
- Takoyaki!
- Takoyaki.

307
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,410
Okonomiyaki!

308
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,090
[I want to eat it.]

309
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,760
Osaka!

310
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,250
Oh, Keita! [Park Han Bin]

311
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,820
Oh, Keita? [Choi Ji Ho]

312
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,540
Didn't he debut as Ciipher? [Jang Yeo Jun]

313
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,670
[Keita debuted as Ciipher in March 2021.]

314
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,440
It's Ciipher's Keita. [Yuki]

315
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,270
Gosh, it's Yuehua! [Lee Da Eul]

316
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,750
They have trainees in Group G, too! [Jang Yeo Jun]

317
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,310
Two groups? [Jung Ho Jin]

318
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,020
- Two!
- Amazing.

319
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,160
[Confused]

320
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,030
Trainees from the same company have to compete. [Yoon Jong Woo]

321
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,170
You're right. [Jeong I Chan]

322
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,810
- They're in different teams. [Yoon Jong Woo]
- K and G. [Jeong I Chan]

323
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

324
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,760
[Yuehua's Group G follows suit.]

325
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,570
It's an internal battle. [Lee Seung Hwan]

326
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,590
The groups feel very different. [Jeong I Chan]

327
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,620
- Hello!
- Hello!

328
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,640
We are trainees at Yuehua. [Zhang Hao]

329
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,610
We're under the same Yuehua family. [Ji Yun Seo]

330
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,610
But Group K ranks a little higher than Group G [Ji Yun Seo]

331
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,930
when it comes to looks and skills. [Ji Yun Seo]

332
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,880

Yes, I'm very...

412
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,750
It's only been a week since I got discharged from the military. [Lee Hoe Taek]

I don't understand why he's here. [Choi Seung Hun]

422

I thought he was a Master when I first saw him. [Jeong I Chan]

423
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,260
He must sit on the winner's chair. [Yoo Seung Eon]

424

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,060
Shall we sing? [Lee Hoe Taek]

434
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,040
Hold on, I need to take this out. [Sung Han Bin]

He's really good.
[Trainee Lee Hoe Taek takes the winner's seat.]

442

Hold on, I'm still shocked. [Park Gun Wook]

443
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,190
I have a sudden headache. [Park Gun Wook]

444
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,510

[Focusing]

451
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,730
[Looking intently]

452
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,330
The two groups are completely different. [Ollie]

453
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,380
Two sides. [Ollie]

454
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,640
I think this side of Group G is all different types of styles. [Ollie]

455
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,080
[Group G's style]

456
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,260
But if you look over. It's either suits or leather. [Ollie]

457
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,700
[Group K's style]

458
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,110
Group G feels more happy, bright, up, and sunny. [Ollie]

459
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,200
But Group K looks more cool and dark. [Ollie]

460
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,330
Our styles are completely different. [Ollie]

461

[Group G's Min looks especially nervous.]

462

I'm scared of the Korean trainees. [Min]

463
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,160
All the K-pop trainees look very tough. [Zhang Hao]

464

They all look talented. [Zhang Hao]

465
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,760
That's why I'm a little nervous. [Zhang Hao]

466
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,590
What do you think Group G's trainees will be like? [Kim Gyu Vin]

467
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,470
They're all handsome, so I'm curious about their skills. [Yoo Seung Eon]

468

I wonder how good they will be. [Yoo Seung Eon]

469

I feel like there will be a lot of Group G trainees with hidden talents.

470
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,420
[The studio suddenly darkens.]

471

only nine will fulfill their dreams of debuting in BOYS PLANET.

506
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,590
- 100 percent!
- 100 percent?

507
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,120
The power of Star Creators will be most important. [Sung Han Bin]

508
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,420
I'm worried if the fans would like me. [Kim Min Seong]

509
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,950

- Vocal, rap, dance.
- Vocal, rap, dance.

516
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,330
They must be coming out.

530
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,250
To be honest, I was a little scared. [Lee Ye Dam]

531
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,680
He had a powerful aura. [Haruto]

532
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,340
I remember seeing his scary side a lot in another survival program. [Choi Ji Ho]

533
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,550
Your singing sounds like you're putting no effort in. I'm wrong, right?

534
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,090
Talk politely.

535
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,580

I get the chance to be taught by them.

I'm preparing to become an idol, and these two make choreographies for idols. [Mun Jung Hyun]

585
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,230
I really wanted to meet them. [Mun Jung Hyun]

586
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,930
- Daebak.
- Is there more? [Ollie]

587

595
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,090

Gosh, this lineup is no joke. [Park Hyun Been]

599
00:28:54,740 --> 00:29:00,050
I think this is probably the most impressive lineup in a survival program. [Jung Ho Jin]

600
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,180

[Nodding]

606
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,290
He was scary. [Wumuti]

607
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,860
He had a very piercing look. [Kim Ji Woong]

608
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,550
I was scared of his aura. [Han Yu Jin]

609
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:26,140
I'll do my best, so I don't get scolded. [Ji Yun Seo]

610
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:30,660
The real competition starts now.

611
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,290
[The competition to fulfill their dreams officially starts now!]

612
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,890
Competition... [Lee Seung Hwan]

613
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,650
- No. [Keita]
- I'm scared. [Hiroto]

614
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,980
The fierce competition starts at this moment.

615
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:44,280
We'll take a look at each group's confidence first.

616
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,150
They're checking our confidence?

617
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,080
[What's the confidence level of each group?]

618
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,460
[No way!]

619
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,530
There are stars on your name tags.

620
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:58,000
It's to show how you rated your own skills.

621
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,970
The numbers on this graph... [Solji]

622
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,540
are the totals of the number of stars trainees

623
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,040
of each group gave themselves.

624
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,190
We got a little more than them.

625
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,420
Oh, we're losing.

626
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,000
This is what confidence is.

627
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,700
I put eight stars because I'm different from others.

628
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,300
[This is K-confidence.]

629
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,940
Only a maximum of four stars were allowed...

630
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,230
but almost everyone did whatever they wanted.

631
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,830
Aren't they being arrogant?

632
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:24,220
However, the number of stars you have right now

633
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,660
represent how good you think you are. [ONESTAR]

634
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,060
He's right.

635
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,190
From now, through Star Level Test,

636
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,820
your true skills will be judged by us, the masters.

637
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,810
[Star Level Test]

638
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:38,560
[It has finally come.]

639
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,670
I'm too nervous.

640
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:44,480
The Masters will watch team or solo performances

641
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,360
and evaluate each trainee's level.

642
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,340
There's a reason why we have stars. [Park Ji Hoo]

643
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,460
- Let's get All Star. [Kim Gyu Vin]
- Let's do that. [Han Yu Jin]

644
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,290
According to the result,

645
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,970
you'll either keep,

646
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:03,370
add, or have to take off all the stars on your name tag.

647
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,830
[No!]

648
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,550
I might have to take off this one star. [Park Do Ha]

649
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:10,020
- No, never.
- No.

650
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,740
One more thing. After the Star Level Test,

651
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,520
there will be a huge benefit

652
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,330
to the group with the most stars.

653
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,310
It's a competition between K and G, then. [Kim Min Hyeok]

654
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:25,390
The benefit is that they will receive

655
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,400
the next test song for BOYS PLANET a day earlier.

656
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,780
[Only the victorious group will receive the next test song a day earlier!]

657
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,850
That means we can practice everything in one day. [Lin Shi Yuan]

658
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,260
We must win no matter what! [Jung Hwan Rok]

659
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,940
Getting an extra day is a huge benefit when it comes to memorizing choreography. [Lee Seung Hwan]

660
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,950
We can't lose. [Haruto]

661
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,360
- Let's start now.
- Oh, my gosh.

662
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,440
Group K from the birthplace of K-pop.

663
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,350
We're from the sacred land that found K-pop. [Park Do Ha]

664
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:50,540
It's unacceptable that we lose here. [Park Do Ha]

665
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,140
We'll win for sure since I'm in this group. [Park Gun Wook]

666
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,270
I won't go easy on them. [Jang Ji Ho]

667
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,810
Group G, the rising stars of K-pop.

668
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,250
We must win. We will. I'll win them! [Winnie]

669
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,000
I think Group G is comprised of the best from each region. [Ouju]

670
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,790
K-pop needs new blood now. [Zhang Shuai Bo]

671
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,360
It's a battle between two groups. Their pride is on the line.

672
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,350
- Let's do this!
- We got this!

673
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,460
Let's win! [Jung Min Gyu]

674
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,300
- Let's go, Group K! [Jung Ho Jin]
- We got this, Group G! [Haruto]

675
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,040
Come on, Group G!

676
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,350
- Let's go!
- We can do this!

677
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,950
- They're so cool.
- That was amazing.
[The Star Level Test has officially begun.]

678
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,850
- He's so good.
- He came to fight.

679
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:31,170
- You were so cool.
- They broke the stage.
- That was amazing.

680
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,700
- He has what it takes to be a star.
- That finalized it.
- I love it.

681
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,070
[Next up...]

682
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:41,190
[the live vote counts will be revealed.]

683
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,410
[Star Level Test site]

684
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,060
Star Level Test.

685
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,170
Let's meet the first team who's preparing for the first performance.

686
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:53,070
It's Group K's Team Jellyfish.

687
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,300
Jellyfish!

688
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,040
- Oh, Jellyfish! [Mun Jung Hyun]
- My gosh, All Star. [Solji]

689
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,130
They all gave themselves All Star.

690
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,650
Their company is known to have talented artists. [ONESTAR]

691
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,190
Gosh, the talented group. [Lee Da Eul]

692
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,700
Someone from Jellyfish debuted in the previous season. [Lim Jun Seo]

693
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,180
[Kim Da Yeon debuted as Kep1er through GIRLs PLANET 999]

694
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:19,960
Congratulations, Kim Da Yeon.
[Who are the boys who took on this challenge after their senior?]

695
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:24,130
That kid has a great physique. [Back Koo Young]

696
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,480
His body is so big. [Han Yu Jin]

697
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,400
I think he's built differently. [Kim Gyu Vin]

698
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,820
Muscle! [Haruto]

699
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,760
- That body isn't fake. [Kim Tae Rae]
- He's muscular.

700
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,800
What will happen if you run into someone like him on the street and get into a fight? [Han Yu Jin]

701
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,340
You need to run. [Yoo Seung Eon]

702
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,300
Gyu Vin will fight him for me anyway. [Han Yu Jin]

703
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,990
Right, Gun Wook... [Gyu Vin]

704
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,890
Mr. Gun Wook. [Kim Gyu Vin]

705
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,530
He's younger than me. [Kim Gyu Vin]

706
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,070
- How old are you? [Yoo Seung Eon]
- I'm 18. [Park Gun Wook]

707
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,360
- I'm 18. [Park Gun Wook]
- My gosh. [Kim Gyu Vin]

708
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,130
He's 19.

709
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,710
But he feels older than me.
[Kim Gyu Vin, 19: 1 year older than Gun Wook]

710
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:00,990
To be honest, I was a bit scared. [Yuki]

711
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,690
When I met the guys from Jellyfish backstage... [Takuto]

712
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,110
Hello.
[Backstage]

713
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,550
Hello.

714
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,220
- Hello.
- Hello.

715
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,930
[He automatically distances himself.]

716
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,000
[Dragging]

717
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,950
[Hesitating]

718
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:26,210
[His hands naturally come together.]

719
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,730
- Are you alone? [Park Gun Wook]
- Yes, I am. [Takuto]

720
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,420
Come here. We won't hit you. [Park Gun Wook]
[We're not scary guys.]

721
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,890
- You're 16? [Park Gun Wook]
- Yes.

722
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,720
You're so young. [Park Gun Wook]

723
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,390
The three of us are 18, and he's 19.

724
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,150
You're so cute. [Park Gun Wook]

725
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,760
- Thank you. [Takuto]
- You're like a baby peach [Park Gun Wook]

726
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,720
I was a little scared. [Takuto]

727
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,100
- They packed their name tags with stars.
- All Star.

728
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,480
Does that mean you're that confident? [Lee Seok Hoon]

729
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,000
- Yes, that's correct [Park Gun Wook]
- Check out his confidence. [Haruto]

730
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,720
What's your main position, Gun Wook? [Back Koo Young]

731
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,160
I'm an all-rounder. [Park Gun Wook]

732
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,260
You're full of confidence. [Solji]

733
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,850
An all-rounder? That's not easy. [Seo Won]

734
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,790
Who usually leads this group? [Back Koo Young]

735
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,530
It's usually me. [Park Gun Wook]

736
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,110
[Backstage]

737
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,390
Okay, good. That was nice. [Park Gun Wook]

738
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,560
It's really tough dancing with the mic on. [Jang Yeo Jun]

739
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,140
I'm not used to it. It's throwing me off. [Jang Yeo Jun]

740
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,550
Don't mind that stuff.

741
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,070
What if the mic falls off on my part? [Jang Yeo Jun]

742
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,320
Then just sing without it. [Park Gun Wook]

743
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,050
I don't want to ruin the quality of the performance because of this. [Park Gun Wook]

744
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,240
Just do it.

745
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,320
- There's no need to get scared.
- Gun Wook is usually a good friend. [Jang Yeo Jun]

746
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,540
He's more mature than anyone. [Jang Yeo Jun]

747
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,810
He's also the one that we rely on. [Jang Yeo Jun]

748
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,650
I wonder which song they'll sing. [Park Min Seok]

749
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,720
They're going to perform this song? [ONESTAR]

750
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,940
I wonder what it is. [Han Seo Bin]

751
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,210
I did the choreography [Choi Young Joon]

752
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,920
- for the song you prepared. [Choi Young Joon]
- Yes, you did. [Park Gun Wook]

753
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,820
["G.B.T.B" by VERIVERY. They are a K-pop group that dances most in sync.]

754
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,660
[Master Choi Young Joon choreographed this hard dance.]

755
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,470
He'll watch even more closely then. [Lee Ye Dam]

756
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,570
The dance isn't easy. [Choi Young Joon]

757
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,160
Yes, you're right. We're well aware. [Park Gun Wook]

758
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,200
I'll be watching very closely. [Choi Young Joon]

759
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,710
- I don't think we'll disappoint you. [Jang Yeo Jun[
- Yes, that's correct. [Park Gun Wook]

760
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,150
[Is that so?]

761
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,240
Then I'll watch every little detail.

762
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,690
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir.

763
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,450
- My gosh. [Ji Yun Seo]
- I love your spirit. [Lee Seok Hoon]

764
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,490
I'm excited. [Seo Won]

765
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,150
These guys are raising our expectations too much. [Back Koo Young]

766
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,830
I'm excited. [Choi Young Joon]

767
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,270
I'm very ambitious and competitive. [Park Gun Wook]

768
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:37,620
I'll show them everything and get All Star. [Park Gun Wook]

769
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,580
[G.B.T.B (by VERIVERY): Park Gun Wook, Park Hyun Been, Jang Yeo Jun, Han Yu Seop]

770
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,970
The choreography is super hard. [Wumuti]

771
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,670
They are totally in sync. [Haruto]

772
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,700
What is this? [Park Min Seok]

773
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,920
They totally destroyed the stage. [Solji]

774
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,070
That was good. [Kim Tae Rae]

775
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,470
They were so in sync. [Lin Shi Yuan]

776
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,890
As expected from Jellyfish. [Wang Yan Hong]

777
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,150
Group K didn't disappoint. [Krystian]

778
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,100
Group K was strong as expected. [Chen Yu Geng]

779
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,780
I really thought the stage was going to break. [Lee Hwan Hee]

780
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,420
Sometimes being tall can be a disadvantage when dancing. [Lee Hwan Hee]

781
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,490
But that wasn't the case for any of them. [Lee Hwan Hee]

782
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,400
They used it to their advantage. [Lee Hwan Hee]

783
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,750
They made every movement seem bigger. [Lee Hwan Hee]

784
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,830
- Only... [Kim Tae Rae]
- They put the focus on their performance. [Park Min Seok]

785
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,390
The center member played a huge role. [Park Gun Wook]

786
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,090
They did the choreography justice. [Lip J]

787
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,870
- Hey, you made good choreography. [Back Koo Young]
- Seriously, it's so cool. [Lip J]

788
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,570
They reminded me of Master Young Joon. [Lee Dong Yeol]

789
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,540
Seriously. [Lee Hwan Hee]

790
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,640
Let us discuss. [Lee Seok Hoon]

791
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,930
I think they're good, don't you agree? [Lip J]

792
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,540
- Can we see another dance from you, Gun Wook? [Choi Young Joon]
- Yes?

793
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,090
Well... [Park Gun Wook]

794
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,020
I'll dance to SEVENTEEN'S "HOT."

795
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,250
"HOT"?

796
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,940
Another dance
[He made the choreography for "HOT."]

797
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,490
by Master Young Joon? [Solji]

798
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:09,240
He's basically challenging you now, Young Joon. [Back Koo Young]

799
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,610
Please play the first verse. [Park Gun Wook]

800
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,330
I'll dance to it. [Park Gun Wook]

801
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,770
Daebak. [Wang Yan Hong]

802
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,360
You know the beat is [Choi Young Joon]

803
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,510
- a little hard at first, right? [Choi Young Joon]
- Yes, I can do it. [Park Gun Wook]

804
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:23,500
Okay. Make sure you get it right. [Choi Young Joon]

805
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,840
[Will he satisfy the original choreographer Choi Young Joon?]

806
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,780
He's so powerful. [Kim Tae Rae]

807
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,920
This guy is good. [Jay]

808
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,550
He's satisfied. [Kim Tae Rae]

809
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,330
That was cool. [Ma Jing Xiang]

810
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,970
He's a monster. [Han Yu Jin]

811
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,330
His arms are like whips. [Yoo Seung Eon]

812
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:12,130
Our bones will break if we dance like that.

813
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:17,340
He might actually be better than you, Young Joon. [Back Koo Young]

814
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,130
[Laughing]

815
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,930
Are they looking down on me? Do they not respect me?

816
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,330
No, that's not it. [Back Koo Young]

817
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:27,510
I meant he's got a long way to go compared to you. [Back Koo Young]

818
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,650
First of all, you can't compare him to me.

819
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,960
Yes, he's right. [Park Gun Wook]

820
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,230
I'm incomparable.

821
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:36,060
But you were great. I have high hopes for you. [Choi Young Joon]

822
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,820
Thank you.

823
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,570
He's only a teenager, but he's overflowing with confidence. [Back Koo Young]

824

- What do you think they'll get? [Kum Jun Hyeon]
- All Star. [Wumuti]

826
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,230
I think most of them are going to get four stars. [Na Kamden]

827

But it was hard to hear the vocalists clearly. [ONESTAR]

846

There were parts in the song where they could relax. [Lee Seok Hoon]

847

But they were dancing so hard. [Lee Seok Hoon]

I couldn't really hear them sing. [Lee Seok Hoon]

849

We'll see their exact skills if we separate them. [Back Koo Young]

850
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,590
They looked better because they were together. [Back Koo Young]

I thought they'd all get All Star. [Takuto]

855
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,940
But after seeing them getting three stars [Takuto]

856

I don't know what to expect from Group G. [Jang Yeo Jun]

867
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:44,520
I think they'll have different charms and strengths from Group K. [Jang Yeo Jun]

868
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,080
The scary part is that I don't know what to expect. [Jang Yeo Jun]

can we quickly check our formation? [Haruto]

886

- Yes, quickly please.
- Thank you.

887

- Okay.

Then use your intuition for the rest. [Haruto]

Yes, of course.

895

- They're very peculiar. [Han Seo Bin]
- They need to be really good after all this. [Cha Woong Ki]

896
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,920
I've never seen anyone rehearse on stage in an audition program.

897
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,040
That's exactly what I'm saying.

898

- Yeah, I'm so disappointed.
- It fell earlier on, right?

00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,550
(He basically means he's crazy good)

1163
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,050
Wow, Jay, man! You can sing, bro!

1164
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,560
- Thank you.
- Really.

1165
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,360
I loved it when you harmonized earlier.

1166
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:21,020
[Trainee Jay's harmony filled the stage]

1167
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,160
Jay, you're excellent.

1168
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,160
He's got star quality.

1169
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,280
The USA was a strong team.

1170
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,670
They're too powerful.

1171
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:31,300
I think they'll both get above 3 stars.

1172
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,970
Or even All Star.

1173
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:35,530
I'll announce the result.

1174
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,860
[The result of Group G's Team USA?]

1175
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,440
I think they both will bet All Star.

1176
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,040
I think they'll get All Star no matter what.

1177
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:49,720
All Star. Jay, congratulations.

1178
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,750
[Jae: All Star, Na Kamden: 3 star]

1179
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:59,100
If all these talented guys from all over the world get into K-Pop...

1180
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,840
Thank you so much.

1181
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,080
Thank you!

1182
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,450
- Good job!
- I'll work hard!

1183
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:05,680
Goodbye!

1184
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,670
The American kids are bowing 90 degrees like that?

1185
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:14,510
You did well. Great job.

1186
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,320
I still can't believe it. [Jay]

1187
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,660
[Staring]

1188
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:22,130
To keep getting All Star,

1189
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:26,960
I will do my best and show that through skill and hard work,

1190
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,960
being a star is completely possible. [Jay]

1191
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:35,810
We'll take a quick break.

1192
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:40,240
[The trainees leave the studio while taking a break.]

1193
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,340
[The place where the trainees visit the most during the break is...]

1194
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:46,910
[The make-up room prepared for each group]

1195
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:49,320
Wow, I'm not looking too good.

1196
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,690
[The K Group and Group G trainees are checking their visual state]

1197
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,270
Everyone has an idol body here. [Kim Min Seong]

1198
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:55,540
Takuto is so cute. [Ollie]

1199
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:57,190
Yeah, he's so cute. [Zhang Hao]

1200
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:01,120
[Trainees share how they really feel in their private space.]
- So handsome.
- Why is everyone so handsome?

1201
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,560
Group G is quite stronger than we thought. [Park Min Seok]

1202
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,160
Everyone in Group G is good at dancing. [Jung Ho Jin]

1203
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,140
I was so shocked by Group G's skill. [Oh Seong Min]

1204
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,410
Why? Why are they so good?

1205
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:12,610
Our Global Team is so good. [Keita]

1206
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:14,890
Those who are bad in Group K are really bad. [Anthony]

1207
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:20,730
In terms of points, I don't think there's much difference between us. [Wen Ye Chen]

1208
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:24,280
Group G trainees are pretty good, but

1209
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,560
Group K is superior. [Park Gun Wook]

1210
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,390
It's K-Pop.

1211
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:31,650
I'm confident Group K would be able to win. [Park Gun Wook]

1212
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:32,900
Isn't he being too proud? [Haruto]

1213
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,780
Group G will win by a landslide. [Riku]

1214
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:38,200
Group G can't beat Group K.

1215
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,470
Why? Because our roots are different. [Yoon Jong Woo]

1216
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:42,560
Wow, let's take them on. [Na Kamden]

1217
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,400
They can't keep up with Group K. [Choi Woo Jin]

1218
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:50,880
[The competition between the two groups is getting fierce.]

1219
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,130
Group K lacks nothing.

1220
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,700
Wow. All they have is confidence. That's great.

1221
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,200
[You can feel the tensions mounting backstage]

1222
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:04,890
[Getting ready to compete with their group's pride on the line, Group K Yue Hua vs. Group G Yue Hua]

1223
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:09,240
[Yue Hwa is divided in two. They are no longer one family.]

1224
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,580
Honestly speaking, Group K is a bit better. [Ji Yun Seo]

1225
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,180
Group K is so good at talking. But our Group G,

1226
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,900
we just show it, we just prove it.

1227
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,180
We don't talk. [Ricky]

1228
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:22,540
Let's go up on stage and see. Let's do it. [Zhang Hao]

1229
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,690
[Group G Yue Hua shows up first.]

1230
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,530
Yue Hua is here. [Yoon Jong Woo]

1231
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:30,880
[Everyone is expecting All Star. Group G Yue Hua is full of confidence.]

1232
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,110
It's Group G's first team full of All Star.

1233
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:34,810
All Star! [Qiu Sheng Yang]

1234
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:36,430
Full of confidence. [Winnie]

1235
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:38,390
[Meanwhile, Group K's mood is down.]

1236
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:39,750
[Pouting]

1237
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,230
Wow, their confidence... [Lee Jeong Hyeon]

1238
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:45,090
It looks like they gave themselves four stars to show their mindset of refusing to lose. [Lee Seung Hwan]

1239
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:47,390
We can't lose to them. [Jung Ho Jin]

1240
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:50,600
Will they beat Group K?

1241
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:55,790
Group G Yue Hua enters with the spotlight on them.

1242
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:57,240
Hello.

1243
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,050
[Welcome, Group G.]

1244
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:00,610
Hold up, hold up.

1245
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,140
- What's going on? [Solji]
- They're starting already? [ONESTAR]

1246
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:04,400
3, 2, 1. Finish them!

1247
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,330
[Setting the tone]

1248
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,240
[Loves it]

1249
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,610
Hello.

1250
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:14,810
We are Group G trainees from Yue Hua Entertainment.

1251
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:17,550
I'm the musical prodigy and ace leader, Zhang Hao. [Zhang Hao]

1252
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:21,530
I'm young and rich, tall and handsome, Ricky.

1253
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:23,120
Young and rich. [Lee Seok Hoon]

1254
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,190
I found my roommate. [Kim Min Hyuk]

1255
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:26,960
I'll sneak him a snack

1256
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,120
and say, "Let's be friends" in Japanese. [Lee Seung Hwan]

1257
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,630
He's Chinese. [Yoon Jong Woo]

1258
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:32,210
[I'm sorry.]

1259
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:34,280
I'm your chocolate.

1260
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:37,130
Ollie is... the youngest. [Ollie]

1261
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:40,280
He's the youngest. Ollie is the youngest.

1262
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,180
Please make some noise for us. Ollie is a bit nervous.

1263
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:45,660
Give him some applause! [Lee Seok Hoon]

1264
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,320
Thank you. [Zhang Hao]

1265
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,920
He's so cute. [Seo Won]

1266
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,250
I'm Brian, with a soft voice. [Brian]

1267
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,420
Wow, he's so handsome.

1268
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,680
Wow, he's really handsome. [Choi Young Joon]

1269
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:57,810
Trainee Zhang Hao, you said you were a musical prodigy.

1270
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:59,750
What did you do before you started training to be an idol? [ONESTAR]

1271
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:04,930
I was attending university as a music education major. [Zhang Hao]

1272
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:06,720
Whoa!

1273
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,590
I majored in violin.

1274
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:14,440
I also learned how to play the viola, piano, and cello.

1275
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:18,160
What I want to do is music.

1276
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:23,820
I entered a music education university and am currently in my third year.

1277
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:28,680
I also got my certificate to teach as a music teacher at a school.

1278
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:33,290
However, I've been influenced by K-Pop culture since high school,

1279
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:36,250
so I ended up loving K-Pop music and culture.

1280
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:39,330
So, I gave up my opportunity to become a music teacher

1281
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:41,520
and decided to come to Korea and become a trainee.

1282
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:46,590
If I can appear on the show, I'll give 200% effort.

1283
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:50,920
And I will seize the opportunity to debut. [Zhang Hao]

1284
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:55,080
[Trainee Zhang Hao is on stage with the dream of becoming a K-Pop idol.]

1285
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:58,450
Then do you have any musical talents that you can show us? [ONESTAR]

1286
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:01,440
Yes, I brought my violin. [Zhang Hao]

1287
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,350
Violin.

1288
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:05,990
Wow, whoa!

1289
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:08,190
It looks like a very expensive violin. [Solji]

1290
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:10,740
- He looks cool from just holding it. [Kim Min Hyuk]
- So cool. [Sung Han Bin]

1291
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,880
By chance, how much does that violin cost?

1292
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:20,030
Well, it's not that expensive.

1293
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:22,740
- Around 10 million won?
- 10 million won!

1294
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:24,540
[Did I mishear?]

1295
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,620
Wow.

1296
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:29,020
I guess Ricky bought it for him since he's young and rich. [Yoon Jong Woo]

1297
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:31,010
Just a moment. [Zhang Hao]

1298
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:34,340
[Tuning the violin]

1299
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:36,330
It sounds good already. [Lee Seung Hwan]

1300
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,100
[Ready]

1301
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:41,900
[Expectations are high]

1302
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,930
So cool. [Lee Hoe Taek]

1303
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,830
[Boys Planet Mini-concert. Beethoven's Violin Sonata, "Spring," echoes throughout the studio.]

1304
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:53,700
So elegant... [Wen Ye Chen]

1305
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:57,000
Wow, I just got goosebumps. [Lee Seung Hwan]

1306
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,480
[Cheers to a sophisticated performance]

1307
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,530
[Cheers to us as well]

1308
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,420
To your beautiful eyes, cheers.

1309
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:08,720
He's so good! [Mun Jung Hyun]

1310
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,020
[Touched]

1311
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:12,830
We ended up seeing a concert before they even started their stage. [Yoon Jong Woo]

1312
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:15,490
Shall we now see their stage right away? [Lee Seok Hoon]

1313
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:16,940
Fighting!

1314
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,400
Fighting!

1315
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,720
[Glaring]

1316
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,870
I feel like this team will do well. [Nice]

1317
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:23,400
I'm looking forward to Yue Hua. [Haruto]

1318
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,210
How well will they perform? [Jung Hwan Rok]

1319
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,100
Oh, look at the look in their eyes. [Choi Young Joon]

1320
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,390
Let's really do well, okay? [Zhang Hao]

1321
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:33,390
We have to win.

1322
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:35,840
We have beat Group K Yue Hua and everyone else in Group K. [Ricky]

1323
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,070
Right.

1324
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:39,970
We may all be foreigners, but we need to have K-Pop pride. [Zhang Hao]

1325
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:43,120
So that Group G can get more stars. [Ricky]

1326
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:48,930
We all have the same goal which is K-Pop,

1327
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:52,070
so we want to do well on stage. [Ricky]

1328
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:54,950
Our Group G Yue Hua team is confident.

1329
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:59,000
Please watch how we express K-Pop. [Zhang Hao]

1330
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:03,820
[Maximum Confidence. The stage that Group G Yue Hua team will perform is...]

1331
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:11,580
They're good! [Park Min Seok]

1332
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,570
[Kick It (by NCT 127): Ricky, Brian, Ollie, Zhang Hao]

1333

Ollie!

1334
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,210
Wow, what's this! [Jang Yeo Jun]

1335
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,500
Their teamwork is amazing. [Qiu Sheng Yang]

1336
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:31,100
What's with these guys? [Park Min Seok]

1337
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,250
Their moves are so powerful. [Chen Jian Yu]

1338
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,540
So cool! [Qiu Sheng Yang]

1339
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,570
[Group G is sure of its victory in the battle with Yue Hua.]

1340
01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:46,870
Daebak.

1341
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:48,880
As expected of Yue Hua. [Jay]

1342
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,290
[On the other hand, Group K]

1343
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:52,250
[Headache]

1344
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,860
They're really good. [Park Min Seok]

1345
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,260
They're so good at dancing. [Jung Ho Jin]

1346
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:58,490
I feel like I finally heard high notes that sound good. [Lee Seung Hwan]

1347
01:08:58,490 --> 01:09:00,660
They came with their A-game. [Yoon Jong Woo]

1348
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:03,460
[Group G Yue Hua's team stage is praised by everyone.]

1349
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:06,490
Since it's similar to what we've seen monitoring them,

1350
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:09,390
I think we have a good chance against them. [Yoo Seung Eon]

1351
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:10,940
Let's go, let's go.

1352
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:15,260
Great job. They said you were nervous, Ollie, but it was all a lie.

1353
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,300
Goodness, you were so good. [Lee Seok Hoon]

1354
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:20,330
[Not nervous at all, younest Ollie completes the stage perfectly.]

1355
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:22,320
Ollie, you did really well. [Lee Seok Hoon]

1356
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,700
Thank you.

1357
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,720
Gosh, I think he's so cute.

1358
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,240
First, you sang with emphasis, so we were able to hear you well,

1359
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,610
and your expressiveness was good too.

1360
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:33,390
- I think it was pretty decent overall. [Lee Seok Hoon]
- Their vocal and dancing balance is good. [Choi Young Joon]

1361
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:36,530
I feel like all four of them will keep their four stars. [Lee Ye Dam]

1362
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:39,140
I will announce the results.

1363
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:40,920
Shall we start with the youngest? [Back Koo Young]

1364
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,960
Ollie is the youngest?

1365
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,220
Yes.

1366
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:46,980
Trainee Ollie, [Back Goo Young]

1367
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:48,870
We need more four stars. [Jay]

1368
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:50,320
Please, please... [Chen Kuan Jui]

1369
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:53,270
you got three stars.

1370
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:54,800
Thank you.

1371
01:09:55,570 --> 01:09:58,530
[3 stars?]

1372
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:01,110
And Trainees Brian and Ricky,

1373
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:04,440
you both received 3 stars. [Back Koo Young]

1374
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,800
Okay.

1375
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,220
I guess it's really difficult to get All Star. [Han Yu Seop]

1376
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:10,950
And the eldest, Trainee Zhang Hao. [Back Koo Young]

1377
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:12,900
[Nervous]

1378
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,670
[Please...]

1379
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:16,680
[Even Group K is nervous about the results]

1380
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:20,150
Congratulations, you got All Star.

1381
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:22,120
Yeah, All Star!

1382
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,130
You got All Star.

1383
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:25,580
[Make some noise!]

1384
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,730
Thank you.

1385
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:30,680
Thank you! [Zhang Hao]

1386
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,650
Zhang Hao has talent and confidence. [Lip J]

1387
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:34,360
It looks like he has leadership as well. [Solji]

1388
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,780
His dancing...

1389
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:37,420
- He's the type to dance even better, right?
- It's not bad, right?

1390
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:40,220
- He's the type to dance even better as time goes on.
- Everyone agrees on giving ace leader Zhang Hao All Star.

1391
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,710
Hyung, you worked so hard.

1392
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:45,980
Thank you.

1393
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,310
We couldn't have done it without you. [Ollie]

1394
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,510
We have to keep working hard.

1395
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:55,090
We're really just starting out now. [Zhang Hao]

1396
01:10:56,370 --> 01:11:00,370
I feel a bit of a bummer that the rest of our group got 3 stars,

1397
01:11:00,370 --> 01:11:03,750
but we did our best to put on a good performance.

1398
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:08,430
For the next evaluation, we'll all get All Star. [Zhang Hao]

1399
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,520
[Meanwhile, Group K Yue Hua is about to get on stage]

1400
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,550
They got 3, 3, 3, All Star. [Ji Yun Seo]

1401
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:15,930
Let's all get All Star.
Yeah, let's all get All Star.

1402
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:17,480
- One, two, three! [Ji Yun Seo]
- Fighting!

Nice! Great!

So good.

1406

The studio is stirred up by Group K Yue Hua's entrance.

1407
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,690
Whoa, what's going on? Wow.

1408
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:28,200
Group K Yue Hua.

1409
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,690
Isn't this like a family feud, a turf war? [Lee Ye Dam]

1410
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:34,280
A friendly competition, wow. [Seo Won]

1411
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,450
This is all out war. [Jung Hwan Rok]

1412
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:37,340
Don't you think Group K Yue Hua will do better? [Jang Yeo Jun]

1413
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:38,370
I know, right?

1414
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:40,240
[Nervous for them]

1415
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,950
This is going to be so much fun.

1416
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:43,970
I want to spectate this fight. [Lee Seung Hwan]

1417
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:46,660
[Entering in the midst of the tension]

1418
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:48,990
- Wow.
- Look at their proportions.

1419
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:50,120
Their visuals are out of this world... [Haruto]

1420
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:53,720
Wow, who are these guys? [Onestar]

1421
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,170
They are all full of stars as well. [Wumuti]

1422
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:58,070
I guess they're really confident. [Cha Woong Gi]

1423
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:00,610
[Will they be able to put on a good stage to match their overflowing confidence?]

1424
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:02,530
We will introduce ourselves.

1425
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:04,810
Hello.

1426
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:07,470
We are Group K trainees from Yue Hwa Entertainment. [Kim Gyu Vin]

1427
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,700
I'm the energetic dragon leader, Ji Yun Seo.

1428
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,200
I'm the main vocalist with a titanium voice, Yoo Seung Eon.

1429
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,790
I'm the charismatic golden youngest member, lovely Han Yu Jin.

1430
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:19,000
I'm the genius you want to see every day, Kim Gyu Vin.

1431
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,510
Two, three!

1432
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:22,700
Let's go!

1433
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,160
Let's go! Let's go! [Jang Yeo Jun]

1434
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,590
They've got a good vibe. [Jay]

1435
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:31,860
There is one person that got All Star among your friends that you trained with. [Lee Seok Hoon]

1436

[The shining All Star Zhang Hao]

1437
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:37,260
How many of you do you think will be able to get All Star? [Lee Seok Hoon]

1438
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:39,880
We will all get All Star together.

1439
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,320
We will all get All Star together.

1440
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:45,870
They're greedy. [Zhang Hao]

1441
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:48,330
I seem to remember that Group G Yue Hua team saying that

1442
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:53,410
they think that Han Yu Jin will get All Star. [Lee Seok Hoon]

1443
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,700
Which trainee are you most wary about on the Group K Yue Hua team

1444
01:12:55,700 --> 01:13:00,040
in terms of their skills? [Lee Seok Hoon]

1445
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,200
[The question that made these four nervous]

1446
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,740
[Let's hear what they have to say.]

1447
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:06,530
I would say our youngest, Yu Jin. [Zhang Hao]

1448
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:08,640
Oh, Yu Jin!

1449
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,990
I guess I should try even harder. [Han Yu Jin]

1450
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:13,540
He's the youngest trainee. [Lee Seok Hoon]

1451
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:14,990
Oh my gosh, he's 16? [Solji]

1452

[Really shocked]

1453
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:19,030
- What year were you born?
- I was born in '07.

1454

[Lee Dong Yeol / Mid-twenties]

1456
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:24,840
You got too visibly shocked. [Lee Hwan Hee]

1457
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:33,150
[Lee Hoe Taek / Thirties]
[No explanations added]

1458
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:35,820
He got to appear on such a good show like this at such a young age... [Kim Ji Woong]

1459
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,600
[Envious]

1460
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,720
Shall we see your stage? [Lee Seok Hoon]

1461
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,280
Group K, fighting!

1462
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,200
Group K, let's not lose!

[Watching carefully]

1466

The youngest member is leading the performance aspects. [Back Koo Young]

1467
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:55,960
Seung Eon hyung, come forward just a bit. [Han Yu Jin]

1468
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,600
- A bit forward?
- Yeah, that's good.

1469
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,260
So he knows how to look at the formation, I see. [Lip J]

1470
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:04,390
What will they perform? [Jang Yeo Jun]

1471
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:06,640
What is it? What is it? [Park Min Seok]

1472
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,420
I like the look in their eyes. [Solji]

1473
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,840
Just from the look in their eyes, they're already heroes. [Lip J]

1474
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,400
Nice. [Back Koo Young]

1475
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:22,190
Let's see how much better they are than the Group G Yue Hua team. [Lee Ye Dam]

1476
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:23,910
I'm more nervous than when we performed. [Zhang Hao]

1477
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:25,770
Yeah, I wonder why we feel that way... [Ricky]

1478
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,650
[Getting more nervous]

1479
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:37,720
Oh!

1480
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:47,720
[What will Group K Yue Hua's stage be like?]

1481
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:02,150
They are right on the beat. [Choi Young Joon]

- becoming a man.
- Whoa, how did you know?

1574
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:46,100
To be honest, this choreo is about the process of a young wolf

1575
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:50,240
growing into an adult wolf.

1576
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:51,360

01:36:41,690 --> 01:36:44,480
It felt like a retreat talent show.

1840
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:48,580
I was listening to you at first with my eyes closed.

1841
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:50,610
I could not keep listening.

1842
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:55,360
They don't know how to sing at all.

1843
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:01,720
Have you monitored this song?

1844
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,490
What were your thoughts about it?

1845
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:06,470
You were singing flat for the majority of the song.

1846
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:08,490
If we keep going like this,

1847
01:37:08,490 --> 01:37:09,650
it's going to be really difficult,

1848
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:13,370
Going up on stage without knowing what you need to fix

1849
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:16,310
means that you are lacking in preparation.

1850
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:18,580
Wow, she's very direct.

1851
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:23,300
The thing that made me sad about your performances is that

1852
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:25,710
your facial expressions are great.

1853
01:37:25,710 --> 01:37:27,810
But you can't just have good facial expressions.

1854
01:37:27,810 --> 01:37:31,930
If your vocals can't keep up, then it looks like you're doing it without any fundamentals.

1855
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:34,790
So, I feel like that's acting as a major detractor to your performances.

1856
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:37,090
The other trainees here as well, you understand, right?

1857
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:39,380
This is a place where we're picking singers.

1858
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:40,950
You need to sing.

1859
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:43,780
In songs, there are lyrics.

1860
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:48,640
So far, most of you have performed songs for us, but not many of you have sung.

1861
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:52,680
I've been watching for several hours now, and it just makes me sad.

1862
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:57,590
It's important to think about which words you want to express in the line you are singing.

1863
01:37:57,590 --> 01:38:00,270
Understand?

1864
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:03,190
- That was really good.
- It was something that was really needed.

1865
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:05,630
I should really take what the masters say to heart.

1866
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:09,030
I am planning on working hard

1867
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:12,150
to follow the masters' advice and teachings.

1868
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:17,250
The sun has already set on the Star Level Test studio.

1869
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:19,070
Good luck.

1870
01:38:19,070 --> 01:38:20,920
[Trainees are leaving to prepare for their stages.]

1871
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,190
We haven't been called yet, right?

1872
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:25,290
When are we going to be called...

1873
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:27,890
At this rate, they might go last.

1874
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:29,890
[Using the spare time to practice]

1875
01:38:29,890 --> 01:38:32,250
Which trainees haven't gone yet?

1876
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:34,200
Oh, there's a lot!

1877
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,870
[Many trainees are still waiting for their turn to perform]

1878
01:38:35,870 --> 01:38:38,330
What did we listen to so far, then?

1879
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:39,890
Their throats might get clogged like this.

1880
01:38:39,890 --> 01:38:41,430
You should keep warming up your throats.

1881
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:43,840
Don't fall asleep because your throat might close up.

1882
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,600
- It's tiring, right?
- I'm sleepy.

1883
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:51,420
[Which trainee will perform next while everyone is getting tired?]

1884
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:53,300
Group G's solo stage.

1885
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:57,740
It is the stage of Trainee Seok Matthew from Canada.

1886
01:38:57,740 --> 01:39:00,420
- Oh, Canada!
- Canada!

1887
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:02,040
Matthew!

1888
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:04,390
My name connects with his, Jeon Woo Seok Matthew.

1889
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:10,300
Let's go, Matthew!

1890
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:12,060
You can do it!

1891
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:14,710
[Bright]

1892
01:39:14,710 --> 01:39:17,620
Oh, his smile is so nice.

1893
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:20,480
[His bright smile lights up the studio]

1894
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,390
- So cute.
- He's very bright.

1895
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:23,910
You have a great first impression.

1896
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:27,630
- Thank you.
- Doesn't he kind of remind you of Xiumin?

1897
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:29,560
Oh, yeah, there's some Min Seok in him.

1898
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:30,820
Oh, thank you.

1899
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:32,550
You're Min Seok Matthew.

1900
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:34,530
He supposedly looks like Xiumin from EXO.

1901
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:40,340
He had such fair complexion and a pretty smile.

1902
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:42,240
Hello.

1903
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:47,450
I'm in Group G from Canada, and capable of three languages...

1904
01:39:47,450 --> 01:39:50,560
I'm Trainee Seok Matthew from MNH.

1905
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,720
- You're capable of speaking three languages?
- I can speak English,

1906
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:55,150
Korean, and French.

1907
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:56,310
Oh, French.

1908
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:59,490
Oh, French? That's cool.

1909
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:01,040
Since he's from Canada.

1910
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,730
Then can we hear you speak a little bit of French?
[All of a sudden?]

1911
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:07,320
Talk to us a bit in French, and tell us how you're feeling today.

1912
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:09,640
Bonjour.

1913
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:14,700
I'm sorry, I suddenly got excited. I mean, excited.

1914
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:17,360
Nervous, you're nervous, you're nervous, you got nervous.
You don't know how to speak French, right?

1915
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:19,290
Give me a moment.

1916
01:40:19,290 --> 01:40:20,930
[Laughing]

1917
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:22,980
He suddenly became unable to speak it.

1918
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:25,360
[A second attempt at speaking French]

1919
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:29,090
[Coolness level increasing]

1920
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:31,610
I guess nobody's capable of interpreting it in real time.

1921
01:40:31,610 --> 01:40:32,920
There's no real time interpreter.

1922
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:35,970
[Fast forward 3 times - "I didn't get to practice for very long, but I will do my best."]

1923
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:41,200
- Thank you for those great words.
- That was sufficient.

1924
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:44,890
We were able to get what you were trying to say.

1925
01:40:44,890 --> 01:40:47,350
Which position are you most confident in?

1926
01:40:47,350 --> 01:40:49,520
To be honest,

1927
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:53,300
I was a bit confident in dancing,

1928
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:55,400
[Eyes light up]

1929
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:57,690
But everyone here was so good, so it's a bit ambiguous.

1930
01:40:57,690 --> 01:40:59,570
It's a bit ambiguous.

1931
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:01,170
[Ambiguous Matthew lost his confidence seeing others perform]

1932
01:41:01,170 --> 01:41:04,360
- He says it's ambiguous.
- He's so cute.

1933
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:07,980
Fighting.

1934
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:10,620
Let's go, Matthew!

1935
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:12,890
You can do it! Fighting.

Sung Han Bin of Group K is looking proudly at Seok Matthew of Group G.

1937
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:20,040
What, 3 stars?

1938
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:21,600
What are you saying?

1939
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:25,300
You should have at least 6 or 7 stars.

1940
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:27,870
[They are having a conversation as if they're old friends]

1941
01:41:27,870 --> 01:41:31,700
I spent some time as a Cube trainee with Matthew,

1942
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:35,210
and we lived together in the same dorms for a long time,

1943
01:41:35,210 --> 01:41:37,860
so we are good friends,

1944
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:42,130
and the fact that we could do something together to achieve the same dream

1945
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:45,300
felt like a dream.

1946
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:47,790
But I feel like I'm going to drop to 2 stars.

1947
01:41:47,790 --> 01:41:50,350
What are you saying?
No, I'm really scared.

1948
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:53,490
Why would you get scared? Just do as you've always done.

1949
01:41:53,490 --> 01:41:57,280
He definitely took good care of me.

1950
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:00,210
Whenever I thought about just going back to Canada,

1951
01:42:00,210 --> 01:42:03,770
Han Bin hyung would talk with me

1952
01:42:03,770 --> 01:42:07,310
and so I was able to endure as a trainee,

1953
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:09,360
thanks to Han Bin hyung.

1954

1957
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:45,660
It's so clean!

He's really good.

1963
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:44,290
He did well.

[Even the masters acknowledge his vocals and performance]

1965
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:49,110

1966
01:43:49,110 --> 01:43:51,540
His performance was so immaculate.

[What's the meaning of these tears?]

1969
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:09,540
I always told him that everything would go well,

1970
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:12,000
and that we can show them our talent on stage.

1971
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:17,970
So when I saw him performing on stage and being so happy...

1972
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,700
He did well.

1973
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,850
- You're so good.
- Hey, Matthew.

1974
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:28,570
You sing well.

I love you.

1977
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:36,380
He just suddenly confessed his love to him.

1978
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:41,740
There are many vocals that end up getting a bit flat,

1979
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:43,670
and then are vocals who end up getting a bit sharp,

1980
01:44:43,670 --> 01:44:45,790
but the latter tends to sound better.

1981
01:44:45,790 --> 01:44:47,840
Matthew, you are the latter case.

1982
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:50,980
And so if you train and practice your vocals more,

1983
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:53,630
you have the potential to become a much better vocalist.

1984
01:44:53,630 --> 01:44:55,370
So it was nice to listen to such clean vocals.

1985
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:57,510
Thank you.

1986
01:44:57,510 --> 01:44:59,120
You were generally jumping up quite high.

1987
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:04,260
But I didn't seem to hear much instability in your vocals while you were jumping around.

1988
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:07,670
That's right. That means he's capable of controlling his pitch unconsciously.

1989
01:45:07,670 --> 01:45:09,630
It's a born talent.

1990
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:11,730
It's really hard to sing while jumping around.

1991
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:13,790
I will announce the results.

Well, he looks quite handsome.

2010
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:00,540
He looks clean-cut.

2011
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:04,750
I heard you were active as a dancer before you started training to be an idol.

2012
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:05,730
Yes, that's right.

2013
01:46:05,730 --> 01:46:07,380
- What?
- Oh, really?

2014
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:12,480
I was active as a dancer for two years, specializing in waacking and tutting.

2015
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,780
Oh, tutting!

2016
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:18,780
You dare talk about waacking in front of Master Lip J?

2017
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:21,600
[How dare you?]

2018
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,470
Can I see it?

2019
01:46:23,470 --> 01:46:26,040
I can't wait to see it.

2020
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:28,930
I mainly focused on tutting that utilized my arms.

2021
01:46:28,930 --> 01:46:29,980
Wow, it's so clean.

2022
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:33,930
And I did a lot of waacking as well.

2023
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:35,770
Thank you.

2024
01:46:35,770 --> 01:46:37,570
[I can't back down!]

2025
01:46:37,570 --> 01:46:39,320
His lung capacity is so good.

2026
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,390
As expected of Master Lip J!

2027
01:46:41,390 --> 01:46:45,290
- How about you and I have a little back-and-forth?
- It would be an honor.

2028
01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:48,340
To think that I can see this in person!

2029
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:49,500
[I'm so nervous!]

2030
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,140
What song are you going to play for us?

2031
01:46:51,140 --> 01:46:52,790
Wow, it's such an honor...

2032
01:46:52,790 --> 01:46:54,430
I want to see it quickly!

2033
01:46:54,430 --> 01:46:55,680
Wow, daebak.

2034
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:57,580
This isn't a dream, right?

2035
01:46:57,580 --> 01:46:58,840
Oh gosh, it's such an honor.

2036
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:01,730
- Wow, she's so cool.
- Wow, daebak.

2037
01:47:01,730 --> 01:47:03,000
I'm able to see this with my own eyes?

2038
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,570
I feel like this is going to be a legendary moment.

2039
01:47:04,570 --> 01:47:06,750
But gosh, what am I going to do? Your face is so small and pretty compared to mine.

2040
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:08,590
Oh, no, that's not true.

2041
01:47:08,590 --> 01:47:10,320
I'm going to record this.

2042

He's crazy!

2046
01:47:58,650 --> 01:48:01,140
It looks like Lip J will need to get serious!

2047
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:07,840
Wow, he's so good!

2048
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,270
Wow...

2049
01:48:35,990 --> 01:48:39,130
[They're both undoubtedly great]

2050
01:48:39,130 --> 01:48:40,600
Thank you.

2051
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:42,130
Legend.

2052
01:48:42,130 --> 01:48:44,490
It was the match of the century.

2053
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:46,030
That was crazy!

2054
01:48:47,350 --> 01:48:50,310
So powerful. Goodness.

2055
01:48:50,310 --> 01:48:52,600
I feel like I'm at a different show right now.

2056
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:55,040
- Is this what waacking was supposed to be?
- Did you see the slow-motion move?

2057
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:59,000
Wow, he was so cool!

2058
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,720
I mean, just from the look in his eyes, I thought it was Street Man Fighter.

2059
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:05,000
- You're quite amazing.
- You were so cool.

2060
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:09,080
When I look into someone's eyes, I can tell what they're thinking.

2061
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:12,090
But when it became his part to dance, his eyes were like, "How dare you?"

2062
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,560
[How dare you?]

2063
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:18,740
- How dare you?
- Gosh, he's so cool.

2064
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:22,130
Seeing here on your application, you didn't check the box for vocals as something you're confident in.

2065
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:24,060
Then does that mean you're not confident in singing?

2066
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:28,640
I wanted to learn to get better at singing here, so I couldn't check the box.

2067
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:31,710
Okay. Prepare your stage, please.

2068
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:33,810
[Sung Han Bin, fighting!]

2069
01:49:33,810 --> 01:49:36,620
Han Bin, let's do this.

2070
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:42,360
While I was training as a trainee,

2071
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:47,010
I was lacking in many areas, and I ended up leaving my agency.

2072
01:49:47,010 --> 01:49:49,490
[After quitting as a trainee, he spent two years as a backup dancer.]

2073
01:49:49,490 --> 01:49:52,250
While I was working as a backup dancer,

2074
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:55,510
I wasn't sure if I could dream

2075
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:57,560
of being an idol again.

2076
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:04,000
Since I gained my first opportunity to get the spotlight,

2077
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,840
I will try my best to become the main hero.

2078
01:50:11,230 --> 01:50:13,970
[Beautiful Beautiful (by ONF): Sung Han Bin]

2079
01:50:13,970 --> 01:50:16,190
Look at his timing on the beat!

2080
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:25,370
Wow, he's so good.

2081
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:35,220
- Wow, he's so good.
- He's singing this live, right?

2082
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:55,750
He's so cool.

2083
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,790
It's so clean.

2084
01:51:11,730 --> 01:51:13,790
He's singing this live, too.

2085
01:51:15,090 --> 01:51:16,760
He's good.

2086
01:51:56,260 --> 01:51:58,020
He's just so good.

2087
01:51:58,020 --> 01:51:59,040
What is this?

2088
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:01,090
Why didn't he check the box for vocals?

2089
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:03,280
- Wow, he's so cool.
- I nearly fell in love with him.

2090
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:05,760
[His unexpected vocal skills surprised everyone]

2091
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:06,970
His vocals are ridiculous.

2092
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:08,580
Trainee Sung Han Bin uses a head voice.

2093
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:11,410
Right?
- His sound goes into his head voice.

2094
01:52:11,410 --> 01:52:13,280
The one who can use head voice.

2095
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:16,650
That vocal skill is really good when used well,

2096
01:52:16,650 --> 01:52:18,610
but if used badly, it can really make everything collapse.

2097
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:20,560
However, Han Bin

2098
01:52:21,870 --> 01:52:24,820
is using it very well, intelligently.

2099
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:27,770

- You got 3 stars.

It's so difficult to get All Stars.

2118
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:14,900
Honestly, when you were waacking with Master Lip J,

2119
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:18,370
we were able to see your charms really well,

2120
01:53:18,370 --> 01:53:23,840
but during your actual performance, those charms didn't stand out as much,

2121
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:26,120
so there was just a bit lacking there.

2122
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:28,330
But still, you did really well.

2123
01:53:28,330 --> 01:53:32,380
Great job. You can work hard to train with Matthew in the same 3-star class.

2124
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:34,510
And I'll fill in the remaining star in the future.

Great job.

2126

I won't just stop here saying that I did it,

2127
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:43,830

01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:39,100
Honestly, I obviously am a bit afraid.

2179
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:43,570
I'm thinking of doing everything that I can to show myself as Lee Hoe Taek.

2180
01:57:43,570 --> 01:57:45,120
Hoe Taek sunbaenim's on stage.

2181
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:46,570
The final boss.

2182
01:57:46,570 --> 01:57:47,990
Hello.

2183
01:57:47,990 --> 01:57:52,560
I'm Lee Hoe Taek of Group K from Cube.

2184
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:54,500
Welcome.

2185
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:56,760
He's here.

2186
01:57:56,760 --> 01:58:02,740
Honestly, we know him better as Hui rather than Lee Hoe Taek.

2187
01:58:02,740 --> 01:58:04,660
Is he in his 7th... 8th year since debut?

2188
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:06,470
Yeah, he should be in his 7th or 8th year since debut.

2189
01:58:06,470 --> 01:58:09,090
Wow, but to think that he would appear here again as a trainee...

2190
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:12,150
How is he a trainee?

2191
01:58:12,150 --> 01:58:14,020
Honestly, we can't compare to him.

2192
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:15,820
Yeah, how can we compare ourselves to him?

2193
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:19,060
He's someone who directs other idols as well.

2194
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:23,080
The people who are watching you can't help but have high expectations for you.

2195
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:26,090
Is there anything you want to say before your performance?

2196
01:58:26,090 --> 01:58:32,230
First, before I perform, I want to say one thing to the 97 trainees here.

2197
01:58:32,230 --> 01:58:35,850
I'm also here as a contestant, just like the rest of you,

2198
01:58:35,850 --> 01:58:37,570
so I came here determined.

2199
01:58:37,570 --> 01:58:40,640
So, I would like for you to also do your best to beat me,

2200
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:43,010
instead of getting intimidated by me

2201
01:58:43,010 --> 01:58:44,410
because I'm a sunbae or a hyung.

2202
01:58:44,410 --> 01:58:48,190
I would like for you all to just beat me.

2203
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:52,360
Respect, respect.

2204
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:56,240
How is he able to talk in such a cool way?

2205
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:58,120
So basically, he's saying, "Try and beat me."

2206
01:58:58,120 --> 01:59:03,100
Honestly, he's someone that would make sense appearing as a Master.

2207
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:06,220
So why did he appear in an audition program?

2208
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:16,060
I just want to hear that I'm good.

2209
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:21,910
In order to hear those words, I've spent over 10 years of my life

2210
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:25,250
on stage.

2211
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:28,540
Honestly, I don't remember how I performed.

2212
01:59:31,450 --> 01:59:35,520
I guess my actual skills will be exposed.

2213
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:40,040
[What will be the results of Lee Hoe Taek's challenge?]

2218
02:00:52,570 --> 02:00:55,660
[Group K from the birthplace of K-Pop has reason to be confident.]

2220

2224
02:01:15,230 --> 02:01:18,180
Based on the Signal Song Test, the star levels will be reassigned.

2225
02:01:18,180 --> 02:01:21,530
I will make sure to wear the All Star uniform.

2226
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:24,850
- I'll work my way up from the bottom.
- I need to give my all and practice.

2227
02:01:24,850 --> 02:01:26,630
I'm sure I will be promoted to All Star.

2228
02:01:26,630 --> 02:01:28,640
I will do the killing part.

2229
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:30,710
Are you tone-deaf?

2230
02:01:30,710 --> 02:01:32,250
Are you tone-deaf?

2231
02:01:32,250 --> 02:01:34,850
[But the process of preparing for the Signal Song Test is not as easy as they thought]

2232
02:01:35,830 --> 02:01:39,080
I wanted to show how much I had improved.

2233
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:42,110
[How will the trainees perform on Signal Song Test?]
