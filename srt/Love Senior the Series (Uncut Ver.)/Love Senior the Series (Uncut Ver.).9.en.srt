"Love Senior The Series"
(Episode 9)

2
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:56,157
(Previous Episode) Please forgive me.
It's been too long that we're angry at each other.

3
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:03,164
In the past, I never tried to understand you at all.

4
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,209
I'm the one who's been stubborn.

5
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,079
But why bracelet?

6
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:29,709
Well, if it's on the right wrist,
whenever you do something, you can see it all the time.

7
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,172
Maybe there might come a day
when you start to feel a bit unsure,

8
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,507
you will constantly think about me.

9
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,760
Even if I don’t see it,

10
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,387
I will always thinking about you.

11
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,939
I'm coming.

12
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,989
Gyo, what's wrong?

13
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,541
It's okay. It's okay.

14
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:34,560
Gyo, you have to tell me what's going on with you.

15
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,813
Why are you crying like this?

16
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,609
I'm worried about you like crazy.

17
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:47,990
It's good I came to take some stuffs first
before going to the hospital again.

18
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,576
Otherwise, what would you do?

19
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,462
Did you have a fight with her?

20
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:16,936
If you don't want to say anything,
just shake or nod your head. That's enough.

21
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,231
But you have to answer my questions.

22
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,693
Understand?

23
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,577
I won't ask why you fought with her.

24
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,664
But the way you are,

25
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,585
Did she hurt you physically?

26
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,973
Do you want to talk to her?
I'll call her for you.

27
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,365
It's okay, it's okay.

28
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,745
I'm right here.

29
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,611
How did I return to the room?

30
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,151
P'Gyo.

31
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:39,662
What's up?
I thought you died lying in bed.

32
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:52,258
Now, can you tell me, what madness you were in last night?
You were drunk like a dog.

33
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,347
I got dumped by P'Gyo.

34
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,890
What dump?

35
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,520
If you mean what P'Gyo did to you last night,

36
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,319
Then look at this.

37
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,994
Last night, P'Warang got hit at a crossroad.

38
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:23,414
That’s something important enough for
P'Gyo to dump you like that, huh?

39
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:24,957
P'Warang...

40
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:25,833
Survived.

41
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,338
She used up all the luck
she had collected throughout her life.

42
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:37,636
Good for her. P'Gyo might be there
to take care of her new girlfriend.

43
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:43,559
You rotten dog.
Help me slide to the next picture, please.

44
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:48,397
And would you please try to open your blind eyes
to see who's beside P'Warang.

45
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,995
Wait.

46
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:08,000
You're so envious.

47
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,586
You were wasting money for alcohol, for real.

48
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,513
You're really you.
You rotten dog.

49
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,769
Open up.

50
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,984
Hi.

51
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,612
Hello.

52
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,157
Didn't expect you'd come.

53
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,537
I feel relieved, seeing you greet us like this.

54
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,873
When I saw the car, I thought...

55
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,000
I can't die, you know.

56
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,671
The project isn't finished yet,
it's not even compiled into a book.

57
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:58,175
If I die now, Gyo would probably
scream all the way to hell.

58
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,972
Whoa, just thinking about it gives me goosebumps.

59
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:10,229
Be careful, you're still recovering,
don’t laugh too hard.

60
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:21,657
P'Warang, do you know where P'Gyo went?

61
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,909
I couldn't contact her at all.

62
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:32,418
Last night, we went back together around 11.
Didn’t you have something planned?

63
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:57,610
Jom! Last night,
did you carry me back to the dorm or not?

64
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,905
Uh, no, I didn't. I left you in the care of Belle.

65
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,700
You entrusted me to Belle?
What else happened?

66
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,536
Belle say that you walked to the dorm yourself.

67
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,371
I did walk myself?

68
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,664
Yeah.

69
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,922
That's it for now.

70
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:45,991
Hey, Belle, come out and meet me for a moment.
I have something to talk.

71
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,128
Whoops, that noodle shop.

72
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,505
Such a small portion!

73
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,799
That's because you're too big for that.

74
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,800
It's quite a lot.

75
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,843
Well, like you didn't order for extra.

76
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,554
Because it's tasty.

77
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:07,930
Hey.

78
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,890
Hey, it's P'Manao!

79
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,517
Go say hi to her.

80
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,518
You wanna go?

81
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,939
- Go ahead.
- Wait, I have to use the bathroom.

82
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,358
What happen?

83
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,449
Can you do it?

84
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,158
I can.

85
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,201
I don't believe you.

86
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,290
- Oh, you don't need to read the instructions.
- Let's go.

87
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,166
Hello, hi there.

88
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,960
Hi!

89
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,925
See you.

90
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,389
Bye.

91
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,434
Bye.

92
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,769
Bye, see you.

93
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:21,462
(Gyo, where are you?)
(I'm worried?)(I miss you.)

94
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,354
You are now entering the voicemail service.

95
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:47,191
I'm still here.

96
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,111
I've always been here.

97
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,604
I've delivered the project.

98
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:35,489
Today, I visited Warang at the hospital.
She’s feeling better now.

99
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,871
They've been asking about you.

100
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,250
Everyone's worried that they can't contact you.

101
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:53,882
So, I told them you might have gone home.
I can't reach you either.

102
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,020
Gyo.

103
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,485
Since you've been here.

104
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,073
You've never shared anything with me.

105
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,041
And Nao...

106
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,674
She started waiting for you in front of the dorm.

107
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,848
She's probably wondering if you're with me.

108
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:08,832
P'Thida, Is Gyo with you?

109
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,421
Can you ask Gyo to come down and see me?

110
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:21,720
Or maybe tell her to turn on the phone.
Please.

111
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,436
Talk to her for me, please.

112
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,607
Gyo isn't here.

113
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:38,195
I can't reach her either.

114
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,829
She might have gone home.

115
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,250
The exams are coming up.

116
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,506
I think you should focus on studying.

117
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:20,881
Gyo, let's have a meal.
I bought all your favorites today.

118
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,091
Have some.

119
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:28,263
You have it, I'm not hungry.

120
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:35,771
I've been eating alone for days.
It's not tasty at all, let's eat together.

121
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,609
Okay, I'll eat with you.

122
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:44,529
That's right, you're a good girl.

123
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,659
Okay, let me help tidy up.

124
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,585
Look, it all looks so appetizing.

125
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,804
You must like it, for sure.

126
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,768
Hey, why are you crying?

127
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,106
If you don't want to eat anymore,

128
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:23,944
It's okay, if you don't want to eat,
you don't have to force yourself.

129
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,113
No.

130
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,574
I'm just happy.

131
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,703
Happy to have you.

132
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:42,379
It's not just me,
Everyone cares about you too.

133
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:50,345
Warang is almost leaving the hospital,
Let's visit Warang together tomorrow, okay?

134
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,265
We'll get to meet other friends too.

135
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,105
Let's eat.

136
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,976
What's up, stinky dog?

137
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,314
Now it's changed from "stinky dog" to "watchdog"?

138
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,402
Come on, let me see your face.

139
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,824
Oh, look like a corpse.

140
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:58,205
Stop, If you come to annoy me,
just get lost.

141
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,421
I told you to be gentle with her.

142
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:17,766
Hello, Nao.
Nice to officially meet you.

143
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,808
My name is-

144
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,310
P'Ploy.

145
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,481
It means we know each other now.

146
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,026
You can just ignore me and that’s fine, guys.

147
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:41,248
Nao, listen to me.
Let me try talking to Gyo.

148
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:47,379
But however it ends,
you must accept it, okay?

149
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,550
Will you really help, P'Ploy?

150
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,677
Yes.

151
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,180
I will to help you talk to Gyo.

152
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,393
But you must promise me,
to accept it.

153
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,980
And take responsibility for your own life.

154
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,692
Can you do that?

155
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:16,032
Yes, I'll do as you say.

156
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,534
Good.

157
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,481
I'm here for Gyo.

158
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,154
Did Nao ask you to come?

159
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:06,499
No, even if Nao doesn't ask me to,
I'm already here.

160
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:21,598
I'm doing fine. Don't worry.

161
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,394
You're still as stubborn as before.

162
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,608
Gyo.

163
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,571
I think you should talk to Nao and clear things up.

164
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:43,703
If you're still hiding like this,
nothing good is gonna come of it.

165
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:52,462
I'm not asking you to forgive her,

166
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:57,175
But I want you to talk to her and clear things up,

167
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,930
Whether it ends or continues,
she should know.

168
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:06,559
She doesn't even know why you disappeared.

169
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,858
I have my own reason, P'Ploy.

170
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,114
Gyo.

171
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,410
I don't know what the problem is between you and Nao,

172
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,956
but I believe you can handle it.

173
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,794
You need the courage to face it.

174
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:53,064
I'm sorry
that I couldn't love you at that time.

175
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:58,862
Because I wasn't strong enough
to make Dad accept this kind of love.

176
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,745
Thank you for the love you gave me then,
it made me stronger today.

177
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,152
What happened...

178
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,491
between us, P'Gyo?

179
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,824
(P'Ploy, EE65)

180
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,664
It's me, P'Ploy?

181
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,682
Manao.

182
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:51,975
Yes?

183
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:04,779
Gyo said you can wait for her in her dorm.

184
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,203
There's something you two should talk about.

185
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,164
Alright.

186
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,741
Gyo.

187
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,835
I came to water the plants for you every day.

188
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,935
I saw your phone was dead,
so I charged it for you.

189
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,234
Yeah.

190
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,844
Where've you been?

191
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,849
I've been searching for you everywhere,
you know?

192
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,815
How about you?

193
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,445
Where were you that night, Nao?

194
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,408
Why didn't you wait for me in the room?

195
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:20,164
I fell asleep,
when I woke up I didn't see you.

196
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:26,254
I tried to contact P'Warang,
I even called and texted her,

197
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,965
but no response.

198
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,596
Then I checked on P'Warang's IG.

199
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,562
I thought that you and P'Warang

200
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,064
were dating.

201
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,695
And I was upset.

202
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,864
Nao.

203
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,950
Are you done talking?

204
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,379
I'm sorry.

205
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,678
Sorry for what?

206
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,893
Sorry for telling me to date Warang?

207
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,937
Or sorry

208
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,940
for that night when you and your junior did it?

209
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,737
What did you mean?

210
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:40,703
About Luktarn, you promised to be honest with me.

211
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,415
And I believed you.

212
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,755
Right now, you're pretending like you don't know anything

213
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,342
even though you spent the whole night with her.

214
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,932
How could you do that?

215
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,227
How could you bring someone to sleep in the room

216
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,687
on our anniversary day.

217
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,899
How could you do that, Nao?

218
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,454
Thank you.

219
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:29,627
That night, you were so drunk but
P'Jom had to send other friends home.

220
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:34,674
So I stopped by to drop you off at the dorm first,
seeing you drunk like that.

221
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,219
Then, I went back to pick up Garcia at the bar.

222
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,681
Do you have something going on?

223
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,491
I don't know what you're talking about.

224
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,205
I admit that that night I was too drunk,
I can't remember anything.

225
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,458
But I didn't sleep with her.

226
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:16,007
Who did you hear it from?
Let that person come and talk to me.

227
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,134
Who did I hear it from?

228
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,184
Do you see these flowers?

229
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,938
How do you think they got here?

230
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,860
I intended to buy them for you

231
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,989
to apologize.

232
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,408
For not arriving on the anniversary day.

233
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,955
But do you know what I found?

234
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:55,004
I found you sleeping with her in the room.

235
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,554
The girl you call her junior.

236
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,809
I didn't know you can do that sort of thing with a junior.

237
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,403
Gyo.

238
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,872
Tell me that you didn't do it.

239
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,792
If you didn't do it, speak up.

240
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,086
If you're sure.

241
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,129
Just say it.

242
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,423
Say it.

243
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,884
That you didn't do it.

244
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,345
Say it.

245
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,034
I…

246
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,036
That's enough, Nao.

247
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,960
Never show your face to me again.

248
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,883
Consider this as my last request.

249
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,441
Okay.

250
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,570
You will never see me again.

251
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,799
Little one.

252
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:16,520
No matter how this ends, you must accept it.

253
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,898
Remember we used to talk to each other, right?

254
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,069
I'm here, little one.

255
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,072
It's fine now.

256
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:31,410
P'Pure, I'm hurt.

257
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,205
P'Pure.

258
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,292
I'm hurt.

259
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,342
I'm also hurt

260
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,139
by seeing the person I loves upset.

261
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:27,341
What happened that night?
Tell me the truth.

262
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,221
You won't be angry, right?

263
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,433
It depends on what you did that night.

264
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,563
What did we do?

265
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:45,025
Tell me the truth. I wanna know.

266
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,829
That night, you were very drunk.

267
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,457
I took you back to the dorm with P'Tarn.

268
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:05,588
P'Tarn gave me a bottle of water and asked to leave.

269
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,673
For a while.

270
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:13,637
I felt dizzy, and then I blacked out.

271
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:18,767
I didn't know when P'Tarn left.

272
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,604
But when I woke up, it was morning.

273
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:28,777
We were both sleeping on the bed
with no clothes.

274
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:42,249
But I'm sure that nothing happened between us.

275
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,711
I was just afraid.

276
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,548
That you would hate me.

277
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:55,387
So I dressed you up and left.

278
00:41:55,387 --> 00:42:00,017
I thought that if you didn't know everything,
it might end there.

279
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,312
However, the other day,

280
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,857
someone sent these photos to me.

281
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,261
You’ve said everything that should have been said, right?

282
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:37,680
Yes.

283
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,685
When P'Gyo came in the morning,
did you realize?

284
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,104
P'Gyo?

285
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,897
No.

286
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,817
I woke up and didn't find anyone else besides you.

287
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,080
I'll handle this myself.

288
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,259
Can it be me?

289
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:20,639
If P'Gyo doesn't love you anymore,

290
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,185
Can I stay here instead?

291
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,106
It's okay if you don't love me.

292
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:35,779
Just let me stay beside you. That's enough.

293
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,288
Belle.

294
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,124
Listen to me.

295
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,335
It's not because you aren't good.

296
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,212
It's not because you did anything wrong.

297
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,257
But for me,

298
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,761
there is no one but her.

299
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,145
As for what’s between us,

300
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,149
I hope one day,

301
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:17,488
We can be close enough
to return to being senior and junior like before.

302
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,831
I'm sorry for having to say this.

303
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,669
I love P'Gyo.

304
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:40,052
Even if P'Gyo ends up hating me,

305
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,640
I'll still love her.

306
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,722
Is she looking for me?

307
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,183
Yeah.

308
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:32,479
I dropped by to submit the work,
then I've got things to do after this.

309
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:36,733
Please tell her that I'll call back later.

310
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:38,777
Yeah.

311
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:52,583
Do you know why I'm looking for you?

312
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,043
I guess...

313
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,006
you probably miss me.

314
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,471
Yes, I'm thinking about you.

315
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:07,764
I'm thinking about

316
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,602
when will you stop messing with me?

317
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,066
If you want me to make up for the incident that night,

318
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,154
by now, P'Gyo probably hates me.

319
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,616
It should be enough to make amends.

320
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,536
What are you talking about?

321
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,248
I am telling you,

322
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,627
Even if there's no P'Gyo,

323
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,047
or there's only you left in this world,

324
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,383
I'll never love you.

325
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,761
Never.

326
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:53,435
And that bullshit plan of framing the junior,
taking blackmail photos,

327
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,104
You did it for what?

328
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:31,807
I never thought you could pull off something this gross.

329
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,561
It's disgusting.

330
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,772
Stop it now, Nao.

331
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:48,699
Do you know
how much I disgust myself

332
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,576
for ever touching you?

333
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,623
I said, stop!

334
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,583
I won't.

335
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:02,129
Stop causing trouble for others anymore.

336
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,132
Because if you don't stop,

337
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,718
I'll be the one to expose your pathetic mind to the world.

338
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,973
You're gone too far.

339
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,851
I can be worse than this.

340
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,604
If you're still involved with P'Gyo,

341
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:38,470
(Next Episode)
I feel sorry for Nao

342
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:43,099
that she has to be upset,
even though it's not her fault,

343
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,270
but because of your stupidity.

344
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,023
Little one,

345
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,571
Will you be my girlfriend.
