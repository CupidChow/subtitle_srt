"Love Senior The Series"
(Episode 7)

2
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,940
(Previous Episode) This lemon-flavored ice cream
is really delicious, isn't it?

3
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,984
Lemon is tasty, I had tasted it.

4
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:57,158
Can you tell?
How she feel about you, Manao?

5
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,493
Yes.

6
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,248
I know what Tarn thinks about me,

7
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,084
but I has told her straight up before

8
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:10,046
that I have someone I love,
and we're just friends.

9
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,299
I'm telling you, it's not playing around.

10
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,441
So, shall we go eat noodles together?
I'm starving.

11
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,406
Hey, Gyoza. Where are you rushing off to?

12
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,825
You haven't agreed to be my girlfriend yet.

13
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,710
I'm rushing off to go eat noodles with my girlfriend.

14
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,545
Quickly.

15
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,308
Give it to her.

16
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,434
Okay.

17
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,518
P'Warang.

18
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,398
Thank you.

19
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,944
She's taken it.

20
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:17,947
Here.

21
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:23,244
Take it, Belle.
It's good for your mind, reduces stress.

22
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,081
Maybe it'll help us solve math problems
with a clear mind.

23
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,043
Take it.

24
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,669
Thank you.

25
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,159
Hello, P'Gyo.

26
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:03,785
Hello.

27
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,579
- Hello, P'Gyo.
- Hello there.

28
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,246
Have a seat.

29
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:08,915
We're counting on you.

30
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,916
Sure.

31
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,671
Thank you.

32
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,631
Today, have you prepared your equipment?

33
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,590
All set.

34
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,387
Then let's take a five-minute break to rest up,
and start writing our paper.

35
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,305
- Okay.
- Sure thing.

36
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,062
Oh, Nao is coming,
she needed to stop by the restroom.

37
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:31,813
Oh.

38
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,897
Yes.

39
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,233
P'Gyo, don't you have a test to prepare for?

40
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:39,320
Actually, I have a study session with friends,
but Nao pleaded with me,

41
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,865
Saying you guys can't understand anything.

42
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,909
And the final exam is nearing too.

43
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,160
Oh, I see.

44
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,205
I was afraid you guys might fail.

45
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,791
Thank you so much, P'Gyo.

46
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,376
No problem.

47
00:04:55,128 --> 00:05:00,091
Nao requested you to come here.
She's really impressive.

48
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,594
Because she's so nice, many people like her.

49
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:14,272
P'Gyo, P'Gyo,
I can't quite make sense of this part.

50
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:18,943
Oh, let's try looking at this again.
It should connect the points.

51
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:19,360
Yes.

52
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,737
Setting the values, the code.

53
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,196
Uh, alright.

54
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,116
Try reading the problem again and analyze it once more.

55
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,701
Sure thing.

56
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,244
I'm here.

57
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,912
Oh, Manao's here.

58
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:35,251
Oh, you're late, student.

59
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,003
Thank you.

60
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,966
Nao, what's done here?

61
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:50,808
Luktarn, if there's anything you're unsure about,
you can ask me. I'll teach you.

62
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:54,187
No worries, P'Gyo.
I already asked Nao for help.

63
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,274
But if I still don't get it,
I will ask Manao, okay?

64
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,694
I was concerned about P'Gyo,
as there are many others for you to teach.

65
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:06,449
Don't worry about that.
Today, I'm here to teach everyone.

66
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,661
Moreover, Nao isn't that great either.

67
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,790
Last night, I was tutoring Nao.

68
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,126
I never knew about this before.

69
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:21,464
CoincidenTarnly, Nao is the first person
to teach everything to me.

70
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,970
So, I think she's brilliant.

71
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,555
Right?

72
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:36,229
Uh, P'Gyo, what's... what's this?

73
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,480
Me... me too.

74
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,441
Uh... P', uh... is this right?

75
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,692
Is it, Kawee?

76
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,111
No, it's not.

77
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,154
Uh, I don't get it either.

78
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,824
P'Gyo, you can explain it loudly, it's okay.

79
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,033
Is it question 612?

80
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,576
Yes, it is.

81
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,092
Nao and I, we made out.

82
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,222
Is it just this that you want to say?

83
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,432
Yes.

84
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,186
Nao never told you, right?

85
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,272
Why did you think that

86
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,984
I wanted to know about Nao's story
way before I was her girlfriend?

87
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:27,363
Is it because it requires sincerity,

88
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:33,119
or is you trying to say that
that night, you weren't wholehearted?

89
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:39,500
I admit that that night,
I was wholehearted.

90
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:45,965
But I want you to understand my intentions,
why I brought this up to you, P'Gyo.

91
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:51,304
Because I'm concerned,
and afraid that if you knew later,

92
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,808
then you would be hurt.
Regardless, Nao and I are friends.

93
00:07:55,808 --> 00:08:01,981
We happen to meet, to Tarnk, to do things together.

94
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,818
Thank you for caring.

95
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:10,489
It's good that Nao and you still Tarnk.

96
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:17,413
You're both grown-ups and being friends.
I feel relieved.

97
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:24,212
Thank you, Tarn,
for having the courage to Tarnk to me directly.

98
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:39,352
Thank you so much, Tarn,
for telling Gyo about this.

99
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,522
I was thinking about
how I would tell Gyo about this.

100
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:56,786
P'Gyo, I'm sorry.

101
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,331
I'm sorry for not telling this personally.

102
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,416
Because I was afraid.

103
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,004
I was afraid of losing P'Gyo.

104
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,135
Luktarn.

105
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:21,018
I feel sorry for you, Tarn.
As soon as you asked me to be friends,

106
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,562
I accepted.

107
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,651
Because I want to take responsibility for my mistake.

108
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:40,079
Today, P'Gyo may be angry with me,
may not forgive me. I understand.

109
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,790
As for Tarn,

110
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,503
I apologize for everything.

111
00:09:53,926 --> 00:10:00,266
Forget about it already.
It's passed; it probably doesn't matter anymore.

112
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,978
I'm off now.

113
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,663
I'll break up with you.

114
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,544
No.

115
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,924
I'll break up with you,

116
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,845
If you don't speak the truth today.

117
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:50,816
I promise, I won't make mistakes again.

118
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,696
I ask only for... your honesty.

119
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,366
I promise,

120
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,703
that things between us will remain the same.

121
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,711
Stop crying.

122
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,011
My heart is aching...

123
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,640
To hear that you said it's over.

124
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:35,694
Don't say you'll end it with me again.
I can't take it.

125
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,824
If I lose you,

126
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,242
Nao..

127
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,287
If you decided what to do next,

128
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,374
you have to face the consequences of actions.

129
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,460
Do you understand?

130
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,465
I will do everything
to keep you by my side.

131
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,802
I will also do everything

132
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,809
for our relationship,
Be my good girl forever, okay?

133
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,856
I'll stay a good girl for you until I'm old.

134
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,050
I love you, Gyo.

135
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:04,325
Welcome, juniors, to our university.

136
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:13,751
I'm Gyoza,
the third-year head cheer,

137
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,087
and I'm responsible for all freshmen's activities.

138
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:25,137
This handbook will guide you through your responsibilities.

139
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:30,601
I'd like to inform you that, until now,
we won't have punishments,

140
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,561
No hazing,

141
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,440
but we'll have cheer activities.

142
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,817
Senior-Junior Bonding Activity.

143
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:42,446
After midterms,
we'll have gear running activities as usual.

144
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,740
Which...

145
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,661
Everyone can participate in activities of their interest.

146
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,957
Any questions?

147
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:01,465
This bonding book...
Can I bond with the seniors yet?

148
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,343
Bond with your friends first, then with the seniors.

149
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,180
But you should still bond.

150
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:20,067
You guys don't need to help.
I'm almost done tidying up the room.

151
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,068
Oh!

152
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:26,198
The dorm staff called to say
my roommate will be here today.

153
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:30,578
If she saw a room full off you guys,
she's probably shocked.

154
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:34,832
Hey, I gotta go.
My roommate might come. Um, um.

155
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,266
Is this your room, Prang?

156
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,727
Uh...

157
00:14:56,478 --> 00:15:01,150
Yes, in the room reservation, it says...
it's my room.

158
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,068
Uh-huh.

159
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,821
Then let's bring in the stuff.

160
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,782
Thank you.

161
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,459
What are you doing? Hurry up and come in.

162
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,877
Yes.

163
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,632
Here.

164
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,221
We're roommates now, right?
I want you to smile a lot.

165
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:20,646
Hey,
In your eye, you see me as a cranky person?

166
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,946
Oops.

167
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,739
Sorry.

168
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:38,956
It's already evening. Are you hungry or not?
Do you want to order something to eat? I'll treat.

169
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,543
Oh, No need.
Can I have a moment?

170
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,681
Here.

171
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,143
Oh, my favorite flavor.

172
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,436
Really?

173
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,937
How did you know?

174
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,147
Wow.

175
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,577
P'Warang, can you sign this for me?

176
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,168
This book is empty.
Haven't got anyone's signature yet?

177
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,756
I haven't asked anyone yet.
I want P'Warang to be the first.

178
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,971
You can choose where.
I'll sign it.

179
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,639
Is this spot okay?

180
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,474
This one, right?

181
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,808
Um.

182
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,393
Okay, give me a sec.

183
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,603
Okay.

184
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:53,447
Even though we're roommates,
I won't easily sign it for you.

185
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,121
Sure, okay.

186
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,956
Take this for drawing.

187
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,547
Yeah.

188
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,051
If you're done eating, let's go to bedroom.

189
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,302
Huh?

190
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,553
To tidy thing up.

191
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,639
What are you thinking?

192
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,224
Uh, nothing.

193
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,517
You dirty mind.

194
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,311
Hurry up.

195
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:56,093
P'Manao, could you sign this friendship book, please?

196
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,011
Sure.

197
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,392
But you startled me, just popping up like that.

198
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,185
Sorry about that.

199
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:19,408
P'Manao's signature is so pretty.
It's as pretty as you are.

200
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:24,163
You're overpraising me, no need.
Just say you want to get my signature.

201
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,673
Hasn't asked anyone for their signatures yet?

202
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,428
P'President will get angry if you don't.

203
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:44,892
Um..I once came to watch you play basketball,

204
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:51,815
last year with my sister, Thida.
I..um... really admired you.

205
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,776
So I wanted you to be my first.

206
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,903
Huh?

207
00:19:55,903 --> 00:20:00,574
I mean the first to sign my book.

208
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,660
I've signed my name.

209
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,622
So, quickly ask for signatures
from other friends and seniors.

210
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,373
Even it has no hazing anymore,

211
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,876
But this kind of relationship-building activity,

212
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,462
I don't want us to neglect it.

213
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,923
You sound like

214
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,178
P'Gyoza, who's the head cheer.

215
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,724
I..um..got P'Manao's signature already,

216
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,977
I'm gonna rush to get others' signatures.
Thank you.

217
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,187
Uh-huh.

218
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,109
Won't you ask for my signature, too?

219
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,029
Hello.

220
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,658
Could you help me fill in my name here?

221
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,703
I thought you're not gonna asking for mine.

222
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,295
You've got the book for days already,

223
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,005
And you just started asking for signatures today, right?

224
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,592
Yes, please sign my book too.

225
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,346
Sure, my name is Luktarn.

226
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,016
N'Belle.

227
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,770
Um. P'

228
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:17,192
Could you sign on the next page, please?

229
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,030
Sure thing.

230
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,543
Thank you.

231
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,104
Ouch!

232
00:21:56,898 --> 00:22:01,319
Oh, P'Gyo, we're not ghosts, you know?

233
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,448
Yes, we're here to ask for your signature, P'Gyo.

234
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,158
But I have to hurry for the class.

235
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,368
Can't you sign for us quickly?

236
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:14,166
Please?

237
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,751
Help us out, please.

238
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,835
Please sign for us.

239
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,045
First-year! Sit down!

240
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,671
Yes.

241
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,507
Sit!

242
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,384
Bow down your head.

243
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,930
Hey!

244
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,225
P'Gyo.

245
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,226
Hey.

246
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,228
The most handsome P'Pure.

247
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,271
Can you sign for us, please...

248
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,314
Whoa.

249
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,778
P', could you sign for me, please?

250
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,781
Please, my most handsome P'Pure.

251
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,782
Please, please.

252
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,491
Please don't snatch my most handsome guy.

253
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,744
Please, please.

254
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,995
Help us, please.

255
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,246
Oh, a snake!

256
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:58,376
P'Pure, wait.

257
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,863
Why didn't you tell me? I could've helped.

258
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,865
It's raining often during this time.

259
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,618
The sky's roaring loudly.

260
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,496
So, I bought noise-canceling curtains.

261
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:38,750
Last year, I didn't prepare, but this year,

262
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,003
I have new items ready.

263
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:45,799
I'm here, no need to worry.

264
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,510
You say it like you're always here.

265
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:53,014
Uh, tonight, they're meeting for a project
at the university.

266
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,225
I might return late.

267
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:59,354
Why not work in your room?
It might be more convenient.

268
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:04,234
In the group, there's also Tarn.
Nao doesn't want to bring her to my room.

269
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,069
Okay.

270
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:11,700
But I might not stay past midnight.
I'll buy some snacks for you, is that okay?

271
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,663
Use the red piggy.
I haven't used it for today.

272
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,791
Later in the evening, Lada will pick me up.

273
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,252
Tonight, the girl gang has a meeting.

274
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,378
Oh.

275
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:29,217
Okay, but tell P'Lada to keep it down a bit.

276
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:34,472
You all become chubby, you know.
Look at their chubby cheeks. Oh my!

277
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,849
Oh my!

278
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,352
Hmm, I will eat more until I burst.

279
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,817
Just bursting, huh?

280
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:51,406
Even your head might burst. Hurry up.

281
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,616
Ouch.

282
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,993
Uh, there's a raincoat under the seat.

283
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,286
It's going to rain.

284
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,333
Go.

285
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,918
Oh, so you want me to go now?

286
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,420
Go, go now.

287
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,339
I'm going.

288
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,470
Be a good girl.

289
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,679
Don't want to go anymore.

290
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,640
Go quickly, you'll be late.

291
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,641
Okay.

292
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,936
Hurry up.

293
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,563
Alright, I'll go.

294
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,398
Bye.

295
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,451
Here, I bought drink for you.

296
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,369
Thank you.

297
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,663
This shop is the best.

298
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,832
It really is good. Fresh drinks!

299
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,754
Did you get P'Warang's signature yet?

300
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,923
Did you all get it or not?

301
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:55,220
Look, She seems pretty calm, floating around.

302
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,223
I think she can teleport for sure.

303
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:02,560
Oh, chill out. She's senior not a ghost.

304
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,814
If anyone's a ghost here, it's you.
ToTarnly, perfect for that.

305
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,692
Stop arguing, please.

306
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,110
Hey!

307
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,363
Help us get P'Warang's signature.

308
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,072
Why?

309
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,701
Like..you're her roommate, right?

310
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,161
Huh? Roommate?

311
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:23,039
How do you know, Belle?

312
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,002
Nothing slips under my nose.

313
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,378
Is there something to tell me?

314
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:33,842
Tell you what?
Nothing. She's just really cute.

315
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:39,681
Yeah, so, could you help friends
to get her signature, please?

316
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,852
Yes, please, help me out.
We all know each other already.

317
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,895
Then we won't have to struggle.

318
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,398
I haven't even got P'Warang's signature yet.

319
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,441
Huh?

320
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:55,947
But If I want P'Manao's signature.
Should I ask you to help?

321
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,700
Why Belle?

322
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,208
You want more?

323
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:07,625
So what?

324
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,376
You just ate it yesterday.

325
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:08,877
You're coming or not?

326
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,919
P'Manao?

327
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:15,133
I, Busaya, Pumitmethi.

328
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:23,808
First-year engineering student.
My nickname is Belle, A soon-to-be E68.

329
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,812
Can you accept me as your junior?

330
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,724
Gyo.

331
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,309
Hmm?

332
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:11,439
Can you skip today? Take a day off.

333
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:18,196
Old assignments are just finished.
Will Gyo start new ones?

334
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:29,958
Can't skip. The work is urgent.
I also want to finish quickly.

335
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:35,171
But it's been half a month
that you working on this. No rest at all.

336
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:43,388
I want to rest too,
but I can't leave Warang struggling alone.

337
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:48,768
You leave me alone often until I become troubled.

338
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,272
I'm a kid who lack warmth and affection.

339
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,150
You're overreacting.

340
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,860
Where did you learn that?

341
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,944
I'm overreacting and I like it.

342
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,866
Please don't go.

343
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,951
I can't.

344
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,582
Then, I will drop you off.

345
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:16,796
It's okay. You can rest.
Warang's is coming.

346
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:26,806
I'm awake. I can drop you off myself.
No need for P'Warang to come around.

347
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,851
Okay.

348
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,460
What time are you coming back?
I will come pick you up.

349
00:29:56,794 --> 00:30:00,965
Maybe I stay up till the morning. It's okay.
I can return with Warang.

350
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:09,349
It's okay. I want to come pick you up myself.
Tell me when you're all done.

351
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:16,314
Uh, around 6:30. But if you can't wake up,
I can come back by myself.

352
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,901
I can.
I want to come pick you up myself.

353
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,655
But If you want to return earlier, call me.

354
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:32,539
Here, a snack I bought. In case you're hungry.

355
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,708
Call me if you're hungry or anything. I will buy it for you.

356
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,836
So you don't have to go out late at night. It's dangerous.

357
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,965
Thank you.

358
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:46,219
I'm grown up now. You act as if I was a kid.

359
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,096
I can take care of myself.

360
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,100
You can go now.
I'm gonna be late.

361
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,561
Okay.

362
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,396
Call me when you're done.

363
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,152
Gyo.

364
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:03,945
Huh?

365
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,414
Bye.

366
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,499
I'm going now.

367
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,681
Finally, you come.

368
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,434
Yeah.

369
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,853
Let's work.

370
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:39,856
Hey.

371
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,485
What was that? You should consider appropriateness.

372
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,447
I'm saying this with good intentions.

373
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,142
Warang.

374
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,101
Hm.

375
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:22,106
Could you help me find the resistance value of this?

376
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,277
Well...

377
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,281
Here it is.
Here it is, the answer's already here.

378
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:37,455
You just need to see R1 = 2K, this 2K is to replace R1,
R2 is like R3, they're the same.

379
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:42,126
As for these symbols, you can find them in that textbook.
You can replace them right away.

380
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:46,005
The answer is already here.
Then why ask me when it's so easy to find?

381
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:50,385
Ah, because you're Prof.Warang.
Can't I ask a little question?

382
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,679
You just started studying three days ago.

383
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,390
Um, memory's fading, isn't it?

384
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,475
Am I still your friend?

385
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,810
Yeah, you are.

386
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,491
That kind of smile.

387
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:37,098
(P'Manao, I have something to
consult you about. Can we meet?)

388
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:49,485
Oh, I've been up so late during this period.
Do it for me, please.

389
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:54,031
You joking? I also have things to do.
Do it yourself.

390
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,758
What are you looking at?

391
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,385
I think I saw Manao earlier.

392
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,435
You're missing that kid so much that my eyes are blur.
Hurry and get it done.

393
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,062
So you can go back before dawn breaks.

394
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:29,025
I'm reminiscing about that incredibly happy life
in that room right now.

395
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,322
Warang's paradise.

396
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,004
P'Nao.

397
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,215
Belle.

398
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,971
What thing you want to consult with me?

399
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:02,183
I want my senior to treat her junior to some treats, please.

400
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:05,770
Recently, you haven't been paying much attention to me.

401
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,565
Be careful. Your junior may be a girl with troubles.

402
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:14,153
Yeah right. I thought you had a problem.

403
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,489
Uh...

404
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,825
Actually, I do.

405
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,869
What's up? You can tell me.

406
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,957
Lately, I haven't been understanding many subjects.

407
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,835
Could P'Nao help tutor me a bit, please?

408
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:33,589
Sure, but whether you'll understand better,
I can't guarantee.

409
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:38,761
It's okay. Just P'Nao agreeing to tutor
makes me relieved and happy, no more headaches.

410
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,763
You're too much.

411
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,644
P'Nao.

412
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,895
Huh?

413
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,732
P'Nao and P'Gyo...

414
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,194
Are you two dating?

415
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,114
Yes.

416
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,825
I knew it.

417
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,786
You guys look good together.

418
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,807
Best of luck!

419
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:41,908
P'Nao.

420
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,783
Yeah?

421
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:49,040
Tasty, right? It's a new flavor—Pink Salt.

422
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,083
Is it delicious?

423
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,001
Uh-huh.

424
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,795
But it sticks to your mouth.

425
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,345
It's alright now.

426
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,346
Uh-huh.

427
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,348
Want more?

428
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:34,085
Why are you and Warang hurrying on the project
to surpass your friends?

429
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,587
Look at you now.

430
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,548
Do you have something to do after finals?

431
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,010
Gyo.

432
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:48,349
Besides work, you should have time for other things too.

433
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:52,061
Like taking care of yourself.

434
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,814
Taking care of others too.

435
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,983
What do you mean?

436
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,694
Nao, right?

437
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:01,946
Yeah.

438
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:11,330
We meet every day. Nao seems fine.

439
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,335
Do you want to say something?

440
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:21,340
Normally, things might not be normal.

441
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:28,639
Because the closeness of people can't be trusted.

442
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:34,228
Especially when you ignore her.
What if she found someone who cares for her

443
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,147
who treat her better than you.

444
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,858
She might be distracted.

445
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,279
I just want you to care for her more.

446
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,825
Before something gets out of control.

447
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:56,876
I know her well.
She has never done anything to make me doubt.

448
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,546
Do you know or see something?

449
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:09,055
I heard that, Lately,

450
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,933
Nao goes out with her junior.

451
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,894
Are you going to say that…

452
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,812
Gyo.

453
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,524
We're coming.

454
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,650
Here I come.

455
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,777
Really.

456
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:27,364
I'm thinking we should go to the market. I'm hungry.

457
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:32,161
Oh, there's this new place,
Madam Poi's hot & spicy, really delicious.

458
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:32,995
Oh!

459
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,413
It's near here. Want to go?

460
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,498
- Shall we? Shall we?
- Let's eat, let's eat.

461
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,624
Yeah.

462
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:53,349
If we don't hurry to dress up,
the table will be full.

463
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,813
Today, Warang's busy. Nao, where do you want to go?

464
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,732
Let's find something yummy to eat.

465
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,572
Are you free today?

466
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:14,036
What's up? Why do you look skeptical?

467
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,497
Just asking.

468
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,417
I don't want to be disappointed.

469
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,880
If you don't want to go, then stay in the room.

470
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,851
I'd rather stay in the room than go outside.

471
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,688
That's fine.

472
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,733
I also prefer doing things in the room
more than going outside.

473
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,199
Let me go.

474
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,951
Let go.

475
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:59,331
Let go. Oh, what are you doing?

476
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:03,878
Who's playing? I always do what I say.

477
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:09,091
So, what now? Do you want to
go find something delicious outside to eat,

478
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:11,635
or should you stay in and let me eat you up?

479
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,181
Go outside.

480
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,058
Go outside.

481
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:20,019
What? I didn't hear anything.

482
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:25,441
Go outside. I said, Go outside!

483
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:31,363
Okay, then see you in front of the lift in 10 minutes.

484
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,907
10 minutes.

485
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,802
Gyo is free because P'Warang is busy.

486
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,681
I should be happy, right?

487
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:09,652
Nao probably won't do anything like that,
something that would make me upset.

488
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,035
Nao.

489
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,704
Thank you, Nao, for tidy up the room.

490
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,540
Washing and Ironing the clothes.

491
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:28,003
If it wasn't you, the room would be
no different from a garbage pile.

492
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:32,258
There's even no time for you to sleep
when you come back to the dorm.

493
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:36,887
I'm willing to help with these things.
I can't assist you with work

494
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:40,975
however, regarding this matter,
I don't want you to strain more.

495
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,977
Take plenty of breaks whenever you can.

496
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:48,232
These little tasks, I will manage them myself.

497
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,697
Who are you Tarnking to?

498
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,407
It's N'Belle.

499
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,868
Oh, N'Belle.

500
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:03,163
She messaged asking about the summary study note.

501
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,165
You're familiar with each other so quickly.

502
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:09,586
We've met frequently,
she asked me for help.

503
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:22,224
Why are you playing with the food?
We're not done yet. It's not yummy?

504
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,352
I think it looks appetizing.

505
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:30,607
Hello, P'Nao. P'Gyo.

506
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:33,944
Oh, why you're here?

507
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,238
We were Tarnking earlier, you didn't mention coming.

508
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,866
I was waiting for friends, we had an appointment.

509
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,785
I didn't know P'Nao would be here too.

510
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:48,625
Since Gyo's free,
we've got time to find something to eat.

511
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:56,717
Oh, today P'Gyo's free.
So, can I wait here for my friend at this table?

512
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,345
I don't want to sit alone.

513
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,564
Right there.

514
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,816
Why aren't you eating?

515
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:13,776
I'm waiting for her to start.

516
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,152
Oh.

517
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,030
Eat up.

518
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,644
Gyo.

519
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:54,942
Are you upset that I asked Belle to join so much?

520
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,865
I'm sorry for not stopping her.

521
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,412
I didn't expect you to care so much.

522
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:21,009
Can't you figure this out,
how Belle looks at you.

523
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:27,558
I think you're just overthinking.
She's just friendly.

524
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:33,730
Besides, I'm her senior,
we're close because of this.

525
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,233
Why's this a big deal?

526
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,194
You don't see the way she looks at you.

527
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:42,489
Don't you see the way she smirk at me?

528
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,658
What smirk?

529
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:51,165
If you have attitude towards her is like this,
I think we probably can't Tarnk.

530
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:58,213
I don't have that attitude.
Do you think I made it up?

531
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:03,552
I didn't say anything. Listen,

532
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,263
There's nothing at all.

533
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:10,142
Then why did you pick her up and drop her off?

534
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:16,023
Are there any good excuses? I probably
wouldn't even know if no one told me about it.

535
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,108
I was just taking her to study,

536
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:22,362
taking her to eat.
It's what seniors do, isn't it?

537
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:26,825
It's normal. Why do you have to
be bothered by such silly things?

538
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:30,704
But she doesn't think about you as juniors do.

539
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:36,126
How about P'Warang?
You stayed with her every night.

540
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:40,339
I don't like it either
when you stay with P'Warang frequently.

541
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:44,551
I don't like it either
when I see you near P'Warang.

542
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:51,558
Can I say something too?
Can I upset with that, huh?

543
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:58,273
- But I go to work.
- Right, you told me, you go to work.

544
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:02,611
And I tutored my junior.
How are they different?

545
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:07,032
I'm friends with Warang,
And I chose you.

546
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:10,827
I agued with Warang, my closest friend,
because I chose you.

547
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:12,621
I never thought that

548
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,165
you going to be this childish.

549
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,502
What do you want to say?

550
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:21,880
Are you going to say that you chose the wrong one?

551
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,551
Would you say choosing Warang would have been better?

552
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,513
Then, just do it. Go then.

553
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,014
Date her.

554
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,392
There's no need for you to
put up with someone as childish as me.

555
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,288
You look horrible.

556
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,503
Someone told me that

557
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,798
if the body receives sugar, it'll uplift the mood.

558
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,594
Thanks.

559
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,179
What?

560
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,390
Normally, if I tease, you'd reTarniate.

561
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:01,313
Hey, how are you feeling? Tell the doctor.

562
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,858
Don't involve yourself in the patient's matters.

563
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:08,612
Save your life first.

564
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,450
What about your roommate, where did she disappear?

565
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:17,913
She has to go to the supplementary classes with professor.

566
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,210
Did you have an argument?

567
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,424
It's because of my junior in the first year,

568
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:32,844
I overheard Thida and Lada Tarnking.

569
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:40,602
Shall I speak to my junior?
Even if she's my junior,

570
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:43,105
she should respect the senior's girlfriend.

571
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,025
And that kid should respect you.

572
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,695
Being too close isn't good.

573
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,242
It's harder than I thought.

574
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,370
I'm close to you.

575
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,417
And you used to like me.

576
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,128
Even if it was just before.

577
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:10,257
But regarding affection, Nao knows well.

578
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:16,054
I'm afraid that if I speak up,

579
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,473
Nao might retract it.

580
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,141
Yeah.

581
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,772
Honestly, before,

582
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:29,067
I didn't know if you still felt anything for me.

583
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:33,655
Until that junior came into your life.

584
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,534
Then I realized that

585
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,621
You and I are genuinely sincere friends.

586
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,753
But I don't know if Nao believes me.

587
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,509
I want to trust Nao,

588
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,974
But it's genuinely challenging.

589
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,937
Don't cry.

590
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,065
Hey.

591
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,527
Come here.

592
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,533
There. There.

593
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,723
It's probably unnecessary now.

594
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:39,155
(Beside Story)
I'm busy, don't invite me.

595
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:40,615
I won't go.

596
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:44,703
That's it for now.

597
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,665
What's up, Gyo?

598
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,500
Well,

599
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:54,170
These days, my skin doesn't seem well.

600
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,966
Just got back from the sea,
and still running around.

601
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:03,638
Here.

602
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,892
I brought this.

603
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,811
Vitamin pills.

604
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,942
Arigato.

605
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,163
(Next Episode)
Happy anniversary.

606
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,248
Gyo.

607
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:41,259
In the past, I never really tried to
understand you at all.

608
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:44,054
I'm the one who is being childish.
