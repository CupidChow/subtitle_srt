"Love Senior The Series"
(Episode 6)

2
00:01:44,575 --> 00:01:51,499
(Previous Episode) By now, we might not be together,
but can't we still love each other?

3
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:56,129
When I finish this duty,
I promise that

4
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:00,174
I will be your girlfriend
without hiding.

5
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:02,844
You promise?

6
00:02:03,845 --> 00:02:05,513
I promise.

7
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:09,684
If there's a day Gyo is upset because of you,

8
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:13,187
You won't even have a chance for a second time.

9
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:19,735
Let's go to the beach.

10
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,737
Why suddenly ask me to go to the beach?

11
00:02:21,737 --> 00:02:25,783
I saw you looking stressed,
so I want you to take a break.

12
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:37,128
Why ask me to come to the beach?

13
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:42,675
Maybe I want to eat gyoza on the beach.

14
00:02:46,804 --> 00:02:50,600
Actually,
I like the first time at the beach with you.

15
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,518
Um.

16
00:02:52,518 --> 00:02:56,814
I saw the real Gyoza, with nothing hidden.

17
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:02,195
I liked that time a lot.

18
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:06,491
But I like it the most

19
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,868
when you became my lover.

20
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:18,836
I wanted to be the head senior

21
00:03:18,836 --> 00:03:22,173
because I've always wanted to
change some things in SOTUS system.

22
00:03:23,424 --> 00:03:27,720
And I wanted to do it to repay someone.

23
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:33,518
You remember P'Ploy, right?

24
00:03:33,518 --> 00:03:34,810
Yeah.

25
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,562
Do you know that

26
00:03:37,522 --> 00:03:39,565
P'Ploy was my first love?

27
00:03:42,443 --> 00:03:45,363
Gyo, tell me about P'Ploy.

28
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:52,578
Back then, P'Ikkyu threatened to cut ties with me.

29
00:03:52,578 --> 00:03:58,251
P'Ikkyu wanted me to get the gear by any means necessary.

30
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:01,546
Whatever you do, get the gear.

31
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:04,340
Everyone in the second year is my junior.

32
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,385
I have full authority to punish my junior

33
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:10,930
who couldn't protect their own gear.

34
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,766
And I found out that P'Ploy was a spy.

35
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:19,397
So I stole P'Ploy's gear
and showed it to everyone.

36
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:25,820
Then, P'Rit came in at the right time.
He was very angry back then.

37
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,573
So, he threw P'Ploy's gear into the water.

38
00:04:29,198 --> 00:04:31,075
And then?

39
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:38,332
I felt very sorry for making P'Ploy lose her gear.

40
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:40,960
That night, I went to find it.

41
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:46,716
But I fell into the water,
and P'Ploy came to save me in time.

42
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:50,428
Then, P'Ploy got suspended for one semester.

43
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:53,889
Was P'Ploy really mad at you?

44
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:59,270
But P'Pure offered a deal to me.
He said, he will

45
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,441
talk to P'Ploy if I agree to become a head senior.

46
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:09,488
And this is another chance for me
to change the system by myself.

47
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:12,700
So, I agreed to consider it.

48
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,997
At that time, I was close with P'MaFueang too.

49
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:20,541
P'MaFueang?

50
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:23,377
My P'MaFueang?

51
00:05:23,377 --> 00:05:24,503
Yes.

52
00:05:24,503 --> 00:05:26,922
P'Ploy and P'MaFueang are close friends.

53
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:32,762
Then why I've never seen you talking to P'MaFueang?

54
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:38,267
Probably because after Ploy was suspended from school,

55
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:44,231
P'MaFueang seemed to keep distance from me too.

56
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:53,658
And if P'Ploy's gear was thrown into the water...

57
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:57,370
whose gear did you wear?

58
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,541
It was P'Ploy's gear.
I found it before it sank to the bottom.

59
00:06:05,503 --> 00:06:07,296
She hurt your feelings,

60
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:11,467
but you still got her gear as a memento?

61
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:13,678
It's more like a consolation prize.

62
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,514
Don't call it a memento.

63
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:20,518
She probably feels sorry for me.

64
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:27,108
I don't know if it was falling in love or not, but I feel

65
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:29,735
different from when I'm with you.

66
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,580
Nao! People might see us.

67
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:46,168
Do you not get tired of kissing?

68
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,587
No, I don't.

69
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:51,048
I can do it all day.

70
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,884
Can you resist?

71
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:54,927
Ooops!

72
00:06:56,846 --> 00:06:58,347
I'll beat you.

73
00:06:58,347 --> 00:07:00,433
Stop teasing me already.

74
00:07:01,142 --> 00:07:05,604
If you tease me again, I will get mad.

75
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,441
Alright, I won't tease you.

76
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:47,855
Gyo.

77
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:53,068
And what about P'Warang?

78
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:56,781
Gyoza.

79
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:05,581
You sleep like a baby.

80
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:16,152
I got you a lecture.
I got an A in this subject.

81
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:18,320
Thank you.

82
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:39,508
- Lada.
- Huh?

83
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:42,011
Is there a swimsuit size that fits Gyo?

84
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:44,722
I think it'd be better
if I borrow my niece's swimsuit for her.

85
00:09:44,722 --> 00:09:46,765
It should fit just right.

86
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:48,017
I think it's okay.

87
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:49,268
- Sure.
- Do you mean the niece's?

88
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:50,060
Yeah. My niece's swimsuit.

89
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,564
Or should I borrow Warang's?

90
00:09:53,564 --> 00:09:58,152
Whoa, wearing Warang's swimsuit
and playing in the water with Manao.

91
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,071
Hey.

92
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,160
Then, go borrow the niece's swimsuit for me then.

93
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,536
What are you babbling about?

94
00:10:08,954 --> 00:10:09,747
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

95
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:14,126
Stop teasing her.
She has to hurry and pack her bag for tonight.

96
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:20,591
Then for tonight, I think... this one.

97
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:25,262
One-piece, Hot black with V-neck.
This is literally hot.

98
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:26,764
OMG

99
00:10:26,764 --> 00:10:30,267
However, this trip is gonna be wild trip!

100
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:33,270
Hey, if you wear this outfit to
play in the water. I guarantee..

101
00:10:34,563 --> 00:10:37,358
No wild thing is gonna happen! I’m just going to the beach.

102
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:40,736
Gyoza, why are you embarrassed?
If you don't know how to do, then...

103
00:10:40,736 --> 00:10:44,698
I'll ask Lada to guide you for the intensive course.
How about that?

104
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:45,950
Come here, baby.

105
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,118
Stop teasing her.

106
00:10:48,118 --> 00:10:49,119
Here.

107
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:53,123
The outfit is already arranged.
Makeup is also prepared.

108
00:10:53,123 --> 00:10:55,834
I guarantee nothing is missing for sure.

109
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:57,628
- Wow!
- You will not fail.

110
00:10:57,628 --> 00:10:59,505
Fabulous!

111
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:02,466
Oh, Mama has packed a bag for you.

112
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:03,842
Here, take it.

113
00:11:03,842 --> 00:11:07,304
Did you save the world in your previous life, Miss Gyoza?

114
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:09,473
Of course.

115
00:11:09,473 --> 00:11:10,391
Oh!

116
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:12,476
- This one too.
- What else do you want?

117
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:16,105
Take everything, creams and stuff, come on.

118
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:20,901
- Wow.
- You gotta take it, it's like...

119
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:23,278
Saucy!

120
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:24,571
Sexy! Sexy!

121
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:26,740
Quiet.

122
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,100
Do you want to sleep? I'll turn off the light.

123
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:55,978
Wait.

124
00:11:58,897 --> 00:12:03,444
I'll apply cream first.
Then I'll turn off the light for you.

125
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,671
Manao, chill out.

126
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,674
Chill out, Manao.

127
00:12:48,072 --> 00:12:49,656
What's wrong?

128
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:55,162
You breathe fast.

129
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,005
P'Gyo.

130
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:05,798
Huh?

131
00:13:51,802 --> 00:13:53,303
I'm sorry.

132
00:14:02,312 --> 00:14:05,941
I'll sleep outside then.

133
00:14:17,244 --> 00:14:20,080
Then don’t change your mind anymore.

134
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,548
Where did she go?

135
00:15:56,635 --> 00:16:00,222
No need for condoms,
but cleanliness is important, you know.

136
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:04,309
Nails should be short,
hands should be clean.

137
00:16:06,061 --> 00:16:07,271
Thida, you brat!

138
00:16:07,271 --> 00:16:08,981
I'll kill you.

139
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:52,816
What a damn outfit?

140
00:16:52,816 --> 00:16:54,693
(Warang left the group.)

141
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:58,530
So, what now, huh?
Do we still need to talk about nightwear issue?

142
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,955
It's cracked!
Maybe it's not the group, It's Gyo's head.

143
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:10,083
What we gonna do?

144
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,169
Just leave her alone. Don't think too much.

145
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:16,214
But the swimsuit is pretty,
Is it specially arranged from Mama?

146
00:17:16,214 --> 00:17:18,634
That's a new outfit from Lada.

147
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:21,720
I heard it was a gift to her friend
on the first night of losing the virginity.

148
00:17:25,015 --> 00:17:28,769
Don't be mad, little Gyo.
She meant well,

149
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:31,438
But Lada is missing.
She hasn't appeared yet to respond.

150
00:17:33,315 --> 00:17:37,694
Is she with her family? Maybe when
she goes back home, when she faces her parents...

151
00:17:37,694 --> 00:17:41,365
she'll be as proper as a prude.

152
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:50,624
Why haven't you gone to shower yet?

153
00:17:50,624 --> 00:17:51,958
I thought

154
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:55,128
I'd shower together with you.

155
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,674
It's alright, I can do it alone.

156
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:02,511
You can go first.

157
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:05,347
No.

158
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:08,433
I want to go to shower with you.

159
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:10,852
Let's go.

160
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,703
You already know how this is gonna end.

161
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,789
Nao.

162
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:37,129
Stop making that scary dirty face like this.

163
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:41,842
What dirty? I'm a good person.

164
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:50,350
Then I should go first.

165
00:19:06,324 --> 00:19:07,117
Gyo.

166
00:19:10,746 --> 00:19:14,040
I'm sorry, could you help me with something?

167
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,668
Yes.

168
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:19,838
I just lose my necklaces around here.
Can you help me find it?

169
00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:24,092
Ah, su-sure. Right here?

170
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:27,387
Yes, around here.
I've been looking for a while.

171
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:28,221
Um.

172
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:33,310
Are you sure it's here?

173
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,605
Yeah, it's a stone necklace.
I think I dropped it here.

174
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:38,607
Here?

175
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:42,986
I can't seem to find it at all.

176
00:20:03,006 --> 00:20:04,090
Manao.

177
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,676
I'll go play in the water first.

178
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:11,223
If you find it, hurry and catch up.

179
00:20:14,768 --> 00:20:17,229
Wait, what are you doing?

180
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:19,147
Playing in the water.

181
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:21,316
This is too much.

182
00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:23,193
- Wait, put this on first.
- Let's play in the water.

183
00:20:23,193 --> 00:20:26,154
- Put it on first.
- Hey, just a quick.

184
00:20:26,154 --> 00:20:27,906
Why I have to wear it?

185
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:30,242
If you're going to play, wear it.

186
00:20:30,242 --> 00:20:32,577
Wear it like this, don't take it off.

187
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:36,706
Don't take it off.

188
00:20:37,165 --> 00:20:39,876
- It's uncomfortable. Just take it off.
- No.

189
00:21:09,155 --> 00:21:12,993
Stop telling me I have to be friends
with you when I don't want to.

190
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:20,083
What will you do if I tell you that I love you so much
that it's more than just being friends?

191
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,043
How will you force my heart?

192
00:21:22,043 --> 00:21:24,296
Why won't you answer when I ask?

193
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:29,050
You think..

194
00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:32,762
Does secretly loving a friend hurt a lot?

195
00:21:35,098 --> 00:21:37,267
Did you ever secretly love a close friend?

196
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,103
Are you caring that much?

197
00:21:40,103 --> 00:21:43,023
You care about her more than
the person sitting next to you, right?

198
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:48,236
Let's go. I want to take a shower.

199
00:21:48,236 --> 00:21:49,112
Manao.

200
00:21:52,616 --> 00:21:53,491
Ouch!

201
00:21:55,911 --> 00:21:57,078
P'Gyo.

202
00:21:57,871 --> 00:21:59,039
Does it hurt?

203
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,376
There's blood.

204
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:05,503
Where are you rushing off to?

205
00:22:10,592 --> 00:22:13,637
Wait, let me take care of the wound first.
Slowly get up.

206
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:48,213
Tomorrow, I might not see things clearly for a while.
It's okay.

207
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:55,470
We should take care of the wound.

208
00:23:15,365 --> 00:23:18,076
Can you not running away from me again?

209
00:23:38,054 --> 00:23:43,226
Quickly, go get the bandage.
I'm sleepy now.

210
00:23:59,325 --> 00:24:00,201
Here.

211
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:07,250
Why buy it for me again? I told you I don't like...

212
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,085
You don't like sweet things.

213
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:16,384
This is a dark chocolate bar.
I once read that

214
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:20,555
Chocolate has benefits,
it helps stimulate the release of endorphins in the brain.

215
00:24:20,555 --> 00:24:23,850
And also,
eating chocolate regularly,

216
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:28,396
It helps make the blood vessels and heart stronger.

217
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:36,154
Should you take the medical exam instead of engineering?
You might be more skilled.

218
00:24:37,405 --> 00:24:40,241
What medical? I'm bad at biology.

219
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,328
I know, because I care.

220
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,665
I know because I'm buying things for you.

221
00:24:50,627 --> 00:24:54,589
Have a piece. And I promise to sit quietly.

222
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:56,716
I'll focus on studying and not bothering you anymore.

223
00:25:25,995 --> 00:25:30,708
Your stern face is scaring all of us.

224
00:25:34,546 --> 00:25:36,339
Be careful not to age too quickly.

225
00:25:40,718 --> 00:25:42,220
Who said they'll study quietly?

226
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,304
Oops!

227
00:26:05,827 --> 00:26:07,996
Hello, you're here?

228
00:26:08,746 --> 00:26:10,290
Uh, okay, okay.

229
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:16,087
Oh, did I forget to tell you that today,

230
00:26:16,087 --> 00:26:18,548
Leewa will treat everyone?

231
00:26:19,382 --> 00:26:20,592
Oh.

232
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:22,176
Here she comes.

233
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:26,222
Hey Gyoza, we haven't seen each other in a while.
You're still petite as ever.

234
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:28,433
Hello, P'Leewa.

235
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:29,434
Hello.

236
00:26:30,018 --> 00:26:32,687
Hello.
Hi.

237
00:26:36,065 --> 00:26:38,568
Is Manao a representative of the freshman?

238
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:41,237
Prae was talking about you.

239
00:26:41,237 --> 00:26:44,324
When she heard there was a junior in the group,
being the freshman representative.

240
00:26:44,324 --> 00:26:46,075
And even winning a title.

241
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:50,747
The one who chose her has a keen eye.

242
00:26:50,747 --> 00:26:54,417
Eh, but who chose her?

243
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:58,588
Oh, was it Gyoza who chose her?

244
00:27:00,548 --> 00:27:04,302
The outfit from the unveiling event posted on the page
looks beautiful.

245
00:27:04,302 --> 00:27:06,095
It was Warang who sewed that outfit herself.

246
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,557
Our group’s juniors are really talented.

247
00:27:09,557 --> 00:27:14,520
It's nothing much.
I just did it for the department.

248
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,856
Not for someone special.

249
00:27:16,856 --> 00:27:21,653
You're being so humble. Did you took the photo?

250
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:24,572
Anyone got photos for the event?

251
00:27:24,572 --> 00:27:27,116
I have them. I have them. I saved them.

252
00:27:27,116 --> 00:27:28,701
Oh, can I see them? I want to see.

253
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,829
Here.

254
00:27:32,664 --> 00:27:34,707
Wow, so beautiful.

255
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:37,543
This outfit suits Manao very well.

256
00:27:37,543 --> 00:27:39,337
Well, it's good.

257
00:27:39,337 --> 00:27:42,256
Wow, Warang is so amazing, very talented!

258
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:45,802
Manao is so pretty, right?
I still like her.

259
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:49,931
So I'm out of favor, right?

260
00:27:51,224 --> 00:27:53,059
No way.

261
00:27:56,562 --> 00:27:57,438
The food is coming.

262
00:27:57,438 --> 00:27:58,064
Wow.

263
00:27:58,064 --> 00:27:59,482
Gyo, you ordered just for yourself?

264
00:27:59,482 --> 00:28:00,483
Looks delicious.

265
00:28:00,483 --> 00:28:01,067
Right!

266
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:03,111
- You teased me again.
- I want to eat it.

267
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:10,243
P'Gyo, try this.
I think it's really delicious.

268
00:28:10,702 --> 00:28:14,747
Gyoza is allergic to Theobromine.
She can't eat chocolate.

269
00:28:18,668 --> 00:28:22,130
I'm sorry. I didn't know that
you couldn't eat chocolate.

270
00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:26,467
It's just a small bite,
it shouldn't be a problem.

271
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:27,385
Hey!

272
00:28:28,594 --> 00:28:33,599
Why insist on eating it?
If it's not good for you, don't eat it.

273
00:28:38,396 --> 00:28:42,150
If P'Gyo can't eat chocolate,
then, can I have it instead?

274
00:28:42,692 --> 00:28:44,193
I like eating chocolate.

275
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,249
I eat lemon ('Manao') ice cream then.

276
00:29:02,545 --> 00:29:05,506
This lemon ice cream is really, really delicious.

277
00:29:05,506 --> 00:29:09,969
Not cheesy and easy to eat. So fresh

278
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:14,849
I'm not allergic to it.
Is it okay if I have this scoop?

279
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:17,226
There's only one scoop.

280
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:20,188
I don't like to share.

281
00:29:20,188 --> 00:29:23,608
Lemon ('Manao') is delicious,
I've tasted it.

282
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,033
Lemon is really delicious, you know.
Why doesn't everyone believe me?

283
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:36,162
How about this, let's order more lemon ice cream instead.
If you want to eat, just order it.

284
00:29:36,162 --> 00:29:39,332
Don't mind me.
You guys don't have to fight over it.

285
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:43,544
No need.
It seems like they want to fight over it.

286
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:48,299
I mean, share it among us.

287
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:49,592
Yeah.

288
00:29:51,344 --> 00:29:53,429
Go ahead, better to just order it.

289
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,145
I'll share my ice cream with you, okay?

290
00:30:02,438 --> 00:30:04,023
Try to open your heart.

291
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:07,735
This lemon ice cream, it's really delicious.

292
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:10,196
I'm going to the restroom.

293
00:30:12,115 --> 00:30:13,199
Excuse me for a moment.

294
00:30:20,456 --> 00:30:22,041
Then, I would like some, please.

295
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:53,364
Manao, Please take this book to Gyoza's room.

296
00:30:53,364 --> 00:30:55,783
It just so happens that I need to talk to Gyoza.

297
00:30:55,783 --> 00:30:56,659
Sure.

298
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,127
Gyo.

299
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:10,715
I know it's a bit late.

300
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:17,013
But I think you should get it.

301
00:31:24,353 --> 00:31:27,106
But, but at that time...

302
00:31:28,024 --> 00:31:31,444
you didn't think I should get it.

303
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:37,742
Yes, at that time,
I really thought so.

304
00:31:39,577 --> 00:31:44,415
I've always thought
that what we embrace is right.

305
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:47,627
I was strict myself.

306
00:31:49,587 --> 00:31:55,593
When I finished studying, I realized that
life is not how we think it is.

307
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,723
And then I heard from Ikkyu that
you became the head senior.

308
00:32:02,308 --> 00:32:06,312
I saw you, and you've done so well.

309
00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:12,818
Passing on traditions,
and letting the juniors choose for themselves.

310
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:19,867
You can mark the gear race date in your calendars.
I believe all of you...

311
00:32:19,867 --> 00:32:22,036
want the badge for sure.

312
00:32:24,497 --> 00:32:28,042
Thank you, P'Rit.
Thank you so much.

313
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:36,634
I want to change the old perspective on traditions.
I want everyone to know that...

314
00:32:36,634 --> 00:32:40,179
Women can be engineers just like men.

315
00:32:41,555 --> 00:32:45,518
The achievements are the measuring stick,
not gender.

316
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:52,608
I believe everyone should see this.

317
00:32:53,442 --> 00:32:54,819
Fight on.

318
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,676
- Hey!
- Oops.

319
00:33:18,676 --> 00:33:21,220
What are you playing, huh, Nao?

320
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,222
Others aren't here yet?

321
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,280
Such a cute rabbit.

322
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,324
Which rabbit?

323
00:33:41,324 --> 00:33:42,575
That one.

324
00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:46,078
The purple rabbit mascot.

325
00:33:46,078 --> 00:33:47,788
Carrying a rabbit.

326
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:50,583
Rabbit carrying a rabbit.

327
00:33:52,335 --> 00:33:54,128
So adorable, huh?

328
00:33:55,504 --> 00:33:56,922
Do you like it?

329
00:33:59,216 --> 00:34:04,221
Then on your graduation day,
I'll invest in wearing that outfit. How's that?

330
00:34:05,222 --> 00:34:06,474
No need.

331
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:09,268
But it's just so cute.

332
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,652
Is it cuter than me?

333
00:34:17,652 --> 00:34:20,571
Stop looking and turn back to me.

334
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:22,573
I'm jealous.

335
00:34:22,573 --> 00:34:24,617
Are you also jealous over the rabbit?

336
00:34:24,617 --> 00:34:32,541
I'm jealous at everything. The smiles, the glances,
the words, the voice. Nao pouts at everything.

337
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:37,129
You're too much! Overreact!

338
00:34:42,635 --> 00:34:45,805
If that day comes,
Gyo, do you want something as a gift?

339
00:34:46,806 --> 00:34:49,016
Just having you by my side is enough.

340
00:34:49,016 --> 00:34:53,145
I always stay. Where would I go?

341
00:34:54,605 --> 00:34:57,733
I'll always be by your side.

342
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:14,750
Right here.

343
00:35:21,841 --> 00:35:23,676
Almost.

344
00:35:44,947 --> 00:35:45,865
First year!

345
00:35:45,865 --> 00:35:46,657
Yes!

346
00:35:46,657 --> 00:35:47,783
Cheering!

347
00:35:47,783 --> 00:35:49,034
Yes!

348
00:35:49,034 --> 00:35:51,245
Throughout this past semester,

349
00:35:51,245 --> 00:35:53,497
we've taught you many things.

350
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:55,458
Shared sorrows, shared joys.

351
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:58,085
Taking responsibility together.

352
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:02,047
How have all these activities changed you?
Do you know?

353
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:08,971
They've made you more responsible,
more resilient, more united.

354
00:36:10,264 --> 00:36:15,811
Trophies or certificates cannot
compare to the pride you feel inside.

355
00:36:17,688 --> 00:36:18,856
Today,

356
00:36:20,316 --> 00:36:23,110
you're almost at the end of your journey.

357
00:36:24,487 --> 00:36:26,280
Just sixty-seven rounds left.

358
00:36:26,906 --> 00:36:28,282
You're reaching the finish line.

359
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:32,161
I'll give you another decision to make.

360
00:36:33,662 --> 00:36:37,833
Whether you'll be mere residents or part of the gear.

361
00:36:40,586 --> 00:36:44,673
Anyone who doesn't want to participate
in this activity can leave now.

362
00:36:54,558 --> 00:36:58,771
From now on, only your two legs

363
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:00,856
can take you to the finish line.

364
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:03,651
Any friends who can't handle it,

365
00:37:04,193 --> 00:37:08,030
hug each other tightly.
Hug them tightly.

366
00:37:09,657 --> 00:37:12,201
We'll make it to the sixty-seventh round together.

367
00:37:13,118 --> 00:37:17,164
My juniors, my friends, my seniors,

368
00:37:18,207 --> 00:37:21,293
they will carry you.
We'll run together.

369
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:23,254
Are you ready?

370
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:24,713
Ready!

371
00:37:24,713 --> 00:37:27,800
When you're ready,
give it your all.

372
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:31,011
Give it all as you can.

373
00:37:31,011 --> 00:37:33,389
First year can be just once.

374
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:37,476
Later on, you won't regret giving it your all.

375
00:37:37,476 --> 00:37:40,938
The tiredness will vanish soon.

376
00:37:40,938 --> 00:37:45,609
Rest for just a moment and it'll disappear
But the pride that arises

377
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:49,071
will stay with you forever.
Understood?

378
00:37:49,071 --> 00:37:50,573
Understood.

379
00:37:50,573 --> 00:37:51,574
Understood?

380
00:37:51,574 --> 00:37:53,200
Understood.

381
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,664
Are you ready?

382
00:37:58,664 --> 00:38:00,249
Ready.

383
00:38:00,249 --> 00:38:01,166
Let's go.

384
00:38:53,177 --> 00:38:54,553
Gyo.

385
00:38:55,095 --> 00:38:57,640
Gyo, are you okay?

386
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:35,552
Did P'Gyo ever secretly love a friend?

387
00:39:35,552 --> 00:39:38,597
No, never.
A friend is just a friend.

388
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:44,061
For me, I can't change the feelings I have for someone.

389
00:39:46,355 --> 00:39:51,694
But... if we never thought of them
as a friend from the start,

390
00:39:51,694 --> 00:39:55,114
then the feelings can be changed, right?

391
00:39:55,114 --> 00:39:58,409
For me, if you feel a certain way,

392
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:04,832
it's better to express it honestly,
true to your feelings.

393
00:40:04,832 --> 00:40:06,625
Is that so?

394
00:40:08,252 --> 00:40:10,170
I likes Manao.

395
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,968
I like her since the first day we met.

396
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:22,057
I see that you and Nao are close.

397
00:40:22,057 --> 00:40:25,394
P'Gyo, could you help me?

398
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:36,864
Should we go to the tent instead?

399
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,657
I'll take you.

400
00:40:38,657 --> 00:40:40,075
- Sure.
- Let's go.

401
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,786
Take it easy.

402
00:40:44,913 --> 00:40:46,373
Are you okay?

403
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:48,208
Let's go.

404
00:40:50,586 --> 00:40:52,796
- Okay?
- It's better if I carry.

405
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:34,505
Would you be mere residents or part of the gear?

406
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:36,840
Today, I got an answer from all of you.

407
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:40,219
Throughout this semester,

408
00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:44,389
you've been through a lot together,
but it's not over yet.

409
00:41:46,016 --> 00:41:49,978
For the next four years ahead,
the real challenges await you.

410
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:54,733
In the past midterm exams, you've seen

411
00:41:54,733 --> 00:42:00,781
how close you've come to
being expelled or dropped out.

412
00:42:02,074 --> 00:42:06,537
You'll need to be serious
because this is your future.

413
00:42:08,372 --> 00:42:14,795
Remember this time well,
the time you went through together.

414
00:42:14,795 --> 00:42:20,509
The time you were proud.
The day you became part of the gear.

415
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,804
First-year.

416
00:42:30,686 --> 00:42:34,356
Today is your day.
Congratulations.

417
00:42:42,114 --> 00:42:44,825
Come closer; I'll put it on.

418
00:42:44,825 --> 00:42:45,868
Yes.

419
00:42:58,088 --> 00:43:00,215
Thank you.

420
00:43:26,658 --> 00:43:30,954
Here you are.
I've been here looking for you.

421
00:43:34,082 --> 00:43:36,710
How are your feet? Let me take a look.

422
00:43:42,758 --> 00:43:45,302
Are you mad at me?

423
00:43:47,346 --> 00:43:50,974
No. Did you do something wrong?

424
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:57,147
Today, when P'Pure carried Gyoza to the infirmary tent,

425
00:43:58,732 --> 00:44:00,943
How did you feel?

426
00:44:03,028 --> 00:44:05,614
How should I feel?

427
00:44:05,614 --> 00:44:06,907
Well...

428
00:44:07,783 --> 00:44:11,703
Jealousy, something like that.

429
00:44:11,703 --> 00:44:17,793
Why do I have to feel that way?
There's nothing between you and P'Pure.

430
00:44:19,544 --> 00:44:23,590
Or is it about me and Luktarn?

431
00:44:25,008 --> 00:44:26,677
Saying things like that...

432
00:44:27,844 --> 00:44:29,638
So, it means...

433
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:34,017
you can tell, right?
How Luktarn feels about you.

434
00:44:34,017 --> 00:44:35,602
Yes.

435
00:44:37,771 --> 00:44:43,276
I know how Looktak feels about me.
But Manao already told her directly

436
00:44:43,276 --> 00:44:47,698
that I love someone else
and we can only be friends.

437
00:44:47,698 --> 00:44:50,617
I probably can't stop Looktak's feelings,

438
00:44:50,617 --> 00:44:53,954
but I'm deeply attached to my own feelings.

439
00:44:57,082 --> 00:44:59,292
Please, trust me.

440
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:11,179
I'm sorry for being like this.

441
00:45:13,098 --> 00:45:17,686
Next time, I will believe in you more.

442
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:21,815
But can I ask for one thing?

443
00:45:21,815 --> 00:45:24,276
What is it?

444
00:45:24,276 --> 00:45:27,320
Don't be too kind to everyone.

445
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,321
Can you?

446
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:31,783
Do you think that I'm too kind to everyone?

447
00:45:32,826 --> 00:45:34,202
Whoa.

448
00:45:34,911 --> 00:45:38,874
Then let me do that sometimes,
so you can see.

449
00:45:39,332 --> 00:45:40,292
Okay.

450
00:45:41,084 --> 00:45:43,503
I won't be friendly to anyone anymore.

451
00:45:44,629 --> 00:45:46,882
Are we good, baby?

452
00:45:49,176 --> 00:45:51,178
That's enough.

453
00:46:02,189 --> 00:46:03,398
Gyo.

454
00:46:08,487 --> 00:46:11,073
I want our situation to be clear.

455
00:46:13,784 --> 00:46:18,914
I don't wants our love to be a secret anymore.

456
00:46:37,057 --> 00:46:38,975
Be my girlfriend, please?

457
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:12,259
My heart... I give it to you.

458
00:47:12,259 --> 00:47:15,095
Don't take it off.

459
00:47:15,095 --> 00:47:19,474
I want my heart to be close to yours.

460
00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:25,147
I also has something for you.

461
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:29,401
Give me your hand.

462
00:47:47,043 --> 00:47:50,005
This is not a gear, is it?

463
00:47:50,005 --> 00:47:52,507
Well, I made it myself.

464
00:47:52,507 --> 00:47:56,720
There's only one in the world,
and it has Gyoza's name on it.

465
00:47:59,931 --> 00:48:02,392
But if you want the gear from the department,

466
00:48:03,852 --> 00:48:06,938
we'll get it from the dorm later.

467
00:48:06,938 --> 00:48:11,193
No, I likes this gear.

468
00:48:11,193 --> 00:48:13,570
Thank you for making me this.

469
00:48:15,071 --> 00:48:17,324
So you like it?

470
00:48:17,324 --> 00:48:18,700
I love it.

471
00:48:20,118 --> 00:48:22,621
But why is it a bracelet?

472
00:48:23,246 --> 00:48:28,543
Well, if it's on the right wrist,
you will get to see it all the time when doing something.

473
00:48:28,543 --> 00:48:35,759
In case there's a day when you feel nervous
or want to go astray from the path,

474
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:39,221
You will think of me all the time.

475
00:48:40,513 --> 00:48:43,016
Even if I don't see it,

476
00:48:43,016 --> 00:48:46,186
I still think of you all the time.

477
00:48:46,186 --> 00:48:48,730
It takes more than words to make me believe you.

478
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:53,485
I'll make it more than words,
I'm telling you, I'm not joking.

479
00:49:03,703 --> 00:49:05,455
Let go of me.

480
00:49:06,831 --> 00:49:11,753
So, shall we go eat noodles together?
I'm starving.

481
00:49:12,796 --> 00:49:16,800
Wait, where are you hurrying off to?

482
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,552
You haven't agreed to be my girlfriend yet.

483
00:49:26,518 --> 00:49:29,854
I'm rushing to eat noodles with my girlfriend.

484
00:49:29,854 --> 00:49:31,690
Hurry up!

485
00:49:42,177 --> 00:49:44,177
(Beside Story)

486
00:49:44,202 --> 00:49:46,579
Being a head senior is exhausting.

487
00:49:48,123 --> 00:49:49,958
Want me to help?

488
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:51,459
Help how?

489
00:49:54,087 --> 00:49:57,090
Here, a vitamin pill.

490
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,843
I'll make the drink for you.

491
00:50:06,308 --> 00:50:09,936
Drink, you'll feel refreshed.

492
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:18,945
Ready to work now.

493
00:50:22,032 --> 00:50:22,907
You're great.

494
00:50:22,907 --> 00:50:24,492
Let's go.

495
00:50:27,537 --> 00:50:28,330
(Next Episode)
Gyo.

496
00:50:28,538 --> 00:50:29,414
Huh?

497
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:36,046
The way you're always close to P'Warang,
I don't like it either.

498
00:50:36,338 --> 00:50:38,089
Having to see both of you so close.

499
00:50:38,715 --> 00:50:42,427
How can you be like this?
You're acting like a child.

500
00:50:42,427 --> 00:50:44,971
Just go and date her.

501
00:50:44,971 --> 00:50:47,474
No need to stay with someone childish like me.
