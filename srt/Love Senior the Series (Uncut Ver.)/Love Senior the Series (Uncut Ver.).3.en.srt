"Love Senior The Series"
(Episode 3)

2
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:47,220
(Previously Episode)
A head senior? She can give me head too.

3
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,430
What the hell are you saying?

4
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,973
That guy was too pathetic.

5
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:55,728
What's going on? This
is about Manao, isn't it?

6
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:59,899
Do you have no clue about
your relationship with Manao?

7
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,318
It's making our major look bad.

8
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:05,696
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:11,702
Nao, stop! I'm ordering you to stop.

10
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:14,872
Don't overthink it.

11
00:02:14,872 --> 00:02:17,625
How can I not overthink this? When...

12
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,711
everything she said is true, you know.

13
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:24,590
I'm sorry,

14
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:27,927
that I caused you trouble.

15
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:57,665
(Max)

16
00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:11,512
I'm Max, the president of the fourth year.

17
00:03:11,512 --> 00:03:13,514
I heard that someone

18
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:17,685
caused an argument,
leading to damage to our major.

19
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:21,981
You, stand up.

20
00:03:26,444 --> 00:03:29,905
Is it true
that you had a fight with another faculty?

21
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:30,948
Yes.

22
00:03:30,948 --> 00:03:33,241
Do you know that your
actions have repercussions

23
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:35,411
on the acceptance
you get from the faculty?

24
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:38,497
I know it very well.
I deserve to get punished alone.

25
00:03:38,497 --> 00:03:40,916
I'm not the one to punish you.

26
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,710
Gyo, come here.

27
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:47,632
Were you involved in that incident?

28
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:48,215
Yes.

29
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:54,180
Being the second-year head senior,
why did you let this happen?

30
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,352
I apologize,
I'll take full responsibility alone.

31
00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:04,357
You've heard, right, first year?

32
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:07,902
Your senior takes
responsibility for all of you alone.

33
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:14,283
I hope you'll appreciate this
and not repeat your mistakes.

34
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:15,117
Gyo.

35
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:20,081
I'll punish you to protect the
dignity and honor of our major.

36
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:22,375
What batch are you in?

37
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:24,335
E66.

38
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,170
Good numbers.

39
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:31,175
So, run sixty-six laps
around the football field.

40
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,012
That might compensate
for your junior's mistake.

41
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:39,141
Gyo, The second-year head senior will
run laps around the football field, go!

42
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:41,727
With your permission.

43
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:45,272
I would like to help my senior.

44
00:04:45,272 --> 00:04:46,816
I disciplined my junior.

45
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:48,776
It's not about you. Sit down.

46
00:04:49,443 --> 00:04:50,361
I refuse.

47
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:53,280
If this is an activity to
welcome juniors to create unity,

48
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,159
to build genuine camaraderie between
seniors and juniors like the way you want.

49
00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:00,538
Not allowing me to help P'Gyo is like,

50
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:02,982
you punishing people for
your own satisfaction and

51
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:05,751
not considering the image
or reputation of our major.

52
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,589
How could you teach your junior to not show
respect, and not listen to the commands?

53
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:12,383
Nao, sit down.

54
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:13,467
But you...

55
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:15,553
Have you forgotten your promise with me?

56
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:20,057
To believe and listen to my words,
or are you breaking your promise?

57
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:23,769
Doubling the punishment.

58
00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:30,109
I would like to help my senior.

59
00:05:31,485 --> 00:05:33,446
I would like to help my senior.

60
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:36,657
Me too.

61
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:39,243
Me too.

62
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:43,797
First-year. I won't stop you.

63
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:48,335
If you want to help so much,
go run around field sixty-seven times.

64
00:05:48,335 --> 00:05:49,378
Same as your batch.

65
00:05:49,378 --> 00:05:51,922
But if any of you can't even run,

66
00:05:51,922 --> 00:05:53,841
I'll exempt the second-year head senior.

67
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:55,593
Yes.

68
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:03,642
I won't let you accept punishment alone.

69
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:05,853
If you can't handle the run,

70
00:06:05,853 --> 00:06:08,063
I will carry you myself.

71
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:15,279
Go.

72
00:06:56,987 --> 00:06:59,532
Didn't think it'd get this heated.

73
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:02,993
I told you, that Manao
kid is quite something.

74
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:04,870
Look at her, rallying
the entire junior batch.

75
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,291
Enabling everyone to help this much,
I respect that. She's just a first-year.

76
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:13,212
Faster, all of your friends are gone.

77
00:07:13,212 --> 00:07:15,297
Run.

78
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,352
Nao, wait, wait a moment.

79
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,148
I can't catch my breath,
can't keep up anymore.

80
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:38,003
Stop running, Nao.

81
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:41,073
P'Max canceled the command a while ago.

82
00:07:41,073 --> 00:07:44,285
It's only you and P'Gyo
in the field right now.

83
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,746
I won't stop running
until the round's complete,

84
00:07:48,455 --> 00:07:49,707
The head senior

85
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:54,837
has a duty to uphold honor.
I can't let people look down on me.

86
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,548
I won't won't let that happen.

87
00:07:57,548 --> 00:08:01,427
In that case, let's continue, P'Gyo.

88
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:04,388
There's only around
twenty more rounds left.

89
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:16,901
Let's go.

90
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:26,952
Are you okay?

91
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:29,496
Is she looks okay?

92
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:30,915
Don't force yourself.

93
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:33,167
- Sit.
- Slowly.

94
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:35,169
Slowly.

95
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:38,088
Does it hurt?

96
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:39,840
It hurts.

97
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:44,887
Look at you. Go home, take a shower,
and take some medicine.

98
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:47,723
Otherwise, I'll let my Thida beat you.

99
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:50,893
Okay, okay, stop complaining. Oh.

100
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:52,478
I'm just worried.

101
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:56,023
Um, alright then. I'll bring my car
to pick you up and drop you at the dorm.

102
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:57,066
Awww.

103
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:59,693
Wait here, okay? Don't faint.

104
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:00,945
Sit properly, Don't faint.

105
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:03,030
Well, I don't feel like carrying you back.

106
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,698
Hello, hello.

107
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:05,908
Your bag is here. I'm going.

108
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:07,243
Alright, Good night.

109
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:08,827
Stay here.

110
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:17,461
Are you going back now or what?
I'll bring my car to pick you up here.

111
00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:21,257
I don't think you can walk.

112
00:09:21,257 --> 00:09:25,302
Um, it's better if you just carry me.

113
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:29,974
Smelly. Earlier, you bravely held the girl's
hand and ran. You won't complain a bit.

114
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:32,851
Now, You want me to carry you?

115
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:36,397
Wait here. I'll bring
my car to pick you up.

116
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,113
Why do you seem so cheerful today?

117
00:11:08,113 --> 00:11:09,907
Because she has to work, right?

118
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:12,576
Perhaps she's crazily heartbroken.

119
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:17,581
Heartbroken?

120
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:09,925
Thank you.

121
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,064
Please give a big round
of applause. Do you like it?

122
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:19,518
Hello, Sis Thun.

123
00:12:19,518 --> 00:12:24,940
Moota and Pepsi,
Give big applause for Nao.

124
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:33,687
I saw your clip, singing and playing
guitar on the day of freshy contest.

125
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:40,789
I have never seen this side of you before. I
thought you're only good at starting fights.

126
00:12:41,623 --> 00:12:45,794
Anyway, thank you so much
for letting me sing part-time.

127
00:12:45,794 --> 00:12:48,922
I hope to make up for what I was caused.

128
00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:54,261
If you're that good, then you
shouldn't have gone looking for trouble.

129
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:57,723
I'll let you sing here regularly.

130
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:58,390
Yes.

131
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:01,935
I'll welcome the guest first.

132
00:13:01,935 --> 00:13:06,940
Hi there, come on in.

133
00:13:10,194 --> 00:13:11,153
Jom.

134
00:13:11,153 --> 00:13:14,323
Oh my, Manao.

135
00:13:14,323 --> 00:13:16,825
Why did you let her get this drunk?

136
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:20,579
I stopped her but she still drank and drank.

137
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,372
I don't know if she did it out of spite.

138
00:13:22,372 --> 00:13:23,957
What do you want me to do then?

139
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:28,420
And now, what should I do?
She lives in the dorm.

140
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,214
How can she go back in this state?

141
00:13:33,842 --> 00:13:35,969
Hey, what are you doing?

142
00:13:37,354 --> 00:13:41,107
This is the key card. You take her, buddy.

143
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:47,814
Hey, Tarn, walk properly for a second.

144
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:56,949
Take it slow.

145
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,178
Nao.

146
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,474
I like you.

147
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,815
Even though I know,
you have someone you like.

148
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:39,199
For me, you are very important.

149
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:45,163
I'll help remove that
someone from your heart.

150
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:50,252
At least, for now.

151
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:36,465
Stay with me tonight.

152
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:02,908
Hand out the sheets.

153
00:16:03,742 --> 00:16:07,537
The sheets that my friends are about
to hand out. It's about physics.

154
00:16:07,537 --> 00:16:11,041
It's all old exam-oriented questions
that you'll need for this semester.

155
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,085
Thank you.

156
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:21,259
Why do you have to drag me out?
If you want tutoring, come alone.

157
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:23,178
You're so dumb about physics.

158
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:26,890
I can't be bothered to explain
complex formulas to someone like you.

159
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,978
But I'm not hoping for this subject,
just getting D dog is enough for me.

160
00:16:31,978 --> 00:16:37,818
I'm afraid you'll end up raising fish instead
of a dog. Don't complain if you get an F.

161
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:38,860
Okay?

162
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,488
I'm deeply moved, buddy.

163
00:16:44,574 --> 00:16:49,371
I must thank you for telling me, or else we
wouldn't know if the senior would tutor us.

164
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:52,958
It's okay. It's thanks
for tutoring me in math.

165
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,459
Because you know I
can't handle math, right?

166
00:16:58,797 --> 00:17:00,549
Another round, another question.

167
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:04,136
Oh, Nao, can we take a break?

168
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:07,013
My head is spinning like crazy now.

169
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:10,684
It's good that we got tutoring today.
So I can review it again.

170
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:13,937
Midterms are coming in just a few days.

171
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,275
Oh, you've no roommate?

172
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:21,611
I booked the dorm late,
so others got all the roommates already.

173
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:23,947
Actually, by the end of
this month, I'll move out.

174
00:17:23,947 --> 00:17:27,117
I'm going to stay in the same dorm as Tal.
So I can have someone to talk with.

175
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:38,628
Do you know, P'Gyo, the head senior,

176
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:42,507
she lives in the room next door.
We've walked past each other sometimes.

177
00:17:42,507 --> 00:17:44,301
She looks fierce.

178
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,431
Um, Nao, the seniors
will tutor physics tomorrow.

179
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:52,601
Will you go for tutoring too?
They reserved a room in the building.

180
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:53,602
Physics?

181
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:54,478
Yeah.

182
00:17:54,478 --> 00:17:58,398
It's interesting. I'll
get to drag Jom along.

183
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:02,110
That's guy is like dumb as shit.

184
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:06,323
But honestly, the seniors are kind.
They also have exams

185
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:08,658
but they willingly spend time tutoring us.

186
00:18:09,242 --> 00:18:10,619
Um, Aoey.

187
00:18:10,911 --> 00:18:13,330
I'll go stretch out on the balcony.

188
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,373
Sure, I'll give my brain a break.

189
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:16,291
Yeah.

190
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:18,084
Rest, rest, rest.

191
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:40,774
You are so kind. Normally, head seniors
would have to be fierce, right?

192
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,901
And do you want me to be fierce?

193
00:18:47,614 --> 00:18:50,909
Well, I don't actually want
you to be kind to others

194
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:54,204
I just want you to be kind
to only me, is that possible?

195
00:20:00,604 --> 00:20:03,106
Do you remember Newton's laws of motion?

196
00:20:03,106 --> 00:20:05,150
Do you remember what S equals?

197
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,776
Who remembers?

198
00:20:07,527 --> 00:20:08,778
Nao.

199
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:11,781
Why isn't Looktal coming?

200
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:19,706
Don't know.

201
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:22,208
That's strange.

202
00:20:24,127 --> 00:20:25,545
I'll be back.

203
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:27,631
What about me?

204
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:29,049
Quiet.

205
00:20:30,884 --> 00:20:32,761
Are you leaving me again?

206
00:20:39,225 --> 00:20:44,856
Ploy, may I take a break?
I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna puke.

207
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,904
Finish the last question first,
then take a break.

208
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:52,822
The last question.

209
00:20:53,448 --> 00:20:57,369
Promise me that it would be the last question.

210
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:02,268
I promise.

211
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:14,594
Bow down, bow your head.

212
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:31,444
You.

213
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:33,196
Stand up.

214
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,534
I said, stand up!

215
00:21:46,793 --> 00:21:50,171
I, Miss Kaniknan Wiwatkul,

216
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:54,217
a first-year engineering student,
a soon-to-be E66.

217
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:58,096
I didn't ask you.
Why didn't you follow the order?

218
00:21:58,096 --> 00:22:00,724
You're not showing seniors respect.

219
00:22:00,724 --> 00:22:06,229
I'm showing respect.
Speaking without looking at people's faces

220
00:22:06,229 --> 00:22:09,899
I consider it disrespect.
This is basic manners.

221
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:11,401
Don't you know?

222
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:14,487
I'm not arguing whether it's basic manners.

223
00:22:14,487 --> 00:22:18,825
But here, the orders of the seniors
are considered to be always right.

224
00:22:18,825 --> 00:22:22,120
The way you are disobeying me
is equivalent to

225
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,706
not respecting seniors.

226
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:26,624
This time, I won't punish you.

227
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:30,003
I think it's because my
juniors failed to teach you.

228
00:22:30,003 --> 00:22:33,256
Second year, stand up!

229
00:22:34,924 --> 00:22:37,552
Squat based on your batch. Go!

230
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:49,063
1..2..3..4..5..6..7..8..9..10...

231
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,636
Hello, roommates.

232
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:35,860
Hey, you're back so soon?
You said you would go see Suay?

233
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,489
She wasn't there. That's
why I came back early.

234
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:47,497
What are you doing?

235
00:23:47,497 --> 00:23:49,582
Revising my assignment.

236
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:08,852
Gyo.

237
00:24:09,477 --> 00:24:11,229
You need to give your brains a break.

238
00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:12,730
Okay.

239
00:24:23,283 --> 00:24:25,994
Here, for refreshing.

240
00:24:40,216 --> 00:24:41,676
Good girl.

241
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:43,177
Ouch.

242
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,390
I didn't take a break at all.

243
00:24:48,683 --> 00:24:50,977
My eyes hurt.

244
00:24:55,398 --> 00:24:55,982
Oops.

245
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,236
Wipe your mouth a bit,
you look more like a kid.

246
00:25:33,394 --> 00:25:34,812
Done.

247
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:40,360
Don't be too happy yet. If you
make a mistake, you have to fix it.

248
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:54,415
Okay, you did it right.

249
00:25:54,415 --> 00:25:57,543
When you return to the dorm, don't forget
to practice the exercises frequently.

250
00:25:57,543 --> 00:26:00,713
So that when you face real exam,
you won't be shocked.

251
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,677
Alright, I've written
down everything for you.

252
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:08,930
Thank you.

253
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,266
Are you going back with me?

254
00:26:12,976 --> 00:26:14,143
No, it's fine.

255
00:26:14,143 --> 00:26:18,064
I need to wait for my twin brother to
finish studying with his friends first,

256
00:26:18,064 --> 00:26:20,191
then we'll go back home together.

257
00:26:20,191 --> 00:26:23,319
Can I borrow this room
until P'Pure finishes?

258
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,195
Sure.

259
00:26:24,195 --> 00:26:26,739
Then don't forget to
leave the key where it was.

260
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:28,241
Okay.

261
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:30,743
Ride safely when going back to the dorm.

262
00:26:50,847 --> 00:26:53,433
Thanks to you for everything.

263
00:27:54,077 --> 00:27:58,998
You think you're confident
and sure now, right?

264
00:28:01,793 --> 00:28:03,252
I think..

265
00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:08,174
It's time for me to return the gear to you.

266
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,552
I'm sorry.

267
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,388
I'm sorry that...

268
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,684
I can't hold onto it anymore.

269
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,065
We need to release
ourselves from this attachment.

270
00:28:25,608 --> 00:28:29,237
And set our hearts free.

271
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,002
Manao, wait for me.

272
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:33,509
Wait for the day when everything's over.

273
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:35,720
Wait until I become...

274
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,140
Just an ordinary girl.

275
00:29:41,184 --> 00:29:43,978
Who doesn't need to
uphold departmental honor.

276
00:29:46,606 --> 00:29:48,900
When that day comes,

277
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:53,321
I won't hesitate to
express feelings to you.

278
00:30:35,363 --> 00:30:36,113
Oh!

279
00:30:36,697 --> 00:30:39,992
Nao, wake up!
What were you dreaming about here?

280
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,829
Oh, can you wake me up nicely?

281
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:52,088
I just realized you're
wearing this kind of shirt too.

282
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:58,803
Earlier, did you see anyone around here?

283
00:30:58,803 --> 00:31:01,472
Right here, there's only you, buddy.

284
00:31:01,472 --> 00:31:04,809
Because others are being
tortured by physics up there.

285
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:07,520
So why did you hurry
down here? Are you leaving?

286
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,983
Yeah, I can't anymore. I'm super tired.

287
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:14,652
Let's go back. I need
to drop you at the dorm.

288
00:31:14,652 --> 00:31:16,320
You can go back now.

289
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,158
Quickly.

290
00:31:38,718 --> 00:31:41,554
Hey, Hello, godmother.

291
00:31:41,554 --> 00:31:43,431
What's up? Can you make it?

292
00:31:43,431 --> 00:31:45,433
Um...

293
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:47,393
I couldn't answer every
question, but I think

294
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:49,645
it's better than not
answering all the questions.

295
00:31:49,645 --> 00:31:52,189
If it weren't for your help, I
would have been dead. Thank you.

296
00:31:52,189 --> 00:31:54,775
No need to thank me. If there's
anything I can help, just tell me.

297
00:31:54,775 --> 00:31:56,610
Are you waiting for Jom?

298
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,570
Yeah.

299
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:01,073
He didn't come out yet.
He is aiming for A+ for sure.

300
00:32:01,073 --> 00:32:04,285
It's hard for A+. If I
don't get it, he won't too.

301
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:05,453
True.

302
00:32:07,913 --> 00:32:10,833
How are you? How did the exam go?

303
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:12,001
It's okay.

304
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:14,795
But I won't be able to compete with
someone who receives academic achievement

305
00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:17,173
from the dean every semester like you.

306
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:23,012
There are still many
subjects left. Let's focus a bit.

307
00:32:23,012 --> 00:32:23,763
Okay.

308
00:32:23,763 --> 00:32:25,348
Let's work hard.

309
00:32:26,265 --> 00:32:27,350
Go for it.

310
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,517
Go for it.

311
00:32:28,517 --> 00:32:30,770
Let's go, I'm hungry.

312
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:31,937
You're always late.

313
00:32:31,937 --> 00:32:33,064
Yeah, let's go.

314
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:35,041
I'm leaving.

315
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:36,942
Hello.

316
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:41,447
Manao!

317
00:32:42,031 --> 00:32:43,366
I'm thrilled.

318
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:47,953
Look at them. I'm a shipper.
My heart flutters.

319
00:32:48,913 --> 00:32:50,873
How long have you been shipping them?

320
00:32:50,873 --> 00:32:53,376
Since the day P'Ikkyu summoned us.

321
00:32:53,376 --> 00:32:57,296
I saw them smiling when we were
running around the field together.

322
00:32:57,296 --> 00:32:58,422
So adorable.

323
00:32:58,422 --> 00:33:01,133
Then when you and P'Gyo finished running,

324
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:04,595
I saw both of them walking
back to the dorm together.

325
00:33:04,595 --> 00:33:07,556
One looked strong and I saw him as a top,

326
00:33:07,556 --> 00:33:12,019
while the other has a sweet
face like a perfect bottom.

327
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:12,978
Wait a sec.

328
00:33:13,562 --> 00:33:15,707
Earlier, when you said
as soon as we finished running,

329
00:33:15,731 --> 00:33:18,317
did they immediately
walk back to the dorm?

330
00:33:18,317 --> 00:33:19,694
Um, yes.

331
00:33:32,915 --> 00:33:34,125
I think so.

332
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:37,420
If there is anything I can
help you with, just tell me.

333
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:37,878
Yeah.

334
00:33:37,878 --> 00:33:38,754
Did you do it well?

335
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,881
It's fine.

336
00:33:57,022 --> 00:33:58,190
Looktal.

337
00:33:58,774 --> 00:33:59,358
I...

338
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:05,364
I don't need an apology
Because you didn't do anything wrong.

339
00:34:08,826 --> 00:34:11,370
I chose to do this myself.

340
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:31,390
Can I be that person
for you? Is it possible?

341
00:34:44,195 --> 00:34:45,863
I'm sorry.

342
00:35:03,047 --> 00:35:04,465
Aoey, let's go back.

343
00:35:04,465 --> 00:35:07,468
Alright, then we'll head back first. Bye.

344
00:35:12,515 --> 00:35:14,225
You.

345
00:35:15,893 --> 00:35:20,022
Is there something going on between you
and Looktal? Why does it seem strange?

346
00:35:20,022 --> 00:35:21,732
It's nothing.

347
00:35:21,732 --> 00:35:23,442
Are you sure?

348
00:35:24,735 --> 00:35:27,821
Yeah, Why are you asking so much?

349
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:29,615
Let's go. I'm hungry.

350
00:35:29,615 --> 00:35:33,911
So you want an A? I saw you
doing it until the very last second.

351
00:35:33,911 --> 00:35:35,955
I'm quite confident, my friend.

352
00:35:35,955 --> 00:35:38,457
Gotta be 'A', for sure.
Let's go.

353
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,211
I'm sorry.

354
00:36:00,688 --> 00:36:01,772
I'm sorry.

355
00:36:01,772 --> 00:36:05,067
It's okay. You didn't mean it.

356
00:36:07,403 --> 00:36:09,071
I'm really sorry.

357
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:11,115
Thank you.

358
00:36:13,534 --> 00:36:17,663
Let's go eat. I'm really hungry.

359
00:36:20,749 --> 00:36:23,335
Hey Nao, why are you zoning out over there?

360
00:36:23,877 --> 00:36:25,713
- I'm hungry.
- Let's go.

361
00:36:25,713 --> 00:36:26,964
Yeah.

362
00:36:37,683 --> 00:36:38,559
Gyo!

363
00:36:40,394 --> 00:36:42,771
You sneaked up on me without any sound.

364
00:36:42,771 --> 00:36:46,775
What would you do
If I got a heart attack?

365
00:36:46,775 --> 00:36:49,945
Didn't think the second-year
head senior would be this jumpy.

366
00:37:16,138 --> 00:37:20,142
By that look, you're missing Ploy, huh?

367
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:25,939
You're being rude, don't you know?

368
00:37:25,939 --> 00:37:28,942
Reading people's mind like that.

369
00:37:33,614 --> 00:37:38,118
You can stop feeling guilty.
She has made up her mind already

370
00:37:38,118 --> 00:37:40,329
that you will have to
return the gear someday.

371
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,375
It's good that you spoke frankly.

372
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,710
No need to think too much.

373
00:37:48,212 --> 00:37:51,173
Are you a shapeshifter or something?

374
00:37:51,173 --> 00:37:55,177
How could you deeply understand
what's going on in my mind like that?

375
00:37:57,846 --> 00:38:04,019
If it's a yes, that means
I'd know everything you're thinking.

376
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:06,689
You're worried.

377
00:38:14,613 --> 00:38:20,369
About the promise we made,
I think you've done on what was said.

378
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:24,707
If you want to relinquish the position of
head senior now, I won't say anything.

379
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:28,711
I know you're burdened and tired.

380
00:38:30,045 --> 00:38:32,089
And it restricts your freedom.

381
00:38:35,926 --> 00:38:39,555
I know that I was being selfish.

382
00:38:39,555 --> 00:38:42,182
I held onto you with the
position and responsibilities.

383
00:38:42,683 --> 00:38:47,062
I'll release you from the position of
head senior if that's what you want.

384
00:38:52,568 --> 00:38:54,069
Sorry, P'Pure.

385
00:38:55,112 --> 00:38:57,656
I won't easily give up this position.

386
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:05,247
Don't just think on your own.
I've been doing this job for a long time.

387
00:39:05,247 --> 00:39:07,249
And you suddenly want to remove me?

388
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:12,421
Or have you found a new favorite?

389
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:15,466
Huh?

390
00:39:16,842 --> 00:39:21,764
Can't help it. Warang has been working
so well lately and deserving rewards,

391
00:39:22,598 --> 00:39:26,477
unlike some around here
who always ditches work.

392
00:39:26,477 --> 00:39:28,854
Spending time tending
to their wounded hearts.

393
00:39:32,274 --> 00:39:36,403
How did Warang manage to
become the favorite of yours?

394
00:39:36,403 --> 00:39:38,030
Did you forget about me, P'Pure?

395
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,115
It's me.

396
00:39:40,115 --> 00:39:42,409
It's Gyo, your little kid.

397
00:39:43,202 --> 00:39:45,370
Stop giggling and answer me first.

398
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,246
Let me go.

399
00:39:46,246 --> 00:39:47,581
Answer me.

400
00:39:47,581 --> 00:39:48,791
Let me go already.

401
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:51,335
Is this the head senior,
how can you act like this? Let go.

402
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:53,086
Where are you going?

403
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:53,879
P'Pure?

404
00:39:53,879 --> 00:39:55,214
I'm going to work.

405
00:40:11,021 --> 00:40:11,647
Hey!

406
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:12,731
There are many more.

407
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:13,857
Should we play basketball then?

408
00:40:13,857 --> 00:40:15,359
Hey, what are you doing?

409
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,069
Oh, Manao, this is perfect.

410
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:17,694
What's up?

411
00:40:17,694 --> 00:40:19,404
The schedule for the Freshy Games is out.

412
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:21,031
Take a look.

413
00:40:21,657 --> 00:40:23,617
Our faculty is at a disadvantage.

414
00:40:23,617 --> 00:40:27,454
Yeah, that's true. There
are few girls in our major.

415
00:40:27,454 --> 00:40:31,834
And this list of women's competitions
makes us short on athletes.

416
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:33,752
We won't be able to sign
up in many categories.

417
00:40:33,752 --> 00:40:36,839
Hey, don't underestimate our girls.

418
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,926
There's a girl who's competing with guys
from other faculties. Have you forgotten?

419
00:40:40,926 --> 00:40:42,135
Wanna try me?

420
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:43,387
Sorry.

421
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:44,972
Hey, show it to me.

422
00:40:47,182 --> 00:40:49,977
I bet you can compete in basketball, Nao.

423
00:40:49,977 --> 00:40:52,896
You still have to participate in
the Freshy competition with Alee.

424
00:40:53,605 --> 00:40:57,943
Other majors will be surprised, thinking
we're sending guys in wigs to the contest.

425
00:40:57,943 --> 00:41:00,070
Oops, look at that.

426
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,240
I can't help it. Sorry
for being so versatile.

427
00:41:04,032 --> 00:41:05,033
Gimme.

428
00:41:05,868 --> 00:41:07,160
What's this?

429
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,996
I'll join in a bit.

430
00:41:08,996 --> 00:41:10,163
Oh!

431
00:41:10,163 --> 00:41:11,206
Me too.

432
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,249
Yeah.

433
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:15,752
Hey.

434
00:41:16,169 --> 00:41:19,172
Here is the yearbook of
the third year that you want.

435
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,300
Thank you.

436
00:41:26,221 --> 00:41:27,347
Nao.

437
00:41:27,764 --> 00:41:28,515
Huh?

438
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:31,685
Do you and Looktal have something going on?

439
00:41:34,062 --> 00:41:37,274
I've seen you two avoiding
each other for a month now.

440
00:41:37,274 --> 00:41:39,359
I'm curious if there's a problem or not.

441
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,694
There's nothing.

442
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:46,033
We're not avoiding each
other. Gosh, you're overthinking.

443
00:41:46,867 --> 00:41:48,493
It's good if there isn't.

444
00:41:48,493 --> 00:41:52,247
I feel sorry for Looktal, though.
Nao, do you know

445
00:41:52,247 --> 00:41:54,082
that Looktal cares a lot about you?

446
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:56,543
Don't worry, Aoey.

447
00:41:58,086 --> 00:42:00,672
If there's something,
I'll handle it myself.

448
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:03,842
I'm fine now.

449
00:42:07,304 --> 00:42:11,767
Everyone please get to your seats.

450
00:42:14,311 --> 00:42:18,649
Hey, can this kid actually play?

451
00:42:18,649 --> 00:42:23,070
What's up, Gyo?
Is this year's project okay?

452
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,874
Miss goddamn Gyo.

453
00:42:35,874 --> 00:42:37,209
Miss. goddamn Gyo.

454
00:42:39,378 --> 00:42:44,424
If you're going to call me "Goddamn" you
don't have to address me as "Miss" right?

455
00:42:44,424 --> 00:42:46,134
Mr. goddamn Beer.

456
00:42:46,134 --> 00:42:49,972
You're going to assault me like this?

457
00:42:49,972 --> 00:42:52,182
Should I call the police?

458
00:42:52,182 --> 00:42:55,560
That's an understatement.

459
00:42:55,852 --> 00:42:56,436
Yeah.

460
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,856
Time, The head senior from another
major left a message to you, asking

461
00:42:59,856 --> 00:43:02,150
when are we going to finish collecting
the juniors' signature books for checking.

462
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,070
Looks like everyone else
has finished theirs already.

463
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:08,490
The sooner we collect them,
the faster the plan will run.

464
00:43:09,574 --> 00:43:11,118
I'm being direct.

465
00:43:12,035 --> 00:43:15,497
- I'm super tired this year.
- True.

466
00:43:15,497 --> 00:43:17,916
I don't know. It's all mixed up.

467
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:21,086
Uh, when are we collecting
the black-covered book again?

468
00:43:21,086 --> 00:43:26,800
Um, a day after
the sports event.

469
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,597
Alright, go tell Time about
that we'll collect the books then.

470
00:43:32,597 --> 00:43:36,268
If he and other head seniors
want to plan the gear accepting day,

471
00:43:36,268 --> 00:43:38,687
they can write a project plan
and send it directly to P'Pure.

472
00:43:39,271 --> 00:43:41,106
That's it.

473
00:43:42,357 --> 00:43:44,192
Are we planning the gear accepting day?

474
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,069
Yes.

475
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:52,367
This year's gear accepting day is early.
It's good. The activities will end quickly.

476
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:54,390
But you don't have
to worry. I'll check the

477
00:43:54,414 --> 00:43:56,872
project documents before
sending them to the dean.

478
00:43:56,872 --> 00:44:00,250
Oh. You don't have to do that.

479
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,960
Warang is the one overseeing it anyway.

480
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,421
For the sports project,
Warang is the one in charge.

481
00:44:04,421 --> 00:44:06,506
The two of you haven't talked?

482
00:44:10,635 --> 00:44:13,638
Beer. Can you help me
check the board for a bit?

483
00:44:13,638 --> 00:44:15,474
It seems like the names
are still incomplete.

484
00:44:15,474 --> 00:44:17,768
Checking for... the names...

485
00:44:17,768 --> 00:44:19,227
Check one more time.

486
00:44:19,394 --> 00:44:19,978
Okay.

487
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:26,943
Is there anything? Let me
know if you want me to talk to her.

488
00:44:28,445 --> 00:44:32,991
You don't have to, if she
doesn't want to talk to me,

489
00:44:32,991 --> 00:44:35,077
we shouldn't force her at all.

490
00:44:48,298 --> 00:44:51,176
What's up with the little
one? Why so flustered?

491
00:44:53,637 --> 00:44:57,641
It's probably the same old problem
they've had. We probably can't help.

492
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:02,896
We can't even get ourselves together.

493
00:45:17,077 --> 00:45:21,832
I've known that some of you
refuse to follow my orders.

494
00:45:22,374 --> 00:45:27,796
Why is that? To track down
second-year signatures,

495
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,467
and to get signatures from your
classmates, is that so hard for you?

496
00:45:33,093 --> 00:45:36,471
In the future, until the
end of the fourth year,

497
00:45:36,471 --> 00:45:41,351
you'll have to do many activities together,
rely on each other countless times,

498
00:45:42,477 --> 00:45:45,397
Are you going to do everything
alone, not considering your batch,

499
00:45:45,397 --> 00:45:47,023
not considering friends?

500
00:45:50,026 --> 00:45:50,902
You.

501
00:45:51,945 --> 00:45:53,905
Show me your signature book.

502
00:46:07,377 --> 00:46:12,132
Clean, blank, not even the owner's name.

503
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:14,301
What does this mean?

504
00:46:15,093 --> 00:46:17,929
Do you think I gave you
the book to joke around?

505
00:46:19,222 --> 00:46:23,393
Don't you see the importance
of building relationships?

506
00:46:23,935 --> 00:46:28,899
Turning your back on me,
on your seniors and friends, right?

507
00:46:34,112 --> 00:46:36,698
How'd you know that I don't have friends?

508
00:46:36,698 --> 00:46:40,702
What gives you the right
to judge this empty book?

509
00:46:40,702 --> 00:46:42,704
It doesn't mean I don't know anyone.

510
00:46:43,872 --> 00:46:46,249
Even if my book is blank,

511
00:46:46,249 --> 00:46:51,963
I might know more friends than someone
with a hundred names on their book.

512
00:46:51,963 --> 00:46:56,843
Prove it. Prove to me
that what you're saying

513
00:46:56,843 --> 00:46:59,763
isn't just a good excuse
from your smart mouth.

514
00:46:59,763 --> 00:47:03,934
First-year, everyone turn
your name tags around. Quickly.

515
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,732
You, stand up!

516
00:47:13,443 --> 00:47:14,861
What's this friend's name?

517
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,446
Suay.

518
00:47:16,988 --> 00:47:18,156
Turn the name tag.

519
00:47:19,324 --> 00:47:20,659
(Suay)

520
00:47:23,078 --> 00:47:24,829
You, stand up!

521
00:47:27,916 --> 00:47:29,417
And what's this person's name?

522
00:47:31,753 --> 00:47:33,171
Jubjib.

523
00:47:33,171 --> 00:47:34,589
Turn the name tag.

524
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,174
(Jubjib)

525
00:47:36,508 --> 00:47:38,009
You, stand up!

526
00:47:42,013 --> 00:47:43,181
What's her name?

527
00:47:43,181 --> 00:47:44,266
Lada.

528
00:47:44,266 --> 00:47:45,558
Turn the name tag.

529
00:47:46,226 --> 00:47:47,060
(Lada)

530
00:47:48,061 --> 00:47:50,021
what's this senior's name?

531
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:51,398
P'Pure.

532
00:47:54,609 --> 00:47:56,236
You, stand up!

533
00:47:59,072 --> 00:48:00,657
And what's this person's name?

534
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:05,912
You don't know, right?

535
00:48:07,122 --> 00:48:09,833
May I have your signature
book and your name tag, please?

536
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:24,597
There's no Kaniknan.
It's probably your own fault

537
00:48:24,597 --> 00:48:28,101
for not wanting to get to know your
friend who don't want to know you.

538
00:48:28,101 --> 00:48:32,939
Since you don't want to get to know each
other, this book doesn't need to exist.

539
00:48:40,864 --> 00:48:45,660
And as for this name tag,
I'll keep it until you

540
00:48:46,395 --> 00:48:48,355
prove it to yourself.

541
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:54,669
I want my friend's name tag back.

542
00:48:54,669 --> 00:48:56,296
You want it back, huh?

543
00:48:57,464 --> 00:49:00,800
If you can bring me the gear

544
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,180
within seven days,
I'll return this tag to your friend.

545
00:49:06,181 --> 00:49:09,601
But first-years can't get the gear until
the hazing is finished.

546
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:11,394
And that will be several more months.

547
00:49:11,394 --> 00:49:13,980
I didn't say the gear must be yours.

548
00:49:14,731 --> 00:49:18,068
You can do whatever
it takes to get the gear.

549
00:49:19,194 --> 00:49:21,363
But there are consequences.

550
00:49:21,363 --> 00:49:26,034
Second-year students are my juniors,
and I have the full authority

551
00:49:26,034 --> 00:49:30,705
to discipline juniors
who can't keep their own gears.

552
00:49:33,249 --> 00:49:38,004
If I can do it, you'll
apologize to my friend.

553
00:49:38,004 --> 00:49:40,840
If you think you can, give it a try.

554
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,717
But if you can't,

555
00:49:42,717 --> 00:49:50,433
neither you nor your friends will have
the chance to even touch the gear's lace.

556
00:50:20,004 --> 00:50:22,674
(Warang)

557
00:50:30,223 --> 00:50:32,684
(Have you talked to Warang or not?
Is she still mad at me?)

558
00:50:32,684 --> 00:50:35,854
(If you want to know that
much, just ask her yourself.)

559
00:50:51,411 --> 00:50:54,289
Could I have your
signature, please?

560
00:50:54,289 --> 00:50:57,917
What can you do for my signature?

561
00:50:57,917 --> 00:51:01,004
Anything you want, I'll do all.

562
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:39,375
I kept the promise.

563
00:51:53,348 --> 00:51:54,599
(Next Episode)
I...

564
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:55,934
love you, Gyo.

565
00:52:00,939 --> 00:52:04,984
Time's up. You've
to answer me now.

566
00:52:04,984 --> 00:52:06,152
Now.

567
00:52:06,152 --> 00:52:07,362
Answer what?

568
00:52:09,697 --> 00:52:11,741
That...

569
00:52:11,741 --> 00:52:14,827
can you love me, head senior?
