"Love Senior The Series"
(Episode 10)

2
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,386
(Previous Episode) How
could you dare to do that?

3
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,358
How dare you bring someone
else to sleep in our room

4
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:52,737
especially on our anniversary day,
How could you do that?

5
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,534
Don't show your face to me again.

6
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:14,843
No matter how this ends,
you have to accept it.

7
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,947
When will you stop loving her?

8
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:44,581
This flowerbed's the most
beautiful in the university.

9
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:50,962
But it used to bloom even more beautifully
when P'Gyo took care of it.

10
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:55,884
The stars on the bridge were the same.
They used to be much more beautiful

11
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,470
when she used to stand
and watch it beside me.

12
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,808
The stars you went to watch,
it was the same every night.

13
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,728
It hasn't become any prettier.

14
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:12,233
Those flowers that you waters every day,

15
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,862
you're doing it for nothing.

16
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:22,327
The person who planted it,
they never came back to take care of it.

17
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,789
What are you hoping for?

18
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:37,926
No matter what, you have
no way to love me, right?

19
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,440
I'm so jealous of that person.

20
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:59,197
If she knew just a bit about
how much you love her,

21
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:08,206
you wouldn't have to look at stars
that aren't as beautiful as before.

22
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,459
Or taking care of the flowerbed alone.

23
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,171
I wish for you

24
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:21,928
to be happy watching the stars,

25
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:27,058
taking care of your flowerbed.

26
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,376
Is no one coming yet?

27
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,422
Um, no one has come yet.

28
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,146
Why are you staring at me?
Do you have something?

29
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,232
Someone wants to talk to you, in private.

30
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:20,570
But I'm not sure if you want to meet them.

31
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:29,120
It's not that person. It's my junior.

32
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,248
Why do you think I want to meet her?

33
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:36,335
Because you need to know the truth from
another perspective you've never known.

34
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:41,966
Because if you know, then you can
decide what to do next. It's your issue.

35
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,177
No one's saying anything about you.

36
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,764
Just giving her a chance
to explain, can you, Gyo?

37
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,102
Alright, I'll meet her.

38
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:15,541
Warang said that
you have something to tell me.

39
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,724
I think that you should know the truth.

40
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,861
That thing has passed for a long time.
Why should I see that?

41
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,781
Because I wasn't the
one who took the picture.

42
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:51,994
I was the one who drop P'Nao
to the room along with P'Tarn.

43
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:55,123
She drugged me.

44
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,418
Between P'Nao and I, it's just staging.

45
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:03,589
I don't really know
what's going on between the three of you.

46
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,592
But I love P'Nao,

47
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,097
and until now, I still do.

48
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:16,769
However, no matter what,
she never changed her mind from you.

49
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,274
I'm hurt,

50
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:26,362
seeing the person I love crying every day,

51
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,574
Going to the same places as before
when she used to go with you,

52
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:33,077
eating the same things
you used to eat together.

53
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:38,708
Taking care of you, looking after you.

54
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:45,339
I hoped that if you two broke up,

55
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,717
It would be me.

56
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,596
But that's not true.

57
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,891
P'Nao never stopped loving you.

58
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,562
I think I've had enough now.

59
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:06,027
This might be the only
thing I can do for her.

60
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,614
Excuse me now.

61
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,524
(I want to talk to you
tomorrow. Can we meet?)

62
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,901
(I'm not free. Can we meet at the party?)

63
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,319
(Okay.)

64
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,832
Are you okay, Gyo?

65
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,544
I'm not carrying you back to the room.

66
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:08,214
And didn't you say you didn't want to
go to the Farewell Party?

67
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:13,844
Honestly, you've been doing this until now
because you wanted to meet someone, right?

68
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,889
Stop complaining.

69
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,435
Don't you have plans with Prang? Go now!

70
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:26,899
She must be finishing her thing by now.
You've plan for dinner, right?

71
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,944
She'll get upset if you were late.

72
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,698
You know better.
Then, I'll go. Bye.

73
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,740
Bye.

74
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,443
I miss you.

75
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,712
I'm about to reach the parking spot.

76
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,256
Thanks for caring.

77
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,301
(Manao)

78
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,761
Yeah.

79
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,561
What's your deal with me, P'Gyo?

80
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,897
Why do you look so happy?

81
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:51,692
When you're the one ruining
other people's lives like that.

82
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,778
What did I do?

83
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,198
Why are you suddenly accusing me?

84
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,825
Give me a reason.

85
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,454
Where's your evidence?

86
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,675
It's about what you did,
setting her up, taking

87
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,919
her photos, and sending
them to blackmail her.

88
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,712
What blackmail?

89
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,591
I haven't sent it to anyone yet.

90
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,426
Except for...

91
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,808
Are you hurt, P'Gyo?

92
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,144
That feeling of being betrayed,

93
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:32,066
being abandoned, it hurts, isn't it?

94
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,867
P'Gyo, do you know
that I hate you?

95
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,662
I hate

96
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,831
that fake smile of yours,

97
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,501
pretending to be good when we meet.

98
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:56,424
I hate that you're the
only one Nao cares about.

99
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,302
I hate

100
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,222
that Nao loves you.

101
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,601
Especially since you've
never done anything for her.

102
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:15,901
And I also hate
how you've made her overlook me.

103
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:22,658
Even though I, well,
I would do anything for Nao.

104
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,412
But what should I say?

105
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:33,085
About you and Nao,
how it's shattered like this.

106
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:39,300
It's because of you, not me.

107
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,136
You've never blamed yourself, right?

108
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,850
It's better to blame yourself.

109
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,811
If that night, you hadn't
abandoned her,

110
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,440
if that night, you chose
to trust her a little,

111
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,235
none of this would have happened, P'Gyo.

112
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:05,826
It's a pity for her to
be sad like this.

113
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,205
Even though it's not her fault,

114
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,958
but it's because of your stupidity.

115
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,883
Tarn.

116
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,526
P'Gyo.

117
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,444
P'Gyo.

118
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,698
P'Gyo.

119
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:48,160
Help! Please help!

120
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,621
Help!

121
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,415
Anyone, please help!

122
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,459
P'Gyo.

123
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,546
Help!

124
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,432
Who's the patient's relative?

125
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,892
I'm the mother.

126
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,936
How's my daughter, doctor?

127
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,022
The patient suffered a severe head injury,

128
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,985
resulting in a comatose state.

129
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,071
Oh, Pure.

130
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,406
Mom.

131
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,743
Gyo.

132
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,498
- It's okay, Mom.
- My daughter.

133
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,001
She's gonna be alright.

134
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,338
What would I do?

135
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,270
You've been sleeping
for too long, you know?

136
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,109
Hurry and wake up.

137
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:47,297
Are you not going back to study?
Don't you have afternoon classes?

138
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:54,179
The mid-term exams are approaching.
Nao, you should return to studying a bit.

139
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:01,645
It's okay to be worried about Gyo. But you
also need to worry about your own future.

140
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,483
I think Gyo wants to tell you this.

141
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,453
Yes, I'm about to go back.

142
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,261
I love you, Gyo.

143
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,144
Hello.

144
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,148
You've been watching over her every day.

145
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:33,320
It's great that you're her
boyfriend. I feel relieved.

146
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,115
Anyway, please take
care of her for me, okay?

147
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,660
I'm more than willing to take care of her.

148
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,251
And the girl who's been watching
over her every day, has she gone back?

149
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,794
Yes.

150
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,797
It's because she has to attend class.

151
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:39,720
I know that you're a sleepyhead,
but you've to wake up early.

152
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:44,224
So I can take you to
eat something delicious.

153
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:13,003
Gyo, we've come to see you.
How are you today?

154
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,675
Gyo.

155
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:24,932
You have to wake up. You've
been asleep like this for months, Gyo.

156
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:32,731
The spicy yum place you like.
Do you still want to eat there together?

157
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,572
Everyone misses you, Gyo.

158
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,369
We miss you, Gyo.

159
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,748
We're waiting to have a meal together.

160
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:57,858
Thank you, Pure. Thank you for the
love and being by her side all this time.

161
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,235
I'm wholeheartedly taking care of her.

162
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,362
He loves her as always.

163
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,119
Do you like it, little one?

164
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,682
Yeah, I'll hurry and follow.

165
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,436
I'm counting on you and Aeoy.

166
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,189
Um.

167
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:36,623
I'll go back first, I have class.

168
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,254
I love you, Gyo.

169
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,260
Hurry and wake up.

170
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,098
Hurry and wake up so that
we can be each other's one and only again.

171
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,954
Gyo.

172
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,624
You wake up.

173
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:23,378
Doctor.

174
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,929
Don't worry, Mom. The patient's
condition is gradually improving.

175
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,931
And I will come for
another checkup tonight.

176
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:38,101
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
Thank you very much.

177
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:43,148
Let me have you sign these documents first.

178
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,155
Hello.

179
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,034
How are you?

180
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:58,997
I'm better now, P'Pure, P'Ploy.

181
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,550
Gyo, you're awake now?

182
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,552
Missed you guys.

183
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,763
Same here.

184
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,890
Anything to say?

185
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,516
Yes, Suay.

186
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,726
Ohhh.

187
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,770
Alright, I'm relieved.

188
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,064
Back to being Gyoza, huh?

189
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,661
How's it going?

190
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,500
You...

191
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,016
Gyo, are you okay?

192
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:47,647
Stay calm, Nao.
Gyo is just recovering.

193
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:54,195
It will take some time for the
memories to return gradually.

194
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,629
We'll wait for the day
your memories return.

195
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,843
And remember again.

196
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,866
Mom.

197
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,787
Whose doll is this?

198
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:48,249
Hmm, not sure. Just found it placed here.

199
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:52,212
And whose flower is this?

200
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:56,591
Flower? That's from P'Pure,
your boyfriend, given to you.

201
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:01,388
Eh, don't you remember your own boyfriend?

202
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:07,602
P'Pure is your boyfriend.
He's been watching over you every day.

203
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,980
Let me go get something and
I'll feed you the oranges.

204
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:59,237
What's that? You only remember
events from first year, huh?

205
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:04,993
It means you can't remember, right? That
P'Ikkyu accepted you in the second year.

206
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:10,623
So you don't know that
we've all graduated, huh?

207
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,419
Have I graduated or not?

208
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:18,756
You haven't graduated
because you haven't passed the final exam.

209
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:22,760
So...

210
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,430
My graduation is delayed?

211
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,435
Yeah, of course you're delayed.
You've been out of school for months.

212
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,230
But you've recovered. We're all relieved.

213
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,359
Well, it's in the past now.
Just let it go.

214
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,279
Why should you dwell on the past?

215
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,575
Another thing, the doctor said
you need more rest, you know?

216
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:49,287
Here's the lecture sheet for final.

217
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,168
If your condition improves this much,
go read a book.

218
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:59,923
Develop your brain cells a bit.
So you can recover quicker, you know.

219
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,007
Stimulate it.

220
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,258
You like to tease her.

221
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,472
Can you hand me that doll?

222
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,934
Are you in love with it?

223
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,145
It's so adorable.

224
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,065
By the way...

225
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:24,280
Who made this doll for me?
Or did I make it myself?

226
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,701
You're talking too much already.
You haven't fully recovered yet.

227
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:35,083
I don't know either, this item of yours.
How would I know who gave it to you?

228
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:39,629
We have to leave soon.
What time are your parents coming?

229
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,131
Shall we call the nurse to be with you?

230
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:45,593
No need, you can leave now.

231
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,721
Alright, get well soon.

232
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,815
We're waiting for you at
the graduation ceremony.

233
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,824
Awwww.

234
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,457
Thank you, guys.

235
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,421
Rest a lot.
You'll recover soon.

236
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,922
When you can leave the hospital

237
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:27,051
I'll take you to eat at Yum
Spicy Poi we used to go to.

238
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,138
- Oh, I want to go.
- That place is really good.

239
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,931
You remember, right?

240
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,474
She remember this one.

241
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,269
You remember food well.

242
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,354
Place it properly.

243
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,689
Go now.

244
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,525
- Yeah.
- Let she rest so she can recover quickly.

245
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,901
- Let's go, let's go."
- Bye.

246
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,403
Bye.

247
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,196
- See you later, I'll come tomorrow.
- Yeah.

248
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,657
- Bye.
- Bye.

249
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,950
I'm worried about her.

250
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,160
- Right?
- Yeah.

251
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,746
- Just a moment.
- Let's her get rest.

252
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,165
I'm just worried about her.

253
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,488
Little one.

254
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:34,035
Have some apple. It's been a while
since you are off the feeding tube.

255
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,412
The doctor said you can eat fruits now.

256
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,291
Yes.

257
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,849
Thank you.

258
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,198
That's carnation.

259
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,703
Who put it here?

260
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:22,417
Um, I don't know either.
I've seen it since I came here.

261
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:28,715
It might be the one you
planted at the university, right?

262
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,678
No, it's not.

263
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,765
Nobody knows that it belongs to me.

264
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,979
Except for P'Pure and P'Ploy.

265
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,815
Good memory.

266
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,235
It's good that you can remember this much.

267
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:13,593
Look who's here.

268
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:17,263
It's Warang, imported from
America just for you, huh?

269
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,933
And Prang, she just wanted to visit you.

270
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,687
I'm sorry for coming to visit you late.

271
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,857
Master degree is quite busy,
It took a while finding time to return.

272
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:34,322
It's okay, girl. Whenever you come,
I'm totally fine with it.

273
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,992
So, what can you remember now?

274
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:42,288
I mean, at that... I just don't understand.

275
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:47,835
Can you remember us, then?
Is most of your memory gone like this?

276
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,129
It's not comprehensive.

277
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:55,384
It's like some parts have entered vaguely,

278
00:34:55,885 --> 00:35:00,515
but the thing I remember accurately is
during the first year of college.

279
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:03,810
But besides that, I
can't recall anything else.

280
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,356
Gyo, before you got into a coma,

281
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,692
do you remember when you met us,
at what time?

282
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:17,281
During the first semester
of the second year.

283
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:25,665
It seems like I was running away, afraid
of being dragged to the senior meeting.

284
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:31,796
Then it seemed like I bumped into someone.

285
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,132
That's all.

286
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:38,636
Yeah, that's all you can remember.

287
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:44,433
The doctor said that your memory
would gradually return, right?

288
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:51,023
The doctor said that the
brain is slowly recovering itself.

289
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:57,071
But whether the memory
returns or not is uncertain.

290
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,825
The doctor couldn't confirm.

291
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:10,167
It's alright, It's alright.
You're better to eat an apple.

292
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,669
Anyone thirsty?

293
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,505
Give some water to Gyo.

294
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,466
Hey, it's good enough
to remember something.

295
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,680
Here.

296
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,353
I'm happy that you're
looking much better now.

297
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,023
Here, have some.

298
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,816
Eat some fruits.

299
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,736
- Are you craving something?
- Have some.

300
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:56,172
You won't even agree to go to a restaurant,
it's been a long time since we were together.

301
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,259
Because we've been
apart for such a long time.

302
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:04,263
That's why I really wanted to invite you
to have a meal here.

303
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:08,517
Like when we used to
be in this room together.

304
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,695
I miss you so much.

305
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:28,996
I miss you too.
Just like the time when we were together.

306
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:35,127
Wait for me, alright?
I'm almost done studying.

307
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:39,840
Then I'll hurry back to stay with you,
for a long, long time.

308
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,345
Who said it wouldn't take long?
Why is it taking so long?

309
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,397
Chocolate.

310
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:59,568
Someone once told me
it makes your heart stronger when eaten.

311
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,005
I love you.

312
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,050
I love you, Prang.

313
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,308
Eat a lot.

314
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,653
P'Pure.

315
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:32,870
I was clearing out some things my mom
kept from the dorm, and I found a box.

316
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:37,541
It's filled with pictures of me.
Was it you, P'Pure, who took them?

317
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:43,506
You don't like having pictures taken.
I don't want to risk making you angry.

318
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:54,183
Oh, but there's this one picture.
Would you like to see it?

319
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:14,078
Hey, P'Pure, where did you take this?

320
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,957
It was the freshy night,
when you were in second year.

321
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,587
Did I go to a concert?

322
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,090
No, you didn't go to the concert.

323
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,676
You just went to watch juniors compete
in a freshy night competition.

324
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,761
Really?

325
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,223
You can't remember at all?

326
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,453
Gyo.

327
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,874
Gyo.

328
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,961
What's wrong? Eat your food.

329
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,548
Give me back.

330
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,136
Eat a lot.

331
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,934
Thank you.

332
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:19,935
Yes.

333
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,727
Still not asleep, kiddo?

334
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,189
I can't sleep.

335
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,484
What's wrong?

336
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,486
Hmm?

337
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:18,702
I feel like something's missing.

338
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:24,833
But I don't know what it is.
I tried to think, but...

339
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:31,090
But I feel like I wasn't
caring enough for it.

340
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:39,181
Take it easy, I think
you'll find it eventually.

341
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:46,021
But if you find it this time,
you must take care of it.

342
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,398
Yes.

343
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:51,068
I want to ask something, alright?
About you and P'Pure, well...

344
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:58,117
I truly don't know how you feel about him.

345
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:02,579
But he's really good to you.

346
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:07,501
I want you to cherish him,

347
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:11,755
It's hard to find a good person in life.

348
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,175
Yes.

349
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,179
Uh, where's your friend gone?

350
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:24,393
When you were still in a coma,
I went to the hospital and

351
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:28,522
I saw her the whole time,
but when she saw my face,

352
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:33,360
she immediately left.
We never talked at all.

353
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,698
I never even had a
chance to ask for her name.

354
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:42,202
A tall girl with cute face.

355
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,038
Is it Warang?

356
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:49,668
No. If it's Warang, I should know, right?

357
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:55,215
It was that girl who helped you.
Otherwise, you would've been in trouble.

358
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:12,524
If that day comes, is there
anything specific you wants as a gift?

359
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,985
Just having you by my side is enough.

360
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:19,031
I'm always here, where else would I go?

361
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:25,496
I'll always be by your side, forever.

362
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:42,614
Gyo, the time is up now.

363
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:44,283
This is the spot, right?

364
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:49,746
Hey, everyone, that's her, right? Gyo!

365
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:54,001
Congratulations!

366
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,044
Congratulations!

367
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,421
Thank you.

368
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,133
Little one.

369
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,470
Congratulations.

370
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,475
From now on, may there only be happiness.

371
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,642
Hug!

372
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:23,989
Come, we'll have the graduates
stand right here.

373
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,325
Let's perform a ritual honor

374
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,827
and rid any negativity from your live.

375
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:32,080
Are you saying "rid negativity"?
Then all our friends will disappear.

376
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,664
Hey.

377
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:35,375
Our sins are heavy.

378
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,460
No way.

379
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,003
Then let's perform it together.

380
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,338
- Come on.
- Okay.

381
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,089
Okay.

382
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,175
Quick!

383
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,222
Boom Engineer, ready!

384
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,223
Ready!

385
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,682
One! Two!

386
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,434
WE ARE, WE ARE

387
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:56,897
E E-Engineer, E E-Engineer, E E-Engineer

388
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,107
Engineer, E E-Engineer

389
00:46:59,107 --> 00:46:59,858
Who are we?

390
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,528
IEE, Engineer, Engineer

391
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,155
Do you like it?

392
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,120
Engineer, Engineer!

393
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,917
Congratulations!

394
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,301
Little one.

395
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,435
Time's up.
I need to give me an answer.

396
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,812
What answer?

397
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:42,693
Just answer the question,
can you love me, my head senior?

398
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,169
Will you be my girlfriend?

399
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,136
I'm sorry, P'Pure.

400
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,472
I'm really sorry.

401
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,563
Gyo!

402
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,946
Does it hurt?

403
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:35,162
It hurts, but I already knew
it had to be this way.

404
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,249
Why keep tormenting yourself?

405
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,375
Because of love, I guess.

406
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,629
You love her so much that you're willing to
do everything.

407
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,757
Just wanting to take care of her is enough.

408
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,927
You know well.

409
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,194
Where have you been?

410
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:55,969
I'm sorry. You must have
mistaken me for someone else.

411
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:14,070
I'm sorry.

412
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,631
No.

413
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,634
No way.

414
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,561
Where have you been?

415
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:55,487
Don't you even miss me a bit?

416
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,659
I do miss you.

417
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,497
I miss you a lot.

418
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:11,545
But I don't want you to
be sad because of me.

419
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:18,760
It's because of me that you're like this.

420
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:22,013
I'm not good enough.

421
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:25,100
I don't want someone good.

422
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:32,816
I want someone who loves me.

423
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,902
Someone who...

424
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,991
Even if memories fade away,

425
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:47,372
they're always in my heart.

426
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:53,295
Why would you let go so easily?

427
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,760
Why would you let me go like this?

428
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:06,016
Don't you love me anymore?

429
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,817
I do.

430
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,030
I've never stopped loving you.

431
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,184
Don't go away again.

432
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:57,150
I won't go anywhere anymore, I promise.

433
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,936
(Beside Story)
It's okay, Nao.

434
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,857
She will recover soon.

435
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:25,697
You always caring for others.
Try taking care of yourself sometimes.

436
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,165
For you to feel refreshed.

437
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,885
Thank you, P'Thida.
