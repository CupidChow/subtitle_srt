"Love Senior The Series"
(Episode 5)

2
00:01:54,377 --> 00:01:58,548
(Previous Episode)
This song holds significance for many people's life.

3
00:01:58,548 --> 00:02:02,176
Hey, Alee, is there something you want to say?

4
00:02:02,176 --> 00:02:03,219
Yes, there is.

5
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:07,890
Then go ahead and say it because

6
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,394
I've already told that person about my feeling.

7
00:02:21,612 --> 00:02:24,907
What are you doing here?
What if you trip and fall, what you gonna do?

8
00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:28,578
If I didn't come in time, what you gonna do?
Do you know how worried I am?

9
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,292
I love you, Nao.

10
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:12,622
Someone might see.

11
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:19,337
I'm sorry, I'm not used to it when you started first.

12
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:45,363
We're trapped.

13
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:48,950
Oh no.

14
00:04:02,463 --> 00:04:06,259
The building opens at half-past seven.
It's only a little past two.

15
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:09,095
We just have to wait for a few more hours.

16
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:12,598
Should we do something to pass the time?

17
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:14,016
You dirty-minded.

18
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,605
Do you know that tonight is
the first night I can get to sleep properly

19
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:22,441
after all those activities

20
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:24,068
and exams stuff.

21
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,698
It should have been the night that I can rest.

22
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:37,456
Don't be upset.
Think of it as our honeymoon night.

23
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:43,129
Anyway, what do people do at honeymoon night?

24
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:44,338
Stop!

25
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:58,185
Damn it, the flowers are wilting.

26
00:04:59,353 --> 00:05:01,897
I even brought it just for you.

27
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:10,156
Tomorrow, I'll get a new one.
Just to thank you for your efforts

28
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:12,992
and congratulate you on winning the Freshy contest.

29
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:17,622
No need.

30
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:20,499
This is enough for me.

31
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:24,128
You're the one who planted these, right?

32
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:26,756
It doesn't look like any other bouquet in the world.

33
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:28,674
Thank you.

34
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:39,644
How did Manao know that I planted it by myself?

35
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:44,857
Don't be mad at me, okay?

36
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:46,817
Just tell me.

37
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:51,572
Then, I will see whether I should be angry or not.

38
00:05:51,572 --> 00:05:55,409
At that time, you said you
would meet me before going on stage.

39
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,375
But you didn't show up. So I came looking here.

40
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:07,088
And I saw you with P'Ploy.

41
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:10,716
Do you know P'Ploy too?

42
00:06:10,716 --> 00:06:12,009
I know her a little.

43
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:16,514
And you don't want to know or ask anything?

44
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,558
Do I have the right to?

45
00:06:21,268 --> 00:06:24,522
If I ever feel jealous, can you handle it?

46
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:40,496
I have feelings for you, I really do.

47
00:06:42,623 --> 00:06:44,625
I love you, Gyo.

48
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,586
The more we're together,
the more confident I am.

49
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:55,678
I wants our relationship to be clear.

50
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:59,724
I want to be sure that

51
00:06:59,724 --> 00:07:02,393
It wasn't one-sided love.

52
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:11,402
I’ll only ask for this one time,
and I won't ask for anything anymore.

53
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:16,157
Can you be my girlfriend?

54
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:23,247
Please, let me be the one to take care of you.

55
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:26,751
I love you.

56
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:31,547
But I can't be your girlfriend now.

57
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:43,142
Being in the position of head senior,
I have to carry a lot of things.

58
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:47,021
Both the dignity and prestige of the department.

59
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,774
I don't want anyone to think

60
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:54,153
that I am biased and
I take care of juniors differently

61
00:07:54,904 --> 00:07:55,738
or

62
00:07:55,863 --> 00:07:59,700
giving you more privileges
just because you're my girlfriend.

63
00:08:01,202 --> 00:08:03,329
Even if it's not true.

64
00:08:04,205 --> 00:08:06,707
You care about what people think more than me?

65
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:08,959
Please, understand me.

66
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:13,672
Even though we're not a couple right now,

67
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:16,175
we can still love each other, right?

68
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:22,598
Please, trust me. Believe in my heart.

69
00:08:25,684 --> 00:08:27,937
When my duty in this role ends,

70
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:31,732
I promise that

71
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,946
I will openly be Manao's lover.

72
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:39,615
Just two more months.

73
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,452
When the running event end?

74
00:08:45,412 --> 00:08:46,956
I will be your girlfriend.

75
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:54,088
You promise?

76
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:56,507
I promise.

77
00:09:42,177 --> 00:09:43,971
Should I change the name to
"Lime (Manao) Grilled Chicken"?

78
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:46,181
No, Gyoza with chicken filling.

79
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:49,143
Right, Gyoza with chicken filling is fine.

80
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:05,784
Hello, P'Gyo.

81
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:06,744
Hi.

82
00:10:09,955 --> 00:10:10,956
Hello.

83
00:10:10,956 --> 00:10:11,790
Hi.

84
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,294
Oh, it's Nao.

85
00:10:16,587 --> 00:10:20,090
Hey Nao, do you come to help us move stuff?

86
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:21,759
Yes.

87
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,136
I heard you're moving to a new dorm today?

88
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:24,762
Yeah.

89
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:25,179
Yeah.

90
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:29,808
You came to help me move while
you're all dressed up in your student uniform.

91
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:32,061
I accidentally fell asleep in this outfit.

92
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:35,522
Then I woke up late.
That's why I hurried out to help.

93
00:10:35,522 --> 00:10:36,565
What are you talking about?

94
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:39,568
Come help then, come on.

95
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:41,570
Take this.

96
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,446
Ugh.

97
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:43,155
-Thanks
-Go.

98
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:43,906
You just...

99
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:45,157
Yeah, come help us, come.

100
00:10:45,157 --> 00:10:45,991
Whoa.

101
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:48,285
Quickly, you need to lift that corner up.

102
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,246
Get in.

103
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:08,222
(I'm helping Aoey tidy up for a bit.
I'll be right there, okay?)

104
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:10,057
(Okay.)

105
00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:25,406
I'm back.

106
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:27,866
Why were you gone for so long?

107
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:30,786
Did you go change your clothes?

108
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:39,545
P'Gyo.

109
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:40,713
Huh?

110
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:47,094
I just took over Aoey's room.

111
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:48,887
Hey, for real?

112
00:11:49,388 --> 00:11:51,223
This is my best chance.

113
00:11:51,223 --> 00:11:53,600
How can I let such an opportunity slip by?

114
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,396
I want to be very close to the person I love.

115
00:11:58,147 --> 00:12:00,566
Uh-huh.

116
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:03,193
I want to be very close to you here.

117
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:06,280
That was too smooth.

118
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:26,091
Here, the signature book.
I've signed for you already.

119
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:34,516
Is it just in the book?

120
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,227
Sign it here too.

121
00:12:38,145 --> 00:12:39,563
Stop!

122
00:12:39,563 --> 00:12:41,231
Ouch, that's hurt.
You hit me too hard.

123
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:42,733
You evil.

124
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:44,902
It hurts? Good, so you'll remember.

125
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:54,286
It doesn't hurt anymore.

126
00:12:56,413 --> 00:13:00,000
But what do people do for when they're in love?

127
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,293
Nao.

128
00:14:03,147 --> 00:14:05,983
Gyo, are you awake?

129
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:07,985
Gyo, are you in here?

130
00:14:16,994 --> 00:14:19,705
Here you go. You're actually home.

131
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:26,211
What happened? Why do you
have to barge into my room like this?

132
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:28,505
I couldn't contact you all night.

133
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:33,927
Oh, my phone battery died.
I just turned it on a while ago.

134
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:37,890
Why are you always like this?
We're worried about you.

135
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:44,479
Sorry, I was really tired last night,
so I hurried back to sleep.

136
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,565
You're just overreacting.

137
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:50,736
Go back, Thida. Don't be here bothers her for nothing.

138
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:56,992
Well, I'll go then.
Don't make us worry next time.

139
00:14:57,242 --> 00:15:01,955
Sorry, and thanks for being worried about me.

140
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:24,269
Should we continue?

141
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:35,739
Why are you late and not properly dressed?

142
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:41,745
Seriously, did you teach your junior?
So careless? Do you still want the badge, huh?

143
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:44,498
First year, stand up.

144
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:51,964
With your permission.

145
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,011
May I say something?

146
00:15:58,303 --> 00:16:02,307
Sure. Any excuses? Spit it out.

147
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,936
I know that

148
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:09,982
our faculty operates under SOTUS
to take care of the juniors.

149
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:12,025
We could almost say that...

150
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:15,862
we use SOTUS
to control and govern our juniors.

151
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:20,617
No matter what the seniors order,
the juniors have to respect

152
00:16:20,617 --> 00:16:23,203
and strictly follow the commands.

153
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:26,039
But today,

154
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:28,333
I

155
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,876
including all of us,

156
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:33,714
both seniors

157
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:36,717
and juniors,

158
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:42,472
think that it's time for a change.

159
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:49,187
I didn't say that SOTUS isn't good,
but a coin has two sides.

160
00:16:49,187 --> 00:16:55,235
If P'Rit is ready to open your heart
and listen, I would continue.

161
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:10,834
SOTUS stands for S - Seniority
Respect those who more senior than you.

162
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:15,839
First coming is senior. Later coming is junior.
Coming together is friends.

163
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,094
Being older doesn't give them more rights than anyone.

164
00:17:22,512 --> 00:17:27,100
Juniors should have freedom of thought and judgment,

165
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:33,815
deciding for themselves what should or shouldn't be done.

166
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:42,199
If we want juniors to respect us,
we must act respectably.

167
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:46,078
Respect and honor should be mutual.

168
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:52,918
It's not just about juniors respecting seniors
It's about everyone.

169
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:56,004
Everyone should respect each other.

170
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:05,347
Next is O - Order
Adhering to discipline.

171
00:18:05,347 --> 00:18:09,935
Seniors instruct juniors to follow rules,
but some seniors can't do it themselves.

172
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:12,187
How can they teach the juniors?

173
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:18,610
Everywhere has rules.
Seniors can only suggest

174
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:23,698
they shouldn't have the right to punish.

175
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:26,827
It's up to the juniors whether to follow or not.

176
00:18:28,662 --> 00:18:34,793
Next is T - Tradition
Following customs and traditions.

177
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:40,382
Taking pride in traditions
passed down through generations.

178
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:42,801
I believe that

179
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:48,682
time changes, society changes.
We should keep what's good, cancel what's not.

180
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:54,146
Or improve what needs development.
Same as SOTUS.

181
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:57,566
In the end, it must change according to today's society.

182
00:18:58,358 --> 00:19:03,822
We can't cling to old things.
Finally,

183
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:06,366
There must be something better to replace it

184
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:10,662
Next, U - Unity.

185
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:15,083
Unity and being of one mind.

186
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:20,505
I believe that each and every one has
thoughts and their own perspectives.

187
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:24,468
While participating in department activities,

188
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:28,346
those who doesn’t join and isn’t responsible
for their job will receive a lesson.

189
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:29,931
That person will learn a lesson

190
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:32,142
without our punishment.

191
00:19:34,394 --> 00:19:38,482
And finally, S - Spirit.

192
00:19:38,482 --> 00:19:44,237
Devoting our energy and courage,
having a heart for society,

193
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:46,406
daring to do what's right.

194
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:51,286
I probably don't need to explain these words

195
00:19:51,286 --> 00:19:56,291
because Spirit is what I am
making everyone see right now.

196
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,918
I dare to speak to P'Rit.

197
00:19:59,252 --> 00:20:03,590
I'm daring to speak what's right,
to say what juniors want seniors to know.

198
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:09,054
And I want you to know too that in the past

199
00:20:09,054 --> 00:20:13,725
they have already shown us that they have Spirit.

200
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:20,065
Lastly, I think that no one should take responsibility
for someone else's mistakes.

201
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:22,817
The person who does wrong must take responsibility
for their own actions.

202
00:20:23,527 --> 00:20:26,530
I once took the blame for someone else.

203
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:31,868
But that's because I was the cause of what happened,
even though in reality

204
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:34,663
I should have let Manao face it.

205
00:20:34,663 --> 00:20:37,666
And accept the consequence of her actions.

206
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:42,671
But I think that no one
should be punished without reason,

207
00:20:42,671 --> 00:20:44,464
and there shouldn't be anyone

208
00:20:44,464 --> 00:20:49,970
empowered to punish as they please
just because they are seniors,

209
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:53,139
or head seniors.

210
00:20:56,434 --> 00:20:57,936
Honestly, I think that...

211
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:02,065
There shouldn't be head seniors like this anymore.

212
00:21:08,697 --> 00:21:11,741
I need to apologize that I,

213
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:13,702
my friends,

214
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:18,623
and my seniors,
maybe didn't train the juniors well enough.

215
00:21:18,623 --> 00:21:22,127
But I want you to watch
over the juniors during activities.

216
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,715
Our juniors might not be the most skilled
or the best,

217
00:21:26,715 --> 00:21:28,967
But they genuinely give their all to us.

218
00:21:29,718 --> 00:21:32,387
If P'Rit is going to cutting them off

219
00:21:32,387 --> 00:21:35,932
or not accept the juniors,
I want you to reconsider it.

220
00:21:43,523 --> 00:21:47,027
Everyone knows that EE1 is cursed.

221
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:49,571
Can't just stay in this group
if you're not strong enough.

222
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:54,075
They all got expelled or maybe dropped out.
There's only you who still remain, Gyo.

223
00:21:54,075 --> 00:21:57,370
But seniors refused to let her join the group,
because you're too stubborn.

224
00:21:57,829 --> 00:22:01,791
Me? I thought P'Rit would cut ties forever.

225
00:22:04,044 --> 00:22:06,129
You're overthinking.

226
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:11,259
I think the cursed group thing is
just a coincidence, you know?

227
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:16,264
Gyo, don't think too much.
Don't pay attention to what Jubjib said.

228
00:22:16,264 --> 00:22:18,516
She talked a lot.

229
00:22:36,951 --> 00:22:41,498
Hey, first-year. What are you waiting for?
Clap for your senior please.

230
00:22:44,918 --> 00:22:48,963
Where else can you find a senior
who has dedicated herself to you like this?

231
00:22:50,423 --> 00:22:55,261
Thank you so much
for making the juniors understand what SOTUS means.

232
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,683
I really appreciate it.

233
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:15,865
But it's good that he forgave you, Gyo.

234
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:19,619
Back then, you went way too far, seriously.

235
00:23:22,914 --> 00:23:26,000
You looked like you had something to say.

236
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,004
Not really, I was just looking around.

237
00:23:30,004 --> 00:23:33,383
If lying doesn't work, there's no need to try.

238
00:23:36,511 --> 00:23:39,097
Oh my, hey, you guys know?

239
00:23:39,097 --> 00:23:41,516
- About what?
- I, uh, teased my junior

240
00:23:41,516 --> 00:23:44,561
to make they understand that Jubjib is their mentor.

241
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:49,941
They were showering her with snacks.
Thought that Jubjib will accept them.

242
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:54,821
But before they realized, she gained three kilos, you know?

243
00:23:54,821 --> 00:23:57,198
Three kilos, look at this!

244
00:23:57,198 --> 00:23:58,366
Just a bit, just a bit.

245
00:23:58,366 --> 00:24:00,702
And she didn't share with anyone, she ate all that alone.

246
00:24:00,702 --> 00:24:02,287
Come on, they gave me the snacks.

247
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:05,957
Are you going to eat more? Oh my, share with me.

248
00:24:05,957 --> 00:24:06,875
Eating vegetables doesn't make you fat, right?

249
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,251
Right.

250
00:24:10,378 --> 00:24:14,090
Hey, can you guys go buy snacks with me?

251
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,134
What? I haven't even eaten yet.

252
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:17,719
The shop is just right here,
go and check it out yourself.

253
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:18,595
It's hot.

254
00:24:18,595 --> 00:24:21,765
Come on, let's go. Don't be so petty.

255
00:24:21,765 --> 00:24:22,474
It's really hot.

256
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:24,058
Let's go. Let's go.

257
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:26,436
My legs are this short, I don't wanna walk.

258
00:24:34,736 --> 00:24:36,446
I have something to clear up with you.

259
00:24:36,446 --> 00:24:37,864
About?

260
00:24:37,864 --> 00:24:41,993
That day, did you see me and her lying on the bed?

261
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:44,370
Yes.

262
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,749
Do you really think that something's
going on between me and her?

263
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,210
You were cuddling up like that.

264
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:55,340
And if I told you that there's
nothing really going on between me and her,

265
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,175
would you believe me?

266
00:24:58,134 --> 00:25:00,637
I was also at fault about the clip.

267
00:25:00,637 --> 00:25:05,475
I wasn't biased toward her, do you believe me?

268
00:25:05,475 --> 00:25:09,020
Do you want me to believe that
there's nothing more between you and her

269
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,065
than just seniors and juniors?

270
00:25:12,065 --> 00:25:17,904
If you ever hear someone speaking ill of me,
will you just stand and listen quietly?

271
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:20,824
No.

272
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:23,868
See, you can't stand it.

273
00:25:23,868 --> 00:25:25,912
But the thing is,

274
00:25:25,912 --> 00:25:29,874
Because you can see that
she doesn't think of me as a senior.

275
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:37,465
And what if I tell you that I actually like her?

276
00:25:37,465 --> 00:25:42,887
If I say that after finishing the running event,
I will agree to date a junior,

277
00:25:43,888 --> 00:25:44,764
what would you say?

278
00:25:44,764 --> 00:25:47,308
It's your business, not about me.

279
00:25:47,308 --> 00:25:50,728
Yes, you're my friend, you know.

280
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:56,776
I don't want you to think that
I mix personal matters with work.

281
00:25:58,111 --> 00:26:00,071
I care about you.

282
00:26:00,071 --> 00:26:02,198
Because you're my close friend.

283
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,203
And you guys are the best friends I have, you know.

284
00:26:07,203 --> 00:26:10,373
I probably couldn't accept it

285
00:26:10,373 --> 00:26:13,084
if you look at me like that.

286
00:26:13,084 --> 00:26:14,586
Shut up.

287
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:18,631
Don't say you see me as your best friend.
I wouldn't be interested.

288
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:27,473
Warang didn't take the bag, did she?

289
00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:27,575
I think I don't want to be friends with you

290
00:27:27,575 --> 00:27:29,285
because you only bring problems

291
00:27:29,285 --> 00:27:30,995
and chaos.

292
00:27:31,621 --> 00:27:35,708
But I've just realized now that
I don't want to be your friend.

293
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:39,462
Because no one wants to be friends
with someone they love.

294
00:27:39,462 --> 00:27:41,714
Gyo, I love you.

295
00:27:41,714 --> 00:27:43,841
I love you even though
you are the reason my notebook got torn.

296
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:46,636
I love you even though you didn't know my name.

297
00:27:46,636 --> 00:27:48,680
But someone like you would never understand.

298
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:51,683
You would never understand anything.

299
00:27:51,683 --> 00:27:53,434
Sorry, Gyo.

300
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:57,480
I'm really sorry that
I couldn't pretend to be your friend anymore.

301
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,947
In the past,
there was no easy thing for you at all.

302
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:11,703
How long have you known?

303
00:28:12,245 --> 00:28:14,914
For long time.

304
00:28:14,914 --> 00:28:18,918
But she just admitted it in this early semester.

305
00:28:18,918 --> 00:28:20,753
Why didn't you tell me then?

306
00:28:21,004 --> 00:28:24,048
Shouldn't she tell you herself about this kind of thing?

307
00:28:25,341 --> 00:28:27,010
Damn you,

308
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:31,139
You know well about everything except this.

309
00:28:32,056 --> 00:28:32,807
Hey.

310
00:28:33,474 --> 00:28:38,396
What should I say?
The way Warang takes care of you

311
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:44,652
and always checks on you,
that's because she doesn't want you to be tired.

312
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:53,244
At first, I didn't think about anything.
Until Manao came in,

313
00:28:53,244 --> 00:28:57,832
She started acting out.
So, I tried to ask her directly.

314
00:28:57,832 --> 00:28:59,834
She told me.

315
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:06,382
Now, what should I do with her?
She wants distance from me

316
00:29:06,382 --> 00:29:10,970
because I once asked for distance
from P'Ploy when I got rejected.

317
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,851
If she asks, just give her space.

318
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:23,232
You can't force a love affair, right?
Well, don't think too much.

319
00:29:26,194 --> 00:29:31,741
Alright, keep some distance.
Things might get better somehow.

320
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:44,545
P'Gyo! P'Gyo! Just a moment, please.

321
00:29:45,922 --> 00:29:48,674
You are not allowed to run
while wearing the student uniform.

322
00:29:48,674 --> 00:29:49,926
I'm sorry.

323
00:29:49,926 --> 00:29:54,388
I'm afraid I couldn't catch you up earlier.
My name is Luktarn, student ID EE1.

324
00:29:54,388 --> 00:29:56,557
I'm reporting to you.

325
00:29:58,601 --> 00:29:59,393
Hey,

326
00:30:00,686 --> 00:30:01,896
Are you okay?

327
00:30:02,271 --> 00:30:03,397
I'm okay.

328
00:30:05,024 --> 00:30:05,942
P'Gyo.

329
00:30:06,776 --> 00:30:07,735
I'm fine.

330
00:30:08,444 --> 00:30:09,612
Report?

331
00:30:10,738 --> 00:30:11,864
Why report?

332
00:30:12,323 --> 00:30:15,743
I've cut you out since the first week
when you couldn't find your senior.

333
00:30:15,743 --> 00:30:18,454
P'Gyo, you're still mad at me.

334
00:30:18,454 --> 00:30:20,248
Because of what happened that day, right?

335
00:30:20,873 --> 00:30:23,167
I'm really sorry.

336
00:30:24,585 --> 00:30:26,129
Because of this..

337
00:30:27,088 --> 00:30:29,423
I couldn't bring myself to report in

338
00:30:29,423 --> 00:30:31,467
I was afraid you wouldn't accept me as your junior.

339
00:30:32,093 --> 00:30:36,305
Then, report in now.
As in the university.

340
00:30:36,305 --> 00:30:37,723
Yes.

341
00:30:38,474 --> 00:30:45,106
I, Miss Kanokwan Nivat,
first-year student in the Faculty of Engineering.

342
00:30:45,106 --> 00:30:49,569
My nickname is Luktarn, a soon-to-be E67.

343
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:51,112
Okay,

344
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:52,572
if you want me to be your senior.

345
00:30:53,865 --> 00:30:57,160
Thank you, P'Gyo, for accepting Tarn as your junior.

346
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,662
And I'll introduce you to our other seniors.

347
00:30:59,662 --> 00:31:00,872
Yes.

348
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:10,715
Hey, Professor canceled the class.
Let's go find something delicious.

349
00:31:10,715 --> 00:31:13,968
Will Luktarn go along?

350
00:31:13,968 --> 00:31:16,596
Well, she has been a bit strange lately.

351
00:31:16,596 --> 00:31:20,016
But we've been attending
another class together in the morning.

352
00:31:20,016 --> 00:31:21,434
Let me call her.

353
00:31:21,434 --> 00:31:24,937
I think there's no need to call.
She's over there.

354
00:31:24,937 --> 00:31:26,689
But it might rain today.

355
00:31:26,689 --> 00:31:28,149
Um, that's true.

356
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:28,983
Right?

357
00:31:28,983 --> 00:31:30,526
But I like when it rains.

358
00:31:30,526 --> 00:31:33,029
Hello, P'Gyo.

359
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:34,488
Hello.

360
00:31:34,488 --> 00:31:36,782
Tarn, wanna get something to eat?

361
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:40,953
Well, I'll clear up some stuff
at the student council first.

362
00:31:40,953 --> 00:31:42,246
Bye.

363
00:31:42,663 --> 00:31:44,540
Bye. Bye.

364
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:48,169
Something to eat? Where should we go?

365
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:49,587
What were you talking about with P'Gyoza?

366
00:31:49,587 --> 00:31:52,798
Just talking like what junior and mentor do.

367
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:53,591
For real?

368
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:54,258
Yeah.

369
00:31:54,258 --> 00:31:56,010
She's your mentor?

370
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:59,263
That's right. Let's hurry, it's getting late.

371
00:31:59,263 --> 00:32:03,017
How did you know? You didn't tell me at all.

372
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:08,481
- Shall we go?
- You guys go ahead, I'll follow.

373
00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:09,607
What's the matter?

374
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,610
Let's go.

375
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,071
- Um, sure.
- Let's find something tasty to eat, Luktarn.

376
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:16,197
Go.

377
00:32:16,197 --> 00:32:17,198
Let's go.

378
00:32:30,544 --> 00:32:32,505
Hello, P'Warang.

379
00:32:32,505 --> 00:32:34,632
Are you surprised that it's me?

380
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:38,135
I just didn't think it would be you.

381
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:40,680
Did you also consider mentorship like others did?

382
00:32:41,514 --> 00:32:44,267
Thought Gyo was all you needed.

383
00:32:44,267 --> 00:32:47,436
Well, I didn't find it in time.

384
00:32:48,062 --> 00:32:49,897
I thought I might have been cut out.

385
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,317
I thought to do that too.

386
00:32:53,317 --> 00:32:57,863
But they wouldn't agree.
They still want a freshman of the major

387
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:00,241
who wins hearts of all the university.

388
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,370
It's nice, being people's favorite.

389
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:06,372
Except you.

390
00:33:07,665 --> 00:33:13,421
Yeah, I made it clear I don't like you.

391
00:33:15,506 --> 00:33:18,259
But I can't do anything about it.
Just have to accept it.

392
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,971
Because seniors from the third and fourth years accepted you.

393
00:33:23,097 --> 00:33:24,807
After the Boom event,

394
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:28,269
there will be a mentor-student dinner.
Give me your number.

395
00:33:29,145 --> 00:33:30,980
I'll add your ID and invite you to the group chat.

396
00:33:48,956 --> 00:33:54,920
If one day Gyo is unhappy because of you,
you won't even have a chance to make it right a second time.

397
00:34:11,979 --> 00:34:15,816
I've already told you, haven't I?
That I like you, Manao.

398
00:34:15,816 --> 00:34:20,029
I've told you the same thing.
That I have someone in my heart already.

399
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,074
I know.

400
00:34:26,577 --> 00:34:29,413
But can I be close to you?

401
00:34:29,413 --> 00:34:32,500
I don't want you to disappear from my life.

402
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,668
I don't want to lose you.

403
00:34:36,712 --> 00:34:39,131
Can you not go?

404
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:52,686
I'm sorry for hurting you.

405
00:34:54,814 --> 00:34:56,524
I'm sorry.

406
00:34:57,566 --> 00:35:01,362
That I can't accept your feelings.

407
00:35:01,362 --> 00:35:03,531
I understand how it feels.

408
00:35:05,324 --> 00:35:10,329
But we can still be good friends,
if that's what you wants.

409
00:35:15,084 --> 00:35:16,585
Friends are fine.

410
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,006
You promise?

411
00:35:21,549 --> 00:35:23,426
Okay, I promise.

412
00:35:23,926 --> 00:35:28,556
Stop crying.
If they see you, they'll be shocked.

413
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,785
Are you going to sleep?

414
00:35:50,828 --> 00:35:54,832
Not yet. I'm still thinking about something.

415
00:35:58,169 --> 00:36:03,674
If you're sleepy, you can sleep first.
I will get my work done first.

416
00:36:04,675 --> 00:36:09,555
It's fine. I want to sleep with you.

417
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,327
Come here, I give you massage.

418
00:36:46,509 --> 00:36:50,429
Uh, Nao, have you found your mentor yet?

419
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:53,057
Actually, I haven't even started searching yet.

420
00:36:54,517 --> 00:36:57,561
But today, P'Warang came to me already.

421
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:02,775
Warang is your mentor?

422
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:07,363
Yes, I also just found out today.

423
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,243
So, what did she say?

424
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:16,205
She just said she's my mentor.

425
00:37:16,997 --> 00:37:20,459
And They're planning for mentor dinner.
That's all.

426
00:37:23,504 --> 00:37:27,716
Anyway,
Today, I saw you talking to Tarn.

427
00:37:27,716 --> 00:37:29,468
What was you talking about?

428
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,095
Well...

429
00:37:32,304 --> 00:37:36,809
We were just chatting.
She seems pretty cute.

430
00:37:38,102 --> 00:37:39,979
You're close to Tarn, right?

431
00:37:49,238 --> 00:37:51,323
Where's the gear?

432
00:37:55,452 --> 00:37:57,454
I returned it to its owner already.

433
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,457
But...

434
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:04,628
Aren't you wondering?

435
00:38:04,628 --> 00:38:08,299
About where my gear is?

436
00:38:21,729 --> 00:38:23,981
I got it, bro. So cool.

437
00:38:23,981 --> 00:38:25,482
That's true, bro.

438
00:38:31,113 --> 00:38:35,618
P'Fuang, you wanna try?
It's new pink salt flavor. It's so delicious.

439
00:38:35,618 --> 00:38:37,578
Oh, Let me try.

440
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,043
Really delicious.

441
00:38:44,043 --> 00:38:44,877
Mmm.

442
00:38:47,171 --> 00:38:48,130
I'll have it too.

443
00:38:50,382 --> 00:38:51,508
P'Fuang.

444
00:38:51,508 --> 00:38:53,677
Can I see your gear?

445
00:38:54,553 --> 00:38:56,430
I want to know if it matches me.

446
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:59,642
Ugh, you smelly.
Focus on studying for real first.

447
00:39:01,143 --> 00:39:02,269
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

448
00:39:03,228 --> 00:39:05,564
By the way, where did your gear go?

449
00:39:05,564 --> 00:39:06,690
Gone?

450
00:39:07,816 --> 00:39:09,568
I left it with someone, you know?

451
00:39:10,736 --> 00:39:12,946
I don't know if it's been misplaced by now.

452
00:39:12,946 --> 00:39:16,241
The gear is with someone,
the heart is with the gear.

453
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:19,828
Who has the gear?
The heart is entrusted to that person.

454
00:39:19,828 --> 00:39:21,121
Who is it entrusted to?

455
00:39:21,622 --> 00:39:22,623
Hey.

456
00:39:23,082 --> 00:39:25,209
If you don't hurry up and eat, I'll finish it all.

457
00:39:27,878 --> 00:39:30,547
- It's mine.
- Go ahead, get this one for me.

458
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:40,933
Why so quiet? I was just teasing you.

459
00:39:45,979 --> 00:39:48,482
Wherever your gear is doesn't matter.

460
00:39:50,192 --> 00:39:51,902
But your heart

461
00:39:52,611 --> 00:39:54,029
must be with me alone.

462
00:39:55,197 --> 00:39:56,031
Right.

463
00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:38,449
Gyo,

464
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:40,409
what are you brooding about?

465
00:40:44,037 --> 00:40:45,122
Wait, Warang.

466
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:51,044
Thida, I want to be alone.

467
00:40:56,717 --> 00:40:58,135
Take it easy, Gyo.

468
00:41:03,891 --> 00:41:07,436
Warang, stop running away from your problems
and let’s talk properly.

469
00:41:10,606 --> 00:41:12,608
Stop and come talk to me.

470
00:41:20,532 --> 00:41:22,534
Do you still see me as a friend?

471
00:41:26,663 --> 00:41:31,502
Stop telling me to be your friend when I don't want to.

472
00:41:34,129 --> 00:41:40,093
What will you do if I tell you
I love you more than just a friend?

473
00:41:41,345 --> 00:41:43,347
How will you force my heart then?

474
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,640
Hmm?

475
00:41:47,017 --> 00:41:49,269
Why won't you answer when I ask?

476
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:50,646
Hey, that's enough, Warang.

477
00:41:52,606 --> 00:41:56,235
If you're not okay with things being the same,
then leave first.

478
00:41:57,903 --> 00:41:58,946
As for Gyo,

479
00:42:00,072 --> 00:42:01,406
I'll handle her myself.

480
00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:35,023
Warang's angry.
It's more complicated than anyone thought.

481
00:42:35,023 --> 00:42:37,359
It's like this group's falling apart.

482
00:42:39,027 --> 00:42:40,070
Oops.

483
00:42:41,071 --> 00:42:41,989
Ouch.

484
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:47,327
Sorry, my bad.

485
00:42:48,787 --> 00:42:51,081
I want us all to be together like before.

486
00:42:51,874 --> 00:42:57,337
I want us to eat, travel, and study together like before.

487
00:42:57,796 --> 00:43:03,677
Just maintaining one friend is this hard.

488
00:43:09,892 --> 00:43:11,476
Just being a friend to me.

489
00:43:13,061 --> 00:43:14,646
It's so difficult.

490
00:43:15,606 --> 00:43:19,443
You have the right to love anyone,
just like others.

491
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,362
It's about respecting each other's rights.

492
00:43:24,281 --> 00:43:27,576
You decide who you love
and then be together.

493
00:43:27,576 --> 00:43:31,580
You might feel sad to lose one friend.

494
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:34,625
But it's not your fault.

495
00:43:35,709 --> 00:43:37,169
And Warang too.

496
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:47,596
Believe me, one day, she'll understand.
She'll come back to being our friend as before.

497
00:43:52,643 --> 00:43:59,274
It's alright.
No matter what, we'll still be here for you.

498
00:43:59,274 --> 00:44:03,612
Yes, even I'm not good at expressing myself
but I love you, Gyo.

499
00:44:08,075 --> 00:44:12,037
There, there, there, don't cry.

500
00:44:12,704 --> 00:44:14,706
Let's hug.

501
00:44:15,832 --> 00:44:18,752
- Good girl.
- Thanks a lot, guys.

502
00:44:19,336 --> 00:44:23,548
Well, it's been a long time
since someone comes whining to get comfort.

503
00:44:23,548 --> 00:44:25,258
There.

504
00:44:25,258 --> 00:44:26,593
You deserve it.

505
00:44:27,427 --> 00:44:29,054
Stop.

506
00:44:29,513 --> 00:44:30,722
You're smiling.

507
00:44:40,148 --> 00:44:43,986
Is this true? The reason why P'Warang doesn't like us?

508
00:45:01,169 --> 00:45:05,674
I brought a note for you. I got an A in this subject.

509
00:45:06,174 --> 00:45:07,509
Thank you.

510
00:45:09,678 --> 00:45:14,307
P'Gyo, I'm late now.
I have to hurry to class.

511
00:45:18,645 --> 00:45:19,980
Bye.

512
00:45:29,614 --> 00:45:30,699
Hey.

513
00:45:30,991 --> 00:45:31,825
Hey.

514
00:45:32,242 --> 00:45:33,326
Hello, Aeoy.

515
00:45:34,661 --> 00:45:38,498
Luktarn skipping class again?
She has been skipping a lot lately.

516
00:45:38,498 --> 00:45:41,835
Um, Is she just late.
Did you try calling?

517
00:45:43,795 --> 00:45:45,839
You don't have to call.
She's already there.

518
00:45:47,257 --> 00:45:48,800
- Luktarn.
- Hello.

519
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,885
Woke up late?

520
00:45:49,885 --> 00:45:51,678
Um, yes, I woke up late.

521
00:45:53,555 --> 00:45:53,930
Go.

522
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:55,640
Okay, take your seat.

523
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,558
Hello, professor.

524
00:45:59,352 --> 00:45:59,936
You.

525
00:46:00,103 --> 00:46:02,773
Luktarn seems strange lately, doesn't she?

526
00:46:02,773 --> 00:46:05,776
Or is Luktarn late because of a new boyfriend?

527
00:46:23,376 --> 00:46:26,296
Class dismissed.
See you next week.

528
00:46:27,089 --> 00:46:30,342
Thank you.

529
00:46:30,342 --> 00:46:33,887
Whoa, finally!
Let's go eat. Pack up quickly.

530
00:46:34,596 --> 00:46:36,473
Why the rush?

531
00:46:38,558 --> 00:46:41,228
I'm leaving first. See you.

532
00:46:41,228 --> 00:46:42,229
Bye.

533
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,188
Bye.

534
00:46:43,188 --> 00:46:44,314
Bye.

535
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:45,816
Bye.

536
00:46:54,116 --> 00:46:57,994
Luktarn seems different lately.
Usually when Nao's around,

537
00:46:57,994 --> 00:46:59,746
she wouldn't leave so soon.

538
00:47:00,872 --> 00:47:03,250
People’s hearts change, Aoey.

539
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,002
Maybe someone's made her heart flutter more.

540
00:47:06,002 --> 00:47:08,588
Better than seeing people she loves with someone else.

541
00:47:08,588 --> 00:47:12,884
Hey, really?
You secretly like someone.

542
00:47:12,884 --> 00:47:14,594
Tell me now!

543
00:47:15,053 --> 00:47:15,846
Tell me.

544
00:47:15,846 --> 00:47:18,515
Don't bother digging into it.
He won't tell anyway.

545
00:47:20,142 --> 00:47:23,103
Not fun at all. Let's go, let's go, and eat together.

546
00:47:23,103 --> 00:47:24,187
- Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
- Go, go!

547
00:47:24,187 --> 00:47:25,564
I'm starving.

548
00:47:28,483 --> 00:47:29,234
Here.

549
00:47:29,234 --> 00:47:30,485
This is the math.

550
00:47:30,485 --> 00:47:31,528
Thank you.

551
00:47:31,528 --> 00:47:32,904
Thank you.

552
00:47:56,428 --> 00:47:57,971
I don't like sweets.

553
00:47:59,264 --> 00:48:04,269
I know, but I just want you to smile just a little.

554
00:48:04,644 --> 00:48:08,064
Whenever I see you, you always look upset.

555
00:48:08,064 --> 00:48:12,527
Getting some sugar for your body
will make you happy.

556
00:48:12,944 --> 00:48:18,408
Instead of caring about how I look,
You should care more about your homework, right?

557
00:48:42,307 --> 00:48:46,186
P'Warang.
Gracia and I need to go to the bathroom.

558
00:48:46,186 --> 00:48:49,856
Oh, sure. It's in the building on the right.

559
00:48:56,238 --> 00:48:58,281
How do I do this?

560
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:04,829
I think this problem is complex,
but if N'Prang can do it,

561
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:07,123
the other problems shouldn't be a problem.

562
00:49:10,418 --> 00:49:18,176
So, if I can solve this problem,
can you stop being upset?

563
00:49:35,193 --> 00:49:36,653
Done.

564
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:48,415
Wrong.

565
00:49:48,415 --> 00:49:49,416
Huh?

566
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:51,126
How is it wrong?

567
00:49:52,252 --> 00:49:53,253
What's wrong?

568
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:54,671
Here.

569
00:49:56,298 --> 00:49:58,174
What are you focusing on?

570
00:49:58,174 --> 00:50:01,720
Focusing on you, I don't know anymore.

571
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,971
Are you complaining?

572
00:50:03,722 --> 00:50:04,681
Nope.

573
00:50:32,459 --> 00:50:33,460
Huh.

574
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,175
Get your dirty ass off my bed right now.

575
00:50:40,884 --> 00:50:42,177
Get up.

576
00:50:44,804 --> 00:50:47,140
Just lie our dirty ass down together.

577
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:50,643
Did you reach the sleeping quota?

578
00:50:51,644 --> 00:50:53,480
Your undereye is a bit darker.

579
00:50:55,065 --> 00:50:56,024
Let go.

580
00:50:57,484 --> 00:51:01,029
Can't we stay like this for a while longer?

581
00:51:01,029 --> 00:51:03,823
It's been a while since you agreed to let me hug you.

582
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:09,537
I haven't agreed. It's clear I've been locked.

583
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:15,001
Let's go to the beach.

584
00:51:15,502 --> 00:51:17,629
Why suddenly ask for the beach?

585
00:51:17,629 --> 00:51:22,967
Because lately, you've been looking stressed,
so I want to give your brain a break.

586
00:51:25,136 --> 00:51:28,056
We'll go in the evening tomorrow,
then return on Sunday, okay?

587
00:51:28,056 --> 00:51:32,268
Tomorrow, we have a gear running rehearsal.
What will you do if P'Pure makes an appointment?

588
00:51:32,268 --> 00:51:34,896
But P'Gyo is the head senior.

589
00:51:34,896 --> 00:51:39,150
Just shifting the rehearsal
shouldn't be too difficult, right?

590
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,071
So, I should check the schedule first.

591
00:51:43,071 --> 00:51:44,322
But...

592
00:51:44,739 --> 00:51:47,742
I haven't given any signals
about whether I can go or not.

593
00:51:50,537 --> 00:51:51,913
I'm busy.

594
00:52:06,344 --> 00:52:09,973
Hey, why are you taking my picture without asking?

595
00:52:19,983 --> 00:52:24,529
Ouch! Don't pinch.

596
00:52:24,529 --> 00:52:27,615
Don't mess with me. Remember that.

597
00:52:31,661 --> 00:52:32,662
P'Gyo.

598
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:35,707
P'Gyo.

599
00:52:38,209 --> 00:52:39,210
Huh?

600
00:52:39,961 --> 00:52:41,045
Can I have a kiss?

601
00:53:26,841 --> 00:53:28,009
(Beside Story)
Did you wait long?

602
00:53:28,718 --> 00:53:29,719
Yes, I did.

603
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,641
Here.

604
00:53:34,641 --> 00:53:37,143
I bought vitamin pills for you, Manao.

605
00:53:37,435 --> 00:53:39,812
After taking them, you'll become an energetic Manao.

606
00:53:40,188 --> 00:53:42,273
Thank you. I was actually hoping for this.

607
00:53:44,776 --> 00:53:45,777
So,

608
00:53:46,027 --> 00:53:47,529
Should we try the outfits together?

609
00:53:47,529 --> 00:53:50,156
Are you ready, Freshy?

610
00:53:52,534 --> 00:53:54,369
Let's go!

611
00:53:56,913 --> 00:53:58,581
(Next Episode)
Why did you bring me to the beach?

612
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,544
Nao, people might see.

613
00:54:02,794 --> 00:54:04,587
Aren't you tired of kissing each other like this?

614
00:54:04,587 --> 00:54:07,632
No, I'm not. I want to kiss you every day.

615
00:54:20,436 --> 00:54:24,274
When P'Pure carried me to the nurse's tent,
did you feel anything?
