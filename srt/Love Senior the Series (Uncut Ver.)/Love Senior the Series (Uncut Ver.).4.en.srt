"Love Senior The Series"
(Episode 4)

2
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:46,452
(Previous Episode)
Why did you let Tarn drink this much?

3
00:01:46,452 --> 00:01:47,829
I stopped her.

4
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:49,747
But Tarn kept drinking.

5
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:55,545
I can help you forget about her.

6
00:01:58,246 --> 00:02:00,383
Stay with me tonight.

7
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:07,890
Do you and Luktarn have something going on?

8
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,102
I've seen you two
avoiding eye contact for a month.

9
00:02:11,102 --> 00:02:12,478
Oh, don't worry.

10
00:02:12,478 --> 00:02:15,022
If there's anything, I
will handle it myself.

11
00:02:19,235 --> 00:02:21,487
I've done what I promised.

12
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:00,461
Naow, Naow!

13
00:04:03,714 --> 00:04:05,383
What's wrong, Naow?

14
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:07,510
You keep missing my passes.
Pull yourself together. Move!

15
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,428
Sorry.

16
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:28,424
Very Good!

17
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,614
(See you in Room 222, there's a reward)

18
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:10,508
You sneakily used the room
for your own purpose again, P'Gyo.

19
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:18,891
Drink first, it will help you feel better.

20
00:06:25,606 --> 00:06:28,067
I'm sorry for being late earlier.

21
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:30,528
Where is my gift?

22
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:33,030
This is it.

23
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:35,741
Even with an injured leg,
you still want to play again.

24
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:37,118
It hurts.

25
00:06:40,996 --> 00:06:42,665
What are you looking for?

26
00:06:42,665 --> 00:06:46,043
The reward I'm going to
give isn't just a material thing.

27
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:49,255
If it's not a material thing,
then what is it?

28
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:54,760
Why are you looking at me like this?

29
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,304
What are you thinking?

30
00:06:57,304 --> 00:07:03,352
You said it's not an object.
It must be an action, right?

31
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:05,521
What are you going to do to me?

32
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:07,815
Dirty mind!

33
00:07:07,815 --> 00:07:08,983
Just a little tease.

34
00:07:11,652 --> 00:07:14,447
I missed you. It's been so long.

35
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:17,324
You still want it or not, a reward?

36
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:18,701
Yes, I do.

37
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:20,536
Then close your eyes.

38
00:07:21,078 --> 00:07:22,079
Quickly.

39
00:07:42,516 --> 00:07:44,810
Open.

40
00:07:57,406 --> 00:07:59,158
Beautiful, right?

41
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,495
A talented person like you deserves stars.

42
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,246
I collected all stars for you.

43
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:08,125
Thank you.

44
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:14,048
Naow?

45
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:19,512
On that day when you said that,
did you really feel that way?

46
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:23,390
I'm starting to doubt if

47
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,311
I still like you or not.

48
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:32,691
I think that...

49
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:37,238
I probably love you, P'Gyo.

50
00:08:59,969 --> 00:09:03,889
Think of it as a down payment.
I'll come up with an answer tomorrow

51
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:06,892
about how you feel to me.

52
00:09:19,113 --> 00:09:24,952
Today is the day when all of you will
officially receive the university's badge.

53
00:09:24,952 --> 00:09:29,832
I must commend all of you for
having behaved in a disciplined manner

54
00:09:29,832 --> 00:09:32,751
and upholding the
university's rules strictly,

55
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:36,213
even if some of you

56
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:38,883
got off track..

57
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:46,307
However, your spirit of accepting
punishment even if you're not at fault

58
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:50,144
reflects the preservation of honor

59
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:53,898
and upholds the major's reputation
for the entire university to see.

60
00:09:55,774 --> 00:10:01,530
But you won't receive the faculty's honor yet
until the traditional running event is completed.

61
00:10:05,576 --> 00:10:09,747
If you can maintain
discipline as you're doing now,

62
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:14,710
the club will then assign the
traditional running event to everyone.

63
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:21,383
This morning, the seniors and the
head senior will inspect your uniforms

64
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:26,013
to ensure that
you won't bring disgrace to the major

65
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:29,475
during the opening event, freshy day and
freshy night

66
00:10:31,435 --> 00:10:33,646
First years, line up!

67
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:34,605
Understood?

68
00:10:34,605 --> 00:10:35,439
Understood.

69
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:06,470
Sorry, are you hurt?

70
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:09,598
Not much.

71
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:11,725
Other things hurt more.

72
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:16,605
Hey.

73
00:11:17,898 --> 00:11:19,483
What's wrong?

74
00:11:19,483 --> 00:11:20,901
I'm okay.

75
00:11:22,152 --> 00:11:24,530
P'Gyo, are you hurt?

76
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:26,740
I'm fine.

77
00:11:27,783 --> 00:11:31,495
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

78
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:35,040
if P'Gyo is fine,
I will excuse myself.

79
00:11:38,377 --> 00:11:40,129
Let's go offer food to monks

80
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:42,464
I'll hold this for you.

81
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:43,924
Ohh

82
00:11:43,924 --> 00:11:45,384
Let's go.

83
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:04,445
What are you all smiling for?

84
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:12,703
Truthfully, today should've been the day
you receive your badge from us.

85
00:12:13,454 --> 00:12:16,749
But I have a necessity
to tell you all that

86
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,251
I couldn't give you the badge.

87
00:12:20,294 --> 00:12:23,922
Because some of you
have violated serious rules.

88
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:27,384
So, all of you

89
00:12:27,384 --> 00:12:30,054
Stand up and bow your heads.

90
00:12:31,513 --> 00:12:33,474
I order you to stand up.

91
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:35,392
And bow your heads.

92
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,938
Bow your heads.

93
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,110
All first-years, hug your necks.

94
00:12:54,953 --> 00:12:56,663
Bow your heads.

95
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:02,169
First-years, be prepared.

96
00:13:04,338 --> 00:13:06,965
Seniors.

97
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:09,927
Are you ready?

98
00:13:09,927 --> 00:13:11,345
Ready!

99
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:19,686
Electrical Trinity!

100
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:23,524
Engineer, Engineer, Boom, Boom, Cheer!

101
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:28,112
E-ENGINEER, E-ENGINEER, Boom, Boom.

102
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:30,781
E-N-G-I-N-E-E-R

103
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:33,367
Engineer, Engineer, Engineer!

104
00:14:25,544 --> 00:14:31,383
I wish you
success in the university you like.

105
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:37,681
Be very happy, study hard,
and stay healthy.

106
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:42,561
Take care of yourself, okay?

107
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:08,712
Time's up.
You need to answer me, now.

108
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:13,258
Let go, others will see.

109
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:14,176
No.

110
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:16,428
Not until you answer me.

111
00:15:16,511 --> 00:15:20,474
What answer? I'm just
doing my duty as a head senior.

112
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:28,630
Answer the question.

113
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:31,527
Head senior,

114
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,530
Can you love me?

115
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:11,650
Okay.

116
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:13,610
Uh, P'Thida.

117
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,195
My friends and I are
already at the event.

118
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:19,283
I will take my friends
to wait near the stage.

119
00:16:19,283 --> 00:16:21,243
Okay, see you.
Bye-bye.

120
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:28,625
You accepted P'Thida's invitation
because you hoped to see P'Warang, right?

121
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,294
Stop!

122
00:16:30,294 --> 00:16:31,962
I can tell.

123
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:35,090
Well, you don't need to tease your friends.

124
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:35,674
Yeah, right.

125
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:39,678
You intended to come to support
P'Manaow in the Freshy contest, right?

126
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:41,722
How did you know?

127
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:46,268
It's the basketball competition day.
I saw you only look at P'Manaow.

128
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:50,314
I just thought
she was really good.

129
00:16:50,314 --> 00:16:54,318
Uh, I can believe that.

130
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:56,320
I believe you.

131
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,906
Let's go find something to eat.
I haven't eaten anything yet. Oh!

132
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:00,699
Smoothie?

133
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:01,533
Yeah, let's go.

134
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:06,496
At today's performance,
we're not worried anymore, right?

135
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:11,460
Alee, if you're ever scared, just...

136
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:15,464
Look at me, okay?

137
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:18,967
You can put on his makeup.

138
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:27,517
Manaow, Don't forget
to check the things

139
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:29,853
that are needed for
the stage competition.

140
00:17:29,853 --> 00:17:30,937
Yes.

141
00:17:30,937 --> 00:17:35,567
Don't miss out. It's good that
the committee allows this.

142
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:43,742
Huh?

143
00:17:43,742 --> 00:17:47,204
Why are you wearing a
student uniform on stage?

144
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:49,706
Um, and the outfit that Warang designed?

145
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:55,837
Take a look.

146
00:17:56,671 --> 00:17:59,216
Hmm, this one's better.
Let's go with this one.

147
00:18:04,846 --> 00:18:06,181
Is it okay?

148
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,476
Slowly.

149
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:14,523
Manaow needs to do it like this, right?

150
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:17,484
And you need to walk steadily,
step by step.

151
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:20,278
Yeah, yeah.

152
00:18:20,278 --> 00:18:23,573
Step by step, slowly, slowly, slowly,
Try it again, one more step.

153
00:18:23,573 --> 00:18:24,950
Just a little bit.

154
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:28,370
Okay, good.

155
00:18:31,998 --> 00:18:36,002
Hey, what's wrong with Manaow?

156
00:18:36,962 --> 00:18:39,047
Are you okay?

157
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:40,507
Just a little bit hurt.

158
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:42,259
Can you manage?

159
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:44,719
Oh, um, I understand.

160
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:47,347
Wait, let get up.
Can you help, please?

161
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:54,604
Okay, is it fine?
Oh!

162
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:58,608
Let me see.

163
00:18:58,608 --> 00:18:59,860
Okay?

164
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:11,329
Hey, the outfit's loose. Oh!

165
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:14,666
Didn't I warn you to be careful?

166
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:17,294
What should we do now?

167
00:19:19,421 --> 00:19:22,841
Lada, fix the problem by letting me
wear the student uniform instead.

168
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,054
To set a good example for dressing appropriately
according to university regulations.

169
00:19:28,305 --> 00:19:29,556
So that people see that

170
00:19:29,556 --> 00:19:32,684
just dressing appropriately
can make you look good.

171
00:19:34,644 --> 00:19:36,855
Sound good.

172
00:19:38,523 --> 00:19:43,403
Well, if we wear the student uniform,
it'll look as good as the Electrical Engineering.

173
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:44,905
Yeah, sure.

174
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:45,697
Looks nice.

175
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:47,240
It's good.

176
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:50,076
Where's Gyoza?

177
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:52,204
Said she'd come help
behind the stage, right?

178
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:53,538
Haven't seen her yet.

179
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:58,502
I want her to come help the dearest junior.

180
00:19:58,502 --> 00:19:59,127
Her?

181
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:01,546
Told her to be careful. Look!

182
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:04,049
Hey, no need to smile like that.

183
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:41,711
Gyo.

184
00:20:41,711 --> 00:20:42,295
Oops.

185
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:51,096
You're still as jumpy as ever.

186
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:57,060
You know it's risky.

187
00:20:58,478 --> 00:21:00,397
Do you think it's worth it, Gyoza?

188
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,107
Yes.

189
00:21:03,024 --> 00:21:04,693
I have thought about it.

190
00:21:15,203 --> 00:21:17,163
I know it's too late.

191
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,668
But I want to stay like this for a while.

192
00:21:26,881 --> 00:21:32,137
I promised that
this would be the last time.

193
00:21:41,938 --> 00:21:44,190
I probably have to let go, right?

194
00:21:58,413 --> 00:22:03,084
So cruel, giving the
flowers we planted together

195
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:04,836
to someone else.

196
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:07,631
Quit bragging.

197
00:22:07,631 --> 00:22:12,594
You just did watered them a few times,
it doesn't count as planting them, right?

198
00:22:12,594 --> 00:22:14,471
That's right.

199
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:17,474
I'm not the star unlike someone else.

200
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,603
There are no stars here, no moons.

201
00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:24,022
Only sand.

202
00:22:28,276 --> 00:22:29,569
Let's go.

203
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:19,411
Hey Gyo.

204
00:23:20,203 --> 00:23:23,248
Have you seen Manaow? She's disappeared.

205
00:23:23,248 --> 00:23:24,624
Is she not with you?

206
00:23:24,624 --> 00:23:25,542
No.

207
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,545
Have you tried to call her.

208
00:23:29,546 --> 00:23:32,132
I did, but she's not answering.

209
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:35,468
And she's supposed to go on stage first.

210
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:37,137
What should we do?

211
00:23:38,596 --> 00:23:43,852
Did she go back to find you behind the
stage? She's not the type to give up easily.

212
00:23:44,811 --> 00:23:47,564
She wouldn't just abandon her
responsibilities and disappear like that.

213
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,780
Here it is. She sent a message.

214
00:23:56,698 --> 00:23:58,074
She's behind the stage.

215
00:23:58,616 --> 00:24:00,118
You will see

216
00:24:00,118 --> 00:24:04,372
after everything is done, I will punish
your lovely junior with the rod. Come see.

217
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:07,584
What are you laughing at? Come with me.

218
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:36,381
It's far.
Can my shorty glasses junior see?

219
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:45,431
And about Ploy, don't worry.
I think you need to give her time.

220
00:25:45,431 --> 00:25:47,433
She'll get better on her own.

221
00:25:54,065 --> 00:25:58,361
Let's go to the stage.
You can't see from here. Let's go.

222
00:25:58,361 --> 00:26:01,197
Wait, no.

223
00:26:01,197 --> 00:26:04,242
Staying here is fine.

224
00:26:04,242 --> 00:26:07,036
Come on, follow me. Are you gonna
keep raising up your head till it hurts?

225
00:26:07,453 --> 00:26:08,371
Go.

226
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:22,886
Help me sing.

227
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:24,637
Let our voices

228
00:26:25,305 --> 00:26:26,556
reach her.

229
00:26:27,015 --> 00:26:29,017
Let her hear the voice within us.

230
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:35,023
She's so cute when she smiles.

231
00:26:37,775 --> 00:26:41,029
She's hot.
Our major's freshy.

232
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:38,354
That's the end of our performance.

233
00:28:38,354 --> 00:28:44,444
Both of us think that this song
carries meaning for many people's lives.

234
00:28:44,444 --> 00:28:48,573
Alee, do you have something to say?

235
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:49,824
Yes, I do.

236
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:58,332
Then go tell them. Because I

237
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:02,754
already told that person
what I wanted to say.

238
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:23,232
I might not be good enough for anyone,
but I only have my heart and promise

239
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:27,278
that I will love and take
care of you the best I can.

240
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:33,159
I hope that it's enough
for you to choose me.

241
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:23,895
Ouch, that hurts!

242
00:31:28,232 --> 00:31:31,027
I won't wipe your tears like Gyoza did.

243
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:34,655
Did you see?

244
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:41,996
I wasn't sneaking.
I just happened to pass by and saw.

245
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,547
Go.

246
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:11,692
Naow.

247
00:32:22,328 --> 00:32:27,250
That person is P'Ploy,
P'Pure's twin sister, right?

248
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,209
Yes.

249
00:32:29,168 --> 00:32:31,337
And she was also Gyo's first love.

250
00:32:33,172 --> 00:32:37,635
But they didn't date. Neither then nor now.

251
00:32:39,845 --> 00:32:43,224
You... like Gyoza, don't you?

252
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:50,147
Why won't you answer?

253
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:54,568
Don't make me force you.

254
00:32:57,863 --> 00:32:58,572
Yes.

255
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:01,576
I like P'Gyo.

256
00:33:04,954 --> 00:33:06,580
Have you told her?

257
00:33:08,499 --> 00:33:10,167
Can I ask you something?

258
00:33:10,918 --> 00:33:12,670
You're asking me like this..

259
00:33:13,587 --> 00:33:15,047
What are you thinking?

260
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:19,302
I just want Gyoza to be happy.

261
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:22,888
If you can make her happy, then I'm okay.

262
00:33:24,974 --> 00:33:26,892
But let me suggest one thing.

263
00:33:27,977 --> 00:33:30,021
Gyoza likes clear things.

264
00:33:30,396 --> 00:33:34,150
If you love her, then make it clear.

265
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:39,613
Um..

266
00:33:40,197 --> 00:33:43,826
It seems like Lada is looking for you.
Oh, and she looks angry.

267
00:33:44,118 --> 00:33:45,536
I just realized.

268
00:33:45,536 --> 00:33:47,830
Why did you just tell me now?

269
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,334
She would kill me.
I have to go.

270
00:33:52,084 --> 00:33:55,379
Tell me what you want to eat in my dream.
I'll offer merit for you.

271
00:34:09,352 --> 00:34:11,729
Why won't you consider
holding onto Gyo a bit longer?

272
00:34:13,356 --> 00:34:15,191
Don't you love Gyo too?

273
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:15,941
Ploy

274
00:34:17,568 --> 00:34:21,238
It's time for us to accept the truth.

275
00:34:21,238 --> 00:34:24,492
The truth that...
both of us have a chance.

276
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:27,870
But we can't hold onto it.

277
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,456
Today is the time to let go.

278
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:36,629
Let her meet the one she love.
If someday she cry and return,

279
00:34:37,421 --> 00:34:40,257
that day will be ours.

280
00:34:41,842 --> 00:34:45,012
But next time, I won't retreat for you.

281
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:03,072
I, Miss Kaniknan Wiwatkul.

282
00:35:03,072 --> 00:35:09,370
A first-year engineering student,
a soon-to-be batch E66.

283
00:35:10,663 --> 00:35:12,581
I'd like to ask for your signature.

284
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:21,924
(P'Pure, Can you sign for me, please.)

285
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:28,389
You want my signature,
what do you have in return?

286
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:30,141
I'll do anything you ask.

287
00:35:30,141 --> 00:35:32,476
If you can follow what I say,

288
00:35:32,476 --> 00:35:35,104
I'll sign.

289
00:35:58,169 --> 00:36:00,546
What's wrong?

290
00:36:00,546 --> 00:36:01,881
P'Rit won't give you a gear?

291
00:36:01,881 --> 00:36:04,008
I almost ran until my legs almost fell off.

292
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:09,889
Sang songs until my throat almost burst.
Finally, P'Rit didn't accept me.

293
00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:19,356
You should be the head senior, next year

294
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:24,278
Then, you'll rule and
set the rules by yourself.

295
00:36:24,278 --> 00:36:28,657
Don't try to influence me.
You two-faced spies!

296
00:36:28,657 --> 00:36:33,162
Acting good but never really helping me.

297
00:36:34,038 --> 00:36:36,207
And ended up living on that side too.

298
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:44,423
Truthfully, the position you hold,
it would be better

299
00:36:44,423 --> 00:36:46,008
if you're the voice for us.

300
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,889
I'm sorry.

301
00:36:52,723 --> 00:36:53,641
Ouch.

302
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:55,392
Do you want a gear?

303
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:07,154
Take it. Here's the gear.
You can have it.

304
00:37:08,072 --> 00:37:10,991
Who wouldn't want something like that?

305
00:37:10,991 --> 00:37:14,078
It has to come with pride, P'Pure.

306
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:22,002
Don't you want to try
being the head senior?

307
00:37:23,837 --> 00:37:25,965
Sometimes you can change the system.

308
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,679
I will consider it.

309
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:33,764
But you have to appease P'Ploy for me.

310
00:37:33,764 --> 00:37:36,976
She seemed genuinely angry at me.

311
00:37:36,976 --> 00:37:38,852
If you accepts the offer,

312
00:37:38,852 --> 00:37:40,271
I'll gladly help.

313
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:41,105
Alright.

314
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:44,316
But if the system fails...

315
00:37:44,441 --> 00:37:45,901
I don't know anymore.

316
00:37:46,986 --> 00:37:49,446
Okay then...

317
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:52,533
Let's start by helping
me at the student union.

318
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:55,536
And then, let's join the
volunteer camp together.

319
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,124
Hey, are you just using me?

320
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:03,460
You little devil,
I need you close

321
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,212
so I can keep an eye on.

322
00:38:05,212 --> 00:38:06,797
You're so mean.

323
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:10,551
Oh, don't cry.

324
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:23,355
Alright, everyone.
After we helped clean the turtle pond...

325
00:38:23,355 --> 00:38:25,774
We're going to separate
into groups to play games.

326
00:38:25,774 --> 00:38:28,068
Make some noise! Team A.

327
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:30,779
Team B.

328
00:38:32,406 --> 00:38:34,992
Our first game is
the three-legged race.

329
00:38:34,992 --> 00:38:36,118
Is everyone ready?

330
00:38:36,118 --> 00:38:38,078
We're ready.

331
00:38:38,078 --> 00:38:39,163
Get set.

332
00:38:39,955 --> 00:38:40,873
Go.

333
00:38:56,263 --> 00:38:57,348
Awesome.

334
00:38:57,931 --> 00:38:59,058
Untangle the rope first.

335
00:39:10,194 --> 00:39:11,779
Of course.

336
00:39:12,488 --> 00:39:14,406
Take a breath.

337
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:17,826
You're cheating.

338
00:39:18,535 --> 00:39:22,498
What cheating? It's called game tactics.
It's not cheating at all.

339
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,751
Did you think of Gyo more than junior?

340
00:39:29,463 --> 00:39:32,966
I think I might be starting
to like the little her.

341
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:36,637
Really?

342
00:39:37,596 --> 00:39:39,098
You like the bratty kid, huh?

343
00:39:39,515 --> 00:39:40,307
Yes.

344
00:39:42,935 --> 00:39:44,228
Do you want me to help?

345
00:39:45,062 --> 00:39:50,150
No, I just want to be sure that
you don't have any feelings for Gyoza.

346
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:54,113
But if you do, I'll stop.

347
00:39:54,113 --> 00:39:55,489
Hey.

348
00:39:55,489 --> 00:39:57,533
Who would ever feel that way.

349
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:19,096
So let's start with our first pair,

350
00:40:19,096 --> 00:40:21,682
Pure and Gyoza.
Let's give a round of applause.

351
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,613
I love you, P'Pure.

352
00:40:45,247 --> 00:40:46,832
Failed.

353
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:48,959
Whoa!

354
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:52,171
You're a cheater!
You tricked me.

355
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,507
I don't want to drink the special water.

356
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:59,470
You're not that skilled.
No matter what you say, I won't believe it.

357
00:41:00,471 --> 00:41:03,640
Show your skills.

358
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,268
Yeah, show us.

359
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:24,161
I love you, Gyo.

360
00:41:34,546 --> 00:41:37,633
This is what we call skill.
Do you understand, little one?

361
00:41:37,633 --> 00:41:41,845
Huh! If you're this good,
you might as well be an actor.

362
00:41:41,845 --> 00:41:43,931
Why waste time studying engineering?

363
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:48,811
No need to say useless things.
Get ready to drink the special formula.

364
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:57,754
That's the end. For the performance
from the representatives of

365
00:42:57,754 --> 00:43:00,048
the Electrical Engineering.
Everyone, did you like it?

366
00:43:00,048 --> 00:43:02,134
Yeaaaaaah!

367
00:43:14,688 --> 00:43:18,609
Alright, let me invite N'Alee and
N'Manaow to the center of the stage.

368
00:43:23,947 --> 00:43:26,783
First of all, a question from

369
00:43:26,783 --> 00:43:28,911
the Electrical Engineering department.

370
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:31,455
I want to know,
who will answer this question well?

371
00:43:33,957 --> 00:43:36,335
It's Manaow, representing to answer.

372
00:43:36,335 --> 00:43:36,960
Yes.

373
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,170
N'Manaow.

374
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:43,133
Which sentence is the most striking and
your favorite sentence from the head senior?

375
00:43:51,016 --> 00:43:57,064
First coming is senior, Later coming
is junior and coming together is friend.

376
00:43:58,607 --> 00:44:02,653
And when do I have to come
so that we can be a couple?

377
00:44:21,088 --> 00:44:25,592
Hey, let's go find something to eat.
I'm getting hungry again.

378
00:44:27,552 --> 00:44:30,931
P'Thida, want to find something to eat?

379
00:44:30,931 --> 00:44:32,140
Sounds good.

380
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,266
Let's go.

381
00:44:33,266 --> 00:44:34,893
Hurry.

382
00:44:41,775 --> 00:44:45,862
The winners of the Popular Vote,
smile and look at the photographer a bit.

383
00:44:46,446 --> 00:44:47,614
Smile.

384
00:44:48,115 --> 00:44:49,324
Smile.

385
00:44:49,324 --> 00:44:50,701
Smile a bit more.

386
00:44:51,243 --> 00:44:53,453
Keep that smile.

387
00:44:54,496 --> 00:44:57,499
My gums are dry.

388
00:44:57,499 --> 00:44:59,292
Let me help take it out.

389
00:45:00,293 --> 00:45:02,045
Your gums are all dried up.

390
00:45:02,045 --> 00:45:04,965
I'm being sarcastic. Smile.

391
00:45:04,965 --> 00:45:09,261
The junior boy, Please
scooch in a bit fresh with the girl.

392
00:45:09,261 --> 00:45:10,429
Scooch in.

393
00:45:10,429 --> 00:45:12,597
Oh,
Scooch in. Alright.

394
00:45:12,597 --> 00:45:14,808
Let the photographer take another picture.

395
00:45:30,449 --> 00:45:33,368
Are you heading back?

396
00:45:34,995 --> 00:45:37,956
It's better to head back, it's late.

397
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:39,916
Warang.

398
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:41,960
Hmm, what's up?

399
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,587
Can I ask you a favor?

400
00:45:43,587 --> 00:45:45,756
Can you tutor?

401
00:45:47,215 --> 00:45:50,218
Well, I'm going to ask you
if you can tutor these three girls a bit.

402
00:45:50,218 --> 00:45:52,763
I'm really busy these
days, no free time at all.

403
00:45:52,763 --> 00:45:54,306
Let me think about it first.

404
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,312
I'll head back now, Thida.

405
00:46:04,357 --> 00:46:08,779
Well then,
I'll ask some other friends for you later.

406
00:46:08,779 --> 00:46:10,322
Just in case.

407
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:11,865
Sure.

408
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,500
(Sorry...)

409
00:47:04,376 --> 00:47:08,004
Why aren't you as good as
when you were in front of senior, huh?

410
00:47:08,004 --> 00:47:10,507
Just asking for one word, "sorry."

411
00:47:10,507 --> 00:47:12,342
You still can't say it.

412
00:47:24,312 --> 00:47:28,900
I'm sorry for making you upset.

413
00:47:41,037 --> 00:47:44,499
Alright, no need to cry anymore.

414
00:47:50,505 --> 00:47:54,384
I'm sorry, Warang. I'm really sorry.

415
00:47:55,844 --> 00:48:00,056
Hey, stop crying now.

416
00:48:12,903 --> 00:48:15,155
Stop crying now.

417
00:48:27,584 --> 00:48:29,794
List of all friends.

418
00:48:34,132 --> 00:48:36,676
Signatures of all the seniors.

419
00:48:39,095 --> 00:48:41,473
I got a new one for you.

420
00:48:43,225 --> 00:48:46,353
Let's use my notebook first.

421
00:48:51,399 --> 00:48:54,903
Sorry for making you upset.

422
00:48:58,615 --> 00:49:02,953
Oh, stop crying now.

423
00:49:09,668 --> 00:49:10,543
Hey.

424
00:49:11,836 --> 00:49:15,924
If you stop crying, I'll
forgive you completely.

425
00:49:15,924 --> 00:49:17,342
Really?

426
00:49:17,342 --> 00:49:18,551
Yeah.

427
00:49:27,143 --> 00:49:29,271
Hey.

428
00:49:29,271 --> 00:49:31,815
Sorry, Warang.

429
00:49:32,899 --> 00:49:34,609
You're really stubborn.

430
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:36,403
I didn't cry.

431
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:10,895
What are you doing here.
What happen if you fall here?

432
00:50:10,895 --> 00:50:14,566
What will you do if I didn't here?
Do you know how much I worry about you?

433
00:50:19,779 --> 00:50:21,031
I love you.

434
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:24,868
I do love you.

435
00:51:09,162 --> 00:51:09,871
(Beside Story)
Gyo.

436
00:51:12,332 --> 00:51:13,833
Do you want to taste it?

437
00:51:14,793 --> 00:51:15,877
Is it a new flavor?

438
00:51:15,877 --> 00:51:16,753
Yeah.

439
00:51:17,796 --> 00:51:18,755
Feed me.

440
00:51:18,755 --> 00:51:20,090
Sure, go ahead.

441
00:51:27,222 --> 00:51:30,308
Oops, be careful not to spill.

442
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:34,813
Yummy.

443
00:51:35,897 --> 00:51:37,607
I like it.
Wait, I'll buy some more for you.

444
00:51:37,607 --> 00:51:39,067
Great, buy plenty.

445
00:51:39,067 --> 00:51:41,778
You can get the small packets,
easy to open. I'll buy them

446
00:51:41,778 --> 00:51:43,405
for you.

447
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:54,082
(Next Episode)
I've told you before that I like you.

448
00:51:54,082 --> 00:51:58,336
I've also told you the same,
that I already have someone in my heart.

449
00:51:58,336 --> 00:52:01,047
Where P'Gyo's gear ends up doesn’t matter,

450
00:52:02,465 --> 00:52:04,217
but P'Gyo's heart

451
00:52:04,926 --> 00:52:06,928
has to be with me alone.

452
00:52:09,139 --> 00:52:11,433
If someday Gyo feels sad because of you,

453
00:52:11,433 --> 00:52:14,894
you won't even have a chance
to make amends for the second time.
