"Love Senior The Series"
(Episode 8)

2
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:48,525
(Previous Episode) Can't you tell?
How did she approach you?

3
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,570
I think you're just overthinking.
She's just friendly.

4
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,826
You don't see the way she looks at you.
Don't you see the way she smirk at me?

5
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,495
I don't think we can talk.

6
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:08,294
I want to trust Nao,
But it's genuinely hard, you know.

7
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,588
Come here.

8
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,092
There. There.

9
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,362
It's probably unnecessary now.

10
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,032
Gracia.

11
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,291
Hello, Garcia. I'm sorry to bother you, but

12
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,211
uh..

13
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,131
Prang is with you?

14
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,759
Okay, thanks a lot.

15
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:19,384
Is this how our story ends, right?

16
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,551
Nao.

17
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,520
P'Warang, hello.

18
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:37,235
We met a single lost kid, ma'am.
So, I brought her here.

19
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,532
Go, Hurry up.

20
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,117
Stop acting up.

21
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:48,413
Well, well, look at her. She seems
doesn't like to be a well-behaved student,

22
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,207
Maybe she wants a role
in a soap opera, don't you?

23
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,670
Life in Imagination.

24
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:04,012
P'Warang, please take care of her.
She cried all night last night.

25
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:11,144
Thank you so much for bringing her
back safely. You guys get home safely.

26
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,228
Sure.

27
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,856
Just let Prang stay with
you, we won't worry anymore.

28
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,358
As for this one, I'll take care of her.

29
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:21,529
The Diva like me will
sing her a lullaby to sleep.

30
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,449
Alright then, we'll take
our leave now, P'Warang.

31
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,993
Goodbye.
See you.

32
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,286
Goodbye.

33
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,921
Why are you angry?

34
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,256
Oh.

35
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,428
Why are you crying? Huh?

36
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,346
I'm not crying at all.

37
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,391
You are right now. Don't talk back.

38
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:58,066
Do you like P'Gyo?
If you don't have feelings for me,

39
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,985
I wouldn't come bothering you again.

40
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,739
P'Gyo, she's Nao's girlfriend.

41
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:11,704
You also know Nao, right?
Why did you come to argue now? Huh?

42
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:17,418
Yesterday,
I saw you hugging P'Gyo in the study room.

43
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,674
And then you shared your
imagination with your friends, right?

44
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,011
Aww.

45
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:32,433
Yesterday, P'Gyo was feeling down,
so she burst into tears.

46
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,769
And I comforted my friend.

47
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,025
Like this.

48
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,695
Friends should comfort
each other, shouldn't they?

49
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:53,079
It's not that they can't, but
I didn't know about that.

50
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:59,836
If you didn't know, why didn't you ask
first instead of making assumptions?

51
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,504
That's not cute.

52
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,883
Why would you hug me? If I'm not cute.

53
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,060
I'm hugging to comfort someone I like.

54
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,646
What to say..

55
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,233
I like it so much,

56
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,027
having you by my side.

57
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:30,783
I like it a lot, having you there
when I return to the room every day,

58
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:37,248
going out to eat, going out for fun,
going shopping.

59
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:42,128
And I feel really good
having someone who cares about me.

60
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,964
Taking care of me.

61
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,468
I want to return the favor to you.

62
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,599
Prang,

63
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,642
Can you,

64
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,312
be my girlfriend?

65
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,523
Yes.

66
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:07,987
I agree to let you care about me a bit.

67
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,283
So,

68
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,328
We can call each other
"girlfriend" now, right?

69
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:28,507
We're a couple now.
So, should you give me your signature now?

70
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,636
Come here.

71
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,429
Thank you.

72
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,275
I miss you so much, Gyo.

73
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:17,588
I've prepared food in the fridge.
Eat on time, okay?

74
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:24,053
If you care this much,
why don't you take me to eat?

75
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,751
In three days, it'll be our anniversary.

76
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,422
I even hurry up with the project.

77
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,470
In the end, we probably won't be together.

78
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,917
Please, make it back in time.

79
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,597
Today's the day.

80
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,240
(Jaojom)

81
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:16,540
Hello, Nao, didn't you actually come? You'd
rather waste a good time before the exam, huh?

82
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,793
I won't go, no need to ask.

83
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,713
Today, I already have plans. Understand?

84
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:26,550
Right, I'm just the old friend.
You don't love me like before, huh?

85
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,969
When did I ever say I love you?

86
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,638
I'm hanging up.

87
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:57,873
You're back together, huh? Look at
you smiling like crazy to your phone.

88
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,958
Back to your work.

89
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:04,380
Not yet, until she's willing to say sorry.

90
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,715
I won't accept a half-hearted apology.

91
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:11,303
But you seem so happy now.
I'm not mad at that kid anymore.

92
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:15,224
Sorry is what matters the most.
And she's always caring about you.

93
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,644
She cleaned the room, prepared
drinks and snacks for you.

94
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,896
This should be compensation enough, right?

95
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:24,817
Words are not as important as actions.

96
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,987
You say it like you have experience.

97
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:33,033
Is this the real Warang?
Or some spirit is possessed you?

98
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:38,622
Well, if you're not mad at each other anymore,
that's good. I'm tired of feeling guilty.

99
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:42,209
Because I caused both of
you to be angry at each other.

100
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,253
Let's finish this chapter today.

101
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:49,675
I'm tired of being involved with you two.
So sick of you.

102
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,761
You're not the only who thinks that way.

103
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:58,183
The mission today is to
finish work by 11 pm, alright?

104
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,103
Why 11 pm?

105
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,690
Otherwise, I won't make it
in time for the anniversary.

106
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,319
What are you waiting for?
Let's start now, quickly.

107
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,237
Hurry up!

108
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,740
Let's work fast to go back early.

109
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,492
Check this out.

110
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,411
You're going to copy.

111
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,705
No, Just look.

112
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:29,102
Please forgive me. We're being angry
at each other for too long, you know?

113
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,775
Hello.

114
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,318
Hello.

115
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,319
Hi, P'Alee.

116
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,528
Uh, hello.

117
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,033
Uh, hello, P'Gyo.

118
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,619
What's up, Alee? How are you?

119
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,120
Uh...

120
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,916
Well...

121
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,293
I'm fine.

122
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,426
What's up?

123
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,513
About Lada, right?

124
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,098
Does P'Gyo have psychic power?

125
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,311
How do you know
that I came to ask about P'Lada.

126
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,897
Or Nao...

127
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:18,360
No need for psychic powers or anyone
to tell me. I can figure it out myself.

128
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,822
Do you like Lada?

129
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,450
Yes.

130
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,915
Anyone near Lada falls
head over heels for her.

131
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:38,505
But I'm holding back a bit.
She just broke up with her boyfriend.

132
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,008
She might not be ready yet.

133
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,259
I understand.

134
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:43,635
But...

135
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,929
I want to take a risk.

136
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,059
I understand, Alee.

137
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:57,107
But if taking this risk
disappoints or upsets you,

138
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,067
Do not close yourself off.

139
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,195
Understood.

140
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:05,574
In the end, I may be disappointed,

141
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:09,411
but it's probably better than holding
onto these feelings alone

142
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,747
without telling P'Lada, right?

143
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,500
I've made up my mind, P'Gyo.

144
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,214
Uh, P'Lada's birthday is coming soon.

145
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,176
I still don't know
what to give P'Lada.

146
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,138
P'Gyo, can you tell me,
what does P'Lada like?

147
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:34,686
Lada likes makeup, dressing up,
likes beautiful things.

148
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,397
Just like most girls.

149
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:41,693
I think whatever you choose with sincerity,

150
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,779
Lada will like it anyway.

151
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,280
Thank you, P'Gyo.

152
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,784
Thank you.
I'll go ahead then.

153
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:08,261
(Please be back in time #Special #Beloved)

154
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:37,249
Hey, take longer steps.
You're meeting someone, aren't you?

155
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,000
Don't be late.

156
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:47,217
I'm hurrying right now.
My legs aren't as long as yours.

157
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:52,139
Yeah. Are you sure you don't want a ride?

158
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:57,853
I can ride my own red piggy back,
no need to bother.

159
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:03,108
Alright then, ride home safely.
You still have 50 minutes.

160
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,736
No need to rush. Don't get hurt.

161
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:11,116
Okay, you go home safely. I'm off.

162
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,245
Don't forget to bring the project
for binding tomorrow, don't forget.

163
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,248
Sure, I know. Hurry back.

164
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,375
There are only 48 minutes left now.

165
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,961
- Yep.
- Walk carefully, walk carefully.

166
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,790
Is she still mad?

167
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,844
Or hasn't she seen my
post or message on IG?

168
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,018
Or hasn't she finished her work?

169
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,409
Stop. Don't overthink, Nao.

170
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,218
Gyo must come for sure.

171
00:25:55,887 --> 00:26:00,725
Gyo won't forget this important day
unless...

172
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,357
It isn't important to her anymore.

173
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,818
I like this atmosphere.

174
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,113
The sound of waves I hear,

175
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,199
the light breeze on my face.

176
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:21,413
I feel strangely at ease.

177
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:25,709
I didn't know the head senior
was so sensitive about things like this.

178
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:29,587
The position hasn't changed me internally.

179
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,347
I'm afraid that one day
I'll wake up not recognizing who I am...

180
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,391
I will be very sad.

181
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:47,647
So today, you must be you to the fullest.

182
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:51,151
So as not to forget who
you really are inside.

183
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:03,455
Almost the end of the day, it's a shame.

184
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,602
Ah, drink to relief your fatigue.

185
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,463
I'm waiting for you, Gyo.

186
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,464
(Gyoza)

187
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,557
(Warang)

188
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:56,025
This is the voicemail service.
Please leave a message after the tone.

189
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,289
(I want to smile for you every
day #GoodMood #Happy)

190
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:24,471
- You're in a relationship?
- Have you secretly been dating for long? Hey!

191
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:29,267
No matter how tough you pretend to be,
You still fall for someone next to you.

192
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:33,897
If you make my baby cry again,
I'll cut your hand off.

193
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:46,284
P'Thida, what about my baby?

194
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:50,622
Stop crying like this
again. It breaks my heart.

195
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,416
Okay, I won't cry again.

196
00:29:53,416 --> 00:30:00,381
It's not just you who is hurt, Lada.
Thida also hurt to see her baby crying like this.

197
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,989
Happy anniversary, P'Gyo.

198
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:58,601
The car's pretty damaged.
She gonna be okay, right?

199
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:06,192
She should be fine.
Warang needs to be safe.

200
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,423
Cheers!

201
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,093
Awesome.

202
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,305
Eat more! Eat more!

203
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,724
Who's treating today?

204
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,434
Not me.

205
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,436
- Hello.
- Hello there.

206
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,063
Hello, hello!

207
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:49,277
Nao, after finishing the final exams,
you have to hurry back to sing, okay?

208
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:53,865
Because at this time, your Fans are urging.

209
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,704
Okay.

210
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,790
Alright,
I'll check on other tables then.

211
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,251
- Bye.
- See you later, kids.

212
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,383
Where to next?

213
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,010
Nowhere, I'll stay right here.

214
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,261
Oh!

215
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,096
What's up? It's bitter?

216
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:21,350
Sorry about that. Want to dance together?

217
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,852
Let's go?

218
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,187
Let's go!

219
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,147
Up, up!

220
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,391
I think you should stop drinking?

221
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:06,521
You're a little late compared to others,
but you're already drunk.

222
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:12,693
Belle, go have fun with
your friends. I'm fine.

223
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,283
P'Nao.

224
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,708
Belle.

225
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,628
Let's dance together.

226
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,881
- Quickly, come on!
- Come!

227
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,675
Come, Belle!

228
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,844
Come quickly!

229
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,906
Kawee! Stand up!

230
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,119
You're drunk this much?

231
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:08,708
Come here Moota, Pepsi. Come here.

232
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:17,633
You guys, you guys, you guys, you guys are all
done, it's time to close the shop, let's go home.

233
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:22,054
Wow, you guys look worse than dogs.

234
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:27,351
Oh, why does Nao look like this?

235
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,062
Huh? Why did you let Nao be like this?

236
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,190
She's never been this drunk before.

237
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,402
Take care of her, take care of her.
Take care of her.

238
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,486
Yes, yes, ma'am.

239
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:41,199
Go, go, go home, go home, go home, go home.

240
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:47,663
N'Belle, are you going back?
Please take this smelly dog with you.

241
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:50,249
I have to drop off my friends first.
Okay.

242
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:54,337
Okay, I'll wait to go back with my friends.

243
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,756
We might have to wait
a bit longer to sober up.

244
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,884
Alright, then, please take care of her.

245
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,634
If you're that close, you
won't be able to pull out in time.

246
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,222
P'Tarn.

247
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:51,310
Secretly loving someone who already has a
partner, aren't you afraid of getting hurt?

248
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,023
What do you mean?

249
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,527
Do you like Nao?

250
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:08,911
No need to make that face.
I'm just asking, okay?

251
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:13,249
Yes, I like P'Nao.

252
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:17,086
But I have never considered
being the third party.

253
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:22,883
Hey, I understand.

254
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:29,098
Nao has a charm.
Anyone close to her likes her.

255
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:36,063
Earlier, Jaojom just called and asked
us to help take Nao back to the dorm.

256
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:41,152
It's nearby.
Can you help me a bit, please?

257
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,947
But P'Jom just said to wait here.

258
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,700
I just received the call as well.

259
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:53,456
He said it'll be a while longer.
Let's take Nao back to her room first.

260
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,291
Alright.

261
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,500
Let's go.

262
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,919
How can we get her up?

263
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,047
This is tough.

264
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,632
I'll help, come on, Belle.

265
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,972
Walk slowly, slowly.

266
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,308
Be careful.

267
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,727
Slowly.

268
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,774
Sit down.

269
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,531
So heavy.

270
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,373
You look so thin.
I never thought you'd be this heavy.

271
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,756
She looks messed up.

272
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,091
Yeah.

273
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:50,137
Here's some water. Have some, so
you won't be tired when you return.

274
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,098
Thank you.

275
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,393
I'll go get a towel for Nao.

276
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,300
(Someone who makes me happy!)

277
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,271
Belle, I'll wipe her myself.

278
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,738
Take care of her for a second.

279
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,491
Don't take your eyes off her.

280
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,784
Yes.

281
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,887
Gyo.

282
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,190
Gyo.

283
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,200
(ICU)

284
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,224
Go sit and wait.

285
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,522
The doctor is out, everyone.

286
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,609
The patient is safe now. Soon, the doctor
will send her to the recovery room.

287
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,237
Thank you so much, doctor,
for helping our friend. Thank you.

288
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,905
Thank you.

289
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:02,496
You guys head back first. I'll stay here.

290
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,916
Are you okay? We've been up all night.

291
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,585
I'm okay.

292
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,212
We can change shifts in the late morning.

293
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:13,799
My parents will probably
arrive around noon.

294
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:15,843
But...

295
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:19,346
Gyo, why don't you head back first?

296
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:22,558
Nao is waiting for you, don't forget.

297
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,894
Head back now.

298
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,188
Go ahead. It's fine.

299
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:29,773
Then, I'll head back.

300
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,650
Alright, back home safely.

301
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,989
You can head back now.

302
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,701
N'Prang, are you going
back with me? I'll drive you.

303
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,831
It's okay. I want to wait for P'Warang.

304
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,625
Okay.

305
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,587
I'll hurry back to change shift.

306
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,006
See you.

307
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:54,631
Let's go.

308
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:55,215
Thank you very much.

309
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,634
Head back and rest.

310
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,226
The doctor said she's
safe now. Don't worry.

311
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,323
I'm sorry for what I said
that day, please forgive me.

312
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:05,369
Let's go out together next time. You
have to take many pictures with me, okay?

313
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,756
I miss you, Gyo.

314
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:46,785
Learn to smile. When you grow older,
you'll be a smiling Gyo.

315
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:03,427
(Thank you for staying by my side)

316
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:12,579
Would you overlook my unpleasantness
in the past? I'm trying to improve myself.

317
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:18,085
It might take some time,
but I promise to try my best.

318
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,755
Don't judge just by a rude word said then,

319
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,466
but judge from all actions taken.

320
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,637
Because even though I may not
have been pleasant that day,

321
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:32,015
There's never been a day
when I didn't love you, Gyo.

322
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:36,687
I'm sorry for the unkind
words and behavior.

323
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,605
Forgive me.

324
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:02,838
Warang is my friend, you should understand.

325
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:16,018
Warang, see you at the dorm tomorrow.

326
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,061
Okay.

327
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:30,490
It's my responsibility.
You need to understand me.

328
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,418
I'm sorry.

329
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:54,014
In the past, I never
tried to understand you.

330
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,475
But I went to work.

331
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,895
Yeah, that's right.
You said you're working.

332
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:03,023
I just went to tutor my junior.
What's the difference?

333
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:07,444
I'm friends with Warang.
And I chose you, Nao.

334
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:11,281
I had to argue with Warang, my
closest friend, just because I chose you.

335
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,242
I never thought that you
would be this childish.

336
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,744
What do you want to say?

337
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:20,123
Are you going to say that
you made the wrong choice?

338
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,626
Would you say choosing
Warang would have been better?

339
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,462
Then go ahead, date her.

340
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:28,423
You don't have to be with
someone childish like me.

341
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,847
It's me who's foolish,
It's me who's childish.

342
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,475
Not you at all.

343
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
(Beside Story)

344
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,136
This new flavor is so delicious.
I should go back and buy more.

345
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
(Next Episode)

346
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,231
P'Gyo.

347
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,152
Gyo.
