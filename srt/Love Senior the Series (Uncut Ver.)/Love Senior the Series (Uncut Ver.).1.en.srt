"Love Senior The Series"
(Episode 1)

2
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,713
Someone once said that university life is short,
so make the most of it.

3
00:01:57,713 --> 00:02:00,591
I've decided not to let anyone

4
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:04,679
ruin the four wonderful years of my life.

5
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:07,598
Hurry up, they've called.

6
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:12,270
My name is Manao, a first-year student

7
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,524
in the Faculty of Engineering. I'm determined

8
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:20,027
to make the most of being a freshman.
Take that, Nao!

9
00:02:46,554 --> 00:02:49,974
Smelly, Mom brought snacks.

10
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:53,394
She's probably worried her little son
will starve to death.

11
00:02:53,394 --> 00:02:54,437
P'Fueang! You little brat!

12
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:56,314
Ah.

13
00:02:57,231 --> 00:02:59,025
I'm out. If you need help, just call me.

14
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:00,568
P'Fueang.

15
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:05,573
I have to ask all the seniors in the department
for their signatures, seriously.

16
00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:07,158
Yes.

17
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:09,410
Is there no other way?

18
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:10,703
Resign then.

19
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:12,872
Hey, wait.

20
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:20,046
I've just entered. How can I resign so easily?
There must be another way.

21
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:23,549
You have to get the signature
from the head senior of your department, any year.

22
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:27,220
But I recommend the second year.
It's probably the easiest.

23
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:30,181
Hey, smelly!

24
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:33,309
Just get the signatures of all the senior students.
What's so difficult about it?

25
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:35,561
Just get The head senior's signature, right?

26
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:36,270
Yeah.

27
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,564
It's a piece of cake, SO EASY.

28
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:40,900
Oh, EASY?

29
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:44,320
Throughout the entire university,
only one person succeeded in doing it last year.

30
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,199
If you think it's so easy,
then go ahead and do it. I must go.

31
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:14,600
I like you, admire you, I'm falling in love with you.
Can I have your number.

32
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,309
Huh?

33
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:21,274
Those seniors ordered me to do.

34
00:04:31,492 --> 00:04:33,703
Hey, give me some inhaler. Inhaler.

35
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:36,831
What's going on here?

36
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,963
I'm not giving my numbers to anyone.
Don't come and confess your feeling anymore.

37
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:48,968
No, I'm not here to confess
or ask for your number.

38
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:51,470
My names is Luktan. Do you remember me?

39
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:56,267
We worked together in the class yesterday.

40
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:58,853
I remembered. Luktan, right?

41
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:02,523
Have you got any signatures?
I...

42
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:09,238
Is it necessary to ask for the senior's phone number?

43
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:11,574
No need.

44
00:05:11,574 --> 00:05:15,369
He probably know that I don't have transportation,
so he volunteered to pick me up.

45
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:17,913
But I don't think I might not call.

46
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:20,166
Have you ever met the second year head prefect?

47
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:24,003
Yes, I did. But that head prefect looks so intimidating.

48
00:05:24,503 --> 00:05:27,506
It's like there's always some kind of
energy coming out from them.

49
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:29,383
Just thinking about it... So scary.

50
00:05:30,384 --> 00:05:34,263
The prefects are here, everyone!

51
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:35,681
Oh!

52
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:39,810
Hey, what's going on?

53
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:26,524
Warang, that's Gyoza.

54
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:32,988
I have to go now.
I'm really sorry for bumping into you.

55
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:43,708
Today, The head senior cannot ditch the hazing, alright?

56
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:49,088
Is that the head senior?

57
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:55,553
Excuse me.

58
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,059
You're the head senior from second year, right?

59
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:05,563
May I have your signature, please?

60
00:07:08,357 --> 00:07:13,237
You here to ask for my signature,
what do you have in exchange?

61
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:17,241
Manao.

62
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:19,076
I'll do anything

63
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:21,829
whatever you want.

64
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:24,039
You say you can do anything

65
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:27,626
to have my signature, right?

66
00:07:29,837 --> 00:07:30,588
Yes.

67
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:44,643
Oh, Gyoza!

68
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:51,984
Gyoza. Are you serious?
You sure you want Manao to enter the Freshy Contest?

69
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:57,114
Do you have a problem with my choice?
I picked the best one, didn't I?

70
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,870
She's beautiful, has a great body, and nice skin.

71
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,416
Who can you find that's better than Manao?
Tell me, bestie?

72
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:12,588
Oh, I'm not denying this, bestie.

73
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:18,219
But she's tall.
How can we find a taller guy than her?

74
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:21,388
And one more thing,
even if he's tall,

75
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:23,557
The height is not enough.

76
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:26,894
Don't stress about it, girl.
Look.

77
00:08:26,894 --> 00:08:29,605
Those wrinkles on your forehead are out now.

78
00:08:29,605 --> 00:08:31,565
What? Are you serious?

79
00:08:33,484 --> 00:08:34,193
What.

80
00:08:40,324 --> 00:08:43,994
What? There is nothing!

81
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:47,790
Here, Gyoza.

82
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,999
What?

83
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:52,795
I was stress out. Is it the time to play?

84
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:57,591
Believe me.
I'm prepared.

85
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:00,970
Come in.

86
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:08,894
Hello.

87
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:10,604
Hello.

88
00:09:11,856 --> 00:09:14,441
Do you have any business?

89
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:18,487
I haven't violated any regulations.
Student shirt, name tag.

90
00:09:18,487 --> 00:09:20,072
I'm completely in line with the regulations.

91
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:21,365
Calm down.

92
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:23,784
I didn't call you because of a regulation violation.

93
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:27,204
Gyoza, don't tell me that...

94
00:09:27,204 --> 00:09:30,082
this is the person you told me about.

95
00:09:30,082 --> 00:09:31,542
Take a look.

96
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,919
Alee is not an ordinary.

97
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:36,672
Take it off.

98
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:40,342
Don't tell me... I was called for...

99
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:41,427
I mean the glasses.

100
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,596
Oh, yes.

101
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:52,313
Slick your hair back.

102
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:56,901
Woah.

103
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:06,660
Alee, you're hiding your handsome face
behind those sunglasses and with that kind of hair?

104
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:09,872
Take off your clothes.

105
00:10:09,872 --> 00:10:12,750
No way,
what are you guys going to do to me?

106
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,834
I'm not gonna let that happen.

107
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:14,793
Alee.

108
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:17,463
Do I look like that kind of person?

109
00:10:17,463 --> 00:10:19,006
Okay, I'll take them off.

110
00:10:56,418 --> 00:10:59,213
What a good eyes, bestie.

111
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:03,676
I told you that I'm prepared well.

112
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:07,721
The rest is up to you,
make sure Alee looks polished

113
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:10,015
for being a freshman, okay?

114
00:11:10,015 --> 00:11:10,975
Okay, bestie.

115
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,393
I'm counting on you.

116
00:11:25,197 --> 00:11:27,282
When will Prang arrive?

117
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:31,286
I'm feeling hungry.

118
00:11:31,286 --> 00:11:32,121
Are you hungry?

119
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:33,372
Yeah.

120
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:35,374
If you're hungry..

121
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,252
Eat Tao Kae Noi.

122
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:42,923
Hey, Is this Tao Kae Noi's new flavor?

123
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:50,014
Cheers.

124
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,683
Wow, delicious.

125
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:55,185
Do you want to have lunch with me?

126
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:58,731
No, it's better to go back. See you.

127
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:01,150
Who are you meeting up with?
Even if you're not having lunch with me.

128
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,779
I have stuff to do, nosy.
Do eat your damn food.

129
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:08,115
You dare push me away, Manao?

130
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:13,704
Ouch.

131
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:19,460
Are you okay?

132
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:32,973
Um... I'm okay.

133
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:36,185
Come apologize her, you little brat.

134
00:12:36,185 --> 00:12:37,686
I'm sorry.

135
00:12:41,523 --> 00:12:43,025
You sure you didn't get hurt?

136
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,861
Forgive me.

137
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,822
Let's go.

138
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:50,866
So sorry.

139
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:52,868
I'm really sorry.

140
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:54,453
Bow down to her.

141
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:55,579
I'm so sorry.

142
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:02,961
P' Gyo.

143
00:13:06,423 --> 00:13:08,759
Here, put this on.

144
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:16,892
I think I'll ride instead.

145
00:13:16,892 --> 00:13:20,187
I'm heavy, you'll get struggle.

146
00:13:20,187 --> 00:13:23,524
So you can't trust me, right?

147
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:28,028
Not that. I'm just afraid that
you're going to get struggles for that.

148
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:30,322
Let's go, I'll ride for you.

149
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:32,825
I really can.

150
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:44,878
Really, I'd offer to drive you all the way there
if you agree to sign your name right now.

151
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,422
Don't be ridiculous.

152
00:13:48,632 --> 00:13:50,259
I'm just teasing you.

153
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:54,263
So, where are we heading?

154
00:13:56,682 --> 00:14:00,394
We're heading Pataya.

155
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:03,105
For real? Riding from here?

156
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:03,939
I'm ready.

157
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:07,276
You don't trust little red porky?

158
00:14:08,193 --> 00:14:10,112
It's perfectly fine.

159
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:13,490
Let's roll.

160
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:14,825
Ouch.

161
00:14:15,242 --> 00:14:16,994
Ouch.

162
00:14:20,122 --> 00:14:21,748
Please, ride safely.

163
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,336
I'm sorry, I'm used to little red porky.

164
00:14:28,755 --> 00:14:32,634
You can hold on me.
It's a long way. It's dangerous.

165
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:34,386
Here, hold on tight.

166
00:14:37,598 --> 00:14:38,932
Off we go.

167
00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:54,823
We have to work together for the whole semester.

168
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:58,452
I want us to get to know each other better than this.

169
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:03,248
I know that
first-year juniors afraid of me.

170
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:05,292
And are you afraid of me?

171
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:11,423
Actually,
I don't feel scared of you.

172
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:16,261
Maybe because
I've met met before.

173
00:15:17,387 --> 00:15:20,015
Really? When?

174
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:57,803
You're the girl I bumped into that day?

175
00:15:57,803 --> 00:16:01,598
"I have to go now.
I'm really sorry for bumping into you."

176
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:04,268
I'll punch you.

177
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:06,770
Stop smiling.

178
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:18,282
Actually, when it's just the two of us,
you don't have to call me 'P'Gyoza' as a junior.

179
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:21,159
So, Gyoza, when were you born?

180
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:25,289
Woah, All of a sudden?

181
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:28,292
I was born in August.

182
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:33,588
So, you are older than me by just 4 months.

183
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:36,591
What?
And you dare call yourself P'

184
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:38,010
Kiddo.

185
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:40,971
4 months older, still,
I'm older.

186
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:46,059
Well, I entered the university before you,
I'm your senior anyway.

187
00:16:46,768 --> 00:16:51,231
Have you heard? First to come are seniors,
later comers are juniors,

188
00:16:51,231 --> 00:16:53,108
and those come together are friends.

189
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:21,386
I'm sure you're cold now.

190
00:17:22,596 --> 00:17:25,265
You should wear a jacket next time.

191
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:29,269
And this thin student uniforms like this,
stop wearing them.

192
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:31,646
I can see through everything.

193
00:17:40,822 --> 00:17:44,743
Manao, can I ask you something?

194
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:48,413
Ask anything, I'll answer if I can.

195
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:51,500
Manao, do you like girls?

196
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:55,253
So you were curious about this?

197
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:02,386
If I like someone,
It doesn't matter if it's a girl or a guy.

198
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:06,932
If it's right, it's right.
It's not about gender.

199
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:10,685
Hmm, true.

200
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:12,354
Why?

201
00:18:12,354 --> 00:18:14,314
You want to date me?

202
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:17,025
Are you crazy?

203
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:20,862
I was asking because you look like a Tomboy.

204
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,033
You can date me, if you want.

205
00:18:26,493 --> 00:18:28,662
I'm gonna kill you.

206
00:18:31,373 --> 00:18:32,541
What you are you looking at?

207
00:18:48,765 --> 00:18:55,981
P'Lada, I'm not confident with this.
I don't feel like myself at all.

208
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:58,316
I really don't.

209
00:18:58,316 --> 00:19:01,403
Listen to me, Manao.

210
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:06,450
You're very beautiful,
so have confidence in yourself. Believe me.

211
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:10,036
Alee is here.

212
00:19:11,037 --> 00:19:14,875
I took Alee to get a new haircut.
How does it look? Awesome, right?

213
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,755
Absolutely handsome, Alee.
Come and be my boyfriend.

214
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:26,553
You all ready?
The camera comes in 30 minutes.

215
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:31,850
I'm ready. But can we find something to eat?
I'm hungry.

216
00:19:33,226 --> 00:19:35,604
Alee, I'll treat you.

217
00:19:36,813 --> 00:19:39,900
I'm going to bed.
Haven't slept yet.

218
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:47,199
Well, let's get going.
Manao, let's go find something to eat.

219
00:19:52,662 --> 00:19:55,916
I'm hungry yet.
You go ahead.

220
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,792
I'll wait here.

221
00:19:57,792 --> 00:19:59,961
Alright, I will buy you snacks as a treat.

222
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:01,046
Bye.

223
00:20:09,596 --> 00:20:12,516
Today, you look really beautiful.

224
00:20:25,612 --> 00:20:27,531
Thought we weren't going to talk to each other.

225
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:32,911
Are you tired? Haven't seen you much lately.

226
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:35,622
Yeah, I've been really busy.

227
00:20:36,414 --> 00:20:39,251
Third-year seniors are constantly calling on me.

228
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:44,047
It's like child labor.

229
00:20:47,008 --> 00:20:50,720
You should put some ice on it.
Your eyes are swollen.

230
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,390
Others will get freak out if they see you.

231
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,641
They'll think..

232
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:57,352
What a ghost is wandering around in this campus.

233
00:20:58,645 --> 00:21:01,314
Thank you, but I'm alright.

234
00:21:01,314 --> 00:21:04,359
Let my eyes be swollen like a ghost.
It's fine.

235
00:21:04,985 --> 00:21:07,654
The kid around here might get freaked out.

236
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:12,242
Don't be so stubborn. Come here, I'll do it for you.

237
00:21:22,627 --> 00:21:26,464
Get some rest.
Don't forget to take care of yourself.

238
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:30,260
If you don't feel well, it'll be a big problem.

239
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,178
No time to rest.

240
00:21:33,013 --> 00:21:35,223
I don't even have time to sleep.

241
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:37,350
I'm worried about you.

242
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:45,108
If you overdo it, you'll get sick.
And if you die,

243
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:46,776
who gonna give me the head signature?

244
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:49,654
And this contest is for nothing.

245
00:21:49,654 --> 00:21:50,655
Ah.

246
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:52,866
Ow, It's hurt.

247
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:55,869
You want me to die?

248
00:21:55,869 --> 00:21:59,039
- Okay, okay, that's enough.
- How stubborn can you be?

249
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,498
What are you doing?

250
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:03,668
Nothing, just...

251
00:22:03,668 --> 00:22:08,757
Whatever.
Manao, the camera is coming. Hurry up.

252
00:22:08,757 --> 00:22:09,424
Yes.

253
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:24,939
You shouldn't be too friendly with the juniors.
After all, you're the head senior.

254
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:27,150
You should make yourself more respectable than this.

255
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,988
Why? Now that I'm the head senior,
do I have to be so careful?

256
00:22:31,988 --> 00:22:36,910
What's not respectful playing with juniors
and why can't I be friendly with juniors?

257
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,537
Especially when we have to work together this semester.

258
00:22:39,537 --> 00:22:45,168
I'm giving you this advice because I care about you.
I want you to think about your current status.

259
00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:51,675
Only during the hazing, After that,
you can be as close as you want. It's your business.

260
00:22:54,344 --> 00:22:58,932
Snacks. I bought them for you. Eat up.

261
00:22:58,932 --> 00:23:01,976
I know you haven't eaten anything since last night.

262
00:23:01,976 --> 00:23:03,478
Thank you.

263
00:23:22,997 --> 00:23:27,085
Is that you, Nao? You're so funny. Look at you.

264
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:29,921
But you're cute in your own way.

265
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:32,757
Try to put on makeup like this every day,
I'll flirt with you.

266
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:35,343
- You're really cute.
- Uh-huh.

267
00:23:39,973 --> 00:23:44,477
If you don't shut it,
I'll change my mind and slap your filthy mouth.

268
00:23:44,477 --> 00:23:48,773
I'm just joking, dude.
You gonna beat me up?

269
00:23:48,773 --> 00:23:49,691
You do try me?

270
00:23:49,691 --> 00:23:50,734
Um..

271
00:23:52,485 --> 00:23:53,528
Sorry.

272
00:23:55,655 --> 00:23:57,198
Overslept, huh?

273
00:23:57,198 --> 00:23:59,117
I watched series late last night.

274
00:23:59,951 --> 00:24:02,120
- Hey, Manao.
- Huh?

275
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,122
I saw Nao's pictures on the page.

276
00:24:04,122 --> 00:24:08,168
So cute.
Look, I saved them.

277
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:09,669
Thank you.

278
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:10,754
Don't you think it's cute?

279
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:13,923
Hey, You're not gonna introduce your friend?

280
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:17,469
Someone like you shouldn't know her.

281
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:20,138
You little devil, keeping the good ones for yourself.

282
00:24:20,138 --> 00:24:22,682
Hello, I'm Luktan.

283
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:24,058
Your name is Jaojom, right?

284
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:27,520
Hello, Luktan. I'm Jaojom.
Nice to meet you.

285
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,314
Don't hesitate to ask me for help.

286
00:24:29,314 --> 00:24:31,524
Nice to meet you too.

287
00:24:31,524 --> 00:24:33,610
Too much. That's too much.

288
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,653
Luktan, I'm Aey.

289
00:24:35,653 --> 00:24:36,362
Hi, Aey.

290
00:24:36,362 --> 00:24:38,448
- Open the damn book.
- Yes, yes, yes, sir.

291
00:24:38,448 --> 00:24:41,409
- We're studying in the library now.
- Finally.

292
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:42,452
Stop complaining.

293
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:09,562
Have you been here for long?
Why don't you wake me up?

294
00:25:11,272 --> 00:25:17,237
You looked comfy.
So I don't want to wake you up. Want more sleep?

295
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:20,573
We can talk about work later.

296
00:25:21,616 --> 00:25:25,370
No, I'm good. I've slept enough.

297
00:25:28,665 --> 00:25:31,918
So let's get you measured.
So Warang can do the dress for you.

298
00:25:38,758 --> 00:25:40,969
And who will come to help me with measuring?

299
00:25:43,096 --> 00:25:44,556
That's me.

300
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:52,105
You?

301
00:25:55,483 --> 00:25:57,068
We need a chair for you to stand on.

302
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:02,949
No, that's enough.
I'm done.

303
00:26:19,007 --> 00:26:20,675
Don't be angry.

304
00:26:29,392 --> 00:26:35,982
Here, drink this. Vitamin C.
It will make you feel better.

305
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:54,459
Feeling less touchy now?

306
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,545
Let's measure.

307
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:44,092
Finished. Let's go have a meal.

308
00:27:44,092 --> 00:27:46,052
So, where are we going?

309
00:27:50,306 --> 00:27:53,810
We're going to Tom Yam noodle soup place
that I usually go. It's yummy.

310
00:27:54,727 --> 00:27:59,440
Earlier, when I measured you, I was so hungry.
I could eat a whole body.

311
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,775
Why didn't you say anything.

312
00:28:01,609 --> 00:28:04,112
I'll let you have me as an appetizer.

313
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:07,615
You naughty.

314
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:14,205
You want some Gyo (dumpling)?

315
00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:22,755
Can I have them?

316
00:28:31,764 --> 00:28:36,477
Wait, what?
You're the one who wants to give me that.

317
00:28:37,895 --> 00:28:42,567
Here's water. In case you're choking on Gyo.

318
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:46,612
Did you bring your girlfriend with you today? So sweet.

319
00:28:46,612 --> 00:28:49,407
No, it's not. She's a junior.

320
00:28:49,407 --> 00:28:52,785
A junior? Really?

321
00:28:57,707 --> 00:29:01,127
But I can be more than your junior,
if you want to.

322
00:29:02,503 --> 00:29:03,921
Stop teasing me.

323
00:29:03,921 --> 00:29:08,843
And stop giving me those looks.

324
00:29:08,843 --> 00:29:10,803
Uh, it's so scary.

325
00:29:10,803 --> 00:29:11,763
Do you wanna try?

326
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:13,014
It's really scary.

327
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:16,100
Okay, you're begging for it.

328
00:29:31,449 --> 00:29:35,620
Wow, who's this?

329
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:41,459
Are you satisfied?

330
00:29:43,127 --> 00:29:44,879
Hmm...

331
00:29:45,922 --> 00:29:48,674
It's going to need just a tiny push-up there.

332
00:29:50,301 --> 00:29:52,595
Looks like Manao has smaller breasts than you.

333
00:29:54,055 --> 00:29:55,556
Turn around.

334
00:29:57,433 --> 00:29:59,852
Please.
Turn around.

335
00:30:02,814 --> 00:30:03,856
Hey.

336
00:30:07,568 --> 00:30:12,865
Hey, Head Senior, are you satisfied?

337
00:30:14,325 --> 00:30:18,538
I know you're being teased,
but you can't argue back, alright?

338
00:30:20,665 --> 00:30:23,042
You look stunning in this outfit.

339
00:30:24,335 --> 00:30:27,839
If I were a guy, I'd try to date you.

340
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:46,566
So, do you need any fix?

341
00:30:46,566 --> 00:30:48,192
It's okay now.

342
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:54,949
But if you want to,
you can add a bit more padding to the chest.

343
00:30:54,949 --> 00:30:57,118
I'm not adding any more padding.

344
00:30:58,536 --> 00:31:01,956
Are you done now? I can change back.

345
00:31:01,956 --> 00:31:03,166
Yes.

346
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:06,961
I hope you won't make her...

347
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:11,340
try on the dress in front of you,
like you did to me, right?

348
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:16,679
I'm not gonna teasing her.
Teasing her is not fun like I did to you.

349
00:31:17,305 --> 00:31:20,308
It's good that you thought of it.

350
00:31:42,163 --> 00:31:46,000
Manao, why have you been
making that face all week?

351
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:50,213
Are you waiting for the pretty head senior's texts?

352
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:52,965
Stop it.

353
00:31:52,965 --> 00:31:54,383
But you're really making that face.

354
00:31:54,383 --> 00:31:56,010
Because she hasn't texted me back yet.

355
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,887
She will text you soon.

356
00:31:59,013 --> 00:32:01,015
(See you at the Room 222.)

357
00:32:05,228 --> 00:32:06,103
I'm gonna go.

358
00:32:06,103 --> 00:32:07,313
How's about your stuff.

359
00:32:07,313 --> 00:32:08,731
Please take care of them.

360
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:13,986
Why is Manao in such a hurry?
I came here to have lunch together.

361
00:32:13,986 --> 00:32:16,280
Go to the pretty head senior.

362
00:32:19,742 --> 00:32:21,410
Are you going to have lunch, Tarn?

363
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:21,953
Let's go.

364
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:24,789
Okay, let's go.

365
00:32:40,054 --> 00:32:41,722
Are you going to see Gyoza?

366
00:32:41,722 --> 00:32:44,183
Yes, P'Gyoza asked me to go try on a dress.

367
00:32:44,183 --> 00:32:47,979
If it doesn't fit, tell Gyoza, and I'll fix it.

368
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:51,065
Thank you so much, P'Warang,
for making me the dress.

369
00:32:51,065 --> 00:32:56,904
I only made it because I had to, for the department.
I didn't make it to favor anyone.

370
00:33:02,618 --> 00:33:05,663
I want to advise you as a senior as well.

371
00:33:05,663 --> 00:33:07,832
Being close to the head senior

372
00:33:07,832 --> 00:33:12,003
doesn't mean you have
any special privileges over other friends.

373
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:16,882
And the fact that Gyoza is nice to you,
it's the same for others too.

374
00:33:16,882 --> 00:33:19,594
It doesn't mean you're special more than anyone.

375
00:33:33,482 --> 00:33:35,443
I'm not special.

376
00:33:56,088 --> 00:33:58,632
Hey, turn around.

377
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,225
Isn't it weird?

378
00:34:09,185 --> 00:34:14,482
No, it look really good.
You looks so pretty in this dress.

379
00:34:17,777 --> 00:34:20,613
Wait, I want to take pictures
for the third and fourth years to see.

380
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:37,129
Hey, try turning to the side.

381
00:34:45,304 --> 00:34:46,305
Good.

382
00:34:50,476 --> 00:34:51,727
Do you like it?

383
00:34:55,773 --> 00:34:58,692
I mean the photo? Do you like it?

384
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:03,197
Uh, it's pretty.

385
00:35:03,197 --> 00:35:05,825
So, now what? Where are you going next?

386
00:35:05,825 --> 00:35:08,536
I have to go and talk to P'Pure in the Student Union room.

387
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:14,083
Do you want to come with me?
We can discuss the orientation day event.

388
00:35:35,312 --> 00:35:37,481
P'Pure, hello.

389
00:35:41,652 --> 00:35:42,820
Oh.

390
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,281
What?

391
00:35:49,493 --> 00:35:50,744
Hello, P'Pure.

392
00:35:50,744 --> 00:35:55,958
Oh, it's N'Manao. Finally we met.
I've only seen you in photos.

393
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:59,295
Right now, the work at SU is really busy
because the orientation day is coming.

394
00:35:59,295 --> 00:36:01,589
We have to prepare university projects.

395
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:04,258
If Gyoza doesn't help, it's going to be tough.

396
00:36:07,094 --> 00:36:09,847
Act cool. Act cool.

397
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:17,980
Your Gyoza is really serious about his work,
to the point that she won't rest until it's done.

398
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:21,192
- Really.
- Oops, P'Pure.

399
00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:24,278
Here, She's look like this when work is done.

400
00:36:24,278 --> 00:36:28,866
P'Pure.
My hair is messy now.

401
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:40,336
Oh, Warang.

402
00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:41,420
What's up, Warang?

403
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:46,842
I'm sorry for calling you so suddenly.
We really need more people to help.

404
00:36:46,842 --> 00:36:47,843
No problem.

405
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:50,513
Is there anything I can help with, P'Pure?

406
00:36:51,055 --> 00:36:54,892
Oh, I want you to help with some documents.

407
00:36:54,892 --> 00:36:58,229
Then, when it's done,
please send it to the dean for me.

408
00:36:59,688 --> 00:37:02,441
We've to send it within this month, can you make it?

409
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:05,110
Okay.

410
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,572
Here.

411
00:37:12,493 --> 00:37:15,120
Will you work here or at home?

412
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:26,549
Um, P'Pure, I think it's better
to take the work back to my place.

413
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:30,261
Gyo, I'm leaving now.

414
00:37:30,261 --> 00:37:32,179
Um, take care.

415
00:37:33,222 --> 00:37:35,849
Um, I think it's better to help you.

416
00:37:36,642 --> 00:37:37,810
It might be heavy.

417
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:48,279
Goodbye, take care.

418
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:06,589
I saw your girl friend
in the area near Room 222.

419
00:38:07,631 --> 00:38:12,386
Her name tag says "Luktan."
I want you to warn your friend

420
00:38:12,386 --> 00:38:16,849
because Gyoza entered Room 222
without asking for permission.

421
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:20,894
It's probably not good
if people find out about that room more than this.

422
00:38:20,894 --> 00:38:23,105
I will talk to Luktan.

423
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:49,131
Why aren't you buttoned up?

424
00:38:56,388 --> 00:38:57,931
50

425
00:38:58,724 --> 00:39:00,476
51

426
00:39:00,476 --> 00:39:02,478
- Louder than this.
- 52

427
00:39:02,978 --> 00:39:04,647
53

428
00:39:05,481 --> 00:39:07,149
54

429
00:39:07,566 --> 00:39:09,276
55

430
00:39:09,443 --> 00:39:10,819
56

431
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,155
57

432
00:39:14,156 --> 00:39:15,449
58

433
00:39:16,575 --> 00:39:17,910
59

434
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,328
Louder than this.

435
00:39:19,495 --> 00:39:20,829
60

436
00:39:21,413 --> 00:39:22,748
61

437
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,000
- Second year, what are you doing?
- 62.

438
00:39:25,626 --> 00:39:26,293
Stop!

439
00:39:29,213 --> 00:39:31,465
We punish them.
They broke the rules.

440
00:39:31,465 --> 00:39:32,925
First-year, sit down.

441
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:42,935
The juniors broke the rules
because their senior didn't teach well.

442
00:39:43,852 --> 00:39:46,522
This way, I should be punished as a second-year.

443
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:50,275
All second-year students,
hold on to your friends' neck.

444
00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:56,365
Squat x10 times of your batch.
Start!

445
00:39:59,034 --> 00:40:01,995
Let me introduce myself again.
My name is Pure.

446
00:40:01,995 --> 00:40:04,415
I'm a third-year senior of yours.

447
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:07,751
I have the responsibility to
take care of you for one more academic year.

448
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:11,130
I hope all of you will cooperate well,

449
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:17,094
but I won't consider you my juniors
until you have this.

450
00:40:21,598 --> 00:40:22,725
The gear.

451
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:30,190
It's the result of a systematic operation.
All of you here are like small gears

452
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:35,070
who must work together and take responsibility
for your duties. If any gear stops turning

453
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:39,908
or gets stuck,
it will prevent the other gears from functioning.

454
00:40:41,326 --> 00:40:45,956
So, gears represent everyone
in the Faculty of Engineering.

455
00:40:45,956 --> 00:40:51,837
It's an honor. It's a virtue.
It doesn't belong to just anyone.

456
00:40:51,837 --> 00:40:57,801
But as long as you continue to act undisciplined like this,
don't expect to get a batch easily.

457
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:02,681
Second-year, get up. Now!

458
00:41:04,641 --> 00:41:08,937
Next, I'll have my junior come out
and demonstrate the proper way to introduce yourself.

459
00:41:08,937 --> 00:41:10,814
When you go to ask for seniors' signatures.

460
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,028
If you want their signatures,
introduce yourself first.

461
00:41:20,115 --> 00:41:24,036
I, my name is Miss Kaniknan, last name Wiwatkul.

462
00:41:24,036 --> 00:41:30,626
The first-year student in the Faculty of Engineering.
My nickname is Gyoza, E66 batch.

463
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:34,922
This is the self-introduction of the senior
who a second-year student and had the badge.

464
00:41:35,964 --> 00:41:40,803
But all of you are first-year students
and haven't received the badge yet.

465
00:41:40,803 --> 00:41:45,557
You must introduce yourself
as 'the soon-to-be E67'

466
00:41:45,557 --> 00:41:50,479
and must use the word "soon-to-be"
until you receive your badge.

467
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:51,188
Understood?

468
00:41:51,188 --> 00:41:52,189
Understood.

469
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:04,827
You.

470
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:13,961
Introduce yourself as an example for your friends to see.

471
00:42:30,435 --> 00:42:34,648
I, My name is Manapat, last name Siridawong.

472
00:42:34,648 --> 00:42:38,277
The first-year student in the Faculty of Engineering.

473
00:42:38,277 --> 00:42:42,030
My nickname is Manao, The soon-to-be E67 batch.

474
00:43:10,976 --> 00:43:12,311
Ha.

475
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,485
(Tired, huh?)

476
00:43:21,862 --> 00:43:25,198
(Very tired. My legs can't take it anymore.)

477
00:43:29,494 --> 00:43:33,707
(P'Gyo, where are you?
Let's go find something to eat. I'll treat.)

478
00:43:41,548 --> 00:43:44,885
(SU room, come quickly. I'm so hungry.)

479
00:43:48,931 --> 00:43:53,310
P'Pure, what's so funny?
My legs are about to give out.

480
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:57,022
Took so long until you told to stop.
Are you a sadist?

481
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:02,361
I'll give you a massage.

482
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:03,695
Stop it.

483
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:09,284
Just by talking, I can see right through to the core.
You still want something from me?

484
00:44:09,284 --> 00:44:12,996
What do you mean?
This is the purest Pure.

485
00:44:12,996 --> 00:44:16,500
The Pure who is good.
Don't you remember?

486
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,834
Oh my.

487
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:30,764
I, my name is Miss Kaniknan, last name Wiwatkul.

488
00:44:30,764 --> 00:44:36,728
The first-year student in the Faculty of Engineering, E66 batch.

489
00:44:38,438 --> 00:44:40,565
I'm here to ask for your signature.

490
00:44:44,987 --> 00:44:49,116
You want my signature,
what do you have in exchange?

491
00:44:49,116 --> 00:44:50,951
I'll do anything.

492
00:44:50,951 --> 00:44:55,163
If you can do what I ordered, I'll sign for you.

493
00:45:04,965 --> 00:45:10,512
It was 10 times of the batch earlier. That's crazy.
I'm your junior not an Iron man. Here.

494
00:45:12,264 --> 00:45:16,059
Look, if it's not heavy,
the juniors will you believe it?

495
00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:20,272
You have to play big.
So they can see how much you love your juniors.

496
00:45:20,272 --> 00:45:22,691
You'd rather take the punishment for them.

497
00:45:22,691 --> 00:45:24,901
Come here, I'll give you massage.

498
00:45:26,945 --> 00:45:31,324
My thighs are sore.
I'll take a long leave from works.

499
00:45:31,324 --> 00:45:34,119
Can't handle the work anymore. My legs hurt.

500
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:35,746
Stop overreacting.

501
00:45:36,413 --> 00:45:43,462
You remember when I was the head third-year senior?
That day, I took the punishment for you like over 400 times.

502
00:45:43,462 --> 00:45:49,760
- This is only 100. Hmm, stop nagging.
- P'Pure

503
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,054
you make my hair messy again.

504
00:45:52,054 --> 00:45:56,266
Wait, Manao's coming to pick you up, right?

505
00:45:59,186 --> 00:46:02,606
Okay, gotta go. See you around.

506
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,735
How do you know that Manao's coming?

507
00:46:06,735 --> 00:46:09,821
I saw your smile. Like that.

508
00:46:09,821 --> 00:46:12,657
You only smile for her. That's why I knew.

509
00:46:14,367 --> 00:46:17,162
I'm off now, see you. Don't forget to lock the room.

510
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:55,909
N'Prang.

511
00:47:07,087 --> 00:47:09,297
You're coming for Thida, right?

512
00:47:09,297 --> 00:47:10,632
Yes.

513
00:47:10,632 --> 00:47:15,262
Then, walk with me.
I'm going to give something to Thida.

514
00:47:15,262 --> 00:47:16,555
Okay.

515
00:48:08,648 --> 00:48:10,025
P'Gyo.

516
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:13,528
P'Gyo.

517
00:48:15,488 --> 00:48:16,615
P'Gyo.

518
00:48:18,617 --> 00:48:19,951
