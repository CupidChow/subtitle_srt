"Love Senior The Series"
(Episode 2)

2
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,440
P'Gyoza.

3
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,039
P'Gyoza.

4
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,320
P'Gyoza.

5
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:46,239
Are you here?

6
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,639
You're late. I fell asleep
just because of you.

7
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:09,920
Let's go, I'm already hungry.

8
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,280
Let's have some food.

9
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,880
Why do you have to bring the workshop shirt
with you? We're just going for food.

10
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:27,419
The reason is I don't
want to walk close to

11
00:03:27,443 --> 00:03:30,760
anyone so that people
know I'm the head senior.

12
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,039
This way, I won't have to walk too close.

13
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,480
P'Gyo, take my shoes. It'll
prevent you from getting leg pain.

14
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,840
If I wear yours,
what will you wear?

15
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,679
It's okay, we'll be back to the dorm soon.

16
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:54,960
Oh, don't forget to stop by
and get the outfit from my room.

17
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,880
I sent it for laundry already.

18
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:01,159
And take these snacks to eat.

19
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,760
Okay.

20
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,320
Let me help you carry this.

21
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,200
(OUT OF ORDER)

22
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:30,199
Ugh.

23
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:35,320
Get on my back.
Here, I'll carry you to the room.

24
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,119
Are you crazy?
My room is on the fifth floor.

25
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:45,960
It's okay, I'll just walk up.

26
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:52,400
Are you really alright?

27
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,719
Are you okay?

28
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,440
Piggyback?

29
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,400
Then hold this.

30
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,719
Come on.

31
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,360
1 2 3 Up! Alright?

32
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,400
OK.

33
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,400
You've owed me.

34
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,039
What do you want then?

35
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,000
Tell me so I can pay if off.

36
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,719
Let me think about it, I'll tell you later.

37
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,599
Will you forget about this debt?

38
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:36,239
I won't forget, of course.

39
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:39,119
I promise with the honor
of the soon-to-be engineer.

40
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,000
OK.

41
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:42,079
OK, then let's go.

42
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,519
Wow, P'Gyo, you're heavy.

43
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,400
I'm not.

44
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,679
- For real.
- Shut up!

45
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:51,000
This is my room.

46
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,159
Take a break if you want; you've
been carrying me from the first floor.

47
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:56,920
Oof.

48
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,880
Why are you slamming the door?

49
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,360
Your room will collapse soon.

50
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,519
- You did it. -I didn't do anything.
- Go sit!

51
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:08,840
Ugh, my legs hurt.

52
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:18,880
I'm sitting down since
you don't need my help.

53
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,880
Yeah.

54
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:23,000
You helped a lot already.

55
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,840
Well, even if your legs hurt,
at least there's food to eat.

56
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,079
Even my back hurts.

57
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,719
But still...

58
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:41,159
There's food to eat.

59
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,599
Right!!!

60
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:01,199
What are you thinking?

61
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,639
Why were you so fierce
during today's hazing?

62
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:12,719
You scared by the first-year
by acting like that.

63
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:15,880
That's my job.

64
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,079
Like how P'Pure punished
the second-year today.

65
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,639
But making everyone
squat for a hundred times

66
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,639
is still too much.

67
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,719
Don't make that sad face,

68
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:29,960
I'm about to cry.

69
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,880
Hey! I'm your senior.
How could you do this?

70
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,480
You're a bad girl.

71
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,719
Should I scold you?

72
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:42,760
Oh, so you can play with my hair?

73
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah. Why?

74
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,239
Why, huh? You bad girl.

75
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Gyo?

76
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,119
I don't wanna be your junior anymore.

77
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,440
Please?

78
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,479
I mean,
I'd rather be your friend.

79
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:27,640
- There it is.
- Oh.

80
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,239
It hurts, look, is it red?

81
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:34,159
No pain, no gain.

82
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,560
Perhaps later, once you've got the gear,
I'll consider you.

83
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:50,439
Can I see yours?

84
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,199
Whose gear is this?

85
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,960
I've heard the quote, "The gear
is where the heart finds its home."

86
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:12,359
It's important.

87
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:18,000
Actually, someone left it to me.

88
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,199
I owed them a promise.

89
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:27,840
Nao, you're looking like a sad puppy again.

90
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,960
What's wrong?

91
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,479
The day P'Gyo buttoned
my shirt just for me,

92
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,880
does that mean I'm special, doesn't it?

93
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,520
That day, she did that to just you
because others dressed decently.

94
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
Stop fooling and get
over yourself, puppy.

95
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,800
Jom.

96
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,880
A good friend should
encourage their friends. Got it?

97
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,800
I'm a good friend, you know.

98
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm saying this to protect your heart. Do
you really think everything is on your side?

99
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:04,720
She might just see you as a plain junior.

100
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,199
What I said... well, I care, okay?

101
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,880
And just because Gyoza is nice to you,
it doesn't mean you're special.

102
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,840
Don't think you're more
special than other people.

103
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:35,039
School's over! Let's go grab a meal.

104
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
Go, go, go!

105
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,159
Professor, I have a question here.

106
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,800
Manao, I'm going.

107
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:44,119
Okay, bye.

108
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:45,560
Hurry, hurry, go, go, go.

109
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,640
Bye.

110
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,880
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

111
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:54,720
Nao.

112
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,000
During class, you seemed to have a
headache, so I got you some medicine.

113
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,119
Thanks.

114
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:02,000
Um.

115
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:08,359
Uh! Looktal, earlier, I
saw you at the room 222.

116
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,239
What were you doing there?

117
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:14,119
I were...

118
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:18,840
Well, if there's nothing,
can I ask just one thing?

119
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,079
Don't go to that room again.
I don't want her to get in trouble.

120
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,960
Sure, okay.

121
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,159
Actually, that day,
I just brought Mechanic's sheets for you,

122
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,399
But if... it makes you uncomfortable,

123
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,479
I won't go to that room anymore.

124
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:36,840
Thank you.

125
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,960
Yeah.

126
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,520
It's lunchtime! Let's go eat.
I'll treat you myself.

127
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,319
Sure.

128
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,119
You treat? I'll come with you.

129
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,319
Not you.

130
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:52,840
Treat me for a day.

131
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,079
- Treat me for a meal.
- No way.

132
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,279
Go.

133
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:14,920
Suay.

134
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,199
Suay. Come here.

135
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,600
What's wrong with her?

136
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,560
She's been strange lately.
It's so scary.

137
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,119
Normally, she's always composed but today,
she didn't even smile or talk. It like...

138
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,680
complete hell.

139
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,960
Hey, could it be that P'Pure used her
until she's lost consciousness?

140
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,359
Unlikely.

141
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,079
P'Pure suspended
her from work right now.

142
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:54,760
He’s afraid she might die
under a pile of paperwork.

143
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,199
So you volunteered to get
her work done, right, Warang?

144
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:03,439
Lada. You.
Go find out what happened to her.

145
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:04,359
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

146
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:05,640
Why shift the responsibility to me?

147
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,520
Yes. Go now.

148
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,239
Gyo.

149
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,640
Hey, Gyoza.

150
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,159
They all went home?

151
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,199
Yeah.

152
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:39,079
What's up with you lately?
You seems down, not smiling or talking.

153
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,279
And your face freezes looks like a robot.

154
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,948
Or... are you so into
the character of the head

155
00:14:43,972 --> 00:14:45,640
senior that you can't
switch out in real life?

156
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,279
You guys are over reacting.
It's nothing.

157
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,600
It's nothing my ass!

158
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,359
Look, we're all worrying about you.

159
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,199
If you've got something
to say, just tell us.

160
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,279
Otherwise, what's the
point of having friends?

161
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:08,039
It's nothing, seriously
You guys are overthinking. That's absurd.

162
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:14,000
Because of that girl, right?

163
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:20,079
Before, she had been
following you like a lost puppy.

164
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,039
But lately, she's all gone.

165
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm wondering if she had someone else.

166
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:32,000
Look, Gyo.

167
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,840
What?

168
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,199
Are you lost?

169
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:41,279
You can tell me.
This can be our secret between you and me.

170
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,239
I won't tell no one.

171
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,439
Ah. Ah. Ah.

172
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:51,439
I promise you with honor of the
prettiest soon-to-be engineer of the batch.

173
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,439
Okay, I'll tell you.

174
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,319
Um.

175
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:01,800
How about..
Tonight at Dark bar.

176
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,119
Oooh.

177
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,680
It is such an honour to be the
guest of yours, K. Kaniknan.

178
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,800
So, see you at 8.

179
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,359
- See ya.
- Sure.

180
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:13,760
Lada.

181
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,439
Yeah?

182
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,720
Keep it together.

183
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,119
What are you playing, Looktal?

184
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,880
Just saw you being all spaced out.

185
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,640
So, I brought you back to your senses.

186
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,640
Bought this for you.

187
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,560
It's a kiss after kick.

188
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,479
I dunno.

189
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,560
Dunno. Dunno.

190
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,920
- I dunno. I dunno.
- My hair!

191
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:02,199
- My hair is messy now.
- Let me help you.

192
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:06,279
No, it's wet.
No! No! No! No! No!

193
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:11,560
Oh, P'Gyo! Hello there.

194
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:22,600
Here you go, dear friend, your food.

195
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:29,399
Your beautiful head senior,
her face looks so stiff.

196
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:30,920
Such a fierce expression.

197
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,479
She's not mine even a bit.

198
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,159
Come here, come, come, come!

199
00:17:54,159 --> 00:18:02,119
What's up, girl? What's on
earth brings you here at my place?

200
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,600
Got a date with friend.

201
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:10,199
Can I get a discount?
Mid-month's tough.

202
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,920
No problem.

203
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:19,319
I'll treat you today.
Hope it won't hurt the shop too much

204
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,079
and there will still be
enough for the other tables.

205
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:28,640
Your place is nearby but
you haven't shown up lately.

206
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,000
After finishing our activities,
I'll come to help out, okay?

207
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,159
Um, um, um, Pepsi,
Moota, you heard that, right?

208
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,560
Huh? I'll remember your words.

209
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,159
Yes.

210
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:43,948
Ah, I'll look after
other tables first, dear.

211
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:45,720
I'll have the kids
take care of you later.

212
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,560
Thank you.

213
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,239
Gyo, sorry for being late.

214
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,119
Uh, I'm used to it.

215
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:57,575
You can order, it's P'Tun's treat.

216
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,199
Yeah? That's nice. But today we will drink
just a little, we got morning class tomorrow.

217
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah.

218
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,760
You ready to talk, huh?

219
00:19:13,782 --> 00:19:18,920
Actually, I'm not ready at all,
but I guess I have to speak, right?

220
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,760
Today, you have to tell
me what happened that day.

221
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,960
I mean, I feel like it
was wrong. It's strange

222
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,319
and..

223
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:34,079
I feel guilty too.

224
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:38,479
Guilty about what, huh?

225
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:45,159
Guilty towards yourself or towards
the owner of the gear you're wearing?

226
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,680
Listen, Gyo,
just cut out what's right and wrong.

227
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,680
But I think you should ask
yourself what the answer is.

228
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,928
If the answer isn't the owner
of the gear you're wearing,

229
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:05,199
just take back
the promise you've given.

230
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:09,399
They've been waiting for your answer
for a year.

231
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:12,800
It's the best way, you should
do something to make it clear.

232
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,920
Don't let it linger like this.

233
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,039
Trust me.

234
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:21,520
But it's probably not the right time now.

235
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,239
But there's a ton of problems.

236
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,520
Hey, Gyo.

237
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:38,720
Huh?

238
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,640
Is that your puppy?

239
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,439
Over there.

240
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,000
Whoa, looking all cool there.

241
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,319
You're not planning to
greet your beautiful senior?

242
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:55,920
She's dressed up too cute today.

243
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:12,560
What's next, mama?
Your puppy is officially on the hunt.

244
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,800
You alright?

245
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,439
So, that's it. Well, eat something else.

246
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:25,840
You will get drunk.

247
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:30,520
Hey, Gyo.

248
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,680
Gyo.

249
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:40,520
But do you know P'Lada, that person?
So damn cute.

250
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,039
But I prefer the one with a small build.

251
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,239
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

252
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,439
You mean P'Gyo?

253
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,680
But she's the head senior.
Do you dare?

254
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,680
A head senior?

255
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,399
She can give me head too.

256
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,334
- What the hell are you saying?
- Hey!

257
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,720
- What did you just f♪cking say?
- What the f♪ck

258
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,880
Stop it!

259
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,720
Nao.

260
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:10,560
Nao! Calm down!

261
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,479
You're insane!

262
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:12,680
Nao! Stop it!

263
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,039
Jom, Get off me!

264
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,840
What's wrong with you?

265
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,199
They talked nasty about P'Gyo. I'll drain
out that bad blood from their filthy mouths.

266
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:21,479
They said 'She can give head too.'

267
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,319
Come on!

268
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,680
Stop!

269
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,840
Is it true?

270
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,079
I'm asking if it's true.

271
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:41,159
Yes.

272
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,039
I did.

273
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,279
I will pardon you,
if you let this go.

274
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,800
But if you mess around anytime soon,

275
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,520
We'll see. If the academic
future can be ruined

276
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,760
by the nastiness that
spills from your filthy mouth.

277
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:04,000
I hope this ends here.

278
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:06,640
Yes.

279
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,680
Nao, we need to clear things up.

280
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,079
Get in now before the mosquitoes do.

281
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,119
My room key is lost.
Did I lose it during the fight?

282
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,880
Don't you have a roommate?

283
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Nope.
I prefer to live alone.

284
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:10,359
Here, hurry up and take a shower. A
toothbrush is on the shelf in the bathroom.

285
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:14,399
Okay.

286
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,439
Nao, stop it!

287
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:21,640
Jom, get off me!

288
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,439
What's wrong with you?

289
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:26,800
They talked nasty about P'Gyo.
I'll drain out that bad blood from their filthy mouths.

290
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,079
They said 'She can give head too.'

291
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,560
Come on!

292
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:42,479
Here, the dryer.

293
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:44,000
What are you doing?

294
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,760
I'm going to pick up the laundry.
Looks like it's about to rain.

295
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,920
Blow it dry, please.

296
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,319
No need to blow. It'll dry on its own.

297
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:37,079
Are you biting its ear, Nao?
Let my teddy go.

298
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:56,319
Why not blow-dry your
hair? You might get sick.

299
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,720
If you don't want me to get sick,
you should do it for me.

300
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,648
No need. If you want to
get sick, that's your choice.

301
00:26:06,571 --> 00:26:08,600
I'm not the one
who gets sick anyway.

302
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,760
But if my damp hair touches your pillow,

303
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,720
Your pillow will smell musty.
Is it alright?

304
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,439
Then…

305
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:25,479
No pillow. No bed. Sleep on the floor.

306
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:28,239
Oh, you're cruel.

307
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:31,840
My hand hurts.
I can't hold the dryer anymore.

308
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,239
Can you dry my hair for me?

309
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:34,640
Please~.

310
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,359
Can you do it for me?

311
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,600
P'Gyo, you're so kind. Normally, the
head senior would scold someone, right?

312
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,840
And do you want me to scold you?

313
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:07,880
Even thought I don't want
you to be kind to others.

314
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,760
I just want you to be kind just to me.

315
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,199
Thanks for blow-drying my hair.

316
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,800
Give me your hand. I'll change the bandage.

317
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,079
Be careful when you go back.
Don't let the wound get wet, understand?

318
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:14,520
Why are you scolding me?
It's scary when you did that, you know?

319
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:22,079
Good. I scolded them
to make the kids scared.

320
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,600
So they won't cause trouble again.

321
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,960
Seriously, when you take the glasses off,
it does look kinda cute.

322
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,640
Cuter than when you wear them.

323
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,000
I can't see clearly.

324
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,119
Even like this, I can't see your face.

325
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,439
How about now? Is it clear?

326
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,439
Ahh! Ouch!

327
00:29:13,439 --> 00:29:15,920
Does it hurt?

328
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,840
Yes, it hurts.

329
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,079
Put the first aid kit away.

330
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:20,760
Do you have trouble sleeping
in someone else's bed?

331
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,000
Yeah, I can hardly sleep.

332
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,439
Are you scared?

333
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,079
Yeah.

334
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:36,199
I don't like thunder.

335
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,600
Are you less scared when I do this?

336
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,560
Yeah.

337
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,800
If possible, I wanna be the last person...

338
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,800
to see your face before
you go to sleep every night.

339
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,279
Is that too much to ask?

340
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:31,079
They talked nasty about P'Gyo. I'll drain
out that bad blood from their filthy mouths.

341
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:33,359
What a loser.

342
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,239
What should we do? This is about Manao.

343
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,760
(Have you seen the clip?)
(Are we in trouble now?)

344
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,479
What should we do now?
Text her in the group chat.

345
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,279
I'll take care of it.

346
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,279
(If you're going to be punished,
we'll take responsibility too, don't worry, Nao.)

347
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:06,279
I'll take it from here.

348
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,600
(Don't worry, Nao.
We'll take the blame with you.)

349
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,760
Where the hell is she?
Just call to check on her.

350
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,039
I called, but she's not answering.

351
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,840
Does she know what was happening right now?

352
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,119
How'd I know? I'm sitting here with you.

353
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,119
Just text her then.

354
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:31,199
She doesn't even reply to my texts, though.

355
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,680
Urg, how much can we do better than this?

356
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,439
Damn, Gyo skipped class again.
Lada, call her.

357
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:53,520
Okay. Okay.

358
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,800
No need to call.
She probably won't come.

359
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,359
I'm worried about the first-year junior.
How can they get the badge if this happens?

360
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:06,560
Even if it's just one person's fault,

361
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,840
the whole batch has to take responsibility.

362
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,680
Really. I think Manao
did it to protect the senior.

363
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,359
But it's still wrong.

364
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,319
But if we cut out the right and wrong.

365
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:20,399
I admire her for doing that.

366
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:27,960
Lada, can you go get a
copy of the sheet with me?

367
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:35,399
Warang.

368
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:37,119
Huh?

369
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,399
I need to talk to you.

370
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,199
What do you want to talk about?
No need to beat around the bush.

371
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,119
I will ask you straight out.

372
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
Do you like Gyoza?

373
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,960
Um, yeah, probably.

374
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,680
But do you really know that
Gyoza might like that girl?

375
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,239
Or maybe she already likes her.

376
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,680
But you can't be jealous.

377
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,479
You have more chances than her.
But you don't try to use them.

378
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:23,359
I know that you don't like Manao.
I just hope you can distinguish

379
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,720
what's personal and what's not.

380
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,640
I can distinguish that.

381
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,439
But can Gyoza distinguish?
She did something wrong, and you see it.

382
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,520
Will Gyoza punish her?

383
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,039
You don't trust your friend, huh?

384
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,279
You talk like you don't
know your friend like that.

385
00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:47,760
What kind of person is Gyoza?
You know very well, don't you?

386
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,000
Yes.
I did know, how she was before.

387
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,319
But now, is she still the same?

388
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:59,600
I had warned her that she
was too close with the juniors.

389
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,943
Even though she's the head senior,

390
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:04,241
she has a responsibility to
uphold the honor of seniors.

391
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:08,600
And what did she do?

392
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,760
Took a junior to sleep in her room.

393
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,520
Is there still confidence
that she's the same?

394
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,119
It's not my business if you trust her or not.
But for me, I've had enough of this.

395
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:10,039
P'Gyo, wake up.
It's noon already.

396
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:15,399
You have to wake up now.

397
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,520
Uh.

398
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,640
Wake up.

399
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:20,159
What time is it?

400
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,960
It's already past noon.

401
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,239
Gosh, I have morning class today.
Thida's going to kill me for sure.

402
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,640
Let me go.

403
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,439
But you're scared of the thunder.

404
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:44,039
The sky is clear.
Let go, I need to grab the phone.

405
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:46,239
Maybe it will thunder again.

406
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,520
Stop it.

407
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:02,840
(Gyo, come to 222 at 2 PM. I have
something important to talk with you.)

408
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,760
What's wrong, P'Gyo?
Why do you look so shocked?

409
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,920
Nao, hurry up and get dressed.
I'll drop you off at the dorm.

410
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,880
But.

411
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,960
No buts.
I have an urgent matter to do.

412
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,880
Go get dressed.

413
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:55,760
(Where are you? I
knocked but no one answered)

414
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,239
(I'm not in my room,
I'm at the college dorm)

415
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:01,199
(I'm not in my room, I'm at the college dorm)
(I'll pick you up, send me location)

416
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,920
(BeLike Dorm near Dark Bar.)

417
00:39:20,479 --> 00:39:24,159
P'Gyo, I've seen the clip.

418
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,039
P'Gyo.

419
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,359
Nao.

420
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:37,560
If there's anything after this,
you have to listen to what I say.

421
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:41,279
You must follow whatever I say.

422
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,920
Can you do that?

423
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,800
Yes.

424
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:48,039
Then I'll drop you off at the dorm.

425
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
My brother will come pick me up here.

426
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,520
Um, I'll walk you down.

427
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:57,439
Nao.

428
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,720
Can you promise me that
you'll believe only in what I say?

429
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,640
No matter what anyone else says,

430
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,880
Just believe me.

431
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,520
Please, I beg you.

432
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:18,439
I promise.

433
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,000
Here's the senior you
stayed the night with.

434
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:42,039
N'Gyo, The head senior of Elec Maj.

435
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,680
Hello, P' MaFueang.

436
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:49,680
I had no idea that
Manao is your little sister.

437
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,640
Do you know each other?

438
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,680
I know her well.
Let's go, smelly.

439
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,239
Get in. We have something to discuss.

440
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,359
Go.

441
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:07,680
Uh, P' MaFueang.

442
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:15,720
Everything that happened,
I will take responsibility

443
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:19,520
for both as a senior in the department

444
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,119
and as the head senior.

445
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,520
I won't interfere with your duty anyway.

446
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,279
But the thing I want to discuss with Nao

447
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,239
is between a brother and a sister.

448
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,359
I hope you understand.

449
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,800
Yes.

450
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,479
Get in now.

451
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,920
P'Gyo.

452
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,479
See you later.

453
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,760
Nao!

454
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,039
It's strange that you came before time.

455
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,800
Tired, huh?

456
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:10,680
So exhausted that I
couldn't hold back my tears?

457
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,479
These past few days that you've
been sad, What's causing it?

458
00:43:17,479 --> 00:43:20,039
I'm reflecting on my own feelings.

459
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:22,560
Everything right now.

460
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:27,359
It's making me completely confused.

461
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:32,199
I even feel bad about the owner
of the gear that's hanging around my neck.

462
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,880
I'm not hanging it around my neck anymore.

463
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:49,279
I think..

464
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,239
I'm confident in the
answer that I'll give them.

465
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,640
If you're about to say...

466
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,279
you like that girl,

467
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,920
that's what I'm worried about.

468
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:07,195
You're worried because
the fact that I like

469
00:44:07,219 --> 00:44:10,600
her will make me not
dare to punish her, right?

470
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,399
You talk like we're not friends.

471
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,520
I couldn't help it.
I heard that you slept with her last night.

472
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,439
Hey.

473
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,640
I let her stay because she lost her key.

474
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,840
There's nothing going on, okay?

475
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:34,479
And how did you find out about that?

476
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,760
Warang.

477
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:39,239
But she just went to wake
you up for class like every day.

478
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,800
Is Warang mad at me?

479
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,680
But I didn't do anything
with her, seriously.

480
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,600
About the clip and Warang.

481
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,600
I'm going crazy.

482
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,720
Let's talk calmly.

483
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,880
You're both hot-tempered.

484
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,279
(Let's meet at Room 222. I have
something I need to talk to you about.)

485
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:26,720
I told her to meet at Room 222.

486
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,960
And about Manao?

487
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,439
Did you ask P'Pure yet?

488
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,039
I've talked to him.

489
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:40,199
About this, I'm the cause.
Anyway, I have to take responsibility.

490
00:45:42,279 --> 00:45:43,840
You don't have to worry.

491
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,239
Okay. No doubt.

492
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,840
It's your problem.
You can solve it on your own.

493
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:59,039
Just keep calm with Warang,
okay? She's just worried about you.

494
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:01,960
Why do you seem so concerned about Warang?

495
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,640
There's nothing.
I don't want any more fights.

496
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:19,159
I'll go submit the assignment first.
Wait for me here.

497
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:20,399
I'm not going anywhere.

498
00:46:20,399 --> 00:46:21,319
Okay.

499
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,848
(Tomorrow at 4:30 PM, there will be
an unofficial branch meeting. Everyone,

500
00:46:36,872 --> 00:46:38,720
please gather at the sports field.)
(Everyone understands you. Don't worry )

501
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,960
P'Gyo.

502
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,720
I think you should clear things
up yourselves. I'd better go.

503
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,159
No need.

504
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,039
It's better if you can stay.

505
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:31,199
You came early.
Do you have any problems?

506
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:36,239
You don't even realize? What's going
on with your relationship with Manao,

507
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:40,920
it's making our branch look bad.
And I've warned you before.

508
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,720
But you still bring Manao close to you,
like when you're in bed together.

509
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,560
I saw it with my eyes.

510
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,520
What you guys did last night.

511
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,720
You couldn't even make it to class.

512
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,520
I'm really disappointed in you, Gyo.

513
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,760
I'm sorry.

514
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,840
Warang, I never thought
you'd be so careless.

515
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:20,239
I thought you were a bit too harsh, Warang.
Are you jealous? But she's your friend.

516
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:22,560
You're just friend.

517
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,520
Wait, Nao. Nao! Stop! Nao!

518
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,279
I order you to stop.

519
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:49,399
Don't overthink this.
Warang was upset because of last night.

520
00:48:49,399 --> 00:48:51,319
How can I not overthink this?

521
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:58,560
Everything she said is true, you know.

522
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:10,199
I like you.

523
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:18,119
I'm sorry,
that the feelings I have for you

524
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:19,960
are making things difficult.

525
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,520
I'm sorry,

526
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,279
that I caused you trouble.

527
00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:28,039
I'm sorry,

528
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:32,359
that I like you even
though it's impossible.

529
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:37,920
I'm really sorry,

530
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:06,600
What a coward, Gyo!

531
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:15,920
(Beside Story) Belle, I've got something.
It's a study aid for the upcoming exams.

532
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:18,640
Wow.

533
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,720
What do you have for me, P'Nao?

534
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,199
These are vitamin pills, various types.

535
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:26,640
But I think this one suits you, Belle.

536
00:50:35,279 --> 00:50:38,319
Great! Thanks, P'Nao.

537
00:50:43,938 --> 00:50:47,039
(Next Episode) I'm Max, the
president of the fourth-years.

538
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:48,960
I heard there was

539
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,399
an incident causing damage
to our department due to a dispute.

540
00:50:52,399 --> 00:50:55,239
I won't let you take the blame alone.

541
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:57,760
If you can't run,

542
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,359
I'll carry you.
