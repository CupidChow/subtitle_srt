=Episode 9=

8
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,200
(It was me who sent someone to kill you.)

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,640
(And I encouraged Baozhu)

10
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,280
to fight with you
over Dongsheng's inheritance.

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,240
(I also)

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,720
poisoned the concoction
Master took every day.

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,480
This case is already settled.

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,720
What does this have
to do with the shares?

15
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,160
Keep listening to it, then.

16
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,600
(Don't think that
becoming Dongsheng's chairwoman)

17
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,390
(means you can go up
against Mo Shenhai.)

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,880
(Twenty years ago, Mo Shenhai...)

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,680
Mo Yuhan.

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,600
Go reunite with your sister.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,960
The Mo family shares
are in your sister's hands.

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,560
That puts my mind at ease.

23
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,920
Yuzi.

24
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,280
All these years,

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,200
Uncle Mo Shenhai has taken care of me.

26
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,800
He raised me like his own.

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,600
Do you know

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,320
who our family's enemy is?

29
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,320
I do.

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,080
And you still want to help him?

31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,120
Don't you know it too, Yuzi?

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,000
Back then, the Hu family
was also one of our enemies.

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,320
Yet you helped them too.

34
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,440
That night, it was you....

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,280
Yes.

36
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,320
Have you gotten better?

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,440
That doesn't matter.

38
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,560
The problem is you, Yuzi.

39
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,400
Please don't make things hard for me.

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
As for the shares,

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,120
you can handle them yourself.

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,960
A reunion between sisters

43
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,600
is always full of surprises.

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,160
As for whether Madam Zeng
and the butler were acting legally,

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,960
the police department
will continue to investigate.

46
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,400
As for today's matter,

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,360
let's leave it at that.

48
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,760
It's the grand opening ceremony.

49
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,440
So we won't get in your way, Ms. Shan.

50
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,320
You're in for it when we get back.

51
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,680
Let's go!

52
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,760
Even though we have backups,
we just let them get away with it?

53
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,600
The recording is short.

54
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,880
But it's enough to scare Mo Shenhai.

55
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,800
Taking him down won't be that easy.

56
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,560
We need more preparation

57
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,000
to get rid of him completely.

58
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,820
Everything that happened today

59
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,840
was too sudden.

60
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,980
But what if Mo Shenhai
deceived you on purpose?

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,900
What if he used your sister
to turn the tables?

62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,800
I really was impulsive.

63
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,440
Whether that girl is truly your sister,

64
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,560
that is to be confirmed.

65
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,160
She looks just like my mother.

66
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,200
I bet she is my sister.

67
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,440
Those outsiders would never know
those details.

68
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,790
So they couldn't make them up.

69
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,720
Mingkai.

70
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,720
Thank you for today.

71
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,720
Be extra cautious when you get back.

72
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,600
Chief Wu will definitely
come after you again.

73
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,990
If you run into trouble,

74
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,880
come to me.

75
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,400
Don't worry, Yunshu.

76
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,600
Well, I know how to handle him.

77
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,580
Oh, right, Yunshu.

78
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,240
If possible,

79
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,240
can I stay at your...

80
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,160
Chongming.

81
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
What was that?

82
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,280
Why didn't you let him finish?

83
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,080
What are you? A dog?

84
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,320
Where did you take Mingkai?

85
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,120
I was worried

86
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,780
the chief might catch him on the road.

87
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,600
So I sent him straight home.

88
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,680
Others would beg for that.

89
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,280
You'd better be right.

90
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,880
From now on,
Mingkai is my little brother.

91
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,880
Don't you dare treat him
like that again.

92
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,680
Also,

93
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,560
from now on, without my permission,

94
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,400
you are not allowed
to use spiritual energy.

95
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,760
You sure have a lot of brothers.

96
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,880
Sir.

97
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,800
It's entirely my failure in duty.

98
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,760
Indeed, you failed in your duty.

99
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,480
Why didn't you expect Mo Yuzi
to be Shan Yunshu?

100
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,960
From now on,

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,920
you just stay out of the dock business.

102
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,360
Instead, you will be
in charge of the opium den.

103
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,240
Judging from the situation,

104
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,840
it's no longer just about
gaining control of Dongsheng.

105
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,640
It's not a business rivalry anymore.

106
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,560
It's nothing less than a vendetta.

107
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,440
Yes.

108
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,680
How careless of me.

109
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,040
Now that I take a closer look,

110
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,440
you two really do look quite alike.

111
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,600
You found your biological sister.

112
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,440
And you're now a young lady.

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,240
You must be happy, no?

114
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,400
I'm not.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,280
You failed assassination attempts
on Shan Yunshu.

116
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,520
Did you already know it all,

117
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,960
so you two teamed up to fool me?

118
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,640
Master...

119
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,760
I really had no idea
Shan Yunshu was my sister.

120
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,800
And she's very skilled.

121
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,520
With those two bodyguards of hers,

122
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
I really couldn't do it.

123
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,280
But

124
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,840
I've never betrayed you.

125
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,560
I will never forget your kindness

126
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,960
for raising me up.

127
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,200
But she is your sister.

128
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,440
She stopped being my sister
when she abandoned me and ran away.

129
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,320
Don't worry, Master.

130
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,680
I'll help you take back Dongsheng.

131
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,920
Hen.

132
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,640
You're the best assassin I've ever had.

133
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,640
And I trust you.

134
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,800
Now your sister wants me dead.

135
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,200
This is your chance to repay me.

136
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,720
Sneaking after an assassin
in the middle of the night, huh?

137
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,080
What do you want?

138
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,200
Want to have a drink with me?

139
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,500
Have you been well

140
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,720
all these years?

141
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,040
Not bad.

142
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,660
After what happened to our family,
I've been looking for you.

143
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,260
But there was no sign of you.

144
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,760
I never expected you were just

145
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,080
right around me.

146
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,400
Did you ever try to find me?

147
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,240
I didn't.

148
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,450
But I did try to kill you.

149
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,680
Aren't you angry?

150
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,080
What is there to be mad about?

151
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,160
You've lived under Mo Shenhai,

152
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,660
walking the edge of life and death.

153
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,160
It's my fault

154
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,600
I didn't find you in time.

155
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,180
Why did you want to see me?

156
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,960
I want you to come back to me.

157
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,920
Or

158
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,040
leave Mo Shenhai.

159
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,080
It's no good staying by his side.

160
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,880
What's wrong with it?

161
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,400
I've survived all these years.

162
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,560
Now that our identities are exposed,

163
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,760
Mo Shenhai won't trust you anymore.

164
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm worried

165
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,400
he will hurt you.

166
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,760
Are you afraid he'll use me against you?

167
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,760
Yes.

168
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,440
Because you're my sister.

169
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
I love you.

170
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,560
I care about you.

171
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,280
Once I defeat Mo Shenhai,

172
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,200
I'll give you all the Mo family shares.

173
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,440
You won't have
to be an assassin anymore.

174
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,080
You just live a good life.

175
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,600
That way, our late parents

176
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,760
will rest in peace.

177
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,320
Mo Shenhai has been good to me.

178
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,240
But he's still our enemy.

179
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,280
The Hu family were enemies too.

180
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,860
Yet you still get along with each other.

181
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,800
There were reasons
for what happened then.

182
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,720
And the Hu family paid the price for it.

183
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,480
If not for Zhenxuan,

184
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,600
I'd be dead.

185
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,160
If not for Mo Shenhai,

186
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,680
I'd be dead too.

187
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,560
Do you want to move in and live with me?

188
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,600
I'm fine on my own.

189
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,320
If so...

190
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,980
Is there anything else you want to ask?

191
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,860
Where did you bury our parents?

192
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,520
I'd like to visit them.

193
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,560
Why are you still here?

194
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,990
Chongming insisted on staying
because he was worried about you.

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,950
And he dragged me into it.

196
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,520
How was it?

197
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,680
She still hates me.

198
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,880
Don't panic.

199
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,380
You've finally found your sister.

200
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,800
It couldn't be better.

201
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,050
As for those misunderstandings,

202
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,220
take your time to solve them.

203
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,690
After all, it's a long journey ahead.

204
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,600
I'm afraid

205
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,880
Yuhan still sees Mo Shenhai
as a benefactor.

206
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,120
And I don't want him

207
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,160
to use her against me.

208
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,820
If Yuhan refuses to do so,

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,880
she will be in danger.

210
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,200
If you want,

211
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,120
I will kidnap your sister
before we head back.

212
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,320
No way.

213
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,240
That will make Madam
and her sister drift apart.

214
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,320
If so, we'll go with
the least harmful option.

215
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,600
After all, we can't let him
use her against us.

216
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,800
Our top priority

217
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,480
is ensure your sister's safety.

218
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,600
I don't think

219
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,040
Mo Shenhai will hurt my sister now.

220
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,320
It'd be a shame

221
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,160
if he didn't make good use of her.

222
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,760
Besides,

223
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,840
I have faith in Yuhan.

224
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,080
She will never hurt me for real.

225
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,960
Yes.

226
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,760
I believe she will understand you.

227
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,400
Well, well.

228
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,200
Yes, she will understand you.

229
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:54,980
She knows you well.

230
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,400
I'm the unreasonable one here.

231
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,680
Aojue.

232
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,300
It's Madam's business,
so she will make the call here.

233
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,920
Since when have you

234
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,320
cared about her?

235
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,800
Not at all.

236
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,580
You were finding your sister
all this while.

237
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,400
And you've had sworn brothers
along the way.

238
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,560
If I were your sister,

239
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,700
I'd refuse to come home too.

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,640
Moreover,

241
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,870
you've found her,
but you remain indecisive

242
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,640
and alarming.

243
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,080
If I had an disobedient sister,

244
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
I'd beat her to a pulp.

245
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,320
Aojue.

246
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,160
Shut up.

247
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,240
I'll leave you to it.

248
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,980
You will know I'm right about it.

249
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,920
Chongming.

250
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,600
Perhaps Aojue was right.

251
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,640
I've been overthinking it.

252
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,600
Some things aren't complicated.

253
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,550
Life is nothing but complicated.

254
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,920
If it were simpler,

255
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,080
perhaps we wouldn't be as worrisome.

256
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,960
Even immortals and demons have worries?

257
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,080
Of course we do.

258
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,920
Like what?

259
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,320
I envy you for having family.

260
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,720
But I have none.

261
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
You don't have family?

262
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,320
Over the long years,

263
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,040
they all perished
because of limited lifespan.

264
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,840
I've lived alone for centuries.

265
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:21,720
Have you never thought
of starting a family?

266
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:23,760
No.

267
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,160
I've always focused on cultivation.

268
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,200
Perhaps

269
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,880
I've never met someone
who captured my heart.

270
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:35,280
Or maybe

271
00:12:35,803 --> 00:12:37,440
I fear losing what I finally have.

272
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:41,000
No one can stay with us for life.

273
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,960
All precious love will go in the end.

274
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,160
Perhaps

275
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:47,960
cherishing what we have now

276
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:49,640
is the meaning of life.

277
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,800
Otherwise,

278
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,040
no matter how long you live,

279
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,788
it's still pointless.

or say something wrong?

to the Dragon King Temple,

I don't need spiritual energy

298

299
