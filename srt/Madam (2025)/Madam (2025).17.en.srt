00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,880
Mother.

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,880
We've been waiting here
for more than fifteen days.

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,200
Why is Father coming?

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,000
Is he abandoning me?

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,880
Feng.

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,240
Didn't I say so?

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,240
Your father
is busy with a lot of things.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,440
Once he receives the letter,

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,040
he will come and see us.

17
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,560
Who are you?

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,840
Are you Madam Zhang?

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,200
Yes.

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,720
I am Aojue,

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,280
the Dragon Prince.

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,400
Are you my father?

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,360
He's your brother.

24
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,760
Brother?

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,080
Thank you.

26
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,040
It's been a long while
since Feng had this much fun.

27
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,000
Don't mention it.

28
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,480
After all, he's my brother.

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,560
Is your father

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,560
not coming to see us?

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,680
No.

32
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,440
The Dragon Clan
has always been heartless.

33
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,110
You should just let it go.

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,200
I've brought you some money.

35
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,920
It should be enough for your livelihood.

36
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,800
Take it and leave this place.

37
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,160
I didn't come here for your money.

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,000
And it was never my intention
to have a good life in your clan.

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,160
Take the money away.

40
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,720
You need not feel embarrassed about it.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,190
In fact, I've been observing you two
for fifteen days.

42
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,240
How can you live without this money?

43
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,840
Don't act silly
because of that heartless man.

44
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,400
Money always comes first.

45
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm dying soon.

46
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,710
I've been feeling unwell
since several months ago.

47
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,080
The physician said
my days were numbered.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,200
I didn't come here
for that heartless man.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,680
I did it exactly for my loved one.

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,440
I hope someone can take care of Aofeng.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,110
I heard that the Dragon Clan
never took in humans.

52
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,320
But this child
is half-human and half-dragon.

53
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,280
Considering the fact
that he has your bloodline,

54
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,960
please look after him for me.

55
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,400
Got it.

56
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,200
Wait for me here.

57
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,440
I'll head back and explain to him
about your situation.

58
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,280
Madam Zhang!

59
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,560
Madam Zhang!

60
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,680
Madam Zhang!

61
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,660
What's the matter, Aofeng?

62
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,880
Wake up!

63
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,080
Wake up!

64
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,080
Aojue?

65
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,640
Aojue!

66
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,660
What's exactly happened?

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,280
Aojue!

68
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,920
Someone killed my mother!

69
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,440
I will protect you.

70
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,280
It's all right.

71
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,360
Everything will be all right.

72
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,800
Did you hit your head yesterday?

73
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,880
Why are you grinning
like an idiot for no reason?

74
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,320
She loves me.

75
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,640
Will you stop already?

76
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,760
I don't want to.

77
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,920
Well, are you jealous?

78
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,920
Yunshu should've stabbed you
to death yesterday.

79
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,600
The deeper the love,

80
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,320
the deeper the pain.

81
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
She loves me.

82
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,960
She loves me.

83
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,200
Look.

84
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,640
Her love is everywhere.

85
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,320
Aojue.

86
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,240
Say one more word
and I'll rip your mouth open.

87
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,520
Fine.

88
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,880
I'll stop grinning.

89
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,880
Mingkai.

90
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,360
Bring the food to my room.

91
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,280
Sure!

92
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,240
Why are you still grinning like a fool?

93
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,080
The more she's hurt,

94
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,760
the deeper her love

95
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,000
How can I not grin?

96
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,240
Is something wrong?

97
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,200
She's been poisoned with Love Severance.

98
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,920
Her body carries toxins.

99
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,240
That means from now on,

100
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,920
if you still want
to use spiritual energy,

101
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,640
you'll have to rely on me

102
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,320
to suppress the Love Severance.

103
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,440
Therefore,

104
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,880
you need to hurry up
and figure out the source.

105
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,320
And don't drag me into it.

106
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,400
That calls for a quick resolution.

107
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Where are you going?

108
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,000
To find the source,

109
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,800
my dear brother.

110
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,400
We can't wait any longer.

111
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,560
The longer we wait, the worse it gets.

112
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,760
We just wanted to protect you then.

113
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,360
So we decided to show goodwill
to buy some time.

114
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,040
Little did I expect them to be this eager.

115
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
What do we do after this?

116
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,600
The Black-Robed Man, Mo Shenhai,
and Chief Wu.

117
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,160
We must defeat them one by one.

118
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,600
Otherwise, they will collude,

119
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,750
making it hard to deal with.

120
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,760
I might be able to handle Mo Shenhai.

121
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,040
How?

122
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,480
He gets to control Chief Wu

123
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,880
because

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,640
he's had a lot of bribery evidence

125
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,360
and the ledger used to frame our parents
for opium smuggling.

126
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,200
It's all in his safe.

127
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,080
I'll find a way to steal it.

128
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,320
By then,

129
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,640
they'll turn on each other like dogs.

130
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,360
Alright.

131
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,800
But be careful.

132
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,800
Mo Shenhai is nothing but cunning.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,270
I'm afraid he might be on guard.

134
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,840
Take Chongming with you.

135
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,120
Yes.

136
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,680
Well, Yuzi,

137
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,480
I'm off.

138
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,550
Call me if you need anything.

139
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,200
Sure.

140
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,040
Yunshu.

141
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,820
I've reheated the food for you.

142
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,750
Eat it while it's warm.

143
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,560
Thank you.

144
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,040
Do you have something to say to me?

145
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,560
Well...

146
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,880
Yunshu.

147
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Do you want to kill me?

148
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,720
Why would I want to kill you?

149
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,960
Yunshu.

150
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,240
Stop feigning ignorance.

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,080
The poison you've had

152
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,320
makes you want to kill the one you like.

153
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,920
Do you like me?

154
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,960
Of course I like you.

155
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,800
If not, would I let you stay here?

156
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,360
I'm talking about romantic love.

157
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,360
What are you thinking?

158
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,120
I'll never fall in love again.

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What about Aojue?

160
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,920
No matter what,

161
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,240
in my heart,

162
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
I'm already married.

163
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,360
My husband died for me.

164
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,480
So I'll never marry again.

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,760
You're lying!

166
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,920
You like Aojue, not me, right?

167
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,280
I don't know if I like Aojue.

168
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,040
But I know

169
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,320
I like you.

170
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,760
I see you as a brother.

171
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,680
You shielded me from harm.

172
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,680
You help and care about me.

173
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,600
You make what I like to eat.

174
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,520
I, Dan Yunshu, will never forget that.

175
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,280
You'll always
be my favourite little brother.

176
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,760
No one can replace you.

177
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,300
I don't want to be your little brother.

178
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,840
I like you.

179
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,600
What's the difference

180
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,800
between sibling love and romantic love?

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,160
They're not the same.

182
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,200
And you know that.

183
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,600
Don't tell me

184
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,720
you just want to sleep with me.

185
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,160
Yunshu.

186
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,440
What are you talking about?

187
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm not that kind of man.

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,910
I was just teasing you.

189
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,880
I never expected you
to be old-fashioned.

190
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,860
It's not that I never thought about it.

191
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,350
You can have a lot of family members.

192
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,410
But there's one true love.

193
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,880
I want to be your only one.

194
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,960
Why are you staring at me like that?

195
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,480
Now that you say that,

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,920
I really do want to kill you.

197
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,040
Is that true?

198
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,160
Are you happy?

199
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,400
Are you sure the Wanlong Chamber
of Commerce ledger is here?

200
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,520
I'm not sure.

201
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,520
We can sneak in.

202
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,600
But we must find out

203
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,040
where he placed the ledger.

204
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,560
So we'll have to wait until nightfall.

205
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,240
No need.

206
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,800
Hold on me.

207
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,000
Here we are.

208
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,520
There are people coming and going.

209
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,600
It's easy to get caught.

210
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,000
I think we should act at night.

211
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,200
Why didn't you say so sooner?

212
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,600
Let's go.

213
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,960
Be patient.

214
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,200
You'll get us caught.

215
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,360
This is fine.

216
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,840
Chongming.

217
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes?

218
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,680
Your chest is pretty firm.

219
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,280
Hands off.

220
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,240
♪You show up behind me♪

221
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,040
♪And that beautiful moment
stops in time♪

222
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,670
♪Things are easily forgotten with time♪

223
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,310
♪Fireworks don't understand the sorrow
of the world♪

224
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,910
♪They light up the clouds in the dark♪

225
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:53,830
♪Hoping to reflect in your eyes♪

226
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:58,920
Sir.

227
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,520
It's been two days.

228
00:11:00,705 --> 00:11:02,480
What do we do about Shan Yunshu?

229
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,640
You'll get to enjoy the show

230
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,880
in just a few days.

231
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,600
I've got everything ready.

232
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,960
As long as she dares show up,
she won't get to run away.

233
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,040
My only concern

234
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,520
are her two bodyguards.

235
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,360
Chief Wu.

236
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,520
The Black-Robed Master

237
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,600
has set up the Anti-Dragon Formation
in this secret chamber of mine.

238
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,860
So, what's there to panic about?

239
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,880
Sir.

240
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,470
A woman downstairs says
she wants to see you.

241
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,080
A woman?

242
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,200
Is it Shan Yunshu?

243
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,720
No.

244
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,720
It's a rather unchaste woman.

245
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,440
An unchaste woman?

246
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:40,960
I'm not seeing her.

247
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,760
Sir!

248
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,240
Do you not know
how to describe a woman properly?

249
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,520
I hate it when people call me unchaste.

250
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,280
Who are you?

251
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,560
What do you want?

252
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,160
I'm here to pass on a message.

253
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,800
Aofeng is to come
to the Dragon King Temple tonight.

254
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,520
Did you hear me?

255
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,240
Here.

256
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,360
Let's have a drink.

257
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,680
I remember we first met each other

258
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,800
on a night just like this.

259
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,990
You were curled up in Aunt Zhang's arms.

260
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,240
Don't bring up my mother!

261
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
So you want to save her
with the Dragon Pearl?

262
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,360
That's not all of it.

263
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,160
Then why didn't you just ask me for it?

264
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,640
I could've given it to you.

265
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,560
I did it for so many times.

266
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,000
But you said

267
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,750
the Dragon Pearl was a sacred relic
of the Dragon Clan.

268
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,200
It was above all else.

269
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,320
Birth, aging,
sickness, and death were part of life.

270
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,280
Anyway, in your eyes,

271
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,560
the Dragon Clan
and the Dragon Pearl matter most.

272
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,080
Ever since your mother's passing,

273
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,720
I've treated you like my own brother.

274
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,600
I taught you spells and lived with you.

275
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,600
What more do you want?

276
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,920
I know, Aojue.

277
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,120
Apart from my mother,

278
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,680
you're the best to me.

279
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,360
But do you know

280
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,840
how my mother died?

281
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,880
To spare the Dragon King from disgrace

282
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,240
and safeguard the Dragon Clan's name,

283
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,160
they killed the woman he loved most.

284
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,240
Aojue.

285
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,480
How could I forget that?

286
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,160
How could I forget my mother's pain?

287
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,000
How could I forget the hopelessness
in her eyes as she died?

288
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,000
That was betrayal!

289
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,280
If it were your mother

290
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,600
or Shan Yunshu,

291
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,840
could you forget it?

292
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,160
So you want to use the Dragon Pearl

293
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,560
to wipe out the Dragon Clan, right?

294
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,480
Yes.

295
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,480
Including me?

296
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,400
I've let you go so many times.

297
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,280
Don't you forget that.

298
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,890
It's painful, isn't it?

299
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,160
Let me tell you.

300
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,160
This is how it feels

301
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,520
when the one you love most
wants you dead.

302
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,800
It's exactly how my mother felt
before she died!

303
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,720
If I could forget that,

304
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,160
may lightning strike me down.

305
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,240
If your mother were watching from above,

306
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,920
she'd be heartbroken

307
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,200
seeing you in this state.

308
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,520
She sent you all the way
to the Dragon Clan

309
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,880
to give you a good life.

310
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,800
Now you're blinded by hatred.

311
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,840
You've killed
the only one who loves you.

312
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,520
Since she's gone, nothing is left.

313
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,560
Aofeng.

314
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,480
I will never let you hurt Shan Yunshu.

315
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,240
Well...

316
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,520
You've fallen for her?

317
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,600
Yes.

318
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,720
If so,

319
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,920
she will end up like my mother.

320
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,120
Do you really not know
how your mother died?

321
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,280
Come back with me now.

322
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,600
I'll protect you.

323
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,680
Enough.

324
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,720
You said the same thing decades ago.

325
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,200
To the Dragon Clan,

326
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,400
I'm a mere outsider.

327
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,000
I've been looked down on and humiliated.

328
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,440
The Dragon Clan is in decline now.

329
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,520
There's no point bringing up the past!

330
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,240
Indeed.

331
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,480
If I hadn't killed them,

332
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,400
how would the Dragon Clan have declined?

333
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,080
What?

334
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,640
Otherwise,

335
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,360
how do you think
you've been the Crown Prince

336
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
until now?

337
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,360
Such a rundown place.

338
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,480
Could the ledger really be here?

339
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,720
Knowing Mo Shenhai,

340
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,560
he must believe the most dangerous place

341
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,680
is also the safest.

342
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,360
That old geezer really did
stash a fortune in here.

343
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,640
Chongming.

344
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,480
Yes?

345
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,360
Can you use a spell

346
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,390
to make it all disappear?

347
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:57,880
I can't.

348
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,000
How could you be so vulgar?

349
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,360
Then chant a spell

350
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,520
to locate the ledger.

351
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,680
I can't.

352
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,600
You can't do

353
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,440
anything at all.

354
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,520
You're a good-for-nothing.

355
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,680
As a man, never say you can't.

356
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,550
Didn't you know that?

357
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,680
Stop nagging.

358
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,680
Find the ledger already.

359
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,060
(Ledger)

360
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,280
