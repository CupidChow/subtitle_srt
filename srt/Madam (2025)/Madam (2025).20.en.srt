Mingkai!

Mingkai!

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,160
Yunshu,

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,080
I'd finally done something for you.

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,120
Don't talk.

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,440
I can definitely save you.

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,160
In my next life...

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,960
In my next life,

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,840
please

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,040
go on

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
a date with me.

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,120
Mingkai?

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,920
Mingkai!

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,040
It's all my fault.

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,920
I encountered Black-robed Man
when I was pursuing Mo Shenhai's men.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,880
That's why I'm late.

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,200
It depends on him

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,960
whether or not he can survive.

26
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,000
One more mark has faded away.

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,160
Seems like the pact is getting weaker.

28
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,720
Mingkai,

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,640
I shouldn't have doubted you.

31
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,480
You have to wake up.

32
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,720
Show yourself.

33
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,440
Aofeng.

34
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,600
I knew you were here.

35
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,960
How does it feel to lose
two of your loved ones?

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,920
You owe me two lives now.

37
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,360
You better be a good girl.

38
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,960
If not, you'll lose even more.

39
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,480
I'll make you

40
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,800
pay for them.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,960
Aren't you overestimating yourself here?

42
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,800
The Dragon Pact only has one mark left.

43
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,280
What gives you the confidence

44
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,360
to think that you can deal with
both Aojue and Chongming at once?

45
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,880
How dare you provoke me?

46
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,200
Provoke you?

47
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,400
This is just the interest
of the pain you've brought upon me.

48
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,080
You better think carefully.

49
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,160
Try to go against my will,

50
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,200
and your brother and Chongming
will be summoned here immediately.

51
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,400
Now, may we talk?

52
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,560
What are you up to?

53
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,680
I wish to negotiate a deal with you.

54
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,280
With the Dragon Pearl?

55
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,320
Yes.

56
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
For what?

57
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,160
Mingkai's life.

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,640
Is his life

59
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,280
more important than yours?

60
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,640
I've owed him too much.

61
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,400
What if Aojue and
Zhang Mingkai died at the same time

62
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,960
while I could only rescue one of them?

63
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,880
Whom do you

64
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,600
wish for me to rescue?

65
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,400
Seems like you're concerned
about our relationship.

66
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
If he dies,

67
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,400
you'll remember him forever.

68
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,280
Isn't that pretty good?

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,960
If he survives,

70
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,840
I'll never forget him as well.

71
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,240
Do you know what
the Dragon Pearl mean to you?

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
Of course I know.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,720
Aren't you afraid that I might
go against my promise?

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,760
That's why

75
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,320
I wish to form a pact with you.

76
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,360
You can have the Dragon Pearl
as long as you promise me three things.

77
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh.

78
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,760
What three things?

79
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,720
Firstly,

80
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
save Mingkai.

81
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,320
Secondly,

82
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,920
do not harm the people I love.

83
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,520
Thirdly,

84
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,440
leave Mo City and never come back

85
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
after obtaining the Dragon Pearl.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,110
You're sacrificing yourself

87
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,160
to protect the people you love, huh?

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,320
Are you that naive?

89
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,120
I'm not being naive here.

90
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,200
You should be more pragmatic.

91
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,360
Once the pact vanishes,

92
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,330
you'll have no chance
to obtain the Dragon Pearl.

93
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,160
Ha ha.

94
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,360
If only I could witness
Aojue's pain and suffering

95
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,940
upon knowing that you're sacrificing
yourself for another man's sake.

96
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,320
They'll return soon.

97
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,080
Come with me.

98
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,120
Madam's bed is untouched.

99
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,280
I suppose she left last night.

100
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,320
Mo Shenhai's body is missing as well.

101
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,320
That girl,

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,090
she always thought
that she was the world's savior.

103
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,840
I have to teach her a lesson
for her self-assertion in the future.

104
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,520
Are you sure Aofeng didn't abduct her?

105
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,600
If Madam was abducted,

106
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,040
there should be signs of a struggle.

107
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,840
And, the Dragon Pact is still intact.

108
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,320
It's impossible.

109
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
According to Yuzi's letter,

110
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,280
she's going to seek
the truth behind the Dragon Pact.

111
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,240
What does that mean?

112
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,200
She did say that she saw the things
that I, Chongming, and Black-robed Man

113
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,280
had done behind her back
in the Dragon Pact.

114
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,380
Zhang Mingkai wasn't supposed
to appear in the pact.

115
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,440
Logically speaking,

116
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,780
only those who form the pact
should be recorded.

117
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,040
Are you saying

118
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,690
Yuzi had already found out
that Zhang Mingkai is Black-robed Man?

119
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,000
I...

120
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,000
Both Aojue

121
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,200
and Aofeng

122
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,040
have a pact with the Dragon Pearl.

123
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,000
And,

124
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,920
the Dragon Pact will record
all of our actions

125
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,840
until the pact is dissolved.

126
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
If Madam intentionally sent us away,

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,400
that means she must've found out
some sort of secrets.

128
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,320
I'm afraid it isn't that simple.

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,980
That girl is trying
to do something silly again.

130
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,720
To dissolve the pact,

131
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,280
one must activate the great formation
with dragon's blood.

132
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,360
Last night, I fed Zhang Mingkai
my blood to save him.

133
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,640
Madam is in danger.

134
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,480
Let's split up and act.

135
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:43,840
Okay.

136
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,520
Let's go.

137
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,490
Why aren't they out yet?

138
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,330
It's crowded.

139
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,060
Yeah.

140
00:07:51,377 --> 00:07:52,490
Why are they taking pictures?

141
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,840
Judging from this, I suppose we can't enter
from the main entrance.

142
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,600
What are you doing?

143
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,360
I don't have any powers now.

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,520
I cannot teleport.

145
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,200
I know this.

146
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,760
Just watch and learn.

147
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,600
Shu!

148
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,000
Shu!

149
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Is this a hidden tunnel?

150
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,240
That's right.

151
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,240
When I was an assassin,

152
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,490
it was inconvenient
for me to use the main entrance.

153
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,880
I could only use this tunnel.

154
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,600
You're looking for me

155
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,600
not just for Zhang Mingkai's sake, right?

156
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,520
Who exactly are you?

157
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,120
What's with that question?

158
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,880
I once entered
the Dragon Pact's illusory realm.

159
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,280
I saw something
that I'd never seen before.

160
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,480
Oh?

161
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,920
What have you seen, then?

162
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,600
How did you control
Zhang Mingkai to spy on me?

163
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,400
You found out, huh?

164
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200
Was his death

165
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,080
part of your plan?

166
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,000
No.

167
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,560
That was his own will.

168
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,040
Mo Shenhai betrayed me.

169
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,600
Seems like Zhang Mingkai

170
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,640
truly cared about you.

171
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,600
You poisoned me

172
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,840
and the masses

173
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,920
just to get rid of Aojue.

174
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,520
Do you hate him that much?

175
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,680
Why should I?

176
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,840
As his younger brother,
I have no complaints.

177
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,160
What I hate is
the Dragon Clan behind him.

178
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,590
I wish to eradicate the Dragon Clan.

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,760
However, as long as Aojue is around,
the Dragon Clan will never fall.

180
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,990
It's just like how you hate
Wanlong Chamber of Commerce.

181
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,720
As long as Mo Shenhai is still around,

182
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,470
Wanlong Chamber of Commerce
will never fall.

183
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,720
So,

184
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,320
I'm sure you understand my feelings.

185
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,640
I'm different from you.

186
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,080
Mo Shenhai killed my parents.

187
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,920
Wanlong Chamber of Commerce is his base.

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,400
I wish to destroy
Wanlong Chamber of Commerce.

189
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,000
However, I won't harm the innocent.

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,800
Your father murdered
Mo Shenhai's father.

191
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,040
Mo Shenhai avenged his father
by murdering your father.

192
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,720
Now,

193
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,000
you've murdered Mo Shenhai.

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,600
Mo Shenhai has children.

195
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,480
In the future, Mo Shenhai's children
will try to take your life.

196
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,190
Will you offer
your life generously, then?

197
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,320
If I slaughter the entire Dragon Clan
and leave Aojue alive,

198
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,320
it'll only make us sworn enemies.

199
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,080
I would rather kill him

200
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,480
than let him live

201
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,320
as an avatar of vengeance like me.

202
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,480
You're truly a despicable scum.

203
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,800
You're making up an excuse
for your unpardonable crimes.

204
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,400
How did you think I was able to survive

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,240
the past century of torment?

206
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,150
How did you think you were able
to survive the past two decades?

207
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,120
My vengeance is ten times
as much as yours.

208
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,880
This secret tunnel is well-developed.

209
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,360
Mo Shenhai had run
this place for many years.

210
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,580
Even I couldn't fully comprehend
the complexity of this place.

211
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,710
You didn't dare to look at me
in broad daylight.

212
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,520
What's wrong?

213
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,920
Are you getting bolder

214
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,350
just because it's dark in here?

215
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,800
Are you an owl now?

216
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,400
Regarding what happened that night,

217
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,640
why don't we talk about it?

218
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,120
I said it already.

219
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,990
I don't need you
to bear responsibility for it.

220
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,480
You're carefree and straightforward.

221
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,200
You're different from Yunshu
when it comes to that.

222
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
You see,

223
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,240
she's only devoted to one man.

224
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,600
What's wrong?

225
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,040
Can you stop comparing me to my sister?

226
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,000
Are you jealous of your sister?

227
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,480
You can court my sister

228
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,320
if you like her.

229
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,960
Stop being long-winded.

230
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,160
I couldn't even court you,

231
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,840
let alone your sister.

232
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,720
You're a few hundred
years old, you know?

233
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,850
I'm sure you've seen
all kinds of women before.

234
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
I think

235
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,320
you shouldn't have become an assassin.

236
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,520
You should've become a writer.

237
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,760
Humans have a short lifespan.

238
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,960
You guys are only concerned with
reproduction and survival.

239
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,160
Unlike us non-humans.

240
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,480
We have a long lifespan.

241
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,040
We're different from
what you imagine us to be.

242
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,480
Am I worthy?

243
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,880
I suppose.

244
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,800
I guess I'm your boyfriend now.

245
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,590
There's one more question.

246
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,560
What is it?

247
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,080
I'm a human.

248
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,800
I have a short lifespan.

249
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
I'll grow old.

250
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,520
I'll die.

251
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,280
If so, I'll find you again

252
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,520
once you've reincarnated.

253
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,460
I'll make you fall for me again.

254
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,160
Don't get ahead of yourself here.

255
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,960
I haven't fallen for you
in this lifetime yet.

256
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,490
Now, you're talking about my next life?

257
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,520
Do you love Zhang Mingkai?

258
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,560
The kind of love between sexes.

259
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,720
I love him, but it's not the kind
of love between sexes.

260
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,080
Mingkai had a rough upbringing.

261
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,080
I promised him

262
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,000
that I would be his kin

263
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,960
as long as I'm alive.

264
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,680
Someone was living here indeed.

265
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,840
Judging from my understanding
of Mo Shenhai,

266
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,760
I don't think he was living here.

267
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,720
Madam?

268
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,440
Look over there.

269
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,560
That's the Soul Possession Spell

270
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,940
that blurs the line
between real and false.

271
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
(Aofeng.)

272
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
(Zhang Mingkai.)

273
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,640
(He visited Shan Yunshu before)

274
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,600
(when I was still inside the pact.)

275
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Aofeng,

276
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
what are you up to?

277
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,120
Hurry and rescue Mingkai.

278
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,880
Yunshu,

279
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,600
Aofeng is Zhang Mingkai.

280
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,880
Zhang Mingkai is Aofeng.

281
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,920
As long as you like it,

282
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,480
I can be Zhang Mingkai forever.

283
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,200
So,

284
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,840
you didn't control Zhang Mingkai.

285
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,920
You were just lying to me all along.

286
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,120
All of that no longer matters.

287
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,640
Most importantly, I fancy you.

288
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,760
I've fallen for you.

289
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,360
You lied to me.

290
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,200
You said you would forgive me.

291
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,920
I didn't lie to you.

292
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,680
That was for Zhenxuan.

293
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,360
If you survive this,

294
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,640
we'll be even.

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,800
Yunshu,

296
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,520
I knew you loved me.

297
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,360
Can you please give me one more chance?

298
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,320
Dumb Aofeng.
