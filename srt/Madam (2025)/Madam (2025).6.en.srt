Zhenxuan,

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,080
you're finally here
to see me in my dream.

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,240
I missed you so much.

15
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,480
Look closely.

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,640

Why didn't you come and visit me?

00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,720
You still blame me for it,

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,560
don't you?

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,880
Let go of me.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,680
I won't.

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,560
Don't undress me!

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,600
Don't do it!

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,880
Don't do it...

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,120
I won't leave.

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,320
I don't trust you.

29
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:33,480
Unless you give me your guarantee.

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,990
Give you my guarantee?

31
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,080
How?

32
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:38,280
Give me something as a mortgage.

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,400

Although Long'er
has an eccentric personality,

43
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,280
I can tell

44
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,840
that he's a nice person.

Sir, thank you for sparing me.

66
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,640
You didn't kill me in one blow.

67
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,700
You're quite intelligent, aren't you?

68
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,720

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,990
You're the chief
of Mo City Police Department.

73
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,480
I don't care what you have to do.

74
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,320
I want to see Shan Yunshu's body!

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,360
Sir, please be appeased.

76
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,470
I'll come up with a solution.

77
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,840
Scram!

78
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,680
Yes, sir!

79
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,360
Hen,

80
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,960
follow him.

81
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,520
I've lost confidence
in Wu Xin's ability.

82
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,120
Understood.

83
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,200
You're here.

84
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,360

85
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,320
don't you feel like

86
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,880
our organs no longer feel like ours

87
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,480
after we were bound

88
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,280
by the pact?

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,720
What organs?

90
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,560
For example,

91
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,080
our heart,

92
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,120
livers, spleen,
lungs, kidneys, and so on.

93
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,890
I already told you
that dragons are lusty creatures.

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,210
Don't tell me you fell for her.

95
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

96
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,240
I...

97
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,120
How could I ever fall for her?

98
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,020
Have you ever heard of the phrase

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,120
Leaping Over the Dragon Gate?

100
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,720
Yunshu,

101
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,080
I'm here to visit you.

102
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,630
I've already acquired
the intel you needed.

103
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,560
Leaping Over the Dragon Gate?

104
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,000
What is he up to?

105
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,400
Yunshu,

106
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,310
this is all the information
you requested.

107
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,910
According to
the descriptions you gave me,

108
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,430
I've put together a list of profiles
that might belong to your sister.

109
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,490
So, you have a younger sister?

110
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,340
That's right.

111
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,380
My younger sister
was abducted in the past.

112
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,210
I was thinking
that she must be still alive.

113
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,680
Mo Shenhai did raise quite
a lot of orphans all these years.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,990
He raised them
to be his trusted aides or assassins.

115
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,560
They usually perform assassinations

116
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,960
or act as spies.

117
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,560
That's how Mo Shenhai was able

118
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,940
to stay dominant all these years.

119
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,940
I'll check the profiles closely.

120
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,790
Let me join you.

121
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,360
Buddy,

122
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,640
I was looking for you.

123
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,560
You...

124
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,280
What do you want?

125
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,280
Come with me.

126
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:28,920
You!

127
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,240
Ao, didn't I tell you already?

128
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,840
Yunshu and I have a common enemy now.

129
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,600
We're in the same boat.

130
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,640
You two are her bodyguards.

131
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,280
We're on the same side.

132
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,480
Say one more word,

133
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,240
and I'll make sure
you never speak again.

134
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,530
Understood.

135
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,120
Goodbye.

136
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,760
Wait.

137
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,480
I...

138
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:56,960
Ao?

139
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
Ao, where did you go?

140
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,200
Stop joking with me.

141
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,590
This place is 50 li away
from Mo City, you know?

142
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,280
Ao?

143
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,000
Aojue!

144
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,760
You scum!

145
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,960
Madam, you're here.

146
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,720
Mr. Li.

147
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,590
Has everything been running smoothly
at the shop lately?

148
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:18,850
Madam.

149
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,290
Report this to the chief.

150
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:19,790
Everything's normal.

151
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,160
Tell him

152
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:20,630
Please don't worry.

153
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,510
that Shan Yunshu has appeared.

154
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:21,880
Yes, sir.

155
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,220
(Opening the Dragon Gate,
Leaping Over the Dragon Gate)

156
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,880
Leaping Over the Dragon Gate?

157
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,960
I ripped this note

158
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,880
from the Secret Dragon Pearl Manual.

159
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,680
It states

160
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,360
the nine dragons are formed

161
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,750
through the opening
of the Heavenly Gate.

162
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,240
When a dragon dies,

163
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,680
the Dragon Gate

164
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,000
will be open.

165
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,160
By then, the person who can
leap through the Dragon Gate,

166
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,320
is able

167
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,400
to turn into a real dragon.

168
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,400
However, Aojue is powerful.

169
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,600
I might not be able to kill him
even with my full power.

170
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,960
You're right.

171
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,400
However, someone else
is able to kill him.

172
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,320
Are you referring

173
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,320
to Shan Yunshu?

174
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,120
That's right.

175
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,580
Aojue gave Shan Yunshu
his Heart-Protecting Scale

176
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,480
just to protect her.

177
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,000
In this world,

178
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,560
one can only kill a dragon using

179
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,880
either a Dragon Pearl

180
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,520
or a Heartscale.

181
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,400
As long as we manipulate the fact

182
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,920
that Shan Yunshu
is under his protection,

183
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,360
he shall

184
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,560
deliver a fatal blow to himself.

185
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,160
By then,

186
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,520
you can turn into a dragon

187
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,690
while I can retrieve
the Dragon Pearl I desired.

188
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,000
It's a win-win situation.

189
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,000
What are you doing here?

190
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,240
I intend to make a decision.

191
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,680
What are you doing here, then?

192
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,100
I copied and studied
the Spirit-Gathering Formation.

193
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,350
I want to see if I can find a force
that can counteract the restriction.

194
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,830
You've already given Shan Yunshu
your Heart-Protecting Scale.

195
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,000
Now, you want to use the formation
to counteract the restriction?

196
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,750
These two are conflicting actions.

197
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,560
So what?

198
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,750
It's none of your business.

199
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,480
Did something unbeknownst to me happen

200
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,600
after we got drunk that night?

201
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,080
Huh?

202
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,400
Nothing happened.

203
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,670
Your Highness, your expression
has already betrayed you.

204
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,080
What are you up to?

205
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,400
Today, I'll see for myself
how powerful you are.

206
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,320
(Everything is within my control.)

207
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,800
(Aojue,)

208
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,840
(you'll die here today.)

209
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,840
Chief Wu, you've graced us
with your presence.

210
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,240
Sorry for our impoliteness.

211
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,280
Mrs. Shan,

212
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,760
where are your bodyguards?

213
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,640
They aren't around.

214
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,910
Chief, may I know
why you're looking for them?

215
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,890
Why I'm looking for them?

216
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,120
You're asking the obvious here.

217
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,080
The police station
was raided two days ago.

218
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,760
I suspect that your bodyguards
were in cahoots with the robbers.

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,430
They launched a two-pronged attack

220
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,800
to raid the police station.

221
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,590
Chief, I'm afraid
this is a misunderstanding.

222
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,000
The robbers were sent by Mo Shenhai.

223
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,490
They were also the ones who killed
my steward and stepmother.

224
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,240
I've already explained
the underlying reasons to Detective Zhang.

225
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,960
What evidence do you have, then?

226
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,000
Evidence?

227
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,520
Chief,

228
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,240
I'm the victim here.

229
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,260
Aren't you guys from the police station

230
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,040
responsible for
procuring crime evidence?

231
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,800
You're accusing someone of a crime,

232
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,800
but you don't have
any substantial evidence.

233
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,120
If so, please come with us

234
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,920
and explain yourself
in the police station.

235
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,920
What?

236
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,670
Do you intend to go against the law?

237
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,320
All of you, stand back.

238
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,520
I'll follow him there and return soon.

239
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,460
You guys should look after
the shop and the pier.

240
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,520
All right, Madam.

241
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,600
Let's go.

242
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,800
Chief Wu,

243
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,120
I don't think this is the road
to the police station.

244
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,960
We have something else to do.

245
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,280
Just mind your own business.

246
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,400
Chief,

247
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,940
the path ahead is blocked off by trees.

248
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,240
Let's take a detour.

249
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes, sir.

250
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,840
Cover me!

251
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,160
Nobody moves!

252
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,120
Stand up.

253
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,360
Mingkai!

254
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,920
Mingkai!

255
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,080
I already told you.
You were no match for me.

256
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,280
I've underestimated you indeed.

257
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,360
Don't tell me you challenged me
for Shan Yunshu's sake.

258
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,960
What if that's the case?

259
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,630
Your Highness, you can't keep anything
to yourself, can you?

260
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,280
What I desire

261
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,600
is your Dragon Pearl.

262
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,000
This is bad.

263
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,320
This is bad.

264
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,720
Yunshu,

265
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,240
are you okay?

266
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,080
Do not speak.

267
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,810
I'll send you
to the hospital right away.

268
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,720
Yunshu.

269
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,280
Am I going to die?

270
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,800
Can you give me a kiss?

271
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,560
This way, I can rest in peace.

272
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Do you know something?

273
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,520
This is my first time seeing you
this close in person.

274
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,160
This feels nice.

275
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,240
Stop saying silly things.

276
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,800
You still stand a chance to survive.

277
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,440
Yunshu,

278
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,160
can't you even fulfill my dying wish?

279
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,760
I forgot about that.

280
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,240
You're quite the actor, aren't you?

281
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,040
I almost fell for it.

282
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,830
Why didn't you go for an audition?

283
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,510
Hurry and get up.

284
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,000
This is great.

285
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,290
The killer has finally been
brought to justice.

286
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,240
Yunshu,

287
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,440
you can rest at ease now.

288
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,760
Let's head back.

289
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,440
Are you okay?

290
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Sorry, Madam.

291
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,560
We were late.

292
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,280
