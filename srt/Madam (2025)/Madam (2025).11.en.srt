=Episode 11=

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,640
I knew you weren't human.

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,920
What has she promised you guys
for you all to swear loyalty to her?

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,800
Young girl,

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,960
the more you know,

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,800
the faster you'll meet your demise.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,640
I don't like dead flesh.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,240
I like living flesh.

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,800
It's fresh.

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,000
Yuhan, how do you feel?

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,600
I feel much better now.

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,560
Don't worry.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,820
I was chatting with her
about yesterday's incident.

20
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,760
You should've taken
a longer break, you know?

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,320
I'm worried about her.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,880
Chongming is doing
a good job looking after me.

23
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,140
There's no need to worry.

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,880
Yuhan, I'm truly honored

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,800
by your acknowledgment.

26
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,560
You two are quite close already, huh?

27
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:32,680
Are you hungry?

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,940
Do you want some food?

29
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,860
I'll make some for you.

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,840
Do you want steamed food or fried food?

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,280
She can

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,880
make both.

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,960
Chongming does know me

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,400
the best.

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,520
What exactly happened?

36
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,500
Such a huge incident has occurred

37
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,480
right when I was away.

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,160
It's a long story.

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,080
Why don't I move here
and keep you company?

40
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,200
At least I can protect you.

41
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,550
I can't rest at ease
when you're in danger.

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,600
I was reckless yesterday.

43
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,760
I injured Mo Shenhai.

44
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,830
I'm afraid it won't be
that easy to clean up the mess.

45
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,560
What?

46
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,800
You guys injured Mo Shenhai?

47
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,200
You were harmed before this.

48
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,040
I suspect that Mo Shenhai sent
the mysterious figure as a warning.

49
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,840
I instructed Aojue to injure him.

50
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,040
But Ao,

51
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,320
it was better if he killed him outright.

52
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,840
Now, he's half-dead.

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,440
This is most troublesome.

54
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,640
Some people think
that she's the savior of the world.

55
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,680
My parents were framed by Mo Shenhai.

56
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,620
The Mo family was wronged for 20 years.

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,120
I desire Mo Shenhai's death
more than anyone else.

58
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,920
However, if he dies,

59
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,640
it'll be difficult
to clear my parent's names.

60
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,840
And,

61
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
I've already Yuhan my promise.

62
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,160
This time, I spared him.

63
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,120
In the future, we're even.

64
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,920
If so, what should we do now?

65
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,600
Let's observe the situation

66
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,960
and deal with it accordingly.

67
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,720
Let's eat first.

68
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's eat first.

69
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,630
This time, you should live with us
for a few more days.

70
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,580
Let me take care of you.

71
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,320
This won't do.

72
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,280
If I do live here,

73
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,040
Mo Shenhai might try to harm you again.

74
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,660
You should let me head back.

75
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,280
Maybe the conflict
can be resolved peacefully.

76
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,160
It's fine.

77
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,000
You just need to look after yourself.

78
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,200
Mo Shenhai

79
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,920
doesn't dare to act against me.

80
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,200
Yuzi,

81
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,880
can you do me a favor?

82
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,160
Go ahead.

83
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,760
It's inconvenient for me
to move around due to my injury.

84
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,680
Can you send me a bodyguard?

85
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,320
Okay.

86
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,480
Who do you desire?

87
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,240
Him.

88
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,560
Okay.

89
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,880
Chongming,

90
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,480
from tomorrow onward,

91
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,760
you'll serve my sister.

92
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,780
You can return
after she has fully recovered.

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,040
Yes, Madam.

94
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,320
I'm done eating.

95
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,960
Yunshu, I'll return to the police station

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,710
and see if Mo Shenhai
has lodged a police report.

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,610
I'll make a move first.

98
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,600
Okay.

99
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,000
Yuzi, I'm done eating as well.

100
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,400
I'll pack my belongings.

101
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

102
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,920
Do you need my help?

103
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,560
No.

104
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,720
Please tell Chongming to help me.

105
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,200
Chongming.

106
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,680
Help my sister to her room.

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,160
Thank you, Chongming.

108
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,480
Long'er,

109
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,960
I'm here to deliver dumplings to you.

110
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,760
Open the door.

111
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,280
Long'er.

112
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,080
Are you still angry at me?

113
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,240
It was my fault yesterday.

114
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,800
I shouldn't have said that about you.

115
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,000
I knew you did it for my sake.

116
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,000
Let me apologize to you.

117
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,900
You should come out and eat.

118
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,000
Now, you're a mortal.

119
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,240
You'll starve if you don't eat.

120
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,520
That's none of your business.

121
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,640
Long'er,

122
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,480
that's enough of you.

123
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,000
You're a grown man.

124
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,240
You're the dragon prince,

125
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,870
yet you're holding a grudge
against a woman like me.

126
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,190
If people hear about this,
they'll think that you're petty.

127
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,200
Is he not inside?

128
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,560
I'll leave the dumplings outside, then.

129
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,320
Your Highness,

130
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,990
you're finally willing to show yourself.

131
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,960
You're acting like
a petty woman, you know?

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,990
Are you here to apologize
or make me angry again?

133
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,080
Fine.

134
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,960
I'll stop talking.

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,200
You should hurry and eat up.

136
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,880
I'm not eating.

137
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,960
I'm not hungry.

138
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,000
Hurry and eat.

139
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,040
Stop being stubborn.

140
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,700
Do you know your fault now?

141
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,560
I do.

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,960
What's your fault, then?

143
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,400
Whatever you say

144
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,360
will be my fault.

145
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,280
Look at you.

146
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,040
You're doing this on purpose.

147
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,720
You care about that man.

148
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,640
You care about your sister.

149
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,200
You care about
any random strangers on the road.

150
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,140
But you don't care about me at all.

151
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,960
Who said so?

152
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,600
Of course I care about you.

153
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,880
I knew that you were hungry.

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,620
That's why I delivered dumplings to you.

155
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,560
You vent your frustrations
on me every time.

156
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,480
It's either you humiliate me
or punish me.

157
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,160
I'm your bodyguard,

158
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
not your fault.

159
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,800
If you keep this up, I'll resign.

160
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,120
Fine, fine.

161
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,440
I'll care more about you in the future.

162
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,640
I'll consider your feelings.

163
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,560
Prove yourself.

164
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,890
I'll do it next time.

165
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,880
Shan Yunshu.

166
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:42,080
What's the matter?

167
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,110
Someone has reported you
for committing homicide.

168
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,080
Come with us.

169
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,600
It's fine.

170
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,120
Finish the dumplings first.

171
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,440
Are you here to steal the record?

172
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,680
This beef jerky is excellent.

173
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,440
Give it a try.

174
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,280
Don't try to shift the topic.

175
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,200
Where did you keep the record

176
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,120
after stealing it?

177
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,800
I destroyed it.

178
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,990
What else did you think
I could do with it?

179
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,480
This cotton candy is delicious too.

180
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,190
I'm sure you never tried it before.

181
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,680
You're so loyal

182
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,720
to Mo Shenhai.

183
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,880
You even resorted to
betraying your own sister.

184
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,760
Chongming,

185
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,200
Yuzi sent you here to look after me,

186
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,560
not to interrogate me.

187
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,380
Don't you agree?

188
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,080
Are you trying

189
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,280
to get me away from your sister

190
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,480
so that you could launch
a sneak attack on her?

191
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,990
Here's a piece of advice.

192
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,930
Don't waste your effort.

193
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,880
What are you doing?

194
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,400
You may look like a silent person,

195
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,500
but you're much more
talkative than I thought.

196
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,240
Aren't you tired?

197
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,880
Do you like Shan Yunshu?

198
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,560
So what if I do?

199
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,320
So what if I don't?

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,180
That's none of your business.

201
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,080
Everyone in Mo City likes her.

202
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,680
Do you think we look alike?

203
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,680
A little.

204
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,890
Do you like me, then?

205
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,480
I do.

206
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,640
I like to roast you,

207
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,960
dip you in sauces,

208
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,960
steam you, braise you, I like
to cook you in every way.

209
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,880
You're pretty humorous, huh?

210
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,040
But I like you.

211
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,640
Let's go.

212
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,680
Let's have some noodles.

213
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,440
Let go.

214
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,320
Let's go.

215
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,120
Let go of me.

216
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,280
Let's go.

217
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,790
Let go of me.

218
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,920
Why are you dragging me?

219
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,680
Why are you shy with your food?

220
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,520
What's with the outdated mindset?

221
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,800
What exactly are you?

222
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,200
How long can you live?

223
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,400
Are you older than

224
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,720
my grandfather's grandfather?

225
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,320
Shan Yunshu,

226
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,840
last night, someone reported

227
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,280
that you had committed
a homicide at the pier.

228
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,560
Do you confess?

229
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,040
Mo Shenhai lodged the report, right?

230
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,320
I did beat him up last night.

231
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,040
I'm willing to bear the responsibility

232
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,120
and compensation.

233
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,990
It's good
that you're confessing your crime.

234
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,920
I'm just afraid that you can't afford
to bear the responsibility.

235
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,860
Who are these people?

236
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,290
Don't you recognize them?

237
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,480
These are the innocent lives
you allowed your bodyguard to take.

238
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,440
There's a total of seven victims.

239
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,480
Ms. Shan,

240
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,640
don't you think you're too reckless?

241
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,120
You've caused such a bloody tragedy.

242
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,000
Even I can't do anything to help you out.

243
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,440
Mo Shenhai and I were
caught in conflict last night.

244
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,720
However, nobody died.

245
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,640
Even if you wish to frame me,

246
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,560
you should at least have some evidence.

247
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,880
Such audacity.

248
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,670
Are you saying
that I'm framing you here?

249
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,160
What evidence do you have
to prove that I killed all those people?

250
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,760
Seems like you won't admit
your mistake unless it's too late.

251
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,160
Not only do we have evidence,

252
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,790
but we also have witnesses of your crime.

253
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,300
I'll see how you can deny your crime.

254
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,760
May I see the witness?

255
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,680
I never expected you
to hold your liquor this well.

256
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,120
One more cup.

257
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,200
I have to stop.

258
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,400
If you know you're drunk,

259
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,840
you're actually not drunk.

260
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,000
To be honest with you,

261
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,520
after spending so many days with you,

262
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,520
today's the most carefree

263
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,920
and the happiest day I've enjoyed.

264
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,440
Your sister,

265
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,040
she loves you very much.

266
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,700
She devoted a lot of time and effort
just to locate you.

267
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,480
You mustn't

268
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,040
let her down.

269
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,320
Do you care about her that much?

270
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,520
Of course I do.

271
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,760
We have

272
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,280
the Dragon Pearl Pact.

273
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,160
Dragon Pearl?

274
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,320
That's right.

275
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,520
The Dragon Pearl

276
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,200
is the Dragon Clan's sacred treasure.

277
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,080
It can bring the dead to life,

278
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,160
restore flesh to bone,

279
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,600
and contains limitless power.

280
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,640
20 years ago,

281
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,400
it entered
your sister's body by accident.

282
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,640
That's why we became her bodyguards.

283
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,560
I'm protecting her

284
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,160
in order

285
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,000
to retrieve the Dragon Pearl.

286
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,800
Hey!

287
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,240
You told her about
the Dragon Pearl on purpose.

288
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,480
What are you up to?

289
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,680
If you want someone to perish,

290
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,720
you have to make them lose their minds.

291
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,200
I no longer want to keep
Mo Shenhai alive.

292
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,880
I still need him.

293
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,440
I won't allow you to kill him.

294
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,840
What if I exchange his life
for Aojue's life

295
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,480
and the Dragon Pearl?

296
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,520
Back then,

297
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,160
Mr. Mo Shenhai's car was passing by.

298
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,720
Suddenly, a car flipped over.

299
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,240
After that, Shan Yunshu's bodyguard
started beating him and his underlings up.

300
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,790
Not long after that,
she arrived at the scene.

301
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,040
They kept beating him up.

302
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,400
That's what I saw.

303
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,480
Why do you look so pale?

304
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,520
I'm fine.

305
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,960
I just feel unwell.

306
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,160
This time, Mo Shenhai came prepared.

307
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,880
Yunshu, do you have any solutions?

308
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,760
Zhang Mingkai,

309
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,600
what were you murmuring about?

310
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,360
Chief,

311
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
I'm interrogating her.

312
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,280
According to you guys,

313
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,320
you guys only saw

314
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,640
Shan Yunshu and her bodyguard beating
Mo Shenhai and his underlings up, right?

315
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,160
You guys didn't see

316
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,320
that the victims
were killed by them, right?

317
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,360
That's right.

318
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
It was raining back then.

319
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,990
It was a fierce fight as well.

320
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,440
We didn't dare to approach them.

321
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,120
We watched them from afar.

322
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,680
Zhang Mingkai,

323
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
what do you mean by this?

324
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,600
The witness didn't witness the crime.

325
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,720
That doesn't count.

326
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,480
Chief,

327
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm sure you've seen
her bodyguards before.

328
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,580
If they truly intended to kill someone,

329
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,190
they didn't need
to go through all that trouble.

330
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,960
And, judging from the wounds
on the bodies,

331
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,880
it's obvious

332
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,790
that they were killed in a gang fight.

333
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,960
Zhang Mingkai,

334
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,160
looks like you don't want
to work here anymore.

335
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,240
You're twisting the facts
on the culprit's behalf

336
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,400
and manipulating the truth.

337
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,120
Chief, the witness has arrived.

338
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,000
Fine.

339
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,200
You guys

340
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,240
wanted to see the witnesses, right?

341
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,990
I'll clarify things for you all
before your demise.

342
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,560
Bring her in.

343
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,600
Mo Yuhan.

344
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,240
You said you witnessed the crime, right?

345
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,520
That's right.

346
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,520
Mo Yuhan,

347
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,060
you're heartless indeed.

348
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,000
Zhang Mingkai,

349
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
save your breath.

350
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,600
Someone! Take him down!

351
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,840
Mo Yuhan,

352
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,920
you're framing your own sister here.

353
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,840
You're inhumane!

354
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,720
Continue.

355
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,240
Last time,

356
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,240
I saw the culprit

357
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,320
murdering the bodyguards at the pier.

358
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,520
Excellent.

359
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,960
Who's the culprit, then?

360
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,920
It's them.

361
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,560
You're framing us!

362
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,720
You're not mistaken, aren't you?

363
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,840
I saw

364
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
these workers

365
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,880
beating the bodyguards to death.

366
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,200
I met Mr. Mo Shenhai just now.

367
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,480
That's what he said as well.

368
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,000
Did Mr. Mo Shenhai say that?

369
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,920
If you don't trust me,

370
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,960
you can call him.

371
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,120
Take them away.

372
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,740
We'll interrogate them next time.

373
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,500
- Go.
- Go.

374
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,750
- Chief, we're innocent!
- Chief, we're innocent!

375
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,640
Chief!

376
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,800
- Chief!
- We're innocent!

377
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,160
We're innocent!

378
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,360
Chief, we're innocent!

379
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,120
Chief, we're innocent!

380
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,120
Yuhan, do you have something else

381
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,160
to say?

382
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,240
Mr. Mo Shenhai said this.

383
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,520
If you and your bodyguard
go and apologize to him,

384
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,960
he'll let bygones be bygones.

385
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,920
Apologize to him?

386
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,840
I'm not going.

387
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,540
Aojue won't be going there either.

388
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,480
It's because Mo Shenhai is using you

389
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,320
and harming you.

390
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,760
I'm doing the right thing.

391
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,280
Yuhan,

392
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,360
I was wrong about you.

393
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,280
Don't be angry at me.

394
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,460
You just need to apologize, right?

395
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,400
Yunshu, you should go.

396
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,870
A wise person knows
when to endure a setback.

397
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,530
Don't be scared.

398
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,430
I can keep you company.

399
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,520
I'll never apologize to him,

400
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,920
not to mention Aojue.

401
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,000
Judging from the time,

402
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,960
your bodyguard should be arriving soon.

403
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,500
He should be arriving soon?

404
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,190
