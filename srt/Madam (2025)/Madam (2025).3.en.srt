00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,040
Madam.

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,480
Hurry up and wash.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,160
Long'er,

11
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:48,960
how dare you?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,680
Get out of here!

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,320
Call me Long'er one more time,

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,520
I'll show you how daring I can be.

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,240
Did you forget the rules?

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,560
No.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,240
I'm your bodyguard, right?

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,840
As for now,

19
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,360
I'm doing close protection work.

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,600
Are you scared?

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,210
Are you trying to threaten me?

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,080
No, I'm not.

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,440
You're quite a beauty
and have become a widow at a young age.

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,280
I don't mind.

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,040
Why don't you marry me

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,960
and be my Crown Princess?

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,160
Long'er,

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,600
you're sick in the head.

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,200
Although

30
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,360
the Dragon Clan disapproves of
marrying humans,

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,360
I believe

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,200
my father would understand.

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,480
Shan Yunshu,

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,720
I'll treat you well.

35
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,000
Madam,

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,680
do you need help?

37
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,600
Chongming,

38
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,880
throw Long'er out.

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,880
Chongming,

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,200
unless you want to be beaten to a pulp,

41
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,640
stay out of my business.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,380
Neither of us holds any power now.

43
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,880
And when it comes to combat skills,

44
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
you can't be so sure

45
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,440
who'll end up as the pulp.

46
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,600
Chongming,

47
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,680
stop pretending to be a good guy.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,920
You're ruining my plan.

49
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,990
The Dragon Pearl will never be yours.

50
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,790
Long'er, it doesn't matter
if I can't get the Dragon Pearl,

51
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,880
as long as you don't get it,

52
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,480
I'm happy.

53
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,360
Is it?

54
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,690
The two of you, get out of here!

55
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,660
I didn't know the seal
could be this strong.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,920
This is all your fault.

57
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,280
I see.

58
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,280
This is the seal you were talking about.

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,000
- Undo the seal.
- Undo the seal.

60
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,120
How?

61
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,040
I don't know how.

62
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,000
Focus.

63
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,920
Meditate.

64
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,560
Do you admit you were wrong?

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,840
I do.

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,560
And you,

67
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,440
Long'er?

68
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,840
I do.

69
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,720
Pardon?

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,760
I didn't catch that.

71
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,200
Madam,

72
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,120
I was wrong.

73
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,720
Girl,

74
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,920
just you wait.

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,440
Looks like someone isn't really sorry.

76
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,560
Do you have dog ears?

77
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,200
You heard that.

78
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,760
Chongming,

79
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,240
go back to your room.

80
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,400
As for Long'er,

81
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,920
kneel here until you truly regret it.

82
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,780
Didn't expect this thing
to work so well.

83
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,460
(Twenty years ago)

84
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,280
(Young Shan Yunshu)

85
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,620
(Young Shan Yunshu)
Yuzi, don't be afraid.

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,300
(Young Hu Zhenxuan)
I'll protect you.

87
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,120
How dare you steal the Dragon Pearl
right under my nose?

88
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,760
Have you lived long enough?

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,790
The Dragon Pearl is the key to
transforming me from a Jiao to a dragon.

90
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,560
I have to get it, no matter what.

91
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,980
The Dragon Pearl is the sacred artifact
of the Dragon Clan.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,590
You want to become a true dragon?
Don't be delusional.

93
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,240
Let go,

94
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,640
or I'll kill you.

95
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,980
You despicable monster,

96
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,960
you've got a helper.

97
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:35,920
Who are you?

98
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,380
It doesn't matter who I am.

99
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,700
What matters is
that the Dragon Pearl must belong to me.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,380
The Dragon Pearl is the arcane treasure
of the Dragon Clan.

101
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,280
How did you know about that?

102
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,100
It has been nurtured
over ten thousand years

103
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,880
to hold the greatest power
in this world.

104
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,160
With it, one can wield
immeasurable power.

105
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,240
I'm determined to claim it.

106
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,790
Anyone who stands in my way
will die.

107
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:10,960
Zhenxuan,

108
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,160
are they immortals?

109
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,720
Hush.

110
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,720
Don't talk.

111
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,560
Who's there?

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,440
Come out.

113
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,680
Little girl,

114
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,680
hand me that pearl.

115
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,280
I'll make any of your wishes come true.

116
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,080
Any wishes at all?

117
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,920
Of course.

118
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,640
Liar!

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,600
He's lying.

120
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,600
What's this?

121
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,510
The pact seal of the Dragon Pearl.

122
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,340
We're marked
by the Dragon Pearl's pact seal.

123
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Give me the Dragon Pearl.

124
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,280
Zhenxuan!

125
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,520
Zhenxuan!

126
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,240
The pact seal has been set.

127
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,640
We've become the girl's servants.

128
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,040
I'd better leave now.

129
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,360
Until next time.

130
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,200
What's going on here?

131
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,890
The Dragon Pearl only recognizes
its master.

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,040
Those marked by the seal

133
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,600
are bound by a pact to the master.

134
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,360
They'll be controlled by this girl.

135
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,900
Anyone who disobeys will be punished.

136
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,640
Only her blood can restore our powers.

137
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,840
Madam,

138
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,080
as your bodyguard,

139
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,720
it's my fault

140
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
for what happened today.

141
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,040
I promise

142
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,280
it won't happen again.

143
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,000
How's Long'er?

144
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,600
He has fainted.

145
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,240
He's arrogant.

146
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,840
It looks like

147
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,080
harsh methods don't work for him.

148
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,240
We may need to read some books.

149
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,000
Hold on.

150
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Thank you for yesterday.

151
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,480
It was my honor

152
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,560
to serve you.

153
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,080
You're behaving well.

154
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,760
I'm in your house now.

155
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,280
I have to.

156
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,600
I've always been practical.

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,920
About the Dragon Pearl,

158
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,160
are there any other abilities
I don't know?

159
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,840
Whoever is bonded with you

160
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,760
will automatically be summoned

161
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,960
when you're in danger.

162
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,920
After your three wishes are fulfilled,

163
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,800
the seal will be lifted.

164
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,640
Or

165
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,800
if you willingly give up your life.

166
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,520
There's only one Dragon Pearl.

167
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,200
If I give it to you,

168
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,880
considering Aojue's temper,

169
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,080
he'd kill me for sure.

170
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,320
If you agree to work with me,

171
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,880
I'll keep you safe for life.

172
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,400
Can you take him on?

173
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,690
With the Dragon Pearl,

174
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,720
Aojue is no match for me.

175
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,680
You're so confident.

176
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,640
Because I have something he doesn't.

177
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,080
What's that?

178
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,400
A thinking brain.

179
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,040
You're smart

180
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,000
and funny.

181
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,600
Give me a moment.

182
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:52,981
♪The wind chime doesn't ask when
time will end♪

183
00:08:53,105 --> 00:08:56,763
♪It only sways gently
while waiting in the mist♪

184
00:08:56,807 --> 00:09:00,160
♪You show up behind me♪

185
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,425
♪And that beautiful moment stops
in time♪

186
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,280
What's happening to me?

187
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,230
Every time you activate
the power of the pact seal,

188
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,040
it drains your spiritual energy.

189
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,360
If you don't want to lose your hearing,

190
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,960
your sanity, or your mind,

191
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,960
don't overuse it.

192
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,310
This is all Long'er's fault.

193
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,080
Any power comes with a price.

194
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,960
Maybe this is how he plans
to get the Dragon Pearl.

195
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,480
This idiot is

196
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,880
all brawn and no brain.

197
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,240
I'm not falling for it.

198
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,760
Let's eat.

199
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,120
I need some nourishment.

200
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:35,505
♪I don't want our moment to end♪

201
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,200
Anyway,

202
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,160
welcome to the Shan's Residence.

203
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,080
Consider this

204
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,400
as a welcoming meal.

205
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,920
Is this even edible?

206
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,240
This fish isn't from the sea.

207
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,200
Plus, it's not fresh.

208
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,720
Are these grass or leaves?

209
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,160
You actually eat this?

210
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,000
It smells like dirt.

211
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,960
How's the food, Chongming?

212
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,280
The food is delicious.

213
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,550
You're pretty too, Madam.

214
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,120
Chongming,

215
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,480
did she poison the food or what?

216
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,260
Even if we're being held hostage
by this ugly woman,

217
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,990
you shouldn't have said something
that disgusting.

218
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,220
Get out if you're not eating.

219
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,120
No need to ruin the  peace
with your sarcasm.

220
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,920
Don't be mad, Madam.

221
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,240
Aojue's doing this on purpose.

222
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,040
He's trying to drain your energy.

223
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,960
Well.

224
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,560
Aojue,

225
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,500
looks like you need more punishments.

226
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,560
Seems like it.

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,920
I'm not afraid of you.

228
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,360
Once you're done,

229
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,040
come to my room to apologize.

230
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,160
Also,

231
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,440
pay for anything you break.

232
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,680
It'll come out of your salary.

233
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:42,800
Madam,

234
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,680
the guests' rooms are ready.

235
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,560
Everything that happened here
must stay here.

236
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,120
Yes, Madam.

237
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,960
You may go.

238
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,190
- Yes, Madam.
- Yes, Madam.

239
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,680
Would you like to check your rooms

240
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,760
before you continue?

241
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,960
Suit yourselves.

242
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,720
Hold on.

243
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,040
Yes,

244
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,840
Long'er?

245
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,580
Call me Long'er one more time,

246
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,360
I'll finish you off.

247
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,680
You'd better check with my bodyguard
and see if he allows it.

248
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,640
Please continue.

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,960
I'm going to attend to
some important business.

250
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,040
Yes, Madam.

251
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,710
Keep an eye on him.

252
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,600
That's your task tonight.

253
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,680
Yes,

254
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,320
Madam.

255
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,480
That's everything that happened.

256
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,200
I also find it hard to believe,

257
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,320
but I'm telling the truth.

258
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,840
I saw it with my own eyes.

259
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,320
She managed to escape from you

260
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,880
and even left you seriously injured.

261
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,400
Looks like the two guys with her
are not ordinary people.

262
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,720
How's your injury?

263
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,280
I'm fine.

264
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,840
Glad to hear it.

265
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,960
Finish off Zhao Xurao and Madam Zeng.

266
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,320
Then, send someone

267
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,720
to get the measure of Shan Yunshu.

268
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,400
Yes, sir.

269
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,280
(Father,)

270
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,320
(Mother,)

271
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,520
(I've become the chairwoman
of Dongsheng Trading Company.)

272
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,480
(I'm strong enough)

273
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,960
(to fight back against the one
who slaughtered our Mo family.)

274
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,520
(I'll get justice for you.)
