Are you a human or a ghost?

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,120
Tell me your names!

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,360
We're not humans.

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,760
Or ghosts.

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,640
Chief.

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,560
This is?

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,990
This is the culprit who murdered
Zeng Baozhu, Zhao Xuyao,

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,900
and infiltrated the police station
in an attempt to kill Mrs. Shan Yunshu.

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,760
However,

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,200
I apprehended her.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,830
She already confessed to everything.

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,520
Chief,

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,800
I brought my bodyguards here
to apologize to you.

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,200
They await your punishment.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,280
Since you two are this heroic,

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,640
I'm sure you two aren't robbers.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,980
It's a misunderstanding.

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,360
This must be a misunderstanding.

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,680
Let's go.

27
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,320
Yunshu.

28
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,070
I'll make a move first as well.

29
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,840
Okay.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,160
Why aren't you making a sound?

31
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,500
You got your revenge.
Aren't you happy about it?

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,360
The dead assailant

33
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,880
wasn't Hen, the one
who tried to assassinate me before.

34
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,400
How did you know?

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,480
I've engaged her
in combat multiple times.

36
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,280
I understand how she attacks
and how dangerous her moves are.

37
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,920
Although my assailant
did try her best to imitate her,

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,320
she's way inferior to her.

39
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,570
If so, why didn't you tell us about it?

40
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,800
Chief Wu had caused me
trouble multiple times.

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,520
He should be related to Mo Shenhai.

42
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,600
He took a detour with me
in his vehicle today

43
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,960
just so I could fall for his trap.

44
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,800
A trap, huh?

45
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,560
They wanted

46
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,200
to see what you were truly capable of.

47
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,400
If they succeed,

48
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,730
you would be murdered,

49
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,350
and they wouldn't need
to worry about you again.

50
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,040
If they fail,

51
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,080
they could use this as a diversion
and shirk the responsibilities.

52
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,680
If so, what should we do next?

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,400
We should use this to our advantage.

54
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,200
If our enemies think
that we've let down our guard,

55
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,710
they'll start to give themselves away.

56
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,760
Madam.

57
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,120
I'm fine.

58
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,040
By the way,

59
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,080
where were you two today?

60
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,480
You two looked messy
when you came to my rescue.

61
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,120
Madam.

62
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,480
It's nothing.

63
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,960
Don't overthink it.

64
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,880
He challenged me to a duel.

65
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,120
In the end, I defeated him easily.

66
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,950
What's the matter?

67
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,430
Are you keeping it from her
because you feel embarrassed?

68
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,080
Aojue, you...

69
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,720
So childish.

70
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,600
Aojue, don't get ahead of yourself here.

71
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,040
I'll definitely defeat you one day.

72
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,760
Bring it on.

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,160
Seems like

74
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,380
I have to stop feeding you guys
with my blood too often.

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,480
If not, you two
will cause trouble for me.

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,910
Now, you're butting in?

77
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,440
You should mind your own business.

78
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,510
Don't you know how terrible
your liquor capacity is?

79
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,160
Long'er, stop stirring up trouble.

80
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,000
I behave well when I'm drunk.

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,040
I just feel sleepy.

82
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,520
Madam, who said you behaved well
when you were drunk?

83
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
If that's the case,

84
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,490
I suppose everyone in the world
behaves well when they're drunk.

85
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,920
Ask Chongming if you don't trust me.

86
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,780
You called him
Brother Chongming, you know?

87
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,520
It gave me goosebumps.

88
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,640
Impossible.

89
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,760
Long'er,

90
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,160
stop trying to ruin my image.

91
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,200
I'll punish you, you know?

92
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,080
Punish me?

93
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,490
Looking after you when you were drunk

94
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,320
was the worst punishment I've received.

95
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,760
End my life

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,900
if you're that capable.

97
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,500
At least I won't feel disgusted.

98
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,680
Mingkai!

99
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,560
That was disgusting.

I told you already.
You were no match for me.

Sorry about this.

112
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,480
Detective Zhang,
you can be discharged now.

113
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,120
Your wound isn't a big deal.

114
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,480
That hurts.

115
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,160
Nurse, change my dressing for me.

116
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,410
I need to recover faster
so that I can visit Yunshu.

117
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,040
Mingkai.

118
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,640
Yunshu.

119
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,720
You're here.

120
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,580
Don't worry about me.

121
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,500
It doesn't hurt at all.

122
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,910
I went to the police station yesterday
to seek you.

123
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,350
I heard
that you were still hospitalized.

124
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,600
Do you feel better now?

125
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,920
The doctor said it wasn't a huge deal.

126
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,600
However,

127
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,800
my body hurts.

128
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,920
I don't know why.

129
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,920
Your body hurts?

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,250
Could it be
that you've been bedridden for too long?

131
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,320
Why don't we take a stroll?

132
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,240
Sure.

133
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,710
Madam's body is frail.

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,120
I'll take a stroll with you.

135
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,720
Let's go.

136
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,390
Stop dragging me.

137
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,750
Yunshu, save me!

138
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,090
Come on.

139
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,520
Aojue.

140
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:14,750
Yunshu!

141
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,110
Let's go.

142
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,720
Let Mingkai go.

143
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,400
Stop dragging me.

144
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,680
Shan Yunshu,

145
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,990
you actually went against
the restriction for his sake?

146
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,360
Darned woman.

147
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,440
I'll never care for you again.

148
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,320
You're utterly blind.

149
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,560
Mr. Aojue.

150
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,800
Who are you?

151
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,000
You're heartless.

152
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,270
It's only been
a few decades since we last met.

153
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,690
And now, you no longer recognize me?

154
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,600
Who exactly are you?

155
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,960
We met at the Xuanyuan Tomb
on Mt. Nan a century ago.

156
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh.

157
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,000
So, you were the fox spirit
I rescued, huh?

158
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,240
Mr. Aojue,

159
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,040
everyone said
that you stole the Dragon Pearl

160
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:56,900
and had gone missing.

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,440
I was heartbroken when I heard that.

162
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,040
Why are you taking a stroll here?

163
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,120
Don't bring it up.

164
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,640
I'm super unlucky.

165
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,350
If so, do you need me
to perform divination

166
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,800
and get rid of your bad luck for you?

167
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:06,960
Perform divination?

168
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,080
Yunshu,

169
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,080
do your bodyguards

170
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
fancy you?

171
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,800
They fancy me?

172
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
How is that possible?

173
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,680
I just think
that they treat you differently.

174
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,320
Especially the guy named Aojue.

175
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,520
You misunderstood us.

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,560
There's a pact between us.

177
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,080
They're not concerned about me.

178
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,240
It's just that I possess
the item they desire.

179
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
You're in trouble.

180
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,480
You've fallen into a love trial.

181
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,600
Nonsense.

182
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,830
I've never fallen for anyone
over the past millennium.

183
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,120
That's precisely why

184
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,560
your current love trial is terrifying.

185
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,280
Impossible.

186
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,640
Did a woman appear beside you lately?

187
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,160
And, you have no way to leave her side.

188
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,080
Yeah.

189
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,860
Even so,
that isn't considered a love trial.

190
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,000
And, she's surrounded by many men.

191
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,240
You feel uncomfortable when you see her

192
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,760
being surrounded by all those men.

193
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,000
Why don't you take me
as your godbrother?

194
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,040
Sure.

195
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,800
Do you feel better now?

196
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,200
Is that so?

197
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,400
You touched her before.

198
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,040
And,

199
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,760
you don't reject her presence.

200
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,880
You even tried to approach her.

201
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,360
Whenever it gets dark and lonely,

202
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,400
you can't sleep
because you're thinking about her.

203
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,760
Have you figured it out,

204
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,960
Aojue?

205
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,760
You're caught in a love trial.

206
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,040
Impossible.

207
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,680
Yunshu,

208
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,200
do you wish to hear about my life?

209
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,520
Tell me.

210
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,080
Actually, I'm an illegitimate son.

211
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,600
I was detested by my father since young.

212
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He never visited me.

213
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,120
My mother and I
had to endure tough days.

214
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,840
For the sake

215
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,560
of his family

216
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,280
and his future,

217
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,760
he killed my mother personally.

218
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,880
In this world,

219
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,480
I'm all alone.

220
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,960
This is your 1,000-year love trial.

221
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,360
There's no way to avoid it.

222
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,920
If you don't handle it properly,

223
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,560
your life will be in danger.

224
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,360
It's either

225
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,400
you kill her

226
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,680
or

227
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,640
you conquer her.

228
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,120
There's no other way.

229
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,200
(I don't think I can kill her.)

230
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,960
(I suppose I can only conquer her.)

231
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,040
(I don't think)

232
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,680
(I can kill him myself.)

233
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,640
(I suppose I can only
let her conquer him.)

234
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,400
You guys are fired.

235
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,000
Your presence is no longer required.

236
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,520
Our presence is enough.

237
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,680
You guys may leave now.

238
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,240
What the heck was that?

239
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,760
Does Madam know about this?

240
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,160
Do you think
you can fire us just like that?

241
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,400
We only follow Madam's command.

242
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,200
Besides,

243
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,520
what about our wages?

244
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,440
Yeah.

245
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,880
I have a family to feed.

246
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,320
Now, you say I'm fired?

247
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,080
Where can I get a job, then?

248
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,080
Yeah.

249
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,640
Where will I get a job in the future?

250
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,920
I'll provide you guys

251
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,560
with an unlimited supply of wealth.

252
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,040
That's my gift to you all.

253
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,040
Take the money and scram.

254
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,120
Aojue,

255
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,160
are you serious?

256
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Who'll do

257
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,400
the chores,

258
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,990
cook, and clean the courtyard if they leave?

259
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,840
You.

260
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,040
Me?

261
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,480
I don't know how to do that.

262
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,780
If so, we can keep
one of them as our cook.

263
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,720
Where is she?

264
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Shan Yunshu thought you were dead.

265
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,880
This is a great opportunity
for you to approach her.

266
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,320
Sir, you mean...

267
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,640
From today onward,

268
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,680
you no longer need to live in darkness.

269
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,320
In the future, your name

270
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,880
will be Mo Yuhan.
