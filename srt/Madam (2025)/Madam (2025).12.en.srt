=Episode 12=

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,320
You said the Dragon Pearl
can grant immortality?

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,920
That's right.

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,080
If that's the case,

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,960
you already killed Shan Yunshu
back when we were in the Dragon Temple.

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,960
So, she was revived by the Dragon Pearl.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,040
Indeed.

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,920
Everything
that didn't make sense back then

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,920
is finally making sense now.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,600
Now, the Dragon Pearl

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,760
is much more important

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,530
than Dongsheng Trading Company, right?

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,800
Yuhan,

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,000
you did a great job this time.

21
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,680
However, the Dragon Pearl
is inside Yunshu's body.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
It's not that easy

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
to retrieve it from her.

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,040
And,

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,240
she has two bodyguards.

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,880
That's none of your business.

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
I have my own solution.

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,360
Head to the police station

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,760
and bring Shan Yunshu here.

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,720
Sir,

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,920
this is the last task
I'll accomplish for you.

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,880
After this,

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,560
I no longer owe you anything.

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,990
You don't want
to treat your sister as an enemy.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I can understand that.

36
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,880
You'll regain freedom

37
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,540
as long as you accomplish this task.

38
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,360
Great timing.

39
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,000
Do me a favor.

40
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,320
What kind of favor?

41
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,800
I wish to acquire the Dragon Pearl.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,040
I want to be an immortal.

43
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,280
It's right there.

44
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,960
Are you sure Shan Yunshu
was abducted here by Mo Shenhai?

45
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,760
Yes.

46
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,640
That's what the girl told me.

47
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,840
(Spirit-Gathering Formation)

48
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,480
Listen up.

49
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,160
Hand over the Dragon Pearl,

50
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,280
and you and the girl

51
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,240
will survive.

52
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,960
She isn't Shan Yunshu.

53
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,600
You won't be able to trick me.

54
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,990
You think a person like you
can acquire the Dragon Pearl?

55
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,080
To hell with you.

56
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,320
Kid,

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,360
yesterday, you launched a sneak
attack with your spiritual energy.

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,560
Today,

59
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,200
I'm going to make you pay.

60
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,480
If you know what's good for you,

61
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,990
you better hand over the Dragon Pearl.

62
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,560
If so, I might let you live.

63
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,720
Seems like

64
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,760
you guys had spent a lot of effort

65
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,960
just to deal with me.

66
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,840
But Black-robed Man didn't tell you guys

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,960
that you guys are no match for me

68
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,520
even if I can't use my spiritual energy
in this formation.

69
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,830
You're still being stubborn
right before your demise, huh?

70
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,320
I'll torture you to death today.

71
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
Attack!

72
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,400
Was everything fake?

73
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,640
Was everything fake from the start?

74
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,520
Not entirely.

75
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:17,960
Where's Chongming?

76
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,000
I think

77
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,760
he's still sleeping in the tavern.

78
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,880
So,

79
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,520
you're trying to assassinate me
under Mo Shenhai's order.

80
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm here to help you out.

81
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,880
If you hand over the Dragon Pearl,

82
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,360
both you and him will be even.

83
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,160
This is also the last task
I'll accomplish for him.

84
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,840
What about our parents' vengeance?

85
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,440
Are we not seeking revenge?

86
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,920
In the future,

87
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,470
I'll seek revenge against him myself.

88
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,820
Are you possessed?
Or did something hit you in the head?

89
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,830
Before this, you tried
to assassinate me twice.

90
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,040
I can let bygones be bygones.

91
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,580
I can choose not to hold it against you

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,240
for deceiving me twice.

93
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
You're indebted to Mo Shenhai.

94
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,280
You can't bear to strike him down.

95
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,170
I can understand that.

96
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,200
But if you don't care about
our parents' reputation and lives,

97
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,400
you're not worthy to be
one of the Mo family's daughters.

98
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,190
Have they ever treated me
as their daughter?

99
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,680
What?

100
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,960
Although I was young,

101
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,840
I still remember everything clearly.

102
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
How dare you still run?

103
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,280
You can only choose one daughter

104
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,560
between the two.

105
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,990
You'll decide who lives.

106
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,960
You guys have already
slain my entire family.

107
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,720
I'll do anything for you

108
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,440
as long as you spare my daughters.

109
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,880
You don't want to decide, huh?

110
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,640
I'll decide for you, then.

111
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,040
Don't!

112
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,480
Don't shoot!

113
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,880
It's always you.

114
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,520
To them, you're always
more important than me.

115
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,120
That was an urgent situation.

116
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,600
Dad and Mom didn't have time
to think about it.

117
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,440
They just protected the child
closest to them subconsciously.

118
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,640
Are you sure you have no idea?

119
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,440
What?

120
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,990
Back then, when the killers
charged into our house,

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,700
they wanted Mom
to decide who gets to live.

122
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,120
Go!

123
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,120
Mom!

124
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,600
Just go!

125
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,000
Mom!

126
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,990
Do you remember now?

127
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,280
There are many things

128
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,480
I've already forgotten.

129
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,560
But I'll never forget

130
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,840
what Mom said to me

131
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,600
when we were hiding in the corner.

132
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,920
She said she wanted to rescue you.

133
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,400
I could never forget her expression.

134
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,480
That was a final farewell.

135
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,790
She hoped that her eldest daughter
could survive.

136
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,560
But she would never let
her younger daughter die like that.

137
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
Therefore, she went back

138
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,920
just to create that sliver of a chance.

139
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,840
So,

140
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,320
you always come in first place.

141
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,120
Mom did so for me to get reinforcements.

142
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,680
You were too young back then.

143
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,990
Where were the reinforcements, then?

144
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,080
I'm done talking.

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,760
You can choose
whether to trust me or not.

146
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,560
You're stalling me

147
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,200
so that you guys can deal with Aojue.

148
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,200
He's just an outsider.

149
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,560
Is he more important
than your own sister?

150
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,800
He's my benefactor.

151
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,520
And you,

152
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,520
you'll always be my younger sister.

153
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,540
You're quite a strong lad, aren't you?

154
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,080
This is interesting.

155
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,280
Kid,

156
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,760
I suppose you can't do anything now.

157
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,000
Shan Yunshu.

158
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,840
What have you guys done to her?

159
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,320
You finally sensed it, huh?

160
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,960
I'm afraid it's too late.

161
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,120
My men are already
dealing with her as we speak.

162
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,000
Even if Chongming is alone,

163
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,680
you guys won't be able to deal with him.

164
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,000
What if we have the help of
the Black-robed Man?

165
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,720
He said there was a scale lacking
in front of your chest.

166
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,600
He said it was your weak point.

167
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,480
He was right indeed.

168
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,040
With the dragon's blood,
the Anti-Dragon Formation is activated.

169
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,000
Kid,

170
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,640
I'm sure it feels great.

171
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,880
Despicable scum.

172
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,560
Yunshu,

173
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,480
you have to hang in there.

174
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,440
Put her down.

175
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,640
Thank you.

176
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,320
Madam.

177
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,310
Chongming, you came here
in the nick of time.

178
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,360
Let's go and find Aojue.

179
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,540
The Spirit-Gathering Formation and the
Anti-Dragon Formation have been activated.

180
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,640
If we go there, we'll be done for.

181
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,640
Don't go.

182
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,680
What about Aojue, then?

183
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,760
The pier is filled with ambushes.

184
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,990
Even if we do go there,
we'll be done for.

185
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,120
I can't just let Aojue
die in front of me.

186
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
Do you fancy him?

187
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,800
This has nothing to do with my feelings.

188
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,240
I'll do the same for you two

189
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,610
no matter which of you is trapped.

190
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,620
You guys are loyal to me.

191
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,760
I have to return the favor.

192
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,520
Moreover,

193
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,560
you and Aojue
have rescued me more than once.

194
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,760
Chongming.

195
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,200
Let go.

196
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,920
You'll die for real this time.

197
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,800
I'm not intimidating you here.

198
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,890
Do you still remember the time
you asked me about the meaning of life?

199
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,720
If I have to stand idly by
as you or Aojue die in front of me,

200
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,360
I would rather die.

201
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,320
It's too late.

202
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,100
When a dragon passes away,

203
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,240
the Dragon Gate will be open.

204
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,000
Aojue is dead.

205
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,360
It's done.

206
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,480
It's finally done.

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,560
Chongming,

208
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,460
you can leap over the Dragon Gate.

209
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,760
I'll retrieve the Dragon Pearl.

210
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,400
From now on, we're even.

211
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,120
Time's up.

212
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,080
I appreciate your cooperation.

213
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,040
If only I was the one

214
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,600
lying on the ground right now.

215
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,800
Chongming.

216
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,200
I regret what I did.

217
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,520
Don't lose your only opportunity!

218
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,440
Aojue!

219
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,960
(Stupid Long'er,)

220
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,560
(you mustn't die yet.)

221
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,640
(Your arrival was like
a ray of morning light that melted me.)

222
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,000
(If you vanish,)

223
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
(what's the point of)

224
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,360
(living in this world alone?)

225
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,600
Shan Yunshu,

226
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,680
hand over the Dragon Pearl,

227
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,160
and I will let you live.

228
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,840
(Stupid Long'er,)

229
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,000
(although you talked back to me,)

230
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,440
(made me angry,)

231
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,800
(and bickered with me,)

232
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,160
(you did protect me and care for me)

233
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:23,640
(wholeheartedly.)

234
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:26,880
(I wish to express my gratitude.)

235
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,280
(Thank you)

236
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:30,600
(for showing me what it feels like
to have a family.)

237
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,400
(What's your name?)

238
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:34,160
(You may address me as Your Highness.)

239
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,520
(Now, I'm going to be your bodyguard.)

240
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,800
(I've rescued you again.)

241
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,120
(How do you intend to repay me?)

242
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,540
You're quite thick-skinned, aren't you?

243
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,480
You must be drunk.

244
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,280
Don't undress me.

245
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,120
Who are you dolling yourself for?

246
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,920
(Shan Yunshu,)

247
00:11:53,032 --> 00:11:54,880
(I don't want
to meddle with your stupid life.)

248
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,520
(In the future, you have
to discuss everything with me.)

249
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,120
The Dragon Pearl!

250
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,320
The Dragon Pearl!

251
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,040
The Dragon Pearl is mine!

252
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,120
You don't care about me at all.

253
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:11,400
Darned lass.

254
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,950
I already gave you
my Heart-Protecting Scale.

255
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,420
You should at least let me sniff you.

256
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,800
