=Episode 2=

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,700
Does that mean her blood contains
the power of the Dragon Pearl

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,590
that can help us temporarily regain
our powers?

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,120
I'm afraid so.

11
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,730
I didn't expect this pact to be
more powerful than I had heard.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,520
Is there no way

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,160
we can regain our power without her?

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,200
There's a rumor.

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,400
If the pact-bearer's
three wishes are granted,

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,720
the seal might weaken.

17
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,600
And that might bring our powers back.

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,520
Are you certain?

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,760
I don't want to waste my time
on some little girl.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,880
If you don't believe me,
figure it out yourself

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,800
to deal with this girl.

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,780
Jeez, little girl.

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,450
You didn't make a sound
when you woke up.

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,200
You're exhausting me.

25
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,280
When did you wake up?

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,890
Around the time

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,990
you said you needed my blood
to restore your powers.

28
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,520
Girl,

29
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,320
make three wishes now.

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:21,880
Yes.

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,440
Do it now.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,960
What are your names?

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,280
Chongming.

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,400
You can call me Crown Prince.

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,720
Now, make three wishes.

36
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,960
Are you immortals and monsters?

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,480
I'm an immortal,

38
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,240
and he's a monster.

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,840
Aojue,

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,100
show some respect, will you?

41
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,680
Chongming,

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,590
once my power is restored,

43
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,400
I'll skin you and have you for dinner.

44
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:44,760
You!

45
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,440
Why are you two fighting already?

46
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,400
Make your wishes now.

47
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,200
Hurry up.

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,480
Can you

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,600
bring my dead family back to life?

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,360
- No.
- No.

51
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,280
Can you turn back time?

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,040
- No.
- No.

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,080
Can you make realistic wishes?

54
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,360
Immortals aren't all-powerful.

55
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,120
How about you change back
to your true form

56
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,100
and let me have a look?

57
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,640
I've only seen dragons and Jiaos
in shadow puppet plays.

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,640
- My power is weak now.
- My power is weak now.

59
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,320
- No.
- No.

60
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,120
Why don't you check your reflection
in the water?

61
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,320
Immortals?

62
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,000
Monsters?

63
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,840
Crown Prince?

64
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,840
You dress like street performers.

65
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,680
People might think you're mentally ill.

66
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,580
Move aside.

67
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,360
I have important business.

68
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:23,800
No.

69
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,800
Unless you undo our pact seal.

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,400
We need to work together.

71
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,240
Help me catch the assassin,

72
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,240
and I'll consider helping you
undo the pact seal.

73
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,880
Chairwoman Zeng.

74
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,040
I'm late.

75
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,900
(Mo Shenhai, president)
Please forgive me, Madam Zeng.

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,680
Having you here is an honor
to Dongsheng Trading Company

77
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,240
and to me personally.

78
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,320
Dongsheng Trading Company

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,560
is advancing together
with the Wanlong Chamber of Commerce.

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,120
However, it's a shame
that Dongsheng Trading Company

81
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
never joined
the Wanlong Chamber of Commerce.

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
That's your call, President Mo.

83
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,080
Also,

84
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,060
I'd like to thank President Mo Shenhai

85
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,670
of the Wanlong Chamber of Commerce

86
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,920
for coming to my inauguration.

87
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,800
President Mo

88
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,440
has graced

89
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,000
Dongsheng Trading Company

90
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,600
with his presence.

91
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,080
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

92
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,360
Girl,

93
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,240
we used up all our powers to save you.

94
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,040
My patience is wearing thin.

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,280
Like I said,

96
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,320
I will kill you.

97
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,280
If you could,

98
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,280
you would've done so.

99
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,920
I don't know what your reasons are,

100
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,990
but I'm sure it has something to do
with the Dragon Pearl and the pact seal.

101
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,720
How about you kill me now?

102
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,240
Girl,

103
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,040
one day, you'll be begging me.

104
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,400
What are you on about?

105
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,640
Right now, it's not that I need you,

106
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,600
but the other way around.

107
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,760
Uh...

108
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,620
What do we do then?

109
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,000
Since you can't leave me,

110
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,280
we need to set some rules.

111
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,240
First,

112
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,400
I don't keep useless people around me.

113
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,840
My blood gives you power

114
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,720
and lets you live like immortals,

115
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,760
you'd better earn it.

116
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
Stay by my side,

117
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,160
protect me,

118
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,640
and serve me.

119
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,040
If I'm pleased,

120
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,990
I'll reward you with a drop of blood
each day.

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
In your dreams.

122
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,920
We own that power in the first place.

123
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,480
You stole the Dragon Pearl
and got our power sealed.

124
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,880
Yet you want us to serve you?

125
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,760
I'll never do that.

126
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,400
Second,

127
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,240
I don't like being interrupted.

128
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,280
You do

129
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,080
what I say.

130
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,320
If I tell you not to do something,
you must obey me.

131
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,000
Third,

132
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,960
I like polite people.

133
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,680
When you talk to me, use honorifics.

134
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,760
Call me

135
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,840
"Madam".

136
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,600
Understood?

137
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,400
Even if it means my life,

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,760
I must teach you a lesson.

139
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,240
Words have it that the late chairman's
first wife passed away.

140
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
Is that true?

141
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,480
Yes.

142
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
Shan Yunshu was the Hu family's fiancee.

143
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,160
Two days ago,

144
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,840
at Master Hu's funeral,

145
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,360
she died.

146
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,520
Her body still hasn't been found.

147
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,720
I'm devastated.

148
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,440
However, for the development
of the company

149
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,480
and our employees,

150
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,960
I had no choice but to take over
Dongsheng Trading Company.

151
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,080
Everyone,

152
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,100
I hope you can understand.

153
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,360
Madam Zeng,

154
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,760
stop pretending.

155
00:05:45,774 --> 00:05:46,540
(Dongsheng Trading Company)

156
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,360
As expected of an actress.

157
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,160
You're still as skilled as ever.

158
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,320
Shan Yunshu?

159
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm not dead yet.

160
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,840
Are you disappointed?

161
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,200
Zhao Xuyao and you really
went to great lengths

162
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,880
sending assassins to kill me.

163
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,600
For the chairwoman's seat,

164
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,440
you really went all out.

165
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,840
I wonder

166
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,990
if someone powerful was helping
from behind.

167
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,040
Shan Yunshu,

168
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,720
don't slander me.

169
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,760
The Hu family treated you well.

170
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,920
You're ungrateful,

171
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,600
so don't blame me for being heartless.

172
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,200
Out of my way.

173
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,600
Twenty years ago,

174
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,280
Young Master died because of you.

175
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,290
Yet you shamelessly stayed
in the Hu's residence.

176
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,280
You seduced Master Hu

177
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,640
and had an indecent affair with him,

178
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,120
which only worsened his condition.

179
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,240
You ruined the Hu family.

180
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,589
Why should I hand the company over
to you?

181
00:06:57,047 --> 00:06:58,065
This...

182
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,200
You can insult me.

183
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,150
But if you insult
Master Hu and Young Master,

184
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,280
you're asking for it.

185
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,590
You tried to poison Master Hu

186
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,800
for his money.

187
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,190
Too bad I didn't find out sooner.

188
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,790
The drugs and evidence
are sent to the police station.

189
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,440
If you dare to slander
Mr. Hu and Zhenxuan again,

190
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,440
I'll make you suffer.

191
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,280
Even Mo Shenhai can't help you.

192
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,680
Fess up.

193
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,680
Did Madam Zeng and Zhao Xuyao
put you up to kill me?

194
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,840
Yes.

195
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:39,636
This...

196
00:07:39,636 --> 00:07:41,076
How can this be?

197
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:42,619
- This is unbelievable.
- Tell me about it.

198
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,269
This is unexpected.

199
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,210
You never really know a person.

200
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,920
Come out.

201
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,560
So what if I sent her?

202
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,480
What can you do?

203
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,800
Today,

204
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,080
you must

205
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,320
die.

206
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,480
I saved you once again.

207
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,160
How do you plan to repay me?

208
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,040
Move aside.

209
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,480
You're blocking me.

210
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,160
Are you a dog?

211
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,800
You're ungrateful.

This must be the First Madam of Mo City,

00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,520
who just saved me,

(Zhang Mingkai, detective)
I'm

225
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:57,740
(Zhang Mingkai, detective)
a detective from Mo City,

226
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,520
(Zhang Mingkai, detective)
Zhang Mingkai.

227
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,280
What's the meaning

228
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,880
of this?

229
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,360
Madam,

230
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,680
who are they?

231
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,680
They are my bodyguards.

232
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,160
Don't flatter yourself.

233
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,240
I'm not your bodyguard.

234
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,040
If he denies it,

235
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,520
I'm taking

236
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,720
both of them with me.

237
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,120
Detective Zhang,

238
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,520
what crime have they committed?

239
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,400
You may not know.

240
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,560
Those fancy suits they're wearing

241
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,680
were actually stolen.

242
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:32,990
On top of that,

243
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,080
they assaulted the shop owner and staff
when asked to pay.

244
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,600
It's their great pleasure
that we wear their clothes.

245
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,900
Besides, I gave them a treasure.

246
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,320
They didn't recognize its value.

247
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,300
They just wouldn't let us go.

248
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,680
Madam,

249
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,120
I told them

250
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,160
you'd pay.

251
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,680
But Aojue was too impulsive.

252
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,490
He insisted on offering them
a Heartscale.

253
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,490
That's why they thought he was crazy.

254
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,860
Detective Zhang,

255
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,840
they are my bodyguards.

256
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,000
It's just...

257
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,280
This one

258
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,640
is sick here.

259
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,760
Please forgive him.

260
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,700
How about this?

261
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,080
I'll pay five times

262
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,520
the price of their suits

263
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,000
and ten times

264
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,280
the shop owner's medical bills.

265
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,680
In that case,

266
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,320
I'll pretend nothing happened.

267
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,640
But

268
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,280
you owe me now.

269
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,240
You can

270
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,840
buy me a meal.

271
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,040
Deal.

272
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,520
Let's go.

273
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,800
All right.

274
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,240
Since you work under me,

275
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,680
I won't treat you poorly.

276
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,560
Remember our rules.

277
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,320
As long as you do your job well,

278
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,120
I'll guarantee you a comfortable life.

279
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,790
By the way,

280
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,600
your name

281
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,620
is hard to pronounce.

282
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,300
From now on, I'll call you

283
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,000
Long'er.

284
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,920
It suits you.

285
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,960
Stop laughing.

286
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,360
Though you're inferior to me,

287
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,920
you're a Jiao dragon, after all.

288
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,920
How can you let this girl
order you around?

289
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,290
For the sake of the Dragon Pearl,

290
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,440
I can put up with her.

291
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,080
As for you, Long'er,

292
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,240
good luck.

293
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,040
