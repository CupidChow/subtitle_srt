19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,240
it's time to go to the banquet.

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,380
(Shan Yunshu, Madam)

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,120
It's said Chairman Hu is seriously ill.

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,680
No wonder Shan Yunshu
is throwing a banquet today.

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,870
She's probably going to take over
Dongsheng Trading Company.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,480
I heard she hasn't gotten married
into the Hu family yet.

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,360
Really?

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,040
It's because Young Master Hu
died young.

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,520
I also heard

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,720
that Master Hu's concubine
is fighting her over the inheritance.

the Dongsheng Trading banquet.

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,040
I wouldn't become

00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,300
(Hu Zeyuan, Chairman of Dongsheng)
there's something I need to tell you.

47
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,640
I acknowledged you
as part of the Hu family,

48
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,440
but I never gave you

49
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,280
what you rightfully deserved.

50
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,020
(Zeng Baozhu, Hu Zeyuan's concubine)

51
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,480
Mr. Hu,

52
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,840
Zhenxuan and I
were betrothed since infancy.

53
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,040
Back then, he risked his life to save me.

54
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,320
I may not have officially
married into the Hu family,

55
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,600
but I've long been your daughter-in-law.

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,240
Yunshu.

57
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,720
I really

58
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,920
miss Zhenxuan.

59
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,720
Bury me

60

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,280

62
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:51,122

We can't act against her will.

123
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,960
Then how do we break the pact seal?

124
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,680
The dragon pearl has fused with her.

125

How do we make her bleed out?

130
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,840
She's a mere human.

131
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,520
She'll need our help.
