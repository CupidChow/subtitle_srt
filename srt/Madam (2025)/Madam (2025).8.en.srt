=Episode 8=

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,240
Why are you doing this yourself?

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,160
Where are the maids?

10
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,510
I paid them a good amount of money
to send them away.

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,120
In the future,

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,040
we will be your servant and bodyguard.

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,560
I am the bodyguard.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,520
You are the maid.

15
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,250
Don't be mistaken.

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,840
You...

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,040
Can any one of you

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,080
cook?

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,000
Who made this? It tastes so bad.

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,080
Is it that bad?

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,240
Then,

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,000
let me try it.

23
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,990
Arriving at the right time
is better than arriving early.

24
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,880
Just in time for breakfast.

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:38,720
All right.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,640
Let me try them.

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,440
Is this for humans?

28
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,480
Who told you to eat?

29
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,520
Thankfully, I am here.

30
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,680
Otherwise, Mo Shenhai
doesn't even need to do anything.

31
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,360
These dishes

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,850
are so disgusting that they can kill.

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,280
You should eat what I brought you.

34
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,680
Mingkai,

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,240
have you recovered from your injuries?

36
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,390
You're the one
who cares about me the most.

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,720
My injuries have mostly healed.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,880
Don't worry.

39
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,520
Besides visiting you,

40
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,080
I also have three things to tell you.

41
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,240
Tell me.

42
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,960
One,

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,920
I want to ally with you

44
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,280
to defeat Mo Shenhai together.

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,160
Two,

46
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,480
the chief

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,880
has gotten the female assassin

48
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,560
to take all the blame.

49
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Three,

50
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,000
Mo Shenhai

51
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,720
has acquired most of
the shares of Dongsheng Trading Company.

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,280
If my guess is correct,

53
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,720
Mo Shenhai

54
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,040
will do everything he can

55
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,480
to take over Dongsheng Trading Company.

56
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,360
Yunshu,

57
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,560
you should be prepared.

58
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,640
I will consider

59
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,040
the first thing thoroughly.

60
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,620
As for the other two things,

61
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,440
I want to hear your opinion.

62
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,720
I can help you out

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,120
for the second thing.

64
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,000
As for the third thing, I need time.

65
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,840
If we want to defeat Mo Shenhai,

66
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,680
we need to play the long game.

67
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,840
I've acquired information

68
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,280
on Mo Shenhai's illegal deals.

69
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,800
If you are interested,

70
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,080
you can come and find me.

71
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,400
I will deal with Mo Shenhai now.

72
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,680
Tell me where he is.

73
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,640
If it's that easy,

74
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,640
we wouldn't be feeling troubled.

75
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,640
Is it that complicated to take revenge?

76
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,400
All of you are overthinking.

77
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,160
Mo Shenhai's matter

78
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,720
cannot be solved with his death.

79
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,940
I don't just want

80
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,080
Mo Shenhai's death.

81
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,990
You still need to stabilise
Dongsheng Trading Company internally.

82
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,990
The external problems

83
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
can be dealt with slowly.

84
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,120
I'm sure Mo Shenhai will do something

85
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,840
during the board meeting.

86
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:42,380
(Libation)

87
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,880
(News)

88
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,960
These are the clues I found
over the years.

89
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,680
Mo Shenhai is the murderer
who killed my parents.

90
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,320
On the surface,

91
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,790
he is the chairman of
Mo City's largest Chamber of Commerce

92
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,310
and the greatest philanthropist

93
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,000
but he has done

94
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,080
many disgusting deeds in secret.

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,920
He can simply be killed

96
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,980
yet all of you
have to complicate things.

97
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,520
If we want to defeat Mo Shenhai,

98
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,560
we must follow the rules of humans.

99
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,160
You can't use brute force.

100
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,400
Moreover,

101
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,560
dying is too easy.

102
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,560
We can't let Mo Shenhai
off the hook so easily.

103
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,120
Aojue,

104
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,720
your methods don't work

105
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,800
in the Human Clan world.

106
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:18,920
Perhaps

107
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,320
working with Zhang Mingkai

108
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,680
is a good choice.

109
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,920
That kid

110
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,880
is sneaky.

111
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,080
He annoys me.

112
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,480
I'm not worried.

113
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,360
Madam,

114
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,700
I'll go with you.

115
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,520
Are you worried about Zhang Mingkai

116
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,200
or the Black-robed Man?

117
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,640
- Black-robed Man.
- Zhang Mingkai.

118
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,880
You're here to visit me.

119
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,720
I'm glad

120
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,080
because

121
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,400
it means
I'll no longer be fighting alone.

122
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,120
You said you've been investigating me.

123
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,880
What did you find?

124
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,560
I know who you are.

125
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,380
How do you find out

126
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,840
about this secret?

127
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,880
I've told you

128
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,000
that I'm a strong ally.

129
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,240
I will do my best to protect you.

130
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,080
Yunshu.

131
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,480
You should learn
how to protect yourself instead.

132
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,990
Don't get injured all the time.

133
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,760
Softer.

134
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,160
I'm sincere towards you
and keep nothing from you.

135
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,280
Yunshu,

136
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,560
I am a man.

137
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,280
Save me some dignity.

138
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,080
Let's talk business.

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,680
Tomorrow is my appointment ceremony
at Dongsheng Trading Company.

140
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,080
Mo Shenhai will surely
take action using this opportunity.

141
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,480
What do you plan to do?

142
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,680
My plan is...

143
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,240
What are you two doing?

144
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,000
Aren't we your allies?

145
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,680
Shouldn't we learn about the plan?

146
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,080
If we know about the plan,

147
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,840
we can cooperate better with you.

148
00:05:59,320 --> 00:05:59,920
Mingkai,

149
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,320
just tell us the plan.

150
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,720
Both of them

151
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,200
should hear about it.

152
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,600
Oh.

153
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,320
The plan is...

154
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,980
(Dongsheng Trading Company)

155
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,680
Shareholders and managers

156
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,860
of Dongsheng Trading Company,

157
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,400
Hello.

158
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,400
Thank you for being here.

159
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,000
All of you
are the backbone of Dongsheng

160
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,560
and the future of this trading company.

161
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,720
Recently, the company went through
many difficult moments.

162
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,320
Now, I've dealt with these problems.

163
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,400
Next,

164
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,200
I will work hard

165
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,700
and lead everyone in Dongsheng

166
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,560
according to
the former chairman's dying wish.

167
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,800
Let's welcome

168
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,500
Dongsheng Trading Company's
great future!

169
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,792
- All right!
- All right!

170
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,720
Shan Yunshu!

171
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,880
I don't think it's right for you
to become the chairman.

172
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,240
Mo Shenhai.

173
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,200
This is the company's internal problem.

174
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,760
Why are you meddling as an outsider?

175
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,120
Right!

176
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,800
Go out!

177
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,710
You are not welcome here!

178
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,400
Everyone.

179
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,880
Chase him away!

180
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,040
Silence!

181
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,760
Back then, Dongsheng Trading Company

182
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,840
was established by
the Mo family and the Hu family.

183
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,120
Both families
hold 30% of Dongsheng's shares each.

184
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,880
20 years ago,

185
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,640
The Mo family has been annihilated.

186
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,560
The Mo family's shares

187
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,800
were acquired by the Hu family.

188
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,440
That was why he became chairman.

189
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,590
After the Mo family was annihilated,

190
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,840
the Hu family took over their shares
as a sworn brother.

191
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,210
It has nothing to do with you.

192
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,470
You are not a descendant
of the Mo family.

193
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,520
Well said.

194
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,480
I, Mo Shenhai,

195
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,000
were close friends

196
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,400
with the Mo family's head.

197
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,360
After searching painstakingly,

198
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,080
I finally found the Mo family's orphan.

199
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:55,287
The second daughter of the Mo family,

200
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,040
Mo Yuhan.

201
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,880
Yuhan,

202
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
step up and greet everyone.

203
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,600
Ms. Shan,

204
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,520
shouldn't you

205
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,280
return the Mo family's shares
back to them?

206
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,960
The matter of the Mo family's shares

207
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
can be discussed further.

208
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,960
Mo Shenhai,

209
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,920
did you stop Ms. Shan's appointment

210
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,360
because you have

211
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,600
another candidate on your mind?

212
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,920
Zeng Baozhu,
the former chairman's concubine

213
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,180
and Zhao Xuyao, the butler signed
this share transfer agreement with me.

214
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,960
I own 21% of
Dongsheng Trading Company's shares.

215
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,560
Yuhan

216
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,560
has given me control of
the 30% shares owned by the Mo family.

217
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,360
I, Mo Shenhai,

218
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,360
own 51% of Dongsheng Trading Company.

219
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,320
I am

220
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,400
Dongsheng Trading Company's chairman.

221
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Shareholders,

222
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,480
take a good look at it yourselves.

223
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:08,763
He is telling the truth.

224
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,960
The agreement is genuine.

225
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,600
This is troublesome.

226
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,380
There's no need to see it anymore.

227
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,640
It's troublesome, right?

228
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,720
Why don't I just kill him instead?

229
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,080
Yuhan,

230
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,360
you resemble Mother.

231
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,320
Ms. Shan,

232
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,720
20 years ago,

233
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,780
the Mo family suffered in an accident.

234
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,040
I was the only one who escaped.

235
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,790
This is all thanks
to Uncle Mo Shenhai's care.

236
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,680
From now on,

237
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,040
I hope

238
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,480
the Hu family can return
the Mo family's shares.

239
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,560
How can you prove that you are Mo Yuhan?

240
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,380
This jade pendant
is a token of the Mo family.

241
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,680
Everyone has it.

242
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,900
There's a secret text carved inside.

243
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,200
It is enough proof of my identity.

244
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,200
Everyone from the Mo family
perished 20 years ago.

245
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,220
Who can prove it for you?

246
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,780
That's right!

247
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,040
Who can prove it for you?

248
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,720
I can.

249
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,960
Yuhan,

250
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,000
don't you remember me?

251
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
I am your sister.

252
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,080
I am Mo Yuzi.

253
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,400
You are my sister?

254
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,480
Is Shan Yunshu

255
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,290
the eldest daughter of the Mo family,

256
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,280
Mo Yuzi?

257
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,480
Looking at it.

258
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,400
They do look similar to each other.

259
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,960
Do you know the secret text
carved in this jade pendant?

260
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,220
You were born on
the sixth day of the fourth month.

261
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,320
Your jade pendant

262
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,640
has a peach blossom carved inside.

263
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,600
I was born in the winter months

264
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,880
so my jade pendant
has a plum blossom carved inside.

265
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,280
Yuhan,

266
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,520
has the burn on your chest been healed?

267
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,080
Back then,

268
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,520
you grabbed a piece of charcoal
from the brazier

269
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,840
and it fell on your chest.

270
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,600
I blamed myself because of that
for a long time.

271
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,440
Yuhan!

272
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,640
Stay away.

273
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,400
This is important news.

274
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,600
Back then, I was pursued by assassins.

275
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,200
Later, I was rescued

276
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,920
by my fiance, Hu Zhenxuan,
the young master of the Hu family.

277
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,240
Ever since,

278
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,390
I've stayed in the Hu family
while hiding my identity.

279
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,400
I was the one

280
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,830
who agreed to let the Hu family
control the Mo family's shares.

281
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,330
I didn't expect you to go through
such an experience, Ms. Shan.

282
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,780
They say the eldest sister
takes on the role of a mother.

283
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,560
Since both of you
have recognised each other,

284
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,880
Mo Shenhai,

285
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,620
you shouldn't be concerned
about the Mo family's shares anymore.

286
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,040
Ms. Shan will be elected
with 60% of the shares.

287
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,190
There's no question about it.

288
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
You are wrong.

289
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,280
A married daughter

290
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,400
is as good as gone.

291
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,360
Ms. Shan is already
the daughter-in-law of the Hu family.

292
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,520
Even if

293
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,920
she has the shares,

294
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:23,527
she can't control them in her own hands.

295
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,080
Even if both siblings
own 15% of the shares each,

296
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Ms. Shan

297
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,600
only has 45% of the shares at most.

298
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,080
Without the vote of the shareholders,

299
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,840
she cannot become chairman.

300
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,720
Moreover, Madam Zeng

301
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
transferred part of her shares

302
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,120
to Mr. Mo Shenhai.

303
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,680
Madam Zeng has been killed.

304
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,240
I wonder

305
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,960
if she agreed to the share transfer
because she was forced to.

306
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,160
Ms. Shan.

307
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,400
Every transfer of shares

308
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,800
was done willingly

309
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,280
without coercion.

310
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,760
Moreover,

311
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,600
Madam Zeng has been acquiring
retail shares in secret

312
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,790
because she was worried
that Dongsheng Trading Company

313
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,320
would be held onto unfairly.

314
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,480
Chairman Mo Shenhai,

315
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,280
the truth of whether the share transfer

316
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,520
of Madam Zeng and the butler

317
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,510
were coerced

318
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,320
is right here.

319
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,360
Everyone,

320
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,590
I am Zhang Mingkai, a detective
of Mo City Police Department.

321
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,240
Before Zeng Baozhu and Zhao Xuyao died,

322
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,440
they had a sense of regret.

323
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,400
Later,

324
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,600
they were assassinated
by an assassin called Hen.

325
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,790
Although the assassin
killed two people,

326
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,800
he left some evidence behind.

327
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,990
Everyone, listen to this.

328
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,440
Why are you causing trouble here?

329
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,760
This case is closed.

330
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,920
It has nothing to do
with Mr. Mo Shenhai.

331
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,000
Chief,

332
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,320
I didn't say

333
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,090
it has anything to do
with Mr. Mo Shenhai.
