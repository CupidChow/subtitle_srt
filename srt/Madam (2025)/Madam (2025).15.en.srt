Does your head hurt?

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,560
Aojue, why did you stay still
in front of the window?

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,440
You scared me.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,320
Did you forget?

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,520
You told me to stand here.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,840
When?

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,700
Are you sure you don't remember?

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,880
Just now, we were at the outskirts...

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,760
What kind of fake liquor
did you offer me?

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,360
It gave me a headache.

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,920
Take a close look.

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,360
Stand there. Don't move.

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,240
I remember now.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,580
Hurry and lift
the immobilization spell you cast.

22
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,360
I remember now.

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,440
What are you doing?

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,320
If you dare to tell anyone
about what happened today,

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,560
I'll make sure you vanish.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,880
Is that how you beg people?

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,360
What do you want, then?

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,580
It depends on your performance
in the future.

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,400
Lift the spell first.

30
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,000
You're free.

31
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,800
You look thin.

32
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,460
I never expected you to be that heavy.

33
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,260
You should eat less.

34
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,710
Seems like you wish
to stand here longer.

35
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,520
I'll be leaving now.

36
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,440
Wait.

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,680
What's wrong again?

38
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,560
Clean the lipstick stain

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,760

00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,480
People will misunderstand us
if they see you like this.

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,480
There's more.

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,760
I can't see my own face.

43
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,080
Why don't you clean it for me?

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,720

You are?

You have
an extraordinary appearance indeed.

50
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,960
You make me feel for you.

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
What are you doing here?

52
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,160
Long'er, is she your friend?

53
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,360
She's a fortune teller.

54
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,840
Long?

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,560
Are you guys that close now?

56
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,560
Have you already conquered her?

57
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,840
I didn't call him Long.

58
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
I called him Long'er.

59
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,260
What are you doing here?

60
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm just worried about you.

61
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,000
You had to overcome a love trial.

62
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,480
I was worried that you might fail.

63
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,840
Now, it seems like I was worried for nothing.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,080
I'm fine. Just leave.

65
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,400
You heartless man.

66
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,760
I came all the way here, you know?

67
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,040
My throat is dry.

68
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,660
Aren't you going to serve me some tea?

69
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,320
In your dreams.

70
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,880
Just leave.

71
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,680
Miss Hu.

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,640
We have tea here.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,920
Madam, you know
how to care for people indeed.

74
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,080
It's no wonder you won the heart
of the 1,000-year-old virgin.

75
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,740
Then you're still talking rubbish.

76
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,920
Just finish your tea.

77
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,920
Miss Hu, I wonder why you're here.

78
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,280
I'm here to collect a debt.

79
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,400
A debt?

80
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,240
Did Aojue take something from you?

81
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,880
I didn't.

82
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,280
Don't spout nonsense.

83
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,160
He didn't take anything.

84
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
He just didn't pay for my
fortune-telling service.

85
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,140
And, he even walked off
with my love guidebook.

86
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,590
Fine. You can have anything you want.

87
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,720
Can you please just shut up?

88
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,440
Do you even have money?

89
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,560
Money isn't her goal.

90
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,680
Yunshu!

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,560
Yunshu, help me out.

92
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,000
You...

93
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,720
Mingkai, what are you doing?

94
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,790
I'm moving to your house
to live with you.

95
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,840
There's no space.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,700
Hurry and scram.

97
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,840
You're just a bodyguard.

98
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,140
Your lover didn't even speak yet.

99
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,100
You shouldn't interfere.

100
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,200
Where are Yuhan and Chongming?

101
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,710
They left the police station long ago.

102
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,590
Didn't they come back?

103
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,950
I'm glad to hear that.

104
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,600
She should be fine
with Chongming around.

105
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,880
Yuhan.

106
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,520
- You're finally back.
- Yuzi.

107
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,640
Have a seat.

108
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,840
Yuzi,

109
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,880
who is she?

110
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,360
I'm a friend of Aojue's.

111
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,400
I'm Hu Lili.

112
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,680
You may address me as Miss Lili.

113
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,120
You're still acting, huh?

114
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,200
Hunk,

115
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,520
what's your name?

116
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,760
I'm Zhang Mingkai.

117
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,520
Yunshu,

118
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,560
may I stay here?

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,080
Of course.

120
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,480
You may live here

121
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,480
if you like.

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,240
I'm going to live here as well.

123
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,560
Why are you trying to stay here?

124
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,500
I'll give you everything you want.
Just leave.

125
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,000
Do you have money?

126
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,510
I thought you desired my dragon blood.

127
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,150
Why do you want money?

128
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,010
None of your business.

129
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,440
If he can't pay me, I'll live here

130
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,920
and use his debt to pay for my rent.

131
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,640
Since he's your bodyguard,

132
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,720
I'll live here with him.

133
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,760
That's reasonable, right?

134
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,520
Yeah.

135
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,960
That's reasonable.

136
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,860
(Why am I thinking
about him all the time?)

137
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,840
(Don't tell me I've fallen for him.)

138
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,920
Who's there?

139
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,720
Yunshu, it's me.

140
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,520
Come in.

141
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,400
Have a seat.

142
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,160
How is it?

143
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,160
Is everything ready?

144
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,150
Do you need anything else?

145
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,210
Yeah, everything's ready.

146
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,290
If so, why did you come here
at such a late hour?

147
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,040
I just wanted
to spend some time with you.

148
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,680
Wait.

149
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,600
Do you still remember this bangle?

150
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,360
What is this?

151
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,990
You still remember, huh?

152
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,520
This is Mom's keepsake.

153
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,560
Each of us

154
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,880
has one.

155
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,660
I'm the one who should apologize.

157
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,800
I couldn't locate you earlier.

158
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,500
You suffered because of me.

159
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,440
You should stop.

160
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,440
I know everything.

161
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Back then, I've helped Mo Shenhai
to gather intel related to you.

162
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,020
But I had no idea
that you were my sister.

163
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,640
Let's drop the past.

164
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,760
In the future,
let's lead a peaceful life together.

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,100
Have you come up with a way
to deal with Mo Shenhai?

166
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,240
What do you think?

167
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,980
I stopped you from
dealing with him before this

168
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,000
because I was indebted to him.

169
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,720
But now, we're even.

170
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,160
I don't know who Black-robed Man is.

171
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,880
I only know that he has served Mo Shenhai
for many years.

172
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,890
Mo Shenhai is able
to get to where he is today

173
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,360
mostly due to his contribution.

174
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,160
He keeps his identity a secret.

175
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,880
And, he's crafty and intelligent.

176
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,280
He almost landed me in huge trouble

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,720
several times even though I had Aojue
and Chongming as my bodyguards.

178
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,400
Right now, our only plan is
to stall him and come up

179
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,440
with a plan accordingly.

180
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,080
He and Mo Shenhai
don't have the same goal.

181
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,000
He followed Mo Shenhai for many years.

182
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,200
Even so, he never told him
about the Dragon Pearl.

183
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,000
I had to fish the intel
out of Chongming.

184
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,800
Chongming always acted cautiously.

185
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,880
Why would he...

186
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,120
Yuzi, don't blame him.

187
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,520
I was the one who got him drunk.

188
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Do you fancy him?

189
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,000
Yes, I do.

190
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,080
I think he's pretty good.

191
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,400
But what does he think about you?

192
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,520
I don't know.

193
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,840
But,

194
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,400
he bought me a meal.

195
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,880
I won't stop you
as long as you can figure it out.

196
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,920
But you need to know something.

197
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,440
He isn't human.

198
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,600
He has lived for ages.

199
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,720
I understand.

200
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,960
Yuzi, what about you?

201
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,800
I realized that Aojue,

202
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,760
Zhang Mingkai,

203
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,760
and Chongming

204
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,480
all fancy you.

205
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,440
I'm already a member of the Hu family.

206
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,120
Zhenxuan protected me with his life.

207
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,200
How could I betray him?

208
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,600
Aojue,

209
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,840
don't tell me you called me here

210
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,920
just to fight with me.

211
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,960
You were the one who told Mo Shenhai
about the Dragon Pearl, right?

212
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,320
I did so in order to drive a wedge

213
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,280
between Mo Shenhai and Black-robed Man.

214
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,110
Or were you trying to get rid of me
with the help of Black-robed Man

215
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,960
so that you can have Shan Yunshu
for yourself?

216
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
I thought of that before.

217
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,880
But couldn't you tell?

218
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,520
Shan Yunshu has fallen for someone.

219
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,720
Who is it?

220
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,480
Are you pretending to be dumb?

221
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,120
Or are you just an idiot?

222
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,120
Was it Zhang Mingkai?

223
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,160
I don't know about him.

224
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,640
But Shan Yunshu

225
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,980
is sincere toward you.

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,350
When we were outside the warehouse,

227
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,080
I stopped her from seeking her demise.

228
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,840
I could tell from her expression
that she cared about you.

229
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,480
And, she was willing
to sacrifice her life for you.

230
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,680
Really?

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,480
Is there a need for me to lie to you?

232
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,120
I won't fight you for her.

233
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,180
However, the Dragon Pearl

234
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,400
is the key to sustaining my life.

235
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,440
I can give you

236
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,960
the Dragon Pearl.

237
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,530
But you have to wait until we die...

238
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,140
That won't do.

239
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,860
What do you mean?

240
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,190
I can't afford to wait that long.

241
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,890
The heavenly tribulation is nearing.

242
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,200
If I don't obtain
the Dragon Pearl by then,

243
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,760
I'll die.

244
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,520
You're already in the underworld.

245
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,190
What do you mean?

246
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,120
Both of us formed a pact

247
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,480
with the Dragon Pearl together.

248
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,400
That's our largest trial.

249
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
If we can't overcome it,

250
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,480
we'll die of old age
together with Shan Yunshu.

251
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,520
You won't receive
the heavenly tribulation.

252
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,640
If not,

253
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,600
you would've been dead

254
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,560
during the 20 years we were sealed away.

255
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,120
Do you mean

256
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,080
Shan Yunshu

257
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,420
is my heavenly tribulation?

258
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,920
We and the Black-robed Man

259
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,720
were bound by the same pact.

260
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,990
That means we're facing
a trial at the same time.

261
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,550
In the end, only one of us can
acquire the Dragon Pearl and survive.

262
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,000
Why are you telling me all this?

263
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,320
Initially,

264
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,280
I was confident
in obtaining the Dragon Pearl.

265
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,800
But after that,

266
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,720
I fell for Shan Yunshu.

267
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,360
I suddenly felt like

268
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,680
spending a lifetime together

269
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,040
with the person I love

270
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,640
was much better than

271
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,800
spending time in that cold Dragon Palace.

272
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,000
Don't get ahead of yourself yet.

273
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,920
According to my observation,

274
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,160
it's not that Shan Yunshu
doesn't like Zhang Mingkai entirely.

275
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,120
You have to do your best.

276
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,600
Long'er.

277
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,900
What are you doing?

278
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,040
I love you.

279
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,180
♪Because our meeting was meant to happen
a thousand years later♪

280
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,520
♪Loving you
is more than I ever hoped for♪

281
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,110
♪I run to be in your arms♪

282
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,080
♪I don't want our moment to end♪

283
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,740
♪Because our meeting was meant to happen
a thousand years later♪

284
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,030
♪I can't express my sadness with words♪

285
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,720
♪So I whisper the overwhelming love♪

286
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:39,500
♪I won't let this moment end♪

287
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,560
Yuzi, I sacrificed my life to protect you.

288
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,240
How could you cheat on me?

289
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,080
You have dark eye circles.

290
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,320
Did you lose sleep last night?

291
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,520
Yunshu.

292
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,000
Look.

293
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,000
This is the breakfast
I've prepared for you.

294
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,710
You don't need
to hire a cook in the future.

295
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,870
I'll make breakfast for you
for the rest of your life.

296
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,040
You're quite amazing.

297
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,240
Of course.

298
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,880
Wow.

299
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,240
They look delicious.

300
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,720
Hunk,

301
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,360
I wonder who's lucky enough

302
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,120
to be your future wife.

303
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,200
Yunshu.

304
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,240
Eat up, Yunshu.

305
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,960
Yunshu, is it nice?

306
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,680
Every dish is different.

307
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,120
Won't I end up being a swine?

308
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,120
How could that be?

309
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,240
At most, you'll end up
like Consort Yang.

310
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
How would you be a swine?

311
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,220
You and your honeyed words.

312
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,560
Ao, are you done eating?

313
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,160
He has a small appetite, huh?

314
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,440
I can tell
that he's a 1,000-year-old virgin.

315
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,160
He's beyond hope.

316
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,480
He's inferior indeed.

317
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,960
(Last time, Yunshu said she fancied me.)

318
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,920
(Something's off.)

319
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,720
(If so, why is she flirting
with Zhang Mingkai?)

320
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,120
Who's there?

321
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,440
I'm not eating anything he cooks.

322
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,160
Take it away.

323
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,760
Shan Yunshu, you...

324
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,950
What are you doing here?

325
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,800
Where's Shan Yunshu?

326
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,320
Shan Yunshu?

327
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,920
You only have eyes for her.

328
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,200
She left the house long ago.

329
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,520
She left the house?

330
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,400
Why didn't she tell me about it?

331
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,230
I think she returned
to her family's old mansion.

332
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,790
This won't do.

333
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,710
It's dangerous outside.

334
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,620
I need to look for her.

335
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,840
Don't worry.

336
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,190
Everyone else is keeping her company.

337
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,400
She'll be fine.

338
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,240
Look at how infatuated you are.

339
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,480
You've truly brought shame
to the Dragon Clan.

340
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,000
Is it that obvious?

341
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,880
Your Highness,

342
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,720
you're truly a naive little sweetheart.

343
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,000
What she needs is a boyfriend,

344
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,600
not a son.

345
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,000
Can you please show her
your charm as a grown man?

346
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,520
Was I childish?

347
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,240
Not at all. You just needed a pacifier,

348
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,940
and you could
play the part of a big baby.

349
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,480
What should I do, then?

350
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,560
Your Highness,

351
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,800
please open your eyes

352
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,160
and look at your rival.

353
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,160
He's young,

354
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,920
fair,

355
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,800
eloquent,

356
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,800
has a driving license,

357
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,560
can cook,

358
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,560
and address her as

359
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,160
Yunshu all day long.

360
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,120
But you?

361
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,160
You act as if she owes you money.

362
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,680
If I encounter someone like Mingkai,

363
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,760
I would fall for him too.

364
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,280
Understood?

365
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,000
Why don't you use the Fox Clan's
seduction technique

366
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,400
to deal with Zhang Mingkai?

367
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,520
This way, he'll stop
thinking about Shan Yunshu.

368
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,480
This way, you can recover

369
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,480
Your Highness,

370
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,160
here's a piece of advice.

371
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,110
If you're free,

372
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,670
you should stop cultivating spiritual
energy and train your body.

373
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,550
You should study more

374
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,920
and improve your intellect.

375
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,800
Don't leave.

376
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,440
Help me out.

377
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,740
I can't just help you out for nothing.

378
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,960
What do you desire?

379
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,720
Dragon blood essence.

380
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,360
Remember, it's dragon blood essence.

381
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,800
Understood?

382
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,960
Are you a pervert?

383
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,510
Why do you need my blood essence?

384
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,320
To refine my pills.

385
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,680
Take it or leave it.

386
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,720
Deal.

387
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,800
Yunshu, I'll go and park the car first.

388
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,580
I'll come back soon.

389
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:13,960
