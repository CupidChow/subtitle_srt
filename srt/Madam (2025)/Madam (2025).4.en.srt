How dare you treat me like this?

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,380
If the Master Hu could see this,

18
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,760
he would be deeply disappointed.

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,680
Since you care so much about him,

20
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,200
why don't

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,520
you join him?

22
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,160
What are you trying to do?

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,840
I told you

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,880
to address me as "Madam."

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,240
From this moment on,

26
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,520
if you lie to me even once,

27
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,280
you will join Master.

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,280

00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,400
Yes,

00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,200
Madam.

31
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,200
Tell me.

32
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,960
Who sent people to kill me

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,400
and who helped
you steal Dongsheng from me?

34
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,440
I'm not saying anything.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,060
Just kill me if you want.

36
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,800
Mr. Zhao,

37
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,600
I know you're not completely heartless.

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,440
That's why I'm sparing your life.

39
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,040
In that case, I will...

40
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,320
Stop!

41
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,520
Can't bear it, can you?

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,400
I sent the assassin

43
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,600
and instigated Baozhu

44
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,180
to fight you for Dongsheng's inheritance.

45
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,560
I was also the one

46
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,720
who poisoned Master's daily medicine.

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
All for money?

48
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,338
Master Hu treated you well.
You never lacked food or clothing.

49
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:06,560
What more did you want?

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,030
It wasn't just about that.

51
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,800
It was also because of you.

52
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,040
Me?

53
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,500
Young Master died
for no reason while trying to save you.

54
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,080
Mr. Hu never forgot

55
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,680
to avenge Zhenxuan

56
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,280
and neither did I.

57
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,280
I dare not to.

58
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,200
Since you're part of the Wanlong Gang,

59
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,640
you must know

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,480
about the Mo Wenkai family massacre.

61
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
Tell me.

62
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,400
Was Mo Shenhai behind it?

63
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,040
If I'm right,

64
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,980
you're Mo Wenkai's daughter,

65
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,360
Mo Yuzi,

66
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,760
aren't you?

67
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,400
What is so funny?

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,920
Do you really think

69
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,200
your so-called

70
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,760
Master Hu Zeyuan

71
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,080
was that innocent?

72
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,560
What are you talking about?

73
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,720
Twenty years ago,

74
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,040
Hu Zeyuan was the main culprit

75
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,920
behind

76
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,440
the massacre of the Mo family.

77
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,200
He was one of those
who destroyed your Mo family!

78
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,080
Enough of your nonsense.

79
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,160
Back then, Master Hu also had his eyes
on the opium smuggling profits.

80
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,160
That's why he turned a blind eye.

81
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,600
Later,

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,140
your father got in the way.

83
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,480
So Mo Shenhai

84
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,360
wanted him dead.

85
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,520
Master Hu knew what was coming.

86
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,680
That's why

87
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,680
your backup never arrived.

88
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,640
You're clever.

89
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,040
You must've realized it by now.

90
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,440
His kindness for you

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,000
was only guilt over the past.

92
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,690
Half of Dongsheng's assets

93
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,640
are stained

94
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,560
in your parents' blood.

95
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
As for Mo Shenhai...

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,900

100

101
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,240
Madam,

102
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,990
you should watch your weight.

Who cares?

105
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Just kill him quickly

106
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
so I can go take my bath.

107
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,760
I was ambushed.

108
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,800
He took my blood.

109
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,680

110
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,920

166
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,920

00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,250
From now on,
you need to run everything by me.

189
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,440
Okay.

190
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,760
Is there anybody

191
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
I can even trust anymore?

192
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,160
Even Mr. Hu lied to me.

193
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,920
Sometimes,

194
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,520
there's no point to this life.

195
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,120
Do any of you know a way

196
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,800
to let me see Zhenxuan again?

197
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,990
Chongming knows
a dream-summoning technique.

198
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,800
Ask him.

199
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,200
Chongming,

200
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,680
help me.

201
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:33,840
Madam,

202
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,320
you are drunk.

203
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,880
I'll take you back to your room.

204
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,480
I'm ordering you

205
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,840
to help me.

206
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,560
All right.

Are you following the Pact's command

212
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,280
or are you falling for this girl?

213
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,800

Chongming,

217
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:22,160
thank you.

218
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:26,680
Just two drinks,
and you're already a mess.

219
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,600
When you wake up tomorrow
and remember what happened tonight,

220
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,480
you'll probably regret it.

221
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,040
Tell me.

222
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:37,640
Does that dream technique really exist?

223
00:11:38,923 --> 00:11:40,640
Can I really see Zhenxuan again?

224
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,440
You sure ask a lot of questions.

225
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:44,360
There's no such technique.

226
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,100
If you truly miss someone,

227
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,120
they'll come to you in a dream.

228
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:50,800
But

229
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,480
my life isn't my own anymore.

230
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,490
It was bought with the lives
of my parents

231
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:57,200
and Zhenxuan.

232
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,440
How could I waste it?

233
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
I have to take revenge.

234
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,520
I must avenge them.

235
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,520
Maybe

236
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,880
they wouldn't want that.

237
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:08,480
They loved you.

238
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,790
And because of that,

239
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,567
they probably hoped

240
00:12:13,672 --> 00:12:14,960
you would find

241
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
something more meaningful

242
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,440
and truly worth living for.

243
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,440
Do you really believe that?

244
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,160
Me?

245
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,160

are dead.

259
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,520
I failed to kill Shan Yunshu.

Did you uncover anything?

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,440
Shan Yunshu set fire to the place

were secretly interrogated.

263
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,280
What kind of place was it?

264
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,960
An abandoned house in Qingyi Alley.

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,320

269
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,160
get Chief Wu over here.
