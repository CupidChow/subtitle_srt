=Episode 5=

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,480
Excuse me, gentlemen.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,320
I'm here on official duty.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,160
If Madam is truly innocent,

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,480
I, Zhang Mingkai,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,280
will make sure to clear her name.

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,110
Do you want to part with your tongue?

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,160
Keep it down.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,840
Don't disturb Madam's rest.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,320
Then

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,760
please go upstairs and wake her.

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,000
If

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,160
she resists arrest, things might get
a lot harder to explain.

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,160
It seems

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,580
you don't want
to keep your tongue anymore.

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,640
No hard feelings, then.

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,120
Detective Zhang.

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,560
Madam.

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,400
I haven't bought you a meal,

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,880
and here you are showing up at my door.

27
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,520
Good morning, Madam.

28
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,390
Last night, the abandoned house
in Qingyi Alley caught fire.

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,520
Madam Zeng and Zhao Xuyao perished
in the flames.

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,920
You took them away.

31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,330
The Chief wants me
to bring you in for questioning.

32
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,320
I indeed went to Qingyi Alley
last night.

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,560
But by the time I arrived,
they were already dead.

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,440
You're very frank, Madam.

35
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,760
But I suspect it
was not as simple as that.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,440
I ask

37
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,200
that you come with me to the precinct.

38
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,440
Don't worry.

39
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,840
If you're innocent,

40
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,480
I'll make sure justice is served.

41
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,160
Can you tell me

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,600
who reported it?

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,200
The Chief said it was a servant
from your household.

44
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,200
So

45
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,800
I'm the prime suspect.

46
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,560
I'd rather not believe that.

47
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,360
After all,

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
we still have a meal to share.

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,840
All right, then.

50
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,400
I'll go with you.

51
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,680
But before that,

52
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,840
can you wait for a moment?

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,640
I'd like to speak to my bodyguards.

54
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,000
Very well, Madam.

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
I shall wait outside.

56
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,900
(Mo City Police Department)

57
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,640
You truly are stunning.

58
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,190
Beauty like yours could topple kingdoms.

59
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,920
I've never seen anything like this before.

60
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,680
Detective Zhang, you're flattering me.

61
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,880
During the probing,

62
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,800
you only need to answer truthfully.

63
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,320
Please ask.

64
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,040
What were you doing

65
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,710
during the Hai hour last night?

66
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,640
I went to question Madam Zeng
and Mr. Zhao

67
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,880
about the attempt on my life.

68
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,800
Did you kill them?

69
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,840
No.

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,880
Did you get

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,920
any useful information?

72
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,040
They weren't the ones behind it.

73
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,120
Someone else gave the orders.

74
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,120
The mastermind was someone else.

75
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,120
And who would that be?

76
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,840
Mo Shenhai.

77
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,620
Do you have any evidence?

78
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,520
No, everyone involved is dead.

79
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,560
So you're accusing Mo Shenhai

80
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,360
of orchestrating
the assassination attempt?

81
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,560
Yes.

82
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,300
Why would he want you dead?

83
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,040
To seize control
of Dongsheng Trading Company.

84
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,160
But

85
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,000
you have no proof
of Mo Shenhai murdering them.

86
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,880
I've found a new lead.

87
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,240
So, are you planning

88
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,520
to go head-to-head

89
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,120
with Mo Shenhai next?

90
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm not planning.

91
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,920
I am already executing it.

92
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,640
I've been at it
since the day I took over Dongsheng.

93
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,160
Madam, can you let me join you?

94
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,280
What do you mean?

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,640
To be honest,

96
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,420
I've been investigating you for a while.

97
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,460
I joined the Mo City Police Department
to gather evidence against Mo Shenhai.

98
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,560
That man is not an ordinary person.

99
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,920
It's you, again.

100
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,040
This girl was right.

101
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,800
This brat just keeps showing up to die.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,960
Put Madam down!

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,890
We fell for his trick.

104
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,360
Can you feel that?

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,400
It's the Spirit-Gathering Formation.

106
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,000
Her life could be in danger.

107
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Are you worried about her

108
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,280
or the dragon pearl in her body?

109
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,600
Is there any difference?

110
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,880
I'm afraid your pretense
might become real

111
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,840
and end up falling in too deep
to get out.

112
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,080
So,

113
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,390
did anything happen
between you two last night?

114
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,640
It's none of your business.

115
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,040
You should worry about yourself.

116
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,960
Tsk.

117
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,360
All I care about is the pearl.

118
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,000
I figured after your ambush failed
yesterday,

119
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,920
you would try something else.

120
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,700
I just didn't expect it to be this fast.

121
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,600
So this was all on purpose.

122
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,800
Smart of you.

123
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,440
Bold, too.

124
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,000
But you've overestimated yourself.

125
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,960
Even if your two bodyguards show up,

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,240
they won't be able to save you.

127
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,000
Do you think

128
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,080
I can't hurt you just

129
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,380
because the dragon pearl
is protecting you?

130
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,800
Let me tell you something.

131
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,040
I've suffered under the seal
for 20 years

132
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,040
and found this formation.

133
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,480
With this formation,

134
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,720
I can weaken the seal's hold

135
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,800
and extract

136
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,760
the dragon pearl from your body
by force.

137
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,280
You're working for Mo Shenhai.

138
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
If you do what I say,

139
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,440
I can let you suffer less.

140
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
I can give you the pearl

141
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,120
if you want it.

142
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,280
But help me kill Mo Shenhai.

143
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,640
How about that?

144
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,990
I don't need your permission

145
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,080
to obtain what I want.

146
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,190
When the Spirit-Gathering Formation
is completed,

147
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,640
I have ways to extract the pearl myself.

148
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,920
Before I die,

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,280
can you at least tell me

150
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,800
why you want the dragon pearl so badly?

151
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,400
Stalling for time doesn't help at all.

152
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,040
If I'm right,

153
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,680
this formation

154
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,000
doesn't just weaken the seal,

155
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,720
but it's also restricting your power.

156
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,480
Am I right?

157
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,720
You think I didn't notice?

158
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,240
Let her go.

159
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,560
You won't get away.

160
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,080
Take one step closer,

161
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,240
and she dies.

162
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,200
It looks like the seal's hold on you

163
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,600
is stronger than we thought.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,640
Don't you know?

165
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,920
If you kill her,

166
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,160
you'll die too.

167
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,440
Judging from your moves,

168
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,380
you're using the Dragon Clan's
Shape-shifting Technique.

169
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,280
Are you one of them?

170
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,600
I am just a nobody.

171
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,700
No need for Your Highness
to remember my name.

172
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,600
Still, I might have a proposal
that benefits us all.

173
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,520
Your Highness,

174
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,920
would you care to hear it?

175
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:32,960
Speak.

176
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,040
You're both familiar

177
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,680
with the Spirit-Gathering Formation.

178
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,480
With it,

179
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,840
we can extract the pearl's power
from her body.

180
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,320
Then,

181
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,240
we split the power into three parts.

182
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,720
Everyone gets what they want. A win-win.

183
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,920
Gentlemen,

184
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,760
what do you say?

185
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
It is a perfect solution.

186
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,320
Then let's have Mr. Chongming
and Your Highness

187
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,960
step into the formation.

188
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,880
We'll carry out the ritual together.

189
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,960
You two...

190
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,320
Are you betraying the promise we made?

191
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,320
We promised you

192
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,040
to kill Mo Shenhai and avenge you

193
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,800
once we got the pearl.

194
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,040
So rest in peace.

195
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,160
You haven't mastered

196
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,080
the Shape-shifting Technique yet.

197
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,880
You're coming with me!

198
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,200
Heartscale?

199
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,440
You're hurt?

200
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,320
Let me take a look.

201
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,000
No need.

202
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,520
What are you looking at?

203
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,240
When did you give her the Heartscale?

204
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,800
Do I need your permission

205
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
to do anything?

206
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,760
Heartscale?

207
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:18,960
What's that?

208
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,390
The dragon's Heartscale

209
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,680
is a dragon's vulnerable spot.

210
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,800
It's the hardest thing in the world

211
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,300
and the one place a dragon
cannot be touched.

212
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,200
It's the Heart Protecting Scale.

213
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,290
And it can only be given willingly
by a member of the Dragon Clan.

214
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,000
I can't believe you gave it to her.

215
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,680
It was meant to fend you.

216
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,370
In case you tried to steal the pearl
while I wasn't looking.

217
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,840
So,

218
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,880
when did you put it on me?

219
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,360
I never even noticed.

220
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,100
I'm a celestial being.

221
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,440
Do you think I'd let you notice?

222
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,700
Just take good care of yourself

223
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,280
and stop causing me trouble.

224
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,360
Madam!

225
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,360
Mingkai.

226
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:10,920
Madam,

227
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,520
I'm here.

228
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,280
Are you okay?

229
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,320
Madam,

230
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,320
I was worried sick.

231
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,640
If anything bad happened to you,

232
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,840
I will die with you.

233
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,920
I'm perfectly fine.

234
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,960
But you look badly injured.

235
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,720
Madam, don't take it wrongly.

236
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,960
I had an older sister.

237
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,400
But she was kidnapped by bad guys.

238
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,240
Whenever I see you, I think of her.

239
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,320
So I got carried away.

240
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:29,920
Madam,

241
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,160
please don't take it to heart.

242
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,320
Thank you.

243
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,920
Madam,

244
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,000
how about you become my god-sister?

245
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,180
From now on,
your enemies are my enemies.

246
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,080
What do you say?

247
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
That's a little sudden.

248
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,880
Madam,

249
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,280
don't you want to?

250
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,120
Why not?

251
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,360
Chongming,

252
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,690
I've lived this long

253
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,320
and never knew Mo City's green tea
[*Manipulative flirt]

254
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,720
was this renowned.

255
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,440
I only drink wine.

256
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm not into green tea.

257
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,160
Green tea?

258
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,000
You like green tea, my friend?

259
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,700
I have some top-shelf stuff at home.

260
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,500
I'll send some over.

261
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,560
Save the flattery.

262
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,780
I'm not your friend.

263
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,760
That's enough.

264
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,880
What's your status report?

265
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,490
Mo City Police Department has fallen.

266
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,600
The key suspects were taken.

267
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,500
There were casualties.

268
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,520
The Chief is furious.

269
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,160
I've been looking all over for you.

270
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,080
So, what happened?

271
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,120
So,

272
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,440
who was the attacker?

273
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,960
Most likely Mo Shenhai's men.

274
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,960
Him again.

275
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,720
That man is out of control.

276
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,960
Won't that mean you're in danger?

277
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,890
Do you want me
to be your personal bodyguard?

278
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:31,920
You?

279
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,960
Protect her?

280
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,160
Don't make things worse.

281
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,080
That's right.

282
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,680
Even with your two elite guards,

283
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,360
you got played too.

284
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,960
I'm not much use.

285
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,440
But

286
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,880
if you ever need me, just call.

287
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
With my men around,

288
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,360
Mo Shenhai

289
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,560
will have to think twice.

290
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,000
Thank you so much.

291
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,280
Shameless.

292
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,440
Yunshu,

293
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,200
I'll send you home.

294
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,600
Come on.

295
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,080
Okay.

296
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,460
(Last night)

297
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,720
You, girl.

298
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,840
Stop pretending to be drunk and get up.

299
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,990
If you were really drunk,
you wouldn't be running your mouth.

300
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,920
Calling Chongming intimately, huh?

301
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,520
Aren't you embarrassed?

302
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,000
Well,

303
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,720
I'm not here to steal anyone.

304
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,500
I have something to say so get up.

305
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,670
How can you be this drunk
from a little bit of wine?

306
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,320
This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

307
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,800
It'd be a waste not to mess
with you a little.

308
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,600
I can't hurt you
because of the dragon pearl.

309
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,200
So I'll draw a turtle.

310
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,080
That'll ease my rage.

311
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,640
It's hot.

312
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,800
What are you doing?

313
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,800
It's hot.

314
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,760
I'll help you cool down.

315
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,320
It's so hot.

316
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,240
You're faking, aren't you?

317
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,500
Are you trying
to mess with me or yourself?
