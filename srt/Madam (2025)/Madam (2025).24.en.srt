8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,680
Yunshu.

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,760
You're awake.

10
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,960
Shan Yunshu willingly gave up
the Dragon Pearl

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,280
so she couldn't extend her life.

12
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,720
So

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,200
she's not planning to come back alive?

14
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,360
Yes.

15
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,560
She wouldn't listen to me.

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,640
It's not your fault.

17
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,520
Can you send me

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,560
back in again?

19
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,680
It's out of my depth.

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,560
Shan Yunshu used her own blood
to activate the formation

21
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,120
and her body and soul

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,080
to seal Aofeng.

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,800
Without her blood,

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,200
the formation won't open.

25
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,640
Wait.

26
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,600
Her blood is in me,

27
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,320
and mine is in her.

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,360
What?

29
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,400
The Dragon Pearl can save you.

30
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,240
They need it more than I do now.

31
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,160
If Madam dies,

32
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,640
Yuhan will be heartbroken.

33
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,840
She's her only family.

34
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Chongming.

35
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,400
Yuhan.

36
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,680
Don't be sad.

37
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,240
I will never

38
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,120
forget you.

39
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,800
I love you.

40
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,320
Yunshu.

41
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,880
Yunshu. Come with me.

42
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,600
Shhh.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,320
Back then, I lost my parents,

44
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,320
and Zhenxuan died tragically.

45
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,640
I was devastated.

46
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,680
I almost took my own life several times.

47
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,560
It was Aofeng.

48
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,860
He disguised himself
as the Masked Master

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,330
and taught me martial arts skills.

50
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,240
He gave me hope.

51
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,920
You two are very alike.

52
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm luckier than he.

53
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,880
The Hu family treated me well.

54
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,880
You're more grateful than Aofeng.

55
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,380
You've let go of your hatred.

56
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,520
It's not that Aofeng can't let go
of his hatred,

57
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,240
he just can't forgive himself.

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,280
Who are you?

59
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,000
He's my boyfriend.

60
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,760
You can call him Brother.

61
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,040
He...

62
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,360
He'll always remain in the night

63
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,160
before you appear.

64
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,760
Miss,

65
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
I'm hungry.

66
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,120
I'll make you something, all right?

67
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,320
Sure.

68
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,720
It should be cooked by now.

69
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,560
Are you all right?

70
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,840
You're careless.

71
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,760
Does it hurt?

72
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,040
No.

73
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,640
I'll handle this kind of thing.

74
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,120
Don't get hurt anymore.

75
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,480
Are you sure you can handle this?

76
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,720
I've lived a thousand years.

77
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,720
What can't I do?

78
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,800
You've lived a thousand years,

79
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,920
but why is your cooking still bad?

80
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,000
Uh...

81
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,160
I'm the Crown Prince.

82
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,080
They're people serving me.

83
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,640
If so,

84
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,080
Your Highness,

85
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,880
will you...

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,720
Yes, I will.

87
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,520
Roast a chicken for me?

88
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,040
Sure.

89
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,490
- Where's the chicken?
- Where's the chicken?

90
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,920
It's not done. Don't eat it.

91
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,320
Not bad.

92
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,200
It tastes pretty good.

93
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,080
Perhaps

94
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,320
this is the life Aofeng really wanted.

95
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,040
Right.

96
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,120
Why did you come back?

97
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't want to leave you.

98
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,280
When you tried to kill yourself
in my yard,

99
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,880
did you think about me?

100
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,720
That's different.

101
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,160
I'd rather die than see you get hurt.

102
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,000
But I'm just like you.

103
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,240
Silly,

104
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,200
you're always so selfish.

105
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,640
You never think about how I feel.

106
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,240
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,960
But now,

108
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,120
we might

109
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,720
be stuck here forever.

110
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,760
As long as you're with me, I'm not afraid.

111
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
I hope he's not here.

112
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,440
Miss,

113
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,680
what are you doing?

114
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,200
Something

115
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,680
got into my eyes,

116
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,400
so I asked him to blow it out.

117
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,840
We were kissing.

118
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,240
Don't talk nonsense.

119
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,320
What nonsense?

120
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,630
He'll find out sooner or later.

121
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,160
It's better to tell him now.

122
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
Why are you laughing?

123
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Are you two trying to have a baby?

124
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,720
What?

125
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,320
My mother told me

126
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,440
that when a man

127
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,520
kisses a woman, it's love.

128
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,480
And they want to have a baby.

129
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,720
Hmm.

130
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,240
There's not exactly what's going on,

131
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,640
but I do want to have a baby.

132
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,000
Mother,

133
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,440
you're back.

134
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,320
Mother,

135
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,560
where have you been?

136
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,840
I missed you so much.

137
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,320
I missed you, too.

138
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,880
Give me a moment, Mother.

139
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,320
Miss.

140
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,160
Brother.

141
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,200
I'm leaving.

142
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,080
Thank you for waiting with me.

143
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,120
Aojue.

144
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,640
Shan Yunshu.

145
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,600
Yuzi.

146
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,840
Yuzi.

147
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,680
Lili,

148
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,240
what's going on?

149
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,480
I don't know.

150
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,400
Maybe it's the Dragon Pearl.

151
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,880
Chongming's alive again.

152
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,840
Look!

153
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,680
They...

154
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,840
You!

155
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,160
Yuzi.

156
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,920
There, there.

157
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,040
I'm all right now.

158
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,200
Are you all right?

159
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,920
Yes.

160
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,560
Yunshu found the solution.

161
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,840
Aofeng let go of his hatred

162
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,920
and reunited with his mother.

163
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,080
Chongming...

164
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,400
Maybe because of the Dragon Pearl,

165
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,680
he won't die.

166
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm injured for saving you all.

167
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
And none of you cared.

168
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,600
You're heartless!

169
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,760
I had a good lunch.

170
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
You need to rest more, all right?

171
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,240
Make sure you have light meals.

172
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,040
All right, Yuzi.

173
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,560
Be careful.

174
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,080
I will.

175
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,000
Your wife's due soon, right?

176
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,800
Yes.

177
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,890
I've picked a few names,
but I haven't decided yet.

178
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,040
You brat

179
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,040
may look decent,

180
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,720
but

181
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,360
you're quick to act, huh?

182
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,360
Your Highness,

183
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
don't tell me

184
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,160
you're still a cherry boy.

185
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,520
Of course not.

186
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,160
I was being considerate of
Yunshu's feelings.

187
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,440
Are you actually

188
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
inexperienced?

189
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
Nonsense!

190
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,990
The Dragon Clan is highly experienced
in marriage.

191
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,400
You're bragging.

192
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,900
If you really are capable,

193
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,980
Madam would've married you
a long time ago.

194
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,280
I'm a bit short on money lately.

195
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,920
I need to gather enough bride price.

196
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,640
Otherwise, I'd look bad.

197
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,440
Why?

198
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,080
Have you spent a lot?

199
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,440
All because of Hu Lili.

200
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,560
She eats 1,000 chickens a day,

201
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,800
and I have to pay for it.

202
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,120
Actually, I think this is a good idea.

203
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,280
She's a big eater.

204
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,440
She eats a lot.

205
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,320
Yeah.

206
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,410
She's eaten so many chickens,
and she's still eating?

207
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,880
Sir,

208
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,680
another twenty chickens.

209
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,040
Miss,

210
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,120
this is our last one.

211
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,440
What?

212
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,760
That's it?

213
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,240
Is this how you run a business?

214
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,160
Miss,

215
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,880
you've eaten all the chicken in Mo City.

216
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,200
This one

217
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,480
is imported.

218
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,320
I overexerted myself

219
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,040
helping my friends.

220
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,760
I've even got Crow's feet now.

221
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,600
Chicken isn't enough for me.

222
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,600
Get some geese and ducks.

223
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,600
How many would you like?

224
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,720
Twenty of each.

225
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,000
Twenty?

226
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,040
Sure thing.

227
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,960
Twenty ducks and twenty geese.

228
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,200
Give us some time to prepare.

229
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,720
Stop pacing.

230
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,000
You're making me dizzy.

231
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,840
Why is it taking so long?

232
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,680
Giving birth takes time.

233
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,240
Sit down. She'll be fine.

234
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,680
You're only this calm
because it's not Shan Yunshu.

235
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,240
I'm not like you.

236
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,690
Even if it were Shan Yunshu in labor,
I wouldn't be nervous.

237
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,320
Then,

238
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,040
why don't you get her pregnant first?

239
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,080
Are you doubting me?

240
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,240
How's it going?

241
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,040
Everything is fine. Don't worry.

242
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,280
But I do have a question.

243
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,240
What is it?

244
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,240
When dragons marry humans,

245
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,080
do they lay eggs?

246
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,400
The midwife said

247
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,160
she saw something round.

248
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,080
Something round?

249
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,860
Why are you laughing?

250
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,160
This is a serious question.

251
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
It affects how
the midwife handles the delivery.

252
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,400
No.

253
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,240
I was born in human form.

254
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,600
It won't be an egg.

255
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,560
That's a relief.

256
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,200
You never know.

257
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,840
I was hatched from an egg.

258
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,360
Is that strange?

259
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,980
Why are you looking at me like that?

260
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,480
I don't want to lay eggs for you.

261
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,760
Don't! I was joking.

262
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,640
Young Master,

263
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,800
congratulations.

264
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,040
It's a boy.

265
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,240
Yunshu!

266
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,000
Forgive me. Let's have a baby, too.

267
00:16:09,714 --> 00:16:10,548
Yunshu!
