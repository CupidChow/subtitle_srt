Madam.

Yunshu.

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,320
Yunshu?

00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,680
Madam.

00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,880
Madam?

Madam.

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,520
Yuzi.

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,320
What happened to me?

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,560
You fainted.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,680
Do you feel unwell?

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,080
It's nothing.

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,720
I just feel exhausted.

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,720
Tell us again what happened.

26
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,840
Yuzi and I came here together.

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,760
After that, she cried.

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,480
She fainted shortly after that.

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,960
If you dare to try anything funny,

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,240
I'll definitely kill you.

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,000
Chongming,

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,440
it isn't Yuhan's fault.

33
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,500
I was just reminded of my tragic past
after seeing the item.

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,800
Let's go back.

35
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,960
Okay.

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,720
You guys are back.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,890
What do you guys think?

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,680
Isn't it nice?

39
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,880
What the heck are you doing?

40
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,320
The mansion looked cold and desolate.

41
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,120
You've found
your younger sister as well.

42
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,360
Aojue and I decorated the mansion,

43
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,600
Count this as a celebration.

44
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,720
There are so many types of seafood here.

45
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,840
I've never seen them before.

46
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,720
Did Aojue

47
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
make these dishes?

48
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,720
I made most of them.

49
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,840
Aojue bought the ingredients.

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,080

Happy birthday.

62
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,080
Please have some cakes.

63
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
You guys are mistaken.

64
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,840
Today isn't Yunshu's birthday.

65
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,360
Her birthday is in January.

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,320
I know that.

67
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,240
That's not it.

68
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,260
My sister's lunar birthday falls on
the fifth day after the Winter Solstice.

69
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,660
I almost forgot about it
had you not reminded me.

70
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:17,600
In order to conceal my identity,

71
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,800
I've converted my lunar birthday
to the solar calendar.

72
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,460
I've never celebrated it
all these years.

73
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,680
How did you guys find out?

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,360
Aojue was the one who discovered it.

75
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,720
But it's right on your fake tombstone.

76
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,680
You really are
such a straight guy, aren't you?

77
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,760
He's so good at joking.

78
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,880
Enough.

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,990
I'll accept your flowers.

80
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,960
Thank you for
celebrating my birthday for me.

81
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,160
Let's enjoy the cake.

82
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,014
Thank you,

83
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:44,632
Miss Lili.

84
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,589
I'm glad that you're happy.

85
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,510
Please take your seats.

86
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,480
That was a sneaky move.

87
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:54,763
Despicable.

88
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,763
Look at all the seafood we have here.

89
00:03:56,763 --> 00:03:57,860
I haven't tried them before.

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,080
Let me try your cooking.

91
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,720
Where did you guys get all this seafood?

92
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,480
These are Chongming's relatives.

93
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,723

They're your relatives.

What a cold joke.

You!

98
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,840
Make a wish first.

99
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,160

Madam.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,640
Chongming?

107
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,680
Do you need anything?

108
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,960
Madam, I didn't prepare
any birthday gift for you.

109
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,560
This is the sacred treasure
of the Jiao Dragon Clan.

110
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,360
You can have it as your birthday gift.

111
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,000
Thank you, Chongming.

112
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,880
Madam,

113
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,280
you should rest early.

114
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,080
Okay.

115
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,760
Yunshu.

116
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,240
Mingkai.

117
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,420
Aojue launched a sneak attack.

118
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,130
I couldn't prepare a gift
for you in time.

119
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,240
This is the flower bouquet
I've prepared.

120
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,920
Happy birthday.

121
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,880
Wild lilies?

122
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,280
These are my favorite flowers.

123
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,000
I used to display them in my house.

124
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,840
Yunshu, don't worry.

125
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,350
Next time, I'll definitely prepare
a precious birthday gift for you.

126
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,020
No need for that.

127
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,360
I like this a lot.

128
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,720
If so, you should rest first.

129
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,590
I'll make a move now.

130
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,200
Okay.

131
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,880
You're

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,640
still awake?

133
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,680
Yeah.

134
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,200
Do you need anything?

135
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,680
It's...

136
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,880
It's nothing.

137
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,920
Thank you for today.

138
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,560
It's been so long
since I celebrated my birthday.

139
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,880
I'm very happy.

140
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,760
The small box in your hand,

141
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,000
is it for me?

142
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,200
I found it on the road.

143
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Do you want to try it?

144
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,120
What is it?

145
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:20,960
I don't know.

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,990
Take a look for yourself.

147
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,800
Show it to me.

148
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,640
It's beautiful.

149
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,880
Do you like it?

150
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,880
Help me put it on.

151
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,880
Aojue?

152
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,080
Aojue?

153
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,760
Aojue.

154
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,240
Shan Yunshu.

155
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,600
Go and check on her first.

156
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't worry.

157
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,880
She'll survive.

158
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,550
But you, your Heartscale has damaged
your heart meridian.

159
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,380
You were lucky that it was
an inch away from your heart.

160
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,360
If not, you would've been dead by now.

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,800
It's voodoo.

162
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,320
Speak.

163
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,160
I'm listening.

164
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
It's voodoo.

165
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,680
What?

166
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,000
How's Yunshu doing?

167
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,280
I examined her body just now.

168
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,280
I couldn't tell what was wrong with her.

169
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,080
Madam's body contains the Dragon Pearl.

170
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,880
Logically speaking,

171
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,760
she's immune to sorcery.

172
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,200
But judging from her expression,

173
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,880
it seems as if
she was controlled by someone.

174
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,520
What should we do, then?

175
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,990
Madam's body contains the Dragon Pearl.

176
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,440
Her life won't be in danger.

177
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,000
We should observe her and act accordingly.

178
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,440
That's our only choice for now.

179
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,840
What about Aojue?

180
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,960
How is he?

181
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,280
He's seriously wounded as well.

182
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,600
I'll go and check on him.

183
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,480
Okay.

184
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,480
About his injury...

185
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,720
His Heartscale damaged
his own heart meridian.

186
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,080
Luckily, the angle was slightly off.

187
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,480
If not,

188
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,360
no one could save him.

189
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,200
I've fed him with Shan Yunshu's blood.

190
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,560
He's recovering faster.

191
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,640
I've examined Shan Yunshu.

192
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,900
I didn't discover
anything abnormal with her.

193
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,440
Did something strange happen

194
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,280
when you guys went out yesterday?

195
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,360
Madam fainted at the
Shan's family old mansion yesterday.

196
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,280
But she regained
consciousness soon after.

197
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,080
There was nothing abnormal
with her body.

198
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,000
Shan Yunshu
is protected by the Dragon Pearl.

199
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,320
She's immune to sorcery.

200
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
In this world,

201
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,490
is there anything else besides sorcery

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,960
that can help place someone
under their control?

203
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,060
Have you ever heard
of the term "voodoo?"

204
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,800
Voodoo?

205
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,440
During ancient times,
all dragons had a lusty nature.

206
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,980
Most of their offspring
didn't become full-fledged dragons.

207
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,360
They sowed their seeds everywhere.

208
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,090
The Dragon Empress thought
that the Dragon King no longer loved her.

209
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,760
To win his heart back,

210
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,720
she sought the shaman of Miaojiang
for a potion of devotion.

211
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,480
After the Dragon King took the potion,

212
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,760
he killed the empress.

213
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,320
Since then, a special voodoo
was crafted for the Dragon Clan.

214
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,720
It's called Love Severance.

215
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
All men, leave the room.

216
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,600
No.

217
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,120
I'll wait here until Yunshu wakes up.

218
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,280
I need to examine her body.

219
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,680
It's inconvenient with you around.

220
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,240
Hurry and get out.

221
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,360
Fine, then.

222
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,040
Can you stop pacing back and forth?

223
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,400
You're making me dizzy.

224
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,120
If so, you should go upstairs.

225
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,120
Why are you waiting here?

226
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,360
Don't tell me

227
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,760
Yunshu is in trouble.

228
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,720
Shan Yunshu won't be in trouble
even if you're in trouble.

229
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,200
Stop arguing.

230
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,080
You guys are so annoying.

231
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,480
Wait.

232
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,440
So, what happened last night?

233
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,320
You were injured.

234
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,400
Yunshu was poisoned.

235
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
Explain yourself.

236
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,970
I was delivering
her birthday gift to her last night.

237
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,920
After that, the incident occurred.

238
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,560
You were delivering
her birthday gift?

239
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,870
Why didn't anything happen
when I delivered my gift to her, then?

240
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
How should I know?

241
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,640
You're truly a jinx.

242
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,270
Yunshu has never been able
to lead her life in peace

243
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,340
after she encountered you.

244
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,360
What did you say?

245
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,840
Who are you calling a jinx?

246
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,000
Listen.

247
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,800
We kissed each other last night.

248
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,200
Stop spouting nonsense.

249
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,680
Yunshu would never fancy you.

250
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,320
She doesn't like you at all.

251
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
If you don't believe me,

252
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,720
you can ask her about it
when she's awake.

253
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,680
How is it?

254
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,480
Just like what Aojue had predicted,

255
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,480
it's the voodoo, Love Severance.

256
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,920
I think someone
poisoned her food in secret.

257
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,240
Someone actually infiltrated
the mansion just to poison her food?

258
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,760
Love Severance?

259
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,320
Love Severance is a type of voodoo.

260
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,960
It won't harm the victim.

261
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,480
However, it'll affect
the victim's mental state.

262
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,350
The more she loves someone,
the more she wants to kill him.

263
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,760
She'll develop an urge to kill
as long as she loves someone.

264
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,040
Only by killing the one she loves

265
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,280
can her torment be eased.

266
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,560
However,

267
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,000
the voodoo lasts for a lifetime.

268
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,750
The only cure is
to forget about one's love.

269
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,680
Most of the victims died of torment

270
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,120
after the loss of their loved ones.

271
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,560
Even if they survive,

272
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,160
they'll lose their minds in the end.

273
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,240
It's a fate worse than death.

274
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,560
This is too much.

275
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,920
What are you laughing at?

276
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,840
She loves me.

277
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,480
Yuzi.

278
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,320
Yuzi, wake up.

279
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,760
What happened?

280
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,420
Seems like she's having a nightmare.

281
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,400
What's wrong with me?

282
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,800
Yuzi, you're awake.

283
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,200
You were struck with voodoo.

284
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,160
It's Love Severance.

285
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,680
I've suppressed it
with my sorcery for now.

286
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,970
You won't feel the urge
to kill Aojue immediately.

287
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,160
Aojue,

288
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,240
is he okay?

289
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,560
His heart meridian was damaged.

290
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,620
However, he drank your blood.
He's recovering rapidly.

291
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,400
He's probably grinning
to himself somewhere.

292
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,640
Grinning to himself?

293
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,240
When Love Severance acts up,

294
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,920
one will only kill the one they love.

295
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,600
Now, he knows
that he's the one you love the most.

296
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,680
He already forgot about the fact
that you would try to end his life.

297
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,680
What's wrong?

298
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
When I think about
that arrogant look on his face,

299
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,520
I feel like slapping him.

300
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,760
Me too.

301
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,920
Slap him on my behalf
when you have the chance.

302
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,200
However,

303
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,760
your sister and Zhang Mingkai
acted strangely

304
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,640
after I told them about
the effect of Love Severance.

305
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,480
I...

306
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,110
Although Love Severance
is a potent voodoo,

307
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,880
it shows who the victim
cares about the most.

308
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,560
The person I care about the most
is definitely Yuhan.

309
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,760
How could this be?

310
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,560
I'm not asleep yet.

311
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,720
I'm just passing by
on my way to the toilet.

312
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,520
Did I wake you up?

313
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,120
No.

314
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,280
I'm waiting for your apology.

315
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,480
Oh.

316
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
You mean your injury?

317
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,960
It hurts.

318
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,040
But I'll survive.

319
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,400
What about you?

320
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,400
I'm fine.

321
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,680
If there's nothing else,
I'll head back now.

322
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,660
You're brushing me off
with your apology, huh?

323
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,400
I almost died because of you, you know?

324
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,520
You didn't die, did you?

325
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,280
And, it's not like
I could control myself.

326
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,200
I was struck by voodoo.

327
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,880
You know

328
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,080
how the voodoo works, right?

329
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,840
I just woke up.

330
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,120
I don't know how Love Severance works.

331
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,280
What's wrong?

332
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,600
I didn't say it was Love Severance.

333
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,200
What do you mean by that?

334
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,520
Although I can't see you,

335
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,960
I can feel your emotions.

336
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,960
What's wrong with me?

337
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,180
Are you frustrated
that you've injured me?

338
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,560
Or are you frustrated
that you've fallen for me?

339
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:38,920
Aojue,

340
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,320
you better listen closely.

341
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,800
I'm married.

342
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,920
The person I fancy is Zhenxuan.

343
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,110
You mustn't
let your imagination run wild

344
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,310
or tell anyone about our relationship.

345
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,840
If not, I'll rip your mouth to shreds.

346
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,610
You already ripped my heart to shreds.

347
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,340
Ripping my mouth to shreds is nothing.

348
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,920
Are you truly Aojue?

349
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,000
Aojue would never
say something that disgusting.

350
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,520
Go and throw up, then.

351
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,280
I wish to tell you this.

352
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,880
I'm not telling you to forget about him.

353
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,320
After all,
he sacrificed his life to save you.

354
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,240
I'm glad that you know that.

355
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,280
However,

356
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,360
I've sacrificed myself
for you several times.

357
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,520
If my flesh body dies,

358
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,080
will you cry in front of my grave?

359
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,350
Good Samaritans are short-lived

360
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,510
while calamities live on for millennia.

361
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
You're old and alive.

362
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,480
I'll be going now.

363
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,360
Calm down.

364
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,840
Don't think about him.

365
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,920
She likes me.

366
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,640
She doesn't want to admit it.

367
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,680
I like that.

368
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,600
Have you met her?

369
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,320
What did she say?

370
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,000
What else?

371
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,990
She didn't want to admit
that she fancied me.

372
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,310
That's not what I'm talking about.

373
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,240
I'm talking about the voodoo.

374
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,480
Oh.

375
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Love Severance is unique
to the Dragon Clan.

376
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,080
And, it's been lost for many years.

377
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,960
If Black-robed Man is able
to get his hands on something like that,

378
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,320
it seems like

379
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,800
you might know who he is.

380
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,200
Actually, I think I know his identity.

381
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,960
Who is it?

382
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,310
You knew that I stole the Dragon Pearl
to save my brother, right?

383
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:03,880
Yes.

384
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,880
He was struck with Love Severance.

385
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,080
In order to make Aofeng sever
his ties with his mother,

386
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,990
my father poisoned him with the voodoo
through the food I delivered to him.

387
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,240
He murdered his own mother personally.

388
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,990
Your brother has
passed away for many years.

389
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,200
Logically speaking, the voodoo
should've vanished from trace.

390
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,280
How did Black-robed Man
get his hands on it?

391
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,920
Although I've overturned
my assumptions countless times,

392
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,900
in the end, it's likely that
Black-robed Man is my younger brother,

393
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,960
Aofeng.
