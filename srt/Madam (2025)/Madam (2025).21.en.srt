8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,360
I can give you anything.

But not my wife.

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,960
You barged in without your power.

11
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,800
You're doomed.

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,000
My silly brother.

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,720
Show me what you've learned.

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,040
(Dragon-Bind Formation.)

15
00:01:07,182 --> 00:01:08,331
What is going on?

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,160
Zhang Mingkai is here.

17
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,280
Detective Zhang.

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,800
Current evidence and reports indicate

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,920
that Mo Shenhai was behind
the Mo family massacre.

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,160
He also made several attempts
to assassinate Shan Yunshu.

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,440
Did the police know about this?

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,240
The department has received
the information.

23
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,480
Further investigation is underway.

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,330
We'll release updates.

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,760
Where is Mr. Mo Shenhai now?

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,200
Mr. Mo Shenhai, knowing the weight
of his crimes, has taken his own life.

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,400
Detective. Can you share
anything else with us?

28
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,240
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Detective Zhang.

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,480
- Detective Zhang.
- Please say something.

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,622
- Detective Zhang!
- Detective Zhang!

31
00:01:36,622 --> 00:01:37,520
- Detective Zhang!
- Please, we need to know!

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,320
Everyone,

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,600
that is all I can disclose.

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,660
Please stay where you are.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,834
- What...
- But...

36
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,685
After all this time...

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,920
The third pact seal is gone.

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,440
Does that mean the seal is
broken and you're free now?

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,160
Isn't that a good thing?

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,880
It means the Black-Robed Man
can torture your sister.

00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:11,260
(Wanted Poster)

42
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,120
Extra! Extra!

43
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,680
The police have shut down
two major chambers in Mo City!

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,080
Extra! Extra!

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,280
What is this?

46
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,240
What happened?

47
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,240
What does it say?

48
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,120
What is going on?

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,890
Mo Shenhai of
the Wanlong Chamber of Commerce

50
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,200
was involved in opium smuggling
and killed the Mo family.

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,280
He has now taken
his own life to avoid punishment.

52
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,520
Then, why was Dongsheng shut down too?

53
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,280
The Hu family of Dongsheng was
also involved in opium smuggling.

54
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,280
Looks like their assets
will not be safe either.

55
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,560
And Chief Wu?

56
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,840
Chief Wu is no better.

57
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,320
He took bribes and abused his power.

58
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,120
You need to rescue my sister.

59
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,440
Zhang Mingkai will not
hurt your sister for now.

60
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,760
Why not?

61
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,440
Zhang Mingkai is eager to catch us.

62
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,800
He must be trying
to carry out some plan,

63
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
afraid it will be ruined.

64
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,160
Until he catches us,

65
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,800
he won't make a reckless move.

66
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,280
That woman is a bodyguard.

67
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,280
The woman is an assassin.

68
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,860
(Wanted Poster)

69
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,040
I have already told Chongming
who you are.

70
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,960
They are already on their way here.

71
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,080
You brat.

72
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,760
The restriction spell has been lifted.

73
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,880
You can't hurt me anymore.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,720
Don't get cocky,

75
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,760
my dear brother.

76
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,720
I have plenty of ways

77
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,200
to deal with the Dragon Clan.

78
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,320
You'd better hurry.

79
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,360
With that parasitic
dark technique of yours,

80
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,640
you won't last long
burning through the spirit energy.

81
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,520
That is true.

82
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,160
But things are different
with the Dragon Pearl.

83
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,440
Is it worth it?

84
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,760
You let hate and desire
twist you into this.

85
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,360
Ever since the moment
my mother was poisoned to death,

86
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,120
there was no turning back for me.

87
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,880
If your mother could see you now,

88
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,360
she would be heartbroken.

89
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,680
My mother

90
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,800
would understand me.

91
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,000
Your mother had a terminal illness.

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,120
She was in constant pain.

93
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,560
She brought you to the Dragon Clan
so you could grow up in comfort.

94
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,160
But, you let her down.

95
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,240
If your mother was watching from above,

96
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,960
what hurts her most wouldn't be
the knife you gave her,

97
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,360
but the countless times
you stabbed yourself.

98
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,800
That stab from Shan Yunshu
made you happy, huh?

99
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,920
You...

100
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,760
What if...

101
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
she stabbed herself countless times too?

102
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,480
Aofeng,

103
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,120
if you lay a finger on Shan Yunshu,

104
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,360
I'll end you!

105
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,680
All that talk about righteousness,

106
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,240
about love and peace...

107
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,840
You love Shan Yunshu
so much you'd die for her.

108
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,800
Is my love for my mother any less?

109
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,960
You can't bear
to hurt Shan Yunshu at all.

110
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,160
And I...

111
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,560
should just live with the knife
in my mother's heart?

112
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,400
Why do I have to suffer like this?

113
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,560
Why?

114
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,880
Even if I was hit by Love Severance,
I'm still one of the culprits.

115
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,380
If I won't spare the Dragon Clan,

116
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,200
how could I ever spare myself?

117
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,160
Take your hatred
for the Dragon Clan out on me.

118
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,000
Leave Shan Yunshu out of it.

119
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,320
Aojue,

120
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,080
the Dragon Clan deserves to die.

121
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,520
But not you, Brother.

122
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,040
I know you've always been good to me.

123
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,600
Without you,

124
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,000
I wouldn't be alive.

125
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,880
You taught me spells,

126
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,520
grew up with me,

127
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,480
and made me strong.

128
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,200
You gave me everything
I imagined a father would.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,080
In this world,

130
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,920
besides my mother,

131
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,080
you treated me the best.

132
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,320
You mattered the most to me.

133
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Even later,

134
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,800
when you brought poison
and tragedy followed,

135
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,040
I still couldn't
bring myself to kill you.

136
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,840
I just couldn't.

137
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,560
But...

138
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,080
my mother's hatred

139
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,920
torments me day and night.

140
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,280
I had countless chances to kill you,

141
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,320
but I just couldn't do it.

142
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,720
I faked my death
to get the Dragon Pearl,

143
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,280
all because

144
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,000
I wanted you to leave the Dragon Clan.

145
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,800
But I never expected

146
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
you'd betray the whole Dragon Clan,

147
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,160
and steal the Dragon Pearl for me.

148
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,840
Aofeng,

149
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,640
it's still not too late to turn back.

150
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,600
Look at this.

151
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,760
Your mother had
already been laid to rest.

152
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,880
But, you dug up her body.

153
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,560
You...

154
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,080
It was because of you

155
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,080
that I still have
a shred of humanity left!

156
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,200
I hesitated and missed so many chances.

157
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
But, I have nowhere left to retreat.

158
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,120
The Dragon Pact has turned on me.

159
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,040
The dark technique I used

160
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,600
is devouring me

161
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,880
with its side effects.

162
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,800
My soul is about to be drained.

163
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,000
If I don't act now, it'll be too late.

164
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,280
Aofeng.

165
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,480
Don't hurt Shan Yunshu.

166
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,240
I'm begging you.

167
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,760
It's not impossible.

168
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,480
You just need to cooperate with me.

169
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,080
Okay.

170
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,320
As long as I can do it.

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,880
You must willingly use your own blood

172
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,600
to open the formation behind you.

173
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,880
Then, I can make sure
Shan Yunshu stays alive,

174
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,400
since you love her that much.

175
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,000
Yunshu.

176
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,800
What are you thinking about?

177
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,360
You've been by my side for so long.

178
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,800
Why didn't you act?

179
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,720
Because I fell for you.

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,300
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

181
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,920
I don't believe you.

182
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,480
Someone who could betray everything

183
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,840
would give up everything for a woman?

184
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,240
And I can't believe

185
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,280
I actually liked you.

186
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,200
You made me weak and hesitant.
I missed so many chances.

187
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,640
I thought you'd go on a hunger strike.

188
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,120
Looks like I was wrong.

189
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,960
Why should I?

190
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,840
Aren't you going
to ask how Aojue is doing?

191
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
You can't kill him.

192
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,440
But I can torture him.

193
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,200
You've been tormenting
your brother every single moment.

194
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,160
Will he even care about a little more?

195
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,280
So,

196
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,000
he told you

197
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,720
everything about me.

198
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,960
He stole the Dragon Pearl for you.

199
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,600
Yeah.

200
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,800
So you know that
Dragon Pearl should've been mine.

201
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,200
You owe me that.

202
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,520
I owe you?

203
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,440
I already paid you back long ago.

204
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,800
Why do you think so?

205
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,680
I was heartbroken over your death.

206
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,440
I even thought
about trading my life for yours.

207
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,520
That was because
I never should've lived.

208
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,720
That way,

209
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,800
you'd remember me for life.

210
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,960
A lifetime is short.

211
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
And people forget.

212
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,520
Quit acting innocent.

213
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,080
You're too old for that.

214
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,800
Fair enough.

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,280
Then, let me be real.

216
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,510
I was wounded
by the Dragon Pearl's restriction.

217
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,480
The only way I can stay alive

218
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,080
is by constantly switching bodies.

219
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,000
The body you're seeing right now

220
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,880
is your dead brother Zhenxuan.

221
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,200
I dug him out of the grave myself.

222
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,120
The Dragon Pact can't hurt me.

223
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,360
Just kidding.

224
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,720
This body is mine.

225
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,440
I can change it however I want.

226
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,440
You make me sick.

227
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,200
You should be thanking me.

228
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,160
I let you see what Zhenxuan
would've looked like all grown up.

229
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,120
Get out.

230
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,320
I never want to see you again.

231
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,840
But I can't stay away from you.

232
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,400
After all these years,

233
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,880
I've tried so many times.

234
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,920
What do you mean?

235
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,080
Do you really think

236
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,080
you've lived this long

237
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,120
and became the First Lady
of Mo City just by luck?

238
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,760
You think twenty years ago,

239
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,160
you survived
all those assassins by chance?

240
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,440
And...

241
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,960
who do you think
taught you all your skills?

242
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,720
Let me tell you.

243
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,600
I may have

244
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,240
wronged anyone else in the world.

245
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,520
But the one person

246
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,320
I never failed was you, Shan Yunshu.

247
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,280
Zhenxuan...

248
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,960
I can't run anymore.

249
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,160
Leave me behind.

250
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,200
Go on your own.

251
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,080
Yuzi,

252
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,280
I won't leave you.

253
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,480
I'm here to save you.

254
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,040
Come on.

255
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,800
I'll carry you.

256
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,880
Zhenxuan.

257
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,680
We'll both die.

258
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,000
Just leave me.

259
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,760
Forget about me.

260
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,680
No.

261
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,080
I won't leave you behind.

262
00:11:57,994 --> 00:11:59,200
(Twenty years ago,)

263
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,560
(I saw you being hunted.)

264
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,080
(You had such a tragic past.)

265
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,760
(I felt pity and saved you.)

266
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,240
(But I never expected)

267
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,240
(the Dragon Pearl would enter your body.)

268
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,880
Take good care of her.

269
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Once she wakes up,

270
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,160
inform me immediately.

271
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,400
Yes, sir.

272
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,960
(Later on, I found you again.)

273
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,120
(I tried to have a servant kill you.)

274
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,760
(But you...)

275
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,520
Mother!

276
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,280
(You piqued my interest.)

277
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,160
Mother?

278
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,240
(I chose to spare your life.)

279
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,960
Doctor.

280
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,800
How is she doing?

281
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,390
The girl has a psychological condition.

282
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,920
My medicine won't work

283
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,880
unless she wakes up on her own.

284
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,000
Alright.

285
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,920
I'll take my leave now.

286
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,280
Girl...

287
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,920
Zhenxuan risked his life to save you.

288
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,200
If anything happens to you,

289
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,480
my guilt

290
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,040
will only grow deeper.

291
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,520
Master!

292
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,160
Master!

293
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,440
Master!

294
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,920
An ascetic is outside.

295
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,200
He says he can cure the girl.

296
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,360
Bring him in, quick!

297
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,840
Yes, sir!

298
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,960
(I approached you
under the guise of healing.)

299
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,920
(I wanted to see)

300
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,520
(how this little wildcat had grown up.)

301
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,000
Your name?

302
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,640
Zhang.

303
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,720
Mr. Zhang.

304
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,360
Can you really cure my girl?

305
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,240
I have a Forgetfulness Pill.

306
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,960
It can ease the demons in her heart.

307
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,400
If it works,

308
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,400
you will be heavily rewarded.

309
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,520
I don't need a reward.

310
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,880
I only wish to take on a disciple.

311
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,840
Once she wakes up,

312
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,480
every five days,

313
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,000
I'll come to the house to teach her.

314
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,760
Alright.

315
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
(One day,)

316
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,360
(the little wildcat actually bit back.)

317
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,480
I'm sorry,

318
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,200
Master.

319
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,360
I overstepped.

320
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,560
I told you,

321
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,120
I'm not your master.

322
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,360
Yes, sir.

323
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,840
Your mastery is complete.

324
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,680
You may leave now.

325
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,440
But...

326
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,400
Mas...

327
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,120
You said you'd help me get revenge.

328
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,000
Your revenge

329
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,960
is something you should take yourself.

330
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,440
I've already
taught you everything I know.

331
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,200
From here on,

332
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,160
you walk your own path.

333
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,560
You no longer need me,

334
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,120
and you can take your revenge alone.

335
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
Take this.

336
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
I tricked you into
taking the Forgetfulness Pill,

337
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,240
so we could both have a way out.

338
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,800
Forget me.

339
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,440
In this lifetime,

340
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,880
we will never meet again.
