What are you doing?

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,160
Miss Lili induced a hallucination

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,560
and made me relive the past.

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,680
I couldn't tell whether
it was a dream or reality.

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,000
That should be the Fox Clan's
Yin-Yang Spell.

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,480
I think so.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,480
What have you seen, then?

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,080
I saw what you,

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,320
Chongming,

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,280
and the Black-robed Man
had done behind my back.

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,640
And,

19
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,120
I saw Mingkai as well.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,600
Huh?

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,400
Anyway, I've never
done anything to let you down.

22
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,960
You did plenty of them.

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,480
Who said so?

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,880
You were always the one
who initiated it.

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,520
What do you mean by that?

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,920
You always initiated our kiss

27
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,750
except for the time
when you were wounded.

28
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,120
I was just anxious to save you.

29
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,480
I didn't take advantage of you.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,680
You just detest me.

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,760
No matter what, I'm charming, elegant,

32
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,620
and quite the looker.

33
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,720
Anyone else would've been elated

34
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,640
to kiss me.

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,660
You'd better know what's good for you.

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't detest you.

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,320
Huh?

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,640
Thank you

39
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,920
for saving me time and time again.

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,800
Thank you for liking me.

41
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,440
Thank you for keeping me company,

42
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,320
Aojue.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,040
Are you poisoned?
Or are you under someone's spell?

44
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,090
I don't have any spiritual energy now.

45
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,200
I'm not strong enough
to handle your torment.

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,720
This happened last time as well.

47
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,080
And, you stabbed me.

48
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,880
Now, I'm afraid

49
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,600
and a little excited.

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,920
It feels like I'm in a dream.

51
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,040
That hurts.

52
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,490

What's wrong?

60
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,920
Chief Wu is dead.

61
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,560
His body is in the courtyard.

62
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,720
The reporters are on their way here.

63
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,680
She's here.

Hurry!

65
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,200
Ms. Shan Yunshu,

66
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,960
may I know why Chief Wu's body
was found at your doorstep?

67
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,440
I have no idea.

68
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,860
Chief Wu had just
shut down Dongsheng Trading

69
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,710
and was investigating
a smuggling case involving opium.

70
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,040
Do you think his death
is related to that case?

71
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,800
Sorry,

72
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,280
I'm unsure about that.

73
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,320
Ms. Shan!

74
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,560
Ms. Shan!

75
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,600
Ms. Shan!

76
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,720
Ms. Shan!

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,160
Ms. Shan!

78
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,800
Please let us off!

79
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,710
Please let my peers
from the police station off!

80
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,760
Please spare the people!

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,160
I, Mo Shenhai,

82
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,280
will kowtow to you.

83
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,280
Ms. Shan, let me kowtow to you!

84
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,920
Mo Shenhai.

85
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,360
Why are you acting?

86
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,200
What has Chief Wu's death
got to do with me?

87
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,920
I admit!

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,280
Back then, your father, me,

89
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,460
and the Hu family had smuggled
tobacco into the city.

90
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,520
I did so in order to boost
Mo City's economy!

91
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,720
And,

92
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,720
Chief Wu permitted us to do so!

93
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,320
But I didn't kill your father!

94
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,880
Tell the monsters under you...

95
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,800
No,

96
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,120
I mean, divine beings.

97
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,600
Tell them

98
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,160
not to slaughter
the innocent people of Mo City!

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,440
I, Mo Shenhai,

100
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,000
will atone for my sins with my life!

101
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,040
Shan Yunshu has monsters
under her command?

102
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,280
How could there be monsters?

103
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah.

104
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,280
Monsters?

105
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,480
I don't think it's true.

106
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,120
Mo Shenhai.

107
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,120
Stop spouting nonsense!

108
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,120
Ms. Shan.

109
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,640
Ms. Shan,

110
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,040
I, Mo Shenhai,
will atone for my sins with my life!

111
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,880
Mr. Mo Shenhai!

112
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,160
Don't do something silly!

113
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,920
Let me die!

114
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,960
I'll exchange my life

115
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,600
for the peace of Mo City!

116
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,520
Let me die!

117
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,840
Put down the knife!

118
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,200
The good will be rewarded,

119
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,460
and the evil will be punished!

120
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,640
According to my observation,

121
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,720
Ms. Shan is possessed by a demon.

122
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Let me

123
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,840
deliver Ms. Shan

124
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,520
from the sea of torment!

125
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,440
There's a monster!

126
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,480
Help!

127
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,880
What is Mo Shenhai up to?

128
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,840
He knew that he couldn't defeat us.

129
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,480
He wishes to achieve victory

130
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,760
in the midst of the chaos.

131
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,400
If so,

132
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,600
what should we do now?

133
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,080
The situation isn't chaotic enough.

134
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,280
I'm afraid Mo Shenhai
has another trick up his sleeve.

135
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,320
A civil uprising.

136
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,920
What?

137
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,080
The Mo family was massacred back then

138
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,480
due to a civil uprising.

139
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,590
Mo Shenhai took advantage of
the situation and slaughtered our family.

140
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,560
No one could rescue us.

141
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,000
Now, I assume

142
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,440
he's using the same trick.

143
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,960
We don't have much
spiritual energy left.

144
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,600
If that's the case,

145
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,290
this will be unfavorable for us.

146
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,320
If so,

147
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,240
we can only go into hiding for now.

148
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,710
We'll explain ourselves
when the opportunity arrives.

149
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,480
That won't do.

150
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,610
Once we go into hiding,

151
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,680
Mo Shenhai will get his way.

152
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,440
By then, we won't be able
to explain ourselves.

153
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,760
What should we do, then?

154
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,440
We'll fight fire with fire.

155
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,760
We'll quell the rumors
with our own lies.

156
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,310
Shan Yunshu's subordinates
are killing innocent people!

157
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,440
Everyone, run!

158
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,740
Be careful.

159
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,000
What's wrong?

160
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,440
Hurry and leave!

161
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,920
The Black-robed Man
is Aofeng, my younger brother.

162
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,400
Do you wish to hear my tale?

163
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
He's pitiful as well.

164
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,720
He has done too many evil deeds.

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,800
Yunshu, everyone

166
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,150
is saying that you're controlling
the innocent with your sorcery

167
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,630
and causing them to hurt each other.

168
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,300
It should be the work of Love Severance.

169
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,990
Aofeng actually poisoned
the innocent to acquire the Dragon Pearl.

170
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,990
Is it the same
as the voodoo I was struck by?

171
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,120
Yes.

172
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,760
Is there no cure

173
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,920
for this voodoo?

174
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,560
Not for now.

175
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,590
Once the victim is struck by it,

176
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,520
Love Severance will become one
with their bloodstream.

177
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,120
However, we can employ Hu Lili's method.

178
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,030
We can suppress it temporarily
using special methods.

179
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,590
I've already tried my best to save them.

180
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,510
But I've expended
most of my spiritual energy.

181
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,560
There are too many victims.

182
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,960
I'm afraid this is the plot set up
by Mo Shenhai and Aofeng.

183
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,990
They wanted you guys
to rescue the victims

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,280
and expend your spiritual energy.

185
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,160
After that, they'll deal with me.

186
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,560
There's no need to fear them.

187
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,320
At most, I'll drink your blood

188
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,400
and kill them with my powers.

189
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,360
After that, you guys can lock me away.

190
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,000
By then, we can ask Hu Lili for help.

191
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,920
What method did Miss Lili employ?

192
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,800
She infused her demonic aura

193
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
into your body

194
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,320
and fuse it with
the Dragon Pearl's power

195
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,080
to suppress the effect of Love Severance.

196
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,760
The main thing is
that Hu Lili isn't here.

197
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,920
Where can we find her?

198
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,520
It's useless even if

199
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,560
Hu Lili is here.

200
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
There's only one Dragon Pearl.

201
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,400
And, it's inside Madam's body.

202
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,800
We can't save other people with it.

203
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,800
I shouldn't have told Mo Shenhai
about the Dragon Pearl back then.

204
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,400
He resorted to such madness
because of that.

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,560
He'll find out
even if you keep it from him.

206
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,280
He's just one of Aofeng's pawns.

207
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,680
The victims are acting as if

208
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,560
they've lost their minds.

209
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,360
Most of my subordinates are injured.

210
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,480
If this keeps up,

211
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,240
not only will the people
suffer heavy casualties,

212
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,960
but Yunshu, you'll also
have no way to clear your name.

213
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,880
Therefore, we can't afford
to wait any longer.

214
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,440
What do you plan to do, then?

215
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,800
I want you guys
to place complete trust in me.

216
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Just follow my command.

217
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,440
Shan Yunshu!

218
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,440
Come out!

219
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,800
What sorcery have you cast on us?

220
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,200
Return my husband to me!

221
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:24,727
Show yourself!

222
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,640
Show yourself!

223
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,058
- Show yourself!
- Show yourself!

224
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:29,120
- Are you guys ready?
- Show yourself!

225
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,440
- Our men are laying in ambush.
- Show yourself!

226
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,680
- Once you give us the command,
- Show yourself!

227
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:32,960
- they'll be riddled with holes.
- Show yourself!

228
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,120
- Show yourself!
- Show yourself!

229
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,200
- Show yourself!
- Show yourself!

230
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,240
- Show yourself!
- Show yourself!

231
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,320
- Show yourself!
- Show yourself!

232
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,520
- Show yourself!
- Show yourself!

233
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,640
- Show yourself!
- Show yourself!

234
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,880
- Show yourself!
- Show yourself!

235
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,840
- Show yourself!
- Show yourself!

236
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,116
- Dear folks, listen to me.
- Show yourself!

237
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,520
I have something to say.

238
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,320
I know

239
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,320
that I'm not a noble person.

240
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,520
But the Chamber of Commerce
and I are indebted to Mo City!

241
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,560
Shan Yunshu

242
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,760
colluded with monsters and demons
for her personal grudges

243
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,800
and plunged Mo City into chaos.

244
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,640
Today,

245
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,240
I'll uphold justice for the people

246
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,760
even if I have to die here!

247
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,698
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

248
00:10:08,698 --> 00:10:10,800
If she doesn't dare to show herself
due to her guilty conscience,

249
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,440
we'll set fire to her mansion

250
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,640
and burn her alive!

251
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,800
- Burn her alive!
- Burn her alive!

252
00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:17,403
- Burn her alive!
- Burn her alive!

253
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:30,450
- Burn her alive!
- Burn her alive!

254
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,680
Mo Shenhai,

255
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,040
you've truly gone insane

256
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,520
in an attempt
to obtain the Dragon Pearl.

257
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,600
You even resorted to framing me
for the voodoo you used.

258
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,440
Stop maligning me!

259
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,960
Your subordinates had committed murders.

260
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,960
Many of our fellow folks

261
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,360
witnessed it for themselves.

262
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:44,120
- That's right!
- That's right!

263
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
- How dare you still deny it?
- We witnessed it ourselves!

264
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,094
We witnessed it ourselves!

265
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:47,360
- That's right!
- That's right!

266
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,749
- They went to rescue you all.
- We witnessed it ourselves!

267
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,520
If not, your family members
would've been dead.

268
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,080
Shan Yunshu,

269
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,560
here's a piece of advice.

270
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,240
You better undo your sorcery!

271
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,040
If not,

272
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,680
we will show you no mercy!

273
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,840
Dear folks,

274
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,400
I'm not a monster.

275
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,120
However, I have a method

276
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,600
to save you all.

277
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,640
Please come with me.

278
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,560
Shan Yunshu,

279
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,320
what exactly are you up to?

280
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,280
If you find out that I'm messing around,

281
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,320
you may do whatever you want to me.

282
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,240
Now,

283
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,000
please bring your family members here.

284
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,120
Shan Yunshu,

285
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,320
what are you up to again?

286
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,440
Dear folks,

287
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,000
I, Shan Yunshu,

288
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,720
grew up in Mo City.

289
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,480
I'm sure all of you know

290
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,120
the kind of person I am.

291
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,640
This morning,

292
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,160
my bodyguards

293
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,880
did exhibit some special powers.

294
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,480
However, they're not monsters.

295
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,480
Shan,

296
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,800
you better stop bewitching them!

297
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,080
Just tell us

298
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,360
if you can neutralize
this poison or not.

299
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,640
Mr. Mo, you're changing
your statement again.

300
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,600
How did you know
that the folks were poisoned?

301
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,720
Didn't you say
that I cast my sorcery on them?

302
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,640
No matter if it's a poison
or your sorcery,

303
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,560
just tell us if you can
dispel it or not.

304
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,360
Dear folks,

305
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,960
you guys are struck with a voodoo
called Love Severance.

306
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,000
I cannot dispel it.

307
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,600
However, I can absorb it into my body.

308
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,040
Please enter the formation

309
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,440
if you wish to give it a try.

310
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,560
What if it doesn't work out?

311
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,160
They cured my husband.

312
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,960
Really?

313
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:41,029
We mustn't trust them.

314
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,541
Yeah.

315
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,400
- Yeah.
- Precisely.

316
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,840
We mustn't trust them.

317
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,920
They were the cause.

318
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,480
Your family members
are already in deep trouble.

319
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,320
What else can get worse?

320
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,760
Madam's bodyguards
saved my husband's life.

321
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,800
I trust you.

322
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,400
Thank you.

323
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,520
Dear?

324
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,440
Dear,

325
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
you're finally awake.

326
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,080
This is great.

327
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,160
Thank you, Madam.

328
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,080
Rest well at home.

329
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,840
He has returned to life.

330
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,120
He's alive again.

331
00:13:30,203 --> 00:13:31,018
It's true.

332
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:33,120
- We can be rescued. This is great.
- Yeah.

333
00:13:33,585 --> 00:13:34,169
This is great.

334
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,301
Please rescue my child!

335
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:36,040
Please rescue my family!

336
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,080
Please rescue my wife!

337
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,560
Madam!

338
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,520
- Calm down.
- Please rescue us!

339
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,880
Please take turns.

340
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:44,654
Okay.

341
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,989
- Thank you, Madam.
- Thank you.

342
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,560
The people have returned safely.

343
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,120
I've already dealt with
the assassins as well.

344
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,200
Let's search the area again

345
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,640
to make sure no one
slips through the net.

346
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,320
Mo Shenhai,

347
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,640
we've crushed all of your plots.

348
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,120
Now,

349
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,280
you're at your wit's end.

350
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,400
Shan Yunshu,

351
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,040
you're amazing.

352
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
You don't fear death.

353
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,560
You do resemble your father

354
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,920
in that aspect.

355
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,840
How dare you mention my father?

356
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,080
He was a successful merchant.

357
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,720
He was also a noble father.

358
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,400
However, he wasn't a good person.

359
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,040
What nonsense are you talking about?

360
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,280
Do you know

361
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,520
what your father did

362
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,760
before he became a merchant in Mo City?

363
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
He was a mounted bandit.

364
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,000
He was one of the mounted bandits
outside Mo City.

365
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,800
They specialized in robbing the wealthy.

366
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,440
Why are you telling me this?

367
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,800
When I was 15, my father and I passed by
Mo City on a business trip.

368
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,800
We were robbed by mounted bandits.

369
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,040
My father fell ill
and became bedridden after that.

370
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,040
Your father turned into
a merchant overnight

371
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,600
and replaced my father

372
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,360
in the company.

373
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,600
The mounted bandit is now a merchant.

374
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,080
He was posing as a member
of the Mo family,

375
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,360
using our wealth and connections!

376
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,400
That's impossible.

377
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,240
That's impossible.

378
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,520
And, that Hu,

379
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,000
he wasn't a good person either.

380
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,520
He pretended to be a philanthropist.

381
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,880
He was a wolf in sheep's skin.

382
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,960
He knew about
your father's true identity,

383
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,200
but he chose to keep it a secret
for the sake of profits.

384
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,800
I was only able

385
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,440
to convince him to join me

386
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,440
with even bigger profits.

387
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,360
- Now, you have a strong desire
- Madam, be careful.

388
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,680
to seek revenge, right?

389
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,360
Back then, in order
to win your father's trust,

390
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,200
I hid my identity

391
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,480
and started out as a dock laborer

392
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,800
until I established
the Wanlong Chamber of Commerce.

393
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
Smuggling tobacco

394
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,960
and opium

395
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,720
weren't my ideas at all.

396
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,440
Those were your father's ideas.

397
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,360
He wanted to make more money

398
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,080
so that he could leave Mo City
together with his family.

399
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
How could that be?

400
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,640
If you were in my shoes,

401
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,280
would you let your sworn enemy
leave the city that easily?

402
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,520
What's wrong?

403
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,840
Was your fragile heart

404
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,480
crushed by the truth?

405
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,120
Yuzi,

406
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,320
don't let him bewitch you.

407
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,040
It's a shame

408
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:21,680
that I didn't get to witness how you
and your sister turned against each other.

409
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,920
You and Black-robed Man

410
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,240
won't get your way.

411
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,200
Did you think Aofeng poisoned the people
to expend your bodyguards' powers?

412
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,400
You're wrong.

413
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,600
He knew that you would

414
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,680
take the risk.

415
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,160
The moment you use the Dragon Pearl
to rescue the masses

416
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,480
is the moment when the Dragon Pact

417
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,880
is at its weakest!

418
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,320
Yunshu, watch out!

419
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,520
Mingkai!
