8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,040
That is enough.

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,960
I said, it's not going to work.

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,400
Your Highness

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,000
asked me here to help you
remove your intrusive thoughts.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,360
I'm doing exactly that.

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,680
You think you're doing it the right way?

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,840
Are you taking me for a fool?

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,560
Well,

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,240
all Your Highness thinks about

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,440
are her words,

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,760
her demeanor,

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,880
her facial expressions,

20
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,200
and her thoughts, huh?

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,320
Are you showing off
your wordplay skill?

22
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,640
Can you speak properly?

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,480
The best way to forget a woman

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,760
is to fall in love

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,000
with another

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,680
excellent one.

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,040
For example, me.

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,800
Are you silly?

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,440
If I could fall for you,

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,400
I'd have done so centuries ago.

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,800
Would I have waited until now?

32
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,840
You're the silly one here.

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,680
I'm a clever fox.

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,120
So stop humiliating me.

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,240
A thousand-year-old virgin

36
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,840
feels tormented and loses sleep

37
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,880
over a girl.

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,520
He is all lovesick,

39
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,040
agonized, and restless.

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,840
I'm helping you out of kindness

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,400
and you're being picky.

42
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,200
Well,

43
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,440
you're the one
who told me to conquer her.

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,680
And now

45
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
things are a total mess.

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,000
Even I can't get out of it.

47
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,160
This is your thousand-year tribulation.

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,680
It is never going to be easy.

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,560
They say fate cannot be avoided.

50
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
If there's no way out,

51
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,440
you might as well face it head-on.

52
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,000
You want me to marry Shan Yunshu?

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,280
I said you're a brute

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,400
and you wouldn't admit it.

55
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,190
Marriage isn't something
you just decide on.

56
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,240
What I meant is

57
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,140
if you can't dodge it,

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,040
just embrace it

59
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,400
and enjoy it.

60
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,400
Why torture yourself like this?

61
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,720
You do have a point.

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,920
Then what do I do next?

63
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,640
Well...

64
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,720
If you start rambling
or thinking about nonsense again,

65
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,270
I'll turn you back
to your original form.

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
You insensitive man.

67
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,360
Of course you start with a confession.

68
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,640
A confession?

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,560
During a confession,

70
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,000
you must look into her eyes.

71
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,640
Say it in a gentle tone

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,680
with a resolute gaze.

73
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,440
Shan Yunshu.

74
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,120
That's not it.

75
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:55,920
I love you,

76
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,760
Yunshu.

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,720
Aojue.

78
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,720
Shan Yunshu.

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,120
Why are you here?

80
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,960
You gave me a fright!

81
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,160
Why are you so upset?

82
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,400
I called your name for times,
but you didn't hear me.

83
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,480
It's nothing.

84
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,910
You need not to explain yourself.

85
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,900
Come with me to a place.

86
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,520
I...

87
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,320
What's it?

88
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,920
Shan Yunshu.

89
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,120
I like you.

90
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,800
Yunshu.

91
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,400
Come with me.

92
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,320
I'll get you there.

93
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,720
Why are you here, Mingkai?

94
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,680
Yunshu.

95
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,710
Of course I'd find out
about this serious matter.

96
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,000
This time,

97
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,080
I will stay by your side.

98
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,640
What has happened?

99
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,460
Mo Shenhai plans to go down
with everyone.

100
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,360
He exposed my sister as a assassin

101
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,800
and the Hu family's opium smuggling
from twenty years ago.

102
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh, right.

103
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,000
What did you just say?

104
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,800
I didn't catch it.

105
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,480
It's nothing.

106
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,550
Let's head
to the police department first.

107
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,240
Sure.

108
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
Chongming.

109
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,440
Actually, you don't have to be here.

110
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,680
I'm just doing as your sister said.

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,280
With your skills,

112
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,280
you could've escaped easily.

113
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,600
I bet you have another plan

114
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,680
or some other scheme.

115
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,240
Do you have to assume the worst of me?

116
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,520
What else am I supposed to think?

117
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,080
I've done a lot of mistakes before.

118
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,040
But

119
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,480
that was before I knew who I really was.

120
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,560
Now

121
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,000
I just want to be a good person.

122
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,600
Even the King Yama
wouldn't believe that now.

123
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,400
I could've run away.

124
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,320
None of this could've held me.

125
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,920
It's just that

126
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,200
if I did, I'd fall right into Mo Shenhai

127
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,760
and Chief Wu's trap.

128
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,640
Shan Yunshu

129
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,640
would end up completely cornered.

130
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,520
Didn't you hate your sister the most?

131
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,920
Why this change of heart?

132
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,280
I did hate her.

133
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,920
Perhaps

134
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,880
I was jealous.

135
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,560
So,

136
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,760
what are you trying to get at?

137
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,920
On one hand,

138
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,720
I owe Mo Shenhai for raising me.

139
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,160
On the other,

140
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,520
I want to test her.

141
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,680
She left me all those years ago.

142
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,040
Since she never found my body,

143
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,720
why didn't she come looking for me?

144
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,400
Your sister never
stopped searching for you.

145
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,720
She just couldn't make it public.

146
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,840
Well, are you trying to become a dragon
with the Dragon Pearl?

147
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,680
Yes.

148
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,000
When that happens,

149
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,350
what's the difference between that
and being a jiao dragon?

150
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,160
Life.

151
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,880
I will find out the meaning of life.

152
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,280
You too have a story.

153
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,440
What will you do

154
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,640
after getting out of here?

155
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,560
I've never thought of leaving it.

156
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,920
What do you mean?

157
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,520
I've been
Mo Shenhai's follower for years.

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,960
And he actually decided to go down
with everyone involved.

159
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,880
That's not like him at all.

160
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,760
There's only one possibility.

161
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,000
It was the Black-Robed Man behind him
who came up with the idea.

162
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,000
He's now a pawn

163
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,000
who is used to force my sister's hand.

164
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,920
If so, I'll turn myself into a pawn too.

165
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,440
Only I

166
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,360
can kill Mo Shenhai.

167
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,720
Consider that a favor for Yuzi.

168
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,000
Perhaps I'm doing it

169
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,880
to fulfill my duty to my late parents.

170
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,080
If you died,

171
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,760
your sister would be devastated.

172
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,560
Let's not talk about the dead.

173
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,800
The living

174
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,720
are the ones we should cherish.

175
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,240
I've been with your sister
all this while.

176
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,840
And I've witnessed
how much she misses you.

177
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,040
If I die,

178
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,760
please help me tell her

179
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,480
to take care of herself.

180
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,520
And please tell her

181
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,280
that

182
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,080
I miss her too.

183
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Yuhan.

184
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't be silly.

185
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,680
Yunshu.

186
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,210
Be careful, the tea might be poisoned.

187
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,520
Don't worry.

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,320
The Black-Robed Man and Mo Shenhai
didn't get the Dragon Pearl or Dongsheng.

189
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,420
They wouldn't dare hurt me.

190
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,280
I'm here with you,

191
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,400
so just rest assured.

192
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,080
Rest assured, huh?

193
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,990
You were never there
when something bad happened.

194
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,520
Well, well.

195
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,640
You're here to visit me
at this late hour, Ms. Shan.

196
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,200
Pardon me for not greeting you sooner.

197
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,640
Mr. Mo.

198
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,400
Let's skip the pleasantries.

199
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,840
I'll get straight to the point.

200
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,520
I want to see the Black-Robed Man.

201
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,520
Shan Yunshu.

202
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,920
The Black-Robed Master isn't someone
you can meet just because you want to.

203
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,520
Why don't you tell me
what else you came here for tonight?

204
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,800
Release my sister.

205
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,320
Drop the charges
against the Hu family and Dongsheng.

206
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
Why should I?

207
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,840
Because I have the Dragon Pearl
the Black-Robed Man is after.

208
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,480
I can let him have it.

209
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,560
We have other ways
of getting the Dragon Pearl.

210
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,340
So that doesn't make it
a bargaining chip.

211
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,720
Is that so?

212
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't think too highly of yourself.

213
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,200
I don't care
about the Hu family's reputation.

214
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,490
After all, you're aware
of what happened back then.

215
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,840
Mr. Hu and Zhenxuan are gone.

216
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,560
But I will

217
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,160
protect my sister.

218
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,840
And you know what she's capable of.

219
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,880
If she wants to leave,

220
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,680
no one can ever stop her.

221
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,560
The reason I came to talk to you

222
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,720
is because I want her
to live the rest of her life in peace.

223
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,760
As for you and the Black-Robed Man,

224
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,320
could you beat

225
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,240
either of my two bodyguards?

226
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,880
If the Black-Robed Man has a way

227
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,840
to extract the Dragon Pearl

228
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,000
without harming me throughout,

229
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,440
I'm willing to cooperate.

230
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
But if he dares hurt my sister again,

231
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,560
I won't hold back.

232
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,400
Don't forget

233
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,680
what happened at the dock.

234
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
If we're going down together,

235
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,880
Wanlong dies first!

236
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,400
Why should I believe you?

237
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,160
The Black-Robed Man's blood

238
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,360
must be running low, no?

239
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
This vial is my gesture of sincerity.

240
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,120
I want to see my sister

241
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,680
before getting home.

242
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,920
Back then, I asked Mr. Hu

243
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,480
to bury them here.

244
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
I didn't even dare
put their names on the grave

245
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,000
or come here to pay them respect.

246
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,880
Long'er.

247
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,240
Have a drink with me.

248
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,760
Long'er.

249
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,040
Thank you.

250
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,120
Well, that's unlike you.

251
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,080
In fact,

252
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,960
you've saved my life for times.

253
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,130
You saved me twenty years ago

254
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,000
and twenty years after.

255
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,880
And you did the same a few days ago.

256
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,000
You ever saved my life too.

257
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,680
So we're even.

258
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,320
I remember you told me this.

259
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,240
You're going to save your brother
with the Dragon Pearl.

260
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,320
Yes.

261
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,080
I will keep my promise.

262
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,920
Once I avenge my late parents,

263
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,680
you can have the Dragon Pearl.

264
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,280
It's alright.

265
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,160
There's no use doing so anymore.

266
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,600
It's been over twenty years.

267
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,520
I bet my brother has reincarnated.

268
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,080
So you just live well.

269
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,920
I can retrieve it
when you die of old age.

270
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,920
Is that so?

271
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,160

Do you want to listen to it?

275

Yes.

276
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,600
After all, it's a story
about an immortal.

277
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,800
Actually, there's nothing much about it.

278
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,600
But you love your brother.

279
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,680
My brother's is another sad story.

280
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,280
His mother was a human.

281
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,680
After her first encounter
with my father,

282
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,160
she gave birth
to a half-dragon, half-human child

283
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,120
and endured endless scorn and slander.

284
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,440
By the time
she brought him to the Dragon Clan,

285
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,440
she was already gravely ill.

286
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,560
My father refused to see her.

287
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,960
Soon after that,

288
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,440
she took poison
and ended her life by the East Sea.

289
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,400
I promised her

290
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,840
I would take good care of him.

291
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,320
But not long after that,

292
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,400
my brother fell ill too.

293
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,240
I stole the Dragon Pearl

294
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,680
just to save him.
