Are the memories back?

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,200
Zhang Mingkai,

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,960
what sorcery did you use this time?

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,880
This isn't sorcery.

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,840
Everything you saw in the Dragon Pact

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,080
was real.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,920
Why is your goal anyway?

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,640
I don't even know.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,680
At first,

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,520
maybe it was because

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,200
you reminded me of my younger self.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,040
I felt sorry for you.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,600
And then,

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,880
maybe I was just lonely.

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,940
I wanted to mold you into another me
to see if you'd get your revenge.

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,480
After that,

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,080
compared to the Dragon Pearl,

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,920
I cared more about you. I liked you.

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,000
When my poison became harder to control,

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,480
I chose to leave you

28
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,680
so I wouldn't hurt you.

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,360
Yunshu,

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,800
can we forget everything
and stay together forever?

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,440
I really like you.

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,800
Give me a chance.

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,080
This is the first time
I truly wanted to be with someone.

34
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,600
And the Dragon Pearl?

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,840
Don't you want it?

36
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,920
I could have waited for you
to grow old and die

37
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,880
to take the Dragon Pearl from you.

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,760
But then...

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,400
Aojue and Chongming showed up again.

40
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,640
They thwarted your plan.

41
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,440
Yes.

42
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,680
Why are you laughing?

43
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,960
I'm laughing at how pitiful you are.

44
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,280
You're pathetic.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,960
Utterly ridiculous.

46
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,680
Truth is,

47
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,840
I have no right to judge you.

48
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,880
Because deep down,

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,560
we're the same kind of person.

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,760
We'll sacrifice anything for revenge

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,080
and do whatever it takes.

52
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,840
And in the process,
we lose what truly matters.

53
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,440
You had a tragic past.

54
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,400
Your mother was killed.

55
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,880
Now you're about to sacrifice
the only brother who loves you.

56
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,480
That is just sad.

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,160
You're poisoned.

58
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,800
You can't have the one you love,

59
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,400
but you still can't let go of desire.

60
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,360
How pitiful.

61
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,240
You stayed with me the longest,

62
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
and gave me the most.

63
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,680
But I never loved you.

64
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,280
How tragic.

65
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,200
Mingkai,

66
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
let it go.

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,040
It's not too late.

68
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,680
Enough!

69
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,680
You sound just like the rest of them.

70
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,280
But...

71
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,080
I can't wait any longer.

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,880
Yuzi...

73
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,560
If I can't have you,

74
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,480
no one else can.

75
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,440
Let go of me!

76
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:18,720
Let me go!

77
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:20,800
Let me go!

78
00:03:30,674 --> 00:03:31,360
Zhang Mingkai!

79
00:03:31,605 --> 00:03:32,400
Get out here!

80
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,680
Release my sister!

81
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,000
Aofeng!

82
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,120
Come out and fight me one-on-one!

83
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,440
What kind of man takes a woman hostage?

84
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:42,400
You dare come back?

85
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,200
I wouldn't be so confident

86
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,480
if I were you.

87
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,320
The last guy who acted this tough

88
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,320
is already rotting in my dungeon.

89
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:51,680
Men!

90
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:54,480
Stop them.

91
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,422
Split up.

92
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:05,737
Go find your sister.

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,840
I'll hold off Zhang Mingkai.

94
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,350
Alright.

95
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,320
Be careful.

96
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:08,897
Yeah.

97
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:47,520
Yunshu...

98
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:49,400

00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,880
How is he?

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,920
No heartbeat.

120
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,440
Feed him your blood!

121
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,200
No.

122
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,080
My blood contains Love Severance.

123
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,360
This is not the time to hesitate.

124
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,720
It's better than letting him die.

125
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,920
We can ask Hu Lili
to find a solution later.

126
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,000
Aojue!

127
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:29,840
Ouch!

128
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:37,920
Trying to murder your husband now?

129
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,480
Are you out of your mind?

130
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:41,520
Now is not the time to fool around!

131
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,160
Who is fooling around?

132
00:06:43,942 --> 00:06:46,360
Aofeng tortured me so badly

133
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,840
I nearly died for real.

134
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,520
Right,

135
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,400
where is Aofeng?

136
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,360
Don't tell me he got away again.

137
00:06:53,508 --> 00:06:54,240
He is dead.

138
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:56,080
I killed him.

139
00:06:58,171 --> 00:06:58,600
Hmm.

140
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:00,920
Don't overthink it.

141
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,360
He got what he deserved.

142
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:03,560
Let's go.

143
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:08,748
Aojue?

144
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:17,760
Aojue.

145
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:19,960
You're really not coming with me?

146
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,120
Do you hate him?

147
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,720
He is dead. The debt is paid.

148
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,760
There is no hatred left.

149
00:07:59,114 --> 00:07:59,760
What about you?

150
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,560
I raised Aofeng myself.

151
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,200
But I never gave him enough love

152
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,240
to dispel the hatred in his heart.

153
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
I feel ashamed.

154
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,440
There is no hate.

155
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,680
What are your plans now?

156
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,760
I don't know.

157
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,400
Mo Shenhai is dead.

158
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,280
My parents have been avenged.

159
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,160
Zhenxuan can rest in peace now.

160
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,160
But I feel completely lost.

161
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,440
You still have me.

162
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
What are your concerns?

163
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:49,840
Can we really be together?

164
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,960
If you're worried about the poison,

165
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,880
I'll ask Hu Lili for help.

166
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:56,000
Aojue.

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,920
You need to understand

168
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,040
I'm going to die one day.

169
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,960
But you won't.

170
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,080
Isn't it nice to have someone
by your side till you're old?

171
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,600
Besides,

172
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:08,560
Yunshu,

173
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,520
I'm going to change.

174
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:12,560
Cherish the present,

175
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,560
and you'll have forever.

176
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,120
You two go on ahead.

177
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
I want to spend
a moment alone with Aofeng.

178
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,320
Chongming,

179
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,520
which place
do you think tasted best today?

180
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:58,680
All of them.

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,910
- No way.
- Move over.

182
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,800
You have to pick one.

183
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,400
Then...

184
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,920
Dragon Beard Noodles, I guess.

185
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:07,360
I think so too.

186
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,360
How about opening a noodle shop?

187
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
We'll sell just that.

188
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,000
Really?

189
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,160
Don't you need to help your sister

190
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,080
revive Dongsheng Trading?

191
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,760
My sister is so capable,

192
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,520
she doesn't need my help.

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,840
And I'm not good at that anyway.

194
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,120
I just want to live
a simple life with you.

195
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
We'll open a shop,

196
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,120
work when the sun rises,

197
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,520
rest when it sets.

198
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,880
How does that sound?

199
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,880
Don't you like me?

200
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,880
No.

201
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
I like you.

202
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,560
Then, why are you pulling away?

203
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,600
I'm afraid I don't have much time left.

204
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,990
I might not be able
to stay by your side every day.

205
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,240
What do you mean by that?

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,120
Explain it.

207
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Haven't you lived for hundreds of years?

208
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,160
We jiao dragons can live for centuries,

209
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,120
but not forever.

210
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,840
I wanted the Dragon Pearl

211
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,240
to turn into a true dragon

212
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,080
and escape the limits of mortality.

213
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,160
But the Dragon Pearl sealed me

214
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,960
and I dodged the tribulation.

215
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,000
Now that the Dragon Pact is broken,

216
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:22,560
I can feel my life slipping away.

217
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,870
I probably don't have much time left.

218
00:11:29,777 --> 00:11:30,400
Still,

219
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,280
every moment with you

220
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,480
makes me happy.

221
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,080
If we cherish the present,

222
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,600
that means everything to me.

223
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,200
We'll figure something out.

224
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:45,320
Don't be sad.

225
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Let's keep eating.

226
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,680
Hopefully,

227
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,320
I can eat myself to death
before the tribulation hits.

228
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,360
That still beats
getting zapped by lightning.

229
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,560
Right?

230
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,800
Come on, let's go.

233
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,840
(We swore a blood oath.)

234
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,160
(I agreed to give up the Dragon Pearl
and not hurt Shan Yunshu.)

235
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:34,840
(And you)

236
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,320
(were supposed
to trade your body for it.)

Aofeng.

238
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,160
The blood oath didn't take effect.

239
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,440
Which means you never
meant to keep your word.

240
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,120
I'll trap you in my body forever.

241
