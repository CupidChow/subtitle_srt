Chongming.

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,800
Why didn't you say so?

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,500
My spiritual energy is exhausted.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,800
You must go now.

Shan Yunshu!

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,400
How dare you kidnap my family?

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,800
What a temper, Chief Wu.

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,760
My son.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,000
My son.

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,200
Are you hurt?

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,360
Shan Yunshu.

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,000
What do you want?

25
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,320
You've misunderstood me.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,780
I heard you had a child
in your later years.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,720
But he's been sick with tuberculosis.

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,480
I happen to have a friend
skilled in medicine.

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,560
So I invited your son and wife over
for treatment.

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,960
Didn't I tell you?

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,360
Don't leave the house

32
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,360
without my permission.

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,480
Dear.

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,080
Ms. Shan sent me a letter

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,600
saying that she could cure our son.

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,200
I got anxious, so I made my way here.

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,520
And he really was miraculously cured.

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,880
Shan Yunshu.

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,720
What exactly do you want?

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,040
You overthink it.

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,800
You've worked hard for years
for the people of Mo City.

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,160
You've even looked out for Dongsheng.

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,400
This is just a small favor from me.

44
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,320
With your son's illness cured,

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,640
now

46
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,760
you have nothing else to worry about.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,080
Leave us to it.

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,720
Come on now.

49
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,600
Fine.

50
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,680
Let's not beat around the bush.

51
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,560
What exactly do you want me to do?

52
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,320
I want all the files

53
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,400
from the investigation
into the Mo family massacre.

54
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,080
If I give them to you,

55
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,280
do you think Mo Shenhai will spare me?

56
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,900
If you don't let me have them,

57
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,040
Mo Shenhai won't spare you either.

58
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,120
He's ready to risk everything

59
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,600
for something he shouldn't have.

60
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,400
Surely you're aware
of him secretly moving his assets

61
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,800
in order to save his own skin.

62
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,520
That opium case back then

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,240
is practically a ticking time bomb.

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,920
You've safeguarded him.

65
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,080
But he doesn't care about you at all.

66
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,720
As you can see,

67
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,160
those around me

68
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,880
are no ordinary folk.

69
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,640
The Black-Robed Man and Mo Shenhai

70
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,200
are no match for them.

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,400
As long as you hand the files
to Zhang Mingkai,

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,000
I promise

73
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,480
you get to step down in one piece.

74
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,800
And the conditions I agreed to before

75
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,800
still stand.

76
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,360
Fine.

77
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
I'll do it.

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll resign right away

79
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,560

to Zhang Mingkai.

80
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,440

Mister.

151
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,320
Two pots of plum liquor
and some osmanthus cakes.

152
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,280
Coming right up.

153
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,800
You've known Aojue
a long time, haven't you?

154
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,360
It's been almost a hundred years.

155
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,360
I went to the East Sea
looking for Forgetfulness Water.

156
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,160
And I almost got struck dead
by the Dragon Clan's thunder.

157
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,080
Fortunately, Aojue saved me.

158
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,280
Forgetfulness Water?

159
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,320
That actually exists in this world?

160
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,680
No, it doesn't.

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,160
But during that journey,

162
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,080
I almost forgot the man who wronged me.

163
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,480
Because of Aojue?

164
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,560
He played a part in it.

165
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,940
I recuperated
in the East Sea for half a year.

166
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,360
He's the most innocent man
I've ever met.

167
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,680
He may appear cold and heartless.

168
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,400
But he's pure inside.

169
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,120
Do you like Aojue?

170
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,720
I do.

171
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,040
But it's like a sister
loving her younger brother.

172
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,680
Just like you and Zhang Mingkai.

173
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,000
What about you?

174
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,480
I can't love him.

175
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,000
I've already been married.

176
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,680

the young master of the Hu family?

177
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,640
Yes.

178
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,960
He shielded me

179
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,960
from that fatal blow then.

180
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,680

see through yin and yang.

The Hu family's young master
has been with you all along.

186
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,280
What do you mean?

187
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,520

00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,200

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,000
The Dragon Pact is a result
of soul sacrifices.

190
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,750
It was most likely formed
by the young master's strong will

191
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,080
before his passing.

192
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,320
That contract might be a part of him now.

193
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,200
Is that true?

194
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,840
Of course.

195
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,880
The pact protects you from harm.

196
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,480
But it never stopped you
from being loved.

197
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,520
I can send your spirit into the pact.

198
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,680
You may take a look

199
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
at Young Master Hu's true feelings.

200
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
Yuzi.

201
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,040
Zhenxuan.

202
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,640
I missed you so much.

203
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,880
So it was you protecting me
all this time.

204
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,000
That was my promise to you.

205
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,160
I wanted you to live well.

206
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,640
Zhenxuan.

207
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,760
Let's stay like this

208
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,360
and never be apart again, okay?

209
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,360
Silly girl.

210
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,800
I'm already dead.

211
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,600
I'm nothing but a trace of will now.

212
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,640
You have to live happily.

213
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,380
That way, everything I've done
for the past twenty years is worth it.

214
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
No one else in this world

215
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,360
has ever been kind to me like you have.

216
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,600
I won't let you go!

217
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,280
Those who care about you are still here.

218
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,880
Don't shut yourself off

219
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,480
and cut off all possibilities in life
because of me.

220
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,800
That's not what I want.

221
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,720
I really care about you.

222
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,520
I want you to be happy,

223
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,400
not stuck in hatred

224
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,920
and regret.

225
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
But how could I ever forget you?

226
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,480
You can't go!

227
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,680
You don't have to forget me.

228
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,840
Just like you never forget
everyone who loves you.

229
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,760
You can keep my love

230
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,840
in your heart.

231
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,920
A place that belongs to just you and me.

232
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,000
But life is short.

233
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,760
I want you to be nothing

234
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,000
but happy.

235
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,680
Thus, I can be relieved enough

236
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,920
to let go

237
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,560
of these twenty years
of worry and loneliness.

238
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,000
I will leave you

239
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,480
and be reborn.

240
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,760
May you

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,440
be nothing

242
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,360
but joyful.

243
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,960
Enjoy your life.

244
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,320
Never be blinded

245
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,080
by hatred, rules,

246
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,320
and prejudice.

247
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,320
May courage and love be with you always.

248
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,080
I would like to turn into a star

249
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,520
and keep you company forever.

256

for such heartfelt love.

257
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,920
You're awake.

258
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Why is it you?

259
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Where's Lili?

260
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,720
She goes wherever she pleases.

261
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,310
I have no idea where she's off
drinking and having fun now.

262
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,120
It's rare to get drunk in this life.

263
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,920
Lili lives as she likes.

264
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,960
That's nice.

265
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,960
You could do that too.

266
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,880
It's not like you haven't
seen me drunk before.

267
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,800
Any new developments with Chief Wu?

268
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,480
Everything should be ready now.

269
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,510
Have you found the Black-Robed Man?

270
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,760
Yes.

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,980
The Black-Robed Man
is my younger brother, Aofeng.

272
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
He betrayed me.

273
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,880
For the Dragon Pearl too?

274
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,240
Yes.

275
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,280
He's pitiful too.

276
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,280
To save his mother

277
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,360
and vent his hatred and resentment,

278
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,080
he did so many wrong things.

279
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,280
Now there's no turning back.

280
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,760
How are you?

281
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,000
I just remembered something.

282
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,880
I think I've heard

283
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,600
a very similar story.

284
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,880
Yunshu.

285
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,400
Do you want to hear my story?

286
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,800
What is it?

287
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,960
I don't have proof just yet.

288
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,640
I'll tell you next time.

289
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,680
Where's my sister and Chongming?

290
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,600
I don't know.

291
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,720
Chongming is with her.

292
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,680
So don't worry.

293
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,920
You're still in the mood for wine?

294
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,240
How are you going

295
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,440
to deal with Shan Yunshu?

296
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
Don't worry.

297
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,520
Everything's under control.

298
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,360
She's already come to me.

299
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,960
She even threatened me
with my wife and child!

300
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,960
Do you have any solutions or not?

301
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,400
Chief Wu.

302
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,080
All these years,

303
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,640
I've never failed.

304
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
Trust me.

305
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,600
Never failed?

306
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,280
And how many times have you failed
dealing with Shan Yunshu?

307
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,600
You've ruined all of my reputation.

308
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,044
The higher-ups are now eyeing

309
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,000
that opium smuggling case
from twenty years ago.

310
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,000
Besides, she's got
so many powerful figures with her.

311
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,080
Neither you nor the Black-Robed Man
can handle them.

312
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,320
What am I supposed to do?

313
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,800
If nothing works,

314
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,680
I'll just have to save my own skin.

315
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,720
Actually,

316
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,480
I've come up with an idea.

317
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,080
What is it?

318
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,800
A dead man.

319
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,760
You!

320
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,560
Clean it up.

321
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,680
Send Chief Wu's body to Shan Yunshu.

322
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,680
Yes.

323
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,280
That jerk.

324
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,440
Why...

325
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,680
I'm still here.

326
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,800
I was out to get us food.

327
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,280
I didn't want to wake you up.

328
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,600
Are you still hurting?

329
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,760
I'm much better.

330
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,880
And you?

331
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,760
My whole body is a bit sore.

332
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
Chongming.

333
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,120
Why are you blushing?

334
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,440
I...

335
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,680
I'm not.

336
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,040
You've lived for hundreds of years.

337
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,000
I bet you've seen all kinds of women.

338
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,280
Don't be ridiculous.

339
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,480
I'm not that kind of man.

340
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,080
I will...

341
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,220
take responsibility for that.

342
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,160
I don't need you to.

343
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,880
You only got hurt
because you protected me.

344
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,080
Consider that my way of repaying you.

345
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,080
Besides,

346
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,120
I'm not

347
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,800
a conservative woman.

348
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,720
I'm not like what you think.

349
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,760
I will take responsibility for it.
