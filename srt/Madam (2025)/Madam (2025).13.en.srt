8
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,110
Give me a reason
why I should spare your life.

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,800
Give me a reason why you shouldn't.

10
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,120
Isn't all this your plot?

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,640
Isn't all this what you've been after?

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,880
I told you so.

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,160
If you ever hurt Shan Yunshu,

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,760
I will get rid of you.

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,880
What a loyal bodyguard you are.

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,760
It was me

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,600
who saved her at the dock.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,930
And I've guarded this place
for one whole night.

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,240
Keep it down

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,480
or you will wake Yuzi and her lover up.

21
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,480
How is Shan Yunshu doing?

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,520
She will make it.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,080
Aojue has been attending to her
since last night.

24
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,800
And there hasn't been any bad news.

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,560
Didn't you plan it all out?

26
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,160
So, why did you regret it?

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,920
Then why did you regret it too?

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,720
Shan Yunshu must live.

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,720
Same goes to me.

30
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,390
Do you have some kind of scheme?

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,240
A scheme?

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,160
Let me think about it.

33
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,960
I made a deal with Mo Shenhai.

34
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,600
He wanted the Dragon Pearl.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,440
I wanted my freedom back
and him to spare Shan Yunshu's life.

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,480
But he tricked me.

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,080
Yuzi was nearly killed

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,880
because of the Dragon Pearl.

39
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,200
Now you have offended both your sister
and Mo Shenhai.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You'd better figure out what to do next.

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,320
I'll need you to protect me.

42
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,360
Why should I?

43
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,360
Because you want Aojue dead.

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,080
To Yuzi,

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,120
Aojue matters more than her own life.

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,760
How dare you threaten me?

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,880
No.

48
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,720
It's cooperation,

49
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,720
dear Chongming.

50
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,840
You rogue!

51
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,990
You took advantage of me, huh?

52
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,240
Took advantage of you?

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,600
I was just healing you.

54
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,670
You used up your spiritual energy,
so the Dragon Pearl left.

55
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,520
If it weren't for me,

56
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,840
you'd be dead by now.

57
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,920
Don't tell me...

58
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,680
How exactly did you heal me?

59
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,840
How else do you think?

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,880
Naturally, I used my mouth.

61
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,520
What's it with this blood?

62
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,920
Could it be...

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,120
Get your mind out of the gutter.

64
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,480
It's not what you think.

65
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,000
Then why did you remove your shirt?

66
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,640
To save you.

67
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,680
How did you save me?

68
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,600
Take a guess.

69
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,560
I'm fine now.

70
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,880
You may go.

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,440
I saved your life,

72
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,800
and not even a thank you?

73
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,400
What a rotten morning.

74
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,400
Urgh!

75
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,280
I'm exhausted.

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,400
I stayed up all night for that.

77
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,040
I'm heading back to get some rest.

78
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,360
Do not disturb me.

79
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,480
You two...

80
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,040
Shush.

81
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,040
Ask Shan Yunshu.

82
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,120
Oh, right.

83
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,760
Where were you yesterday?

84
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,720
Well...

85
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,080
I went after the Black-robed Man.

86
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,600
You'd better be.

87
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,400
This time, I made a mistake.

88
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,040
I didn't expect Mo Yuhan

89
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,560
to betray me.

90
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,400
I was too naive.

91
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,320
And I never thought
Chongming would turn on me.

92
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,640
He gave up his chance to become a dragon

93
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,280
just to save Shan Yunshu.

94
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,520
Indeed.

95
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,040
As long as you're fine,

96
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,280
we still stand a chance

97
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,840
to get the Dragon Pearl.

98
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,240
I still have to thank you

99
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,550
for going to all that trouble
to find me those blood packs

100
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,840
to treat the backlash
from the Dragon Pearl.

101
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,080
Don't stand on ceremony.

102
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,520
We should help each other out.

103
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,960
But you should've told me

104
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,400
about the Dragon Pearl sooner.

105
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,760
If you had done so,
we might've already had it by now.

106
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,800
I'm not an ungrateful person.

107
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,120
Naturally, I will remember your kindness.

108
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,040
But the Dragon Pearl can only be mine,

109
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
not ours.

110
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,520
From now on, do as I say.

111
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,200
Yes, Master.

112
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,440
The food is pretty good today.

113
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,320
Who made it?

114
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,690
Thank you for the compliment.

115
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,190
Help yourself with it if you like it.

116
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,800
How nice of you.

117
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,640
Did you poison it, huh?

118
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,880
You're the Dragon Prince,
but you're scared of poison?

119
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,300
You managed
to treat her serious wounds by licking.

120
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,480
I guess poison is nothing.

121
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,920
When are you leaving?

122
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,920
Yuzi.

123
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,220
What's with that attitude?

124
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,160
Aojue was right.

125
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,240
I've been too soft with you.

126
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,620
That's why you acted out like that.

127
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,920
I've decided to stay.

128
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,630
I offended Mo Shenhai

129
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,760
by helping you.

130
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,920
Now he's after me everywhere.

131
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,960
That's on you.

132
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,680
There are no maids here anymore.

133
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,480
Pick a room and tidy it up yourself.

134
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,600
No worries.

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,440
Chongming will lend me a hand.

136
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,560
Don't try anything funny.

137
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,600
If I hadn't saved Yuzi from Mo Shenhai,

138
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,560
would you still be eating here in peace?

139
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,520
Chongming.

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,960
She can stay.

141
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,400
But keep a close watch on her.

142
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,040
Yes.

143
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,240
Yunshu.

144
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,160
Mingkai.

145
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,200
Why are you here?

146
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,120
Are you okay, Yunshu?

147
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
That was frightening.

148
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,520
It was indeed dangerous yesterday.

149
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,080
But everything's fine now.

150
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,000
So don't worry.

151
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,640
I'm staying here today

152
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,640
to protect you.

153
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,400
You still have the nerve
to show up here.

154
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,640
Yesterday, you knocked me out

155
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,540
and colluded with Mo Shenhai
to hurt Yunshu.

156
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:56,791
Where is your conscience?

157
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,790
Stop pointing your finger at me
or I'll snap your arm.

158
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,520
Try me.

159
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,120
I admit I was wrong yesterday.

160
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,320
But

161
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,560
I still saved Yuzi.

162
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,760
Unlike someone
who laid there like a dead dog.

163
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,360
And now you're barking at me here.

164
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,920
You shamelessly claimed
you wanted to protect Yuzi.

165
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,680
But in the end,

166
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,320
you couldn't even take one blow from me.

167
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,040
What a loser.

168
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,040
How thick-skinned.

169
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,040
You!

170
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,160
Eat up.

171
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,040
Mingkai.

172
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,320
Join us.

173
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,390
A real man never fight with a woman.

174
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,360
And I'm hungry anyway.

175
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,120
Yunshu.

176
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,990
I was terrified upon learning
about your injury this morning.

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,980
I was so upset
as if I were the one who got hurt.

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,950
The doctor tried to stop me,
but I insisted on coming over.

179
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,480
Yunshu.

180
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,960
You must tell me
what happened yesterday.

181
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,560
I really was badly injured yesterday.

182
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,520
What?

183
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,720
You...

184
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,240
But I don't see any wounds.

185
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,360
How did they heal?

186
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,680
I used my dragon saliva
to heal Yunshu's wounds.

187
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,920
Dragon saliva?

188
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,040
You spat on my sister?

189
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,760
Of course not.

190
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,200
I'm very gentle with ladies.

191
00:08:58,767 --> 00:08:59,967
I used my lips

192
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
to pass it over every inch of her skin.

193
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,720
That took me one whole night.

194
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,360
I'm like a life-saving Buddha.

195
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,120
Amitabha.

196
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,200
Am I right,

197
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,200
Shan Yunshu?

198
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,840
He's joking, isn't he?

199
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,560
Long'er!

200
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,280
Stop right there!

201
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,080
I'm going to make you shut up!

202
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,040
Long'er!

203
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,640
Help me tidy the room.

204
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,080
This is the list
of those Mo Yuhan killed

205
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,680
when she was the assassin known as Hen.

206
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,680
Send it to the police and the press.

207
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,920
Yes, sir.

208
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,800
(Portfolio)

209
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,720
And this

210
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,790
is evidence

211
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:14,000
of the Hu family's opium smuggling
twenty years ago.

212
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,560
Submit it to the Prosecutor's Office.

213
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,160
Well,

214
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,920
sir,

215
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,080
the Wanlong Chamber of Commerce
was involved in the smuggling too.

216
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,800
If they start investigating it,

217
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,120
we'll all go down together.

218
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,160
It's not worth it.

219
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,520
There is something
more important than Dongsheng now.

220
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,640
Even if we all go down,

221
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,080
so be it.

222
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,040
Go now.

223
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,920
Yes.

224
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,480
What's happening?

225
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,880
Where is Chief Wu heading?

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,440
Captain.

227
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Haven't you heard?

228
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
We just received a report

229
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,560
saying there's evidence of Dongsheng
smuggling opium twenty years ago.

230
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,720
Also,

231
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,520
the chairwoman's sister

232
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,080
allegedly murdered the former
chairman's concubine, Madam Zeng.

233
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,960
The chief has decided
to lead the arrest personally.

234
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,880
This is bad.

235
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,960
Wait up, Chongming!

236
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,960
Why should I?

237
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,600
I just cleared your name.

238
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,190
Instead of showing me gratitude,
you're turning against me, huh?

239
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,880
I never asked for your help.

240
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,000
Chongming.

241
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,480
My sister told you to look after me.

242
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,920
And this is how you treat me?

243
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,560
Her latest order
was to keep an eye on you.

244
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,920
I wasn't told to look after you.

245
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,360
Fine.

246
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,960
Then I'll go tell Aojue

247
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,200
you and the Black-robed Man
are plotting to kill him.

248
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,880
Are you afraid?

249
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,120
Me? Afraid?

250
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,520
I am nothing but fearless.

251
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,840
But if you dare to snitch on me,

252
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,760
I'll drain your blood
before you even reach home.

253
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,520
You will stay silent
for good after that.

254
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,240
Chongming.

255
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,680
Can you be more creative?

256
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,700
You either threatened to kill

257
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,400
or drain me.

258
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,390
Do you think I'll fall for that?

259
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,200
Why?

260
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,840
Do you think I dare not do so?

261
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,360
No.

262
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,310
I'm sure you dare do so.

263
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,310
You're nothing but bold.

264
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,640
But you can't do it.

265
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,760
What?

266
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,120
Shan Yunshu and I may be distant now.

267
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,280
But I'm her blood sister after all.

268
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,160
If you kill me,

269
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,520
she will hate you forever.

270
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,720
Since you care so much about her,

271
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,160
you dare not do it.

272
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,320
Tch.

273
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,320
What a joke.

274
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,120
I'm only in this for the Dragon Pearl.

275
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,560
If I'm not mistaken,

276
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,800
you and Aojue have had some kind
of secret pact with her, right?

277
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,040
Not only can you not kill her,

278
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,960
but you also have to obey her.

279
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,720
The Dragon Pearl is inside Yuzi now.

280
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Even if you eventually

281
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,720
find a way to remove it,

282
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,760
you'll still have to deal
with the Black-robed Man and Aojue.

283
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,510
Are you totally confident
you can do that?

284
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,080
I advise you to stay out of it.

285
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,600
But if you go after the Dragon Pearl,

286
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,160
I'll make sure
there's not even a bone of you left.

287
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,000
How two-faced you are.

288
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,120
You are all gentle, polite, and quiet

289
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,280
in Yuzi's presence.

290
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,600
But you're a beast when it comes to me.

291
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,160
A beast?

292
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,640
You're an assassin,
but you're calling me a beast?

293
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
I bet you killed

294
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,200
more than I have.

295
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,520
Enough.

296
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,760
Let's go.

297
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,120
What are you doing?

298
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,710
Someone has filed a report against her.

299
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,260
She is under arrest for killing
the former chairman's concubine

300
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,680
and butler of Dongsheng.

301
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,160
Those who have nothing to do with it,
please leave immediately!

302
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,560
Here, Yunshu.

303
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,920
Madam!

304
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,800
Madam!

305
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,480
Madam.

306
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,320
This is bad!

307
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,360
Chief Wu from the police department
has seized all our cargo at the dock

308
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,920
and frozen part of our stocks

309
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,760
on the grounds
of Dongsheng's opium smuggling.

310
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,200
Madam!

311
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,080
Madam!

312
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,040
Here's today's paper.

313
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,960
Please have a look.

314
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,000
It says your sister has killed
many prominent business figures.

315
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,720
She is now labelled
a spy and an assassin.

316
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,160
She has already been arrested.

317
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,880
Seal it.

318
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,020
(Sealed by Mo City Police Department)

319
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,400
Chief Wu.

320
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,960
What is all this?

321
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,120
Ms. Shan.

322
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,320
Please pardon me.

323
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,320
I'm just performing my duties here.

324
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,920
There is verified evidence

325
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,320
that Dongsheng Trading

326
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,000
smuggled opium.

327
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,760
By order of higher-ups,

328
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,040
all your company assets
must be seized and sealed.

329
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,080
If you're not happy about it,

330
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,960
you may report it to my superiors.

331
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,640
Do you have a seizure order?

332
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,580
(Seizure Order)

333
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,440
Was this Mo Shenhai's doing?

334
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,960
That's right.

335
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,200
The pot calling the kettle black.

336
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,470
If it really came
from the Wanlong Chamber of Commerce,

337
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,080
they're implicated too.

338
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,320
Back then,

339
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,520
Wanlong was Mr. Hu's business partner.

340
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,440
That's not for you to worry about.

341
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,920
We'll get to the bottom of it.

342
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,720
Looks like Mo Shenhai
has truly run out of options.

343
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,960
He actually resorted
to such destructive move

344
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,360
to make me yield.

345
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,680
But here's the thing, Chief Wu.

346
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,920
If both Wanlong and Dongsheng fall,

347
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,120
you'll be in danger.

348
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,310
What do you mean by that?

349
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,640
As far as I know,

350
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,360
Mr. Hu and Mr. Wan

351
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,960
gave you a lot of benefits then.

352
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,280
If this is thoroughly investigated,
will you remain innocent?

353
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,920
This trick of Mo Shenhai's

354
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,840
is meant to drag
all of us down with him.

355
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,720
How could you be so reckless?

356
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,400
Mo Shenhai is making
his last-ditch effort

357
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,680
because he's failed to beat me.

358
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,320
And you've witnessed

359
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,680
how strong my bodyguards are.

360
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,680
He can't lay a finger on me.

361
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,720
If the two biggest companies
in Mo City fall,

362
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,360
your position

363
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,960
will be gone too.

364
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,880
By then,

365
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,800
apart from us two,

366
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,660
there will be more coming after you.

367
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,600
So,

368
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,000
what idea do you have?

369
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,200
Timing beats all.

370
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,480
Take your time with the investigation.

371
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,560
Naturally, I won't forget your kindness.

00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,680
The Hu family happens to have
some properties in your hometown.

373
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,280
Let that be a gift for your two sons
and daughter back home.

374
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,240
This case

375
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,120
was assigned to me by my superiors.

376
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,600
I need to lay low.

377
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,520
Rest assured.

378
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,840
I have my own way.

379
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,280
But before that,

380
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,200
please allow me to see my sister.
