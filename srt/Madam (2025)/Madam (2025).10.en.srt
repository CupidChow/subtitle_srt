You'll roll the dough.

Stop calling me that.

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,430

Long'er.

Stop laughing
or I'd turn you into a dumpling.

Yunshu.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,930
Well, you will make the dumplings.

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,830
I'll roll the dough.

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,460
I don't know how to do it.

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,380
What can you do, then?

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,520
Well,

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,080
he's a mere glutton.

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,640
Shut up, you stupid demon.

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,920
You!

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,200
You drove all the servants out.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
Yet you know nothing.

26
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,040
Why are you here, then?

27
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,280
I...

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,520
I'll knead the dough.

29
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,320
I should know how to do that.

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:20,840
Are you sure?

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,960
You're unbelievable, Long'er!

32
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,090
Let me have some blood
to replenish my spiritual energy.

33
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,130
And we'll get to eat soon.

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,360
You know nothing.

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,240
All you do is infuriate people.

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,200
This reminds me of making dumplings

37
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,560
with Mom and Yuhan when I was young.

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,990
That was exactly like this.

Yunshu.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,800
I believe you will
reunite with your sister.

00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,030
I'll help you make that happen.

00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,560

to see you here.

00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,020

00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,000
Sure.

because you've found your sister.

62
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,080
Take that.

63
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,080
You!

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,840

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,120

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,880
Eat your food.

67
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,040
You talk too much.

68
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,280
Alright,

69
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:24,960
stop it.

70
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,080
Miss Yuhan.

71
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,760
Your return has warmed Yunshu's heart.

72
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,020
You should come home often.

73
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,640
Actually, I came here to have a look
at our parents' belongings.

74
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,520
Can I?

75
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,600
Of course you can.

76
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,280
What do you think?

77
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,910
Do you still remember this outfit?

78
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,900
They share a strong bond?

79
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,120
Mom knitted it all by herself then.

80
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,160
She was cold yesterday,
but she's now come around to it.

81
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,120
You said you loved
the pattern of a little tiger.

82
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,850
I don't believe it.

83
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,120
She sewed all these on her own.

84
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,040
Stay still unless she is on the move.

85
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,910
I don't remember that.

86
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,240
Let's just act accordingly.

87
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,800
There's this too.

88
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,800
Father made you this blessing pouch
with golden thread

89
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,000
for your birthday.

90
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,450
You wouldn't let go of it back then.

91
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,600
I don't remember that either.

92
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,240
You were too young.

93
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,580
It's normal you don't remember it.

94
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,510
Don't worry about it.

95
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,480
I only remember
Mother's sorrowful face as she fell.

96
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,520
And the sight of you departure.

97
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,320
I'll never forget that.

98
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,840
The way Mother collapsed

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,480
and your helpless cries.

100
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,360
That's why I must take revenge.

101
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,080
I must find the killer,

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,880
especially Mo Shenhai.

103
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,320
I won't stop you

104
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
from avenging it.

105
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,920
But I won't help you either.

106
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,880
Fine.

107
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,480
I understand.

108
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,160
Because you ever told me

109
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,760
that Mo Shenhai raised you up.

110
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,640
I'll repay that kindness on your behalf.

111
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,920
But I'm still going

112
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,640
to take revenge.

113
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,600
Yes.

114
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,760
Yuzi.

115
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,400
Can I stay here tonight?

116
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,920
Of course.

117
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,920
If you want to,
you're welcome here anytime!

118
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,200
You'll stay in my room.

119
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,550
I'll get everything ready for you.

120
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,680
Chongming!

121
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,640
Hurry up.

122
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,920
Take my sister to my room.

123
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,880
Yes, Madam.

124
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,920
Get rid of him for me.

125
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,880
Calm down.

126
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,120
Calm down, my foot.

127
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,840
Mo Shenhai must be the one behind it.

128
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,960
I put up with it when he hurt me then.

129
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,360
But he dared hurt my sister.

130
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,080
He must die.

131
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,760
I'll kill him for you.

132
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,550
Considering your sister's skills,

133
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,440
it'd be impossible
for that person to hurt your sister

134
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,840
without us noticing.

135
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,280
Shut up!

136
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,490
I don't want to hear that.

137
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,200
I want Mo Shenhai dead.

138
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,480
I promise you.

139
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,400
This time,

140
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,800
he will perish completely.

141
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,160
Wait a second.

142
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,280
Madam.

143
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,160
If we kill Mo Shenhai now,

144
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,280
wouldn't your whole plan be ruined?

145
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,640
Then how will your parents' case
be cleared?

146
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,840
And what about

147
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,640
your sister?

148
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,880
Long'er.

149
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,280
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,760
I regret it now.

151
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,840
Little girl, don't ever go soft.

152
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,080
Kill him to avoid further trouble.

153
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,240
You will regret this.

154
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,560
If I just kill you today,

155
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,800
it'd be too easy on you.

156
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,120
I'll take back everything
you stole from my family,

157
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,600
one by one.

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,280
I'll make you lose everything.

159
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,000
You will feel ten times
the pain I had back then.

160
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,520
I'll make you live in constant fear.

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,300
It will be a living hell for you.

162
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,600
Madam.

163
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,520
The police are coming.

164
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,480
I promised my sister

165
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,240
that I'd

166
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,640
repay your kindness in raising her
on her behalf.

167
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,480
If you ever hurt anyone I love again,

168
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,320
you will meet your demise.

169
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,280
Tell the Black-robed Man
to come and see me.

170
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,720
Aojue.

171
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,000
I apologize.

172
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,420
I was just afraid you'd act on impulse
and kill Mo Shenhai for real.

173
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,800
Thus, I used the restriction spell.

174
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,240
Me? Act on impulse?

175
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,120
You're the one who made it complicated.

176
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,720
You told me to kill him.

177
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,480
And you stopped me from doing so.

178
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,990
Did you ever consider my feelings
when using the restriction spell?

179
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,840
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,760
I was upset about my sister's condition.

181
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,200
I was being reckless.

182
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,990
All you care about
is your sister's condition

183
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,360
and that of soft Zhang Mingkai.

184
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,240
Have you ever considered mine?

185
00:10:32,552 --> 00:10:33,520
Are you hurt?

186
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,280
It's my heart!

187
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,440
It's true that you're willing
to punish me for others.
