1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:05,881
But...

2
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:08,842
Am I doing well?

3
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:11,929
What?

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,309
Will I not be looked down upon elsewhere?

5
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,939
Where else are you going to do this?

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,026
Right.

7
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,366
Is that important?

8
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,869
Hey

9
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,498
What was your name again?

10
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,628
I never told you

11
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:53,679
I know

12
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,931
What?

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,684
Do you know everything?

14
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,185
Are you a stalker?

15
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,270
At our place

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,231
You should have only hit on girls once or twice

17
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,733
How many times a day did you introduce yourself?

18
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,820
Ah...

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,613
This is embarrassing

20
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,949
But that wasn't me

21
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,493
My friend is the one who likes that

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,703
Not me

23
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,671
Is it a single character?

24
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,219
I see

25
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,688
This is really good

26
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,316
Ah...

27
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,235
Are you crazy, seriously?

28
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,079
Did you wake up?

29
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:43,872
Yeah

30
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,124
Hey, did I drink a lot yesterday?

31
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,211
I can't remember anything

32
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,671
We had a lot of fun yesterday

33
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,590
I...

34
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,050
Since class ran late...

35
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,218
I'll go first

36
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,594
It was fun

37
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:11,608
Hey

38
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,276
Are you going today?

39
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:14,528
Where?

40
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,863
To the hunting pocha

41
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,491
Why so suddenly?

42
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,993
Are you finally realizing you're going to the military?

43
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,955
Yeah, so are we going?

44
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:26,998
No

45
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,208
Why not?

46
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,837
Ah, why... really... ah...

47
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,673
What's wrong with you today? Did you eat something bad?

48
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,758
When I say let's go

49
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,717
Even if you go

50
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,885
You'll just sit there like a coward

51
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,303
Why are you acting so weird today?

52
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,680
Why so strange?

53
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,765
Ah...

54
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:46,685
Hey

55
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,395
Then that time

56
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,729
You said you'd introduce me

57
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:54,776
Yeah

58
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,736
Does she have a boyfriend?

59
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,446
I don't think so yet

60
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,158
Then introduce her to me

61
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:02,951
Are you crazy?

62
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,327
A guy who's enlisting in a month

63
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,620
Why not?

64
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,038
Even if it's not romance, we can just...

65
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,041
Be friends, right?

66
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,459
Hey, and besides

67
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,087
Didn't you say she wanted to meet me?

68
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,883
Ah... this is really suspicious

69
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,677
Come on, just ask her once

70
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,512
Quickly

71
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,474
Then let's drink too

72
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,309
Alcohol

73
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,395
Then buy me a tart

74
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:31,980
Okay

75
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,149
Wait a moment...

76
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:37,861
Hey...

77
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,155
I don't have my wallet?

78
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,489
What? You didn't bring it?

79
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,659
Seems like I left it

80
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,828
Must be at home

81
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,210
Isn't it at the PC bang?

82
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,962
Yeah, might be at the PC bang

83
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,380
Hey, let's go check

84
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,048
Huh?

85
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,341
Should we call and ask?

86
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,383
Yeah! No, no

87
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,468
Why not? Let's call and ask

88
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,469
No, no

89
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,096
Thinking about it again

90
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:05,764
Uh...

91
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,307
It's at home

92
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,059
Hey, it's definitely at home

93
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,235
So you buy the tart

94
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,738
Ah, buy it

95
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,394
Hey, they say everyone's almost here?

96
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,144
Really?

97
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,145
They say to come to Seokgu Beer?

98
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:54,604
Huh?

99
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,313
Hey, no

100
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,231
Why?

101
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,399
Let's go somewhere else

102
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,317
Honestly, aren't you tired of that place?

103
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,987
She wanted to drink cocktails there, let's just go

104
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,154
Please...

105
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:03,905
Huh?

106
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,618
Hey, no?

107
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,995
What day is it today?

108
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,664
Today's Friday, why?

109
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,875
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 5 PM to 11 PM

110
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,754
Cool! Let's go to Seokgu Beer

111
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,634
Ah, this guy is acting really weird

112
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,719
Why is he like this?

113
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,929
Hey, come with us

114
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,740
It's not because he's handsome?

115
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,826
What are you talking about? It's not that

116
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,042
Really?

117
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,960
Ah... yeah

118
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,504
Since he's going to the military

119
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,423
But these days

120
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,508
They say you can use phones in the military too

121
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,468
Yeah!

122
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,181
Well, that's true

123
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,309
What?

124
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,977
Why are you so enthusiastic today?

125
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:16,978
Oh!

126
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,565
Oppa, you don't have my number, right?

127
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,858
Give me your phone

128
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:22,984
Here

129
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:29,824
Huh?

130
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,250
Should we order another cocktail then?

131
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:40,585
Yeah

132
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,003
Great!

133
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:44,923
Here!

134
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,050
Ah, yes

135
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,941
Hey, where are you going?

136
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,442
I'm going to the bathroom for a bit

137
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,281
Do you need anything else?

138
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,381
Did your class go well?

139
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,341
Ah...

140
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:30,801
Yeah

141
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,639
Today was successful, huh?

142
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:36,683
Huh?

143
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,227
The hunting

144
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,526
Of course it was successful

145
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,654
What did you say your name was again?

146
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,948
I really can't remember anything

147
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,618
How can you not remember the name?

148
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,416
I never told you

149
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:02,917
Ah, really?

150
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,335
Right?

151
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:06,754
Somehow...

152
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,506
Somehow I couldn't remember

153
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,341
I didn't ask you, did I?

154
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,930
Then have fun

155
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:17,682
Yeah

156
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:45,710
Huh?

157
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,002
We didn't call you

158
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,261
What's this?

159
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,930
Hey, isn't this your wallet?

160
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,849
Oppa lost his wallet?

161
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,692
You left it at my place yesterday

162
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:11,736
Place?
