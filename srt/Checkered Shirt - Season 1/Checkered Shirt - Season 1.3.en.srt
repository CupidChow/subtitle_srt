1
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:07,925
Wow...

2
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:09,968
Your place is really nice.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,138
You live here alone?

4
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:14,640
Yes.

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,434
You can speak casually.

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,019
You're older than me.

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,854
Ah...

8
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:22,981
Right.

9
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,287
Are you preparing for a transfer?

10
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,247
Ah, yes...

11
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,501
I heard you weren't attending school...

12
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,253
Did you drop out?

13
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:48,882
I'm on leave.

14
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,968
Which school do you go to?

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,803
Donghan University.

16
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,138
Donghan?

17
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:57,432
Huh?

18
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,101
That's nearby, isn't it?

19
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,519
Yes.

20
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,492
Can you see our school?

21
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,452
Yes.

22
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,705
Oh...

23
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,875
When was this photo taken?

24
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,919
In high school.

25
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,131
Cute.

26
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,176
I'm cute?

27
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,764
Seohan University, I like our school.

28
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,268
Do you think I could get in?

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,061
What's your major?

30
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,357
I'm in art, but I'm transferring to sciences.

31
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,860
Is that even possible?

32
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,405
I'm also considering retaking the entrance exam.

33
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,240
Which department?

34
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,200
Computer Engineering.

35
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,076
Huh?

36
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,164
Hey, are you trying to impress me?

37
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,124
I'm in Computer Engineering.

38
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,001
I know.

39
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,754
What? How do you know?

40
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:10,839
I heard you talking with your friends.

41
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,299
At the bar.

42
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,052
Ah...

43
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,637
Seokgu Beer is our hangout spot.

44
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,974
You must be busy...

45
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,977
Is that why you don't have a girlfriend?

46
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,025
And you...

47
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,860
Why aren't you dating?

48
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,112
It's not that I don't want to...

49
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,448
I just can't.

50
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:39,534
Never dated?

51
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:40,410
No!

52
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,496
Look,

53
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,748
I've had some connections.

54
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,459
But since we're in engineering...

55
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,669
Natural meetings are difficult.

56
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,838
It's mostly through introductions.

57
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,634
So first you meet for dinner and talk,

58
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,094
Then go to a café and talk more,

59
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,638
Spend time getting to know each other, right?

60
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,140
But after that...

61
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,851
How should I put it?

62
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,813
I'm not curious anymore.

63
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,359
How can you figure everything out from the start?

64
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,902
You just didn't like them.

65
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,739
You think so?

66
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,744
Must have high standards?

67
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,998
I'm telling you that's not it.

68
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,503
Can you drink well?

69
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,922
I don't drink much.

70
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,799
Just...

71
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,218
The type to eat quickly and go home?

72
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,021
Are you okay?

73
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:53,859
Let me see.

74
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,410
I'll do it.

75
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,037
Where's the bathroom?

76
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,247
Ah...

77
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,249
Hey.

78
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:10,709
Yeah?

79
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,491
What's that?

80
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,369
Sleeping pills.

81
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,914
Why are you taking those?

82
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,000
Because I have trouble sleeping.

83
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,170
You're going to sleep already?

84
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,423
I'm not sleepy yet.

85
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,593
If you're not sleepy, don't sleep.

86
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,720
Want to watch a movie with me?

87
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,397
They're kissing without even dating.

88
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,900
That can happen.

89
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,029
I don't get it.

90
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,036
Of course you don't, you've never done it.

91
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:30,997
Are you making fun of me?

92
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,255
Yeah, you're right.

93
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,966
How would I know without trying?

94
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,472
Are you curious?

95
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:50,767
About what?

96
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,478
Kissing?

97
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,985
I am curious.

98
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,742
Do you know what this is?

99
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,952
It's a jelly.

100
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,871
It's called a kiss jelly.

101
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,416
They say when you eat it,

102
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,667
It feels like a kiss.

103
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,718
Try licking it.

104
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,177
What?

105
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,431
Try it.

106
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,657
What's with that expression?

107
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,410
You touched me.

108
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,912
I didn't touch you.

109
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,124
You're so innocent.

110
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,385
What kind of drama is this?

111
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,262
Why are there so many kissing scenes?

112
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,477
You're like...

113
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,604
You're such a dork.

114
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:20,982
What?

115
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,903
Is that a compliment?

116
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,994
Can I really do it?

117
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,373
Do what?

118
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,542
Kiss you.

119
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,046
Are you drunk?

120
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,217
I think you're more drunk than I am.

121
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,555
Is my face very red?

122
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,726
I think the alcohol is kicking in.

123
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,736
If you don't want to, say so.

124
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,548
You...

125
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,718
What?

126
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,180
You said you were curious.

127
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,850
I was just showing you.

128
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,354
But...

129
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,064
This isn't a kiss.

130
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,653
I know that much.
