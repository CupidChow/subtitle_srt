1
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:03,837
Ah, I just boiled it

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:04,796
You woke up like a ghost

3
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:05,797
What?

4
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:06,673
Where are you going?

5
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,175
I have an appointment

6
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:09,885
From weekend morning?

7
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,679
Who are you meeting?

8
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,222
Don't tell me it's Soyoung?!

9
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,017
I'll be back

10
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:24,942
Ouch, hot

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,219
Go in first

12
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,013
There are no seats inside

13
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,598
Oh, really?

14
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,809
Then...

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,061
Should we do it at home?

16
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,272
That's why I said let's meet at Kkachisan, right?

17
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,316
What?

18
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,985
Then why bother waiting?

19
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,196
There are a lot of people working here in the cafe

20
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,990
Seats won't be available easily, right?

21
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:17,786
Hyung

22
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,080
Are you always like this?

23
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:21,456
Huh?

24
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,960
Like what?

25
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:28,880
Nothing

26
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,173
Let's go

27
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,606
Wait here for 5 minutes

28
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,233
Why?

29
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,361
My house is messy because I haven't cleaned up

30
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,656
Come on, we're both guys, what does it matter?

31
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,786
Want to wait?

32
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,458
Wait

33
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,975
Did you clean everything?

34
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,643
Yes

35
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,190
Now, look

36
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,317
If the sequencing problem is at the end of the text

37
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,319
It's better to solve the sequencing problem first

38
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,198
This problem has text after the sequence too, right?

39
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,701
The conclusion often appears here

40
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,412
You know Seowon University's transfer English exam

41
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,206
Is the most difficult one, right?

42
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:48,919
Yes

43
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,962
The more difficult it is, what do you need to do?

44
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,632
You need to approach it strategically

45
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,674
That's what I'm saying

46
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,759
And

47
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,971
Diligently memorizing vocabulary is also important

48
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,058
If you get something wrong because you don't know words like these

49
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,851
It's really frustrating, isn't it?

50
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,900
Are you sleepy?

51
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:14,903
No

52
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,533
You don't seem to be concentrating?

53
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,868
I am concentrating

54
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,954
Really?

55
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,875
Hyung

56
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,755
You're cool

57
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:35,882
What?

58
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,928
After always seeing you hunting women

59
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,430
Seeing this now

60
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,475
You're cool

61
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,021
Really?

62
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,331
You can accept it

63
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,375
No, it's fine

64
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,254
Is it...

65
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,173
Going well?

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,302
I'm not interested

67
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,928
She's not my type either

68
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,225
What is your type then?

69
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,814
First of all...

70
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,692
Fair skin

71
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,487
Long eyelashes

72
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,908
Someone who tells me...

73
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,660
That checkered shirts look good on me

74
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,500
The woman next to you that time was pretty, wasn't she?

75
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,338
Do you want me to work things out with her?

76
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,675
That...

77
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,719
Is up to you

78
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,890
You can use what you learned from me

79
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,810
What did I learn?

80
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,066
I don't remember?

81
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,110
Don't lie

82
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,992
It's true...

83
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,621
I'll have to teach you again

84
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,291
Hyung

85
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,086
Honestly, you're not a virgin, right?

86
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,129
That's right

87
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,007
Doesn't seem like it, right?

88
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,427
Then let's say I'm not

89
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,059
Let's take a short break

90
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,146
You're tired, aren't you?

91
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,233
No

92
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,235
It's just that you look tired

93
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,867
Let's relax for a bit

94
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:08,952
To do what?

95
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,959
I wanted to draw you

96
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,336
Suddenly?

97
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,672
Don't move

98
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:44,941
Did you sleep well?

99
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,450
Yes, I slept well

100
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,330
Good
