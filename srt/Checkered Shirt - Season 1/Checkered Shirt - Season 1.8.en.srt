1
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,920
You can just sleep in my room

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:05,255
What?

3
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:07,048
Hey

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,759
Why is this kid sleeping in your room?

5
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,760
Because my room is bigger

6
00:00:11,677 --> 00:00:12,554
No way

7
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,347
This kid's room is super dirty, seriously

8
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,224
Just sleep in my room

9
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,144
Do you have an extra blanket?

10
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,728
I have one

11
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,648
Come here

12
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:25,858
Look at him taking care of his student?

13
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:27,860
Let's go

14
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,925
Um...

15
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,885
Am I really sleeping here?

16
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:52,802
Yes

17
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,554
Let's sleep together in the bed

18
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,309
I slept in your bed with you too

19
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,438
Ah, but Jaesub sunbae also lives here

20
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:07,442
Sunbae?

21
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:11,612
You told me to call you that

22
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:14,992
No, don't worry about him

23
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:16,617
No

24
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,494
Don't even hang out with him

25
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,876
But is this a single bed?

26
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:27,670
Yes

27
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:32,925
It seems a bit narrow

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,139
Isn't that better then?

29
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,226
Do you have something I can wear?

30
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,146
Just a moment

31
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,572
Will it be too big?

32
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,409
Huh?

33
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,744
Isn't this outdoor clothing?

34
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:01,204
It's fine

35
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:06,376
It's pretty

36
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,146
Wait

37
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,034
But who is it?

38
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,579
What?

39
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,041
The person you were talking to earlier

40
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:34,588
Just...

41
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,300
Someone I know

42
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:42,179
Just someone I know...

43
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,851
Why do you look so upset?

44
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,652
Is it the person from that life shot?

45
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,117
Seems like I'm right

46
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:05,911
Ex-boyfriend?

47
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,289
Just

48
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,916
We dated briefly

49
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,597
Is it over?

50
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:28,393
What?

51
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:33,440
Can I stop asking?

52
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,360
It's a waste of time...

53
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,240
Well, I am curious

54
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,244
But...

55
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,206
Even talking about it now is a waste of time

56
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,389
I like you

57
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:08,934
Hangyeol

58
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,019
Hyung

59
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,940
Will you go out with me?

60
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,286
Ah, I didn't think Jeongwoo oppa was like that

61
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,579
That's too much

62
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,581
Doing this now when you're going to the military

63
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,958
I feel a bit sorry about it

64
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,876
Then why did you ask me to introduce you to someone?

65
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,795
I encouraged him a bit from the side

66
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,713
Sorry

67
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,382
For awkwardly being in the middle

68
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,177
And you have time for tutoring?

69
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,806
Ah, how was that person yesterday?

70
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,181
Hangyeol?

71
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,224
Yeah

72
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:51,809
Is he really coming to our school?

73
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,144
Yeah, he said he's applying

74
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:54,896
Why?

75
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,065
Is he from Donghan University?

76
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,275
Donghan University?

77
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,193
Is that so?

78
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,320
He just said he lives near Kachisan

79
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,697
I only know that he's an art student

80
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,155
He's an art student?

81
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,117
Yeah, why?

82
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,411
No, I...

83
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,786
Among my former classmates

84
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:12,371
I have a friend at Donghan University

85
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,498
And that friend previously

86
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,625
Showed me something that was posted on Everytime

87
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,253
And he looks a bit like the person I saw there

88
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,670
Hangyeol?

89
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,047
Yes

90
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,257
He was even in art school

91
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,467
What was the post about?

92
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:45,530
Hyung

93
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,990
I'll go first

94
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,626
Aren't you forgetting something?

95
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,512
Ha...

96
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,556
This is driving me crazy

97
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:30,949
That's it for today...

98
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:35,954
Call me when you wake up

99
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:22,961
Hangyeol!

100
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:32,929
What?

101
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,015
Stop avoiding me and talk to me

102
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:38,600
Let go

103
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,395
No, it'll just take a moment, just a moment

104
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,814
I said let go!

105
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,617
Hi

106
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,161
Huh?

107
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,667
I have class, so I'll get up first

108
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,765
What's going on?

109
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:20,310
Did you two fight?

110
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:21,435
Huh?

111
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:23,395
No

112
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,734
Then why is the atmosphere like this?

113
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,360
It's nothing

114
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,570
What's with the atmosphere?

115
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,407
You're super awkward right now

116
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,158
Yeah

117
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:39,203
Yeah, yeah

118
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,631
Jeongwoo

119
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:52,926
You...

120
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,177
Do you

121
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,346
have something you're hiding from me?

122
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,557
Hiding?

123
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,689
You and Lee Hangyeol...

124
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:09,609
Are you dating?

125
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,569
Huh?
