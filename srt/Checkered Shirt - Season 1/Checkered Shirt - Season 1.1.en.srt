1
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,757
Minji, why aren't you responding...

2
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:10,093
Didn't you say you'd call when you got home?

3
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,179
Guess she hasn't arrived yet

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,181
Hey, is Minji living in Jeju or something?

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,557
It's been four hours

6
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,185
You were the one who wanted to break up before

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,647
Yeah, back then

8
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,523
But now that we've actually broken up

9
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,025
I feel like I can't live without her

10
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:27,778
Hey

11
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,447
Didn't you guys only date for two months?

12
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,491
The time spent together

13
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,284
Doesn't measure the depth of love

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,203
*sigh*

15
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:43,961
Hey

16
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,712
Look behind you

17
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,547
Those girls are getting his number

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,307
That server must be in the Theater Department at our school

19
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,688
Wow... look at those girls' confidence

20
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,023
Must be popular?

21
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,402
Not sure?

22
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,529
*sigh*

23
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,073
What would a forever-single like you know?

24
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,376
Well...

25
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,086
They look nice

26
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,797
Hey, should we ask them if they wanna hang out?

27
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,757
The server?

28
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,009
Are you crazy?

29
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,677
No, those girls...

30
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:34,803
Ah...

31
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,264
Why would the server want to hang out with us?

32
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,183
No, I meant... nevermind, my mistake

33
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,019
What do you think?

34
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,103
Want me to go talk to them?

35
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,771
Forget it

36
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,858
You were just going on about Minji, what's this about?

37
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:48,692
Hey

38
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,486
They say the best way to get over someone is to meet someone new

39
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,696
Before you go to the military

40
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,239
You gonna leave without even having kissed anyone?

41
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,407
Come on!

42
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,035
Let's hit the singles bar tomorrow?

43
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,369
No, that's different

44
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,830
You're wasting precious time right now

45
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,207
Hey, I'll be right back

46
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,417
OfferUp?

47
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,294
Oh yeah, go ahead and eat

48
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,013
Is it from OfferUp?

49
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:18,930
Ah, yes

50
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,141
Oh, sorry I'm late

51
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,476
That's 45,000 won

52
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,728
I only have a 50,000 won bill

53
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,731
Then wait a moment

54
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,692
It's okay, just keep it

55
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,155
Thanks

56
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,867
Aren't you going to check it?

57
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,077
Ah...

58
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,122
Well, whatever

59
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,626
Hope you enjoy it

60
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,346
Nice to meet you

61
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,065
Oh, you're here?

62
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,526
This is my friend

63
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,361
The most handsome one, Jung-woo

64
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,446
Hi

65
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,572
Hi

66
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,908
Turns out they're from our school, Korean Literature

67
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,494
Hey, show me what you got from OfferUp

68
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,918
Ah...

69
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,462
This guy's such an engineering student!

70
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,632
How many times did I tell you not to buy plaid shirts?

71
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,802
You really love plaid that much?

72
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,139
Don't tell me you only have plaid shirts at home?

73
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,516
That's right, I only have plaid shirts

74
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,102
Didn't you say you were buying clothes for tomorrow?

75
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,562
Where are you going?

76
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,021
Ah... amusement park

77
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,481
Amusement park

78
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,983
Wow, that'll be fun

79
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,328
Not bad, right?

80
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,066
I'm the one who bought

81
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,860
The plaid shirt on OfferUp earlier

82
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,032
I found this in the pocket

83
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,416
Just throw it away

84
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,846
You up for it?

85
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,307
Should be!

86
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,734
Isn't it better than you thought?

87
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,612
I swear, if you show up wearing that tomorrow...

88
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,239
Is it that bad?

89
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,032
It's awful

90
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,742
No, it's nice!

91
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,911
It's really nice

92
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,412
Hey, it's perfect for me!

93
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,123
It just looks good

94
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:53,103
If you haven't deleted the photo yet

95
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,813
Could I get it again?

96
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,404
Oh my god!

97
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,198
Hey, don't you have afternoon classes?

98
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,222
Um... OfferUp?

99
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,183
Ah... yes

100
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,435
Here you go

101
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,437
Thank you

102
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,572
But...

103
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,118
Didn't you say it was new?

104
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,245
What?
