1
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,933
We didn't call you, did we?

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:23,482
What's this?

3
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,359
Hey, isn't this your wallet?

4
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,236
Oppa, did you lose your wallet?

5
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,080
You left it at my place yesterday

6
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,123
Place?

7
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,259
Ah..

8
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,804
We met at the PC cafe yesterday

9
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,681
Since I recognized you

10
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:56,974
We had a drink together

11
00:00:58,684 --> 00:00:59,768
Oh, really?

12
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,062
You're quite sociable, huh?

13
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,064
I greeted you outside earlier

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,401
I should have given it then...

15
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,735
Why are you giving it to me now?

16
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,657
Let's have a drink together next time

17
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,033
We come here quite often

18
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,660
Yes

19
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,745
You could give us some service now

20
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,081
I'll bring it right to you

21
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,545
Come out for a moment

22
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,552
Just wait 10 minutes

23
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,349
Who are you?

24
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,227
What do you mean?

25
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,147
Are you trying to embarrass me right now?

26
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,692
What did I do wrong?

27
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,863
I'm just returning your wallet, what's the problem?

28
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,120
Seems like there's a misunderstanding

29
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,330
I'm not gay!

30
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,584
I'm not like you

31
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,210
I hope there's no misunderstanding

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,548
Yesterday was a mistake, I drank too much

33
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,551
You said you didn't remember...

34
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,554
But you seem to remember everything, don't you?

35
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,601
You asked if you could stay over

36
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,352
And I said you could

37
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,688
I'm just returning your wallet, why?

38
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,524
What's wrong with that?

39
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,277
Why give it to me in front of everyone!

40
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,695
Should I call you aside to give it to you then?

41
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,574
Hey! What are you doing there?

42
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,203
Let's go, the guys are too drunk

43
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,247
Yeah

44
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,471
Wow, it's cold..

45
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,015
Hey, what were you talking about with that guy earlier?

46
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,517
Nothing special

47
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,268
How old is he?

48
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,311
Twenty

49
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,562
Does he have a girlfriend?

50
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,730
I don't know..

51
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,774
He's not dating anyone right now

52
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,233
Why?

53
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,443
He's a student, he's studying for exams

54
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,153
Oh really?

55
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,154
Is he retaking the exam?

56
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,074
But how did you end up drinking

57
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,493
And you even went to his place

58
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,995
It's all because of you

59
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,581
How is it my fault?

60
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,421
I don't know

61
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,101
What did you say your name was?

62
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,895
I really can't remember anything

63
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,356
I never told you

64
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,733
You said you didn't remember...

65
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,862
But you seem to remember everything, don't you?

66
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:27,309
When was that photo taken?

67
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,227
In high school

68
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,480
That's cute

69
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,276
You think I'm cute?

70
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,524
Hey, what are you doing?

71
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,026
Nothing

72
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,319
Did you get a text from Soyoung?

73
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,530
Yes, we're chatting

74
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,784
Are you going to see her again?

75
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,746
I think we're going to eat something later

76
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,248
Just the two of you?

77
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,167
Yeah, you come too

78
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,174
Hey

79
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,428
If... hypothetically speaking

80
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,723
If you had someone you were starting something with

81
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,729
No, not exactly that

82
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,983
More like someone you met by chance

83
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,359
And...

84
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,568
A kiss?

85
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,989
Yeah, something like that, some physical contact

86
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,991
But the two of you...

87
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,202
Are an impossible couple

88
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,121
What would you do?

89
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,331
Did you kiss someone?

90
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:14,958
Huh?

91
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,835
Did you kiss Soyoung?

92
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,253
No, keep your voice down

93
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,296
You're crazy, when?

94
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,630
I didn't!

95
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,007
Then what's the meaning of what you said?

96
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,216
No, just

97
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,969
Hypothetically speaking

98
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,014
Are you really going to date Soyoung?

99
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,516
Well...

100
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,728
Let's say I am, more or less

101
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,693
I think I could do better

102
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:42,902
Why?

103
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,155
Just because

104
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,740
Didn't you say it was an impossible couple?

105
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,702
If it's impossible, you should try harder, until it works

106
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,749
You think so?

107
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,585
Is it because of military service?

108
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,627
Huh?

109
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,840
Ah... right

110
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,010
There's military service too

111
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,888
But hey...

112
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,015
Isn't that something the other person should decide?

113
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,142
It's not something you can decide just because you like it, right?

114
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,353
Hey

115
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,646
But the problem is...

116
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,148
Uh...

117
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,649
It's that...

118
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,735
I...

119
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,781
I'm not even sure

120
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,574
if I really like them

121
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,451
It's just a feeling that

122
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:32,869
Hey, Jeongwoo

123
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,497
The fact that you're thinking about this

124
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,332
and telling me about it is already

125
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,625
proof that you

126
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,794
are completely smitten

127
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,174
Oppa

128
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,220
Oppa?

129
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:51,846
Oh sorry

130
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,849
I saw a pretty cafe nearby

131
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,017
Do you want to go with me?

132
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,395
Oppa, you haven't even finished your food

133
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,813
Ah...

134
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,316
I'm not feeling well today

135
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,276
Oh, really?

136
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,195
Yeah...

137
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,697
I think I'll feel better if I rest a bit

138
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,908
I'm sorry, can we go next time?

139
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,537
Yes, yes, you should go home

140
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,122
I'll watch you get in a taxi

141
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:19,874
It's okay

142
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,167
You're not feeling well, go home first

143
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,087
Are you sure?

144
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,381
I'll let you know when the bus comes

145
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,518
Welcome

146
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,603
Excuse me, is...

147
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,229
Um...

148
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,483
Is he working today?

149
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,609
Ah

150
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,279
Today Han Gyeol and I

151
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,779
switched shifts, so he's not here

152
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:54,783
Do you need something specific?

153
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,327
No, it's okay

154
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,453
I'll come again

155
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,558
What are you doing here?

156
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,518
What?

157
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,897
They said you weren't working today

158
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,107
My academy is near here

159
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,318
Ah... really?

160
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,447
Your academy is quite far from your home

161
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,118
Why did you come here?

162
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,621
Ah...

163
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,122
I was just passing by

164
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,582
I see...

165
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,167
Then

166
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,086
Wait

167
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,880
Um...

168
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,051
Have you eaten?

169
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:58,515
Do you want to have dinner with me if you haven't eaten?

170
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,613
I'm sorry

171
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,074
I've been thinking

172
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,618
I was the one who stayed at your place

173
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,829
You were right

174
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,002
I was so drunk that day

175
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:32,966
I think I felt guilty about my mistake

176
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,724
What mistake?

177
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,812
You know, everything that happened

178
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,038
Hey, is this wrong too?

179
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,542
Give me that

180
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,169
How do you expect to get into Sehan University with this?

181
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,132
Are you good at English?

182
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,926
Sure, I'm an English specialist

183
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,095
When is your exam?

184
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,557
The 29th

185
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,228
Two weeks left

186
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,814
Do you want me to give you intensive tutoring?

187
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,284
How much do you charge?

188
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,121
No, well...

189
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,748
I'll just help you when I have time

190
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,124
I'm not going to charge you

191
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,710
And...

192
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,920
I have nothing to do until I go to the army

193
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,505
Ah...

194
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,300
Excuse me?

195
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,969
You haven't done your military service yet?

196
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,013
Have you done yours?

197
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,640
Yes, I've done it

198
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,809
You did it early

199
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,482
When are you going?

200
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,234
In a month

201
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,622
We'll start tomorrow

202
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,084
The tutoring
