1
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,190
Oh Min-ah

2
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,110
I bought some salad ingredients

3
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:24,940
and an avocado

4
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,860
Oh, milk. I didn't buy milk

5
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,910
I'll go back and buy it soon

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,490
Is it low-fat milk?

7
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,410
Oh, I see

8
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,470
It's been a while, Suho oppa

9
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,640
Oh.. Minjeong, it's been a while

10
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,770
Oh, you moved here?

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,440
It's been a while since I moved here

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,400
I've never seen you before

13
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,530
It's not a move, there's a new place here

14
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,320
Oh, I see

15
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,740
Oh, it's been a while since we last saw each other. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?

16
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,750
How have you been?

17
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,760
I've seen you active a lot on TV

18
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,720
I was a little busy with my activities,

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
but I'm taking a break now so I'm resting

20
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,720
I see. How

21
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,730
have you been?

22
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,730
Isn't it about time for you to debut?

23
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,730
I quit being a trainee and joined a company

24
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,740
I felt like the singer didn't suit me

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,740
Why? You're talented and the CEO praised you a lot

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,740
If I had done just a little more, I would have debuted

27
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,740
Let's try some more

28
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,460
Since my brother rejected my confession

29
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,340
I didn't even want to dance and I lost interest

30
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,840
I'm just living my life satisfied with the company I work for

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,720
So, oppa, even though it's late,

32
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,730
can you think about the confession

33
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,730
I made just once more?

34
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,280
I still haven't forgotten you, oppa

35
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,490
Minjeong-ah

36
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,590
What's going on?

37
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,780
Minjeong, take care

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,940
Brother

39
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,830
Oppa, are you still seeing Min?

40
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,290
What does that mean?

41
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,870
Only Oppa and Min-i Oppa didn't know

42
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,960
Everyone at the agency knew that the two were meeting

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,630
Don't love something that is impossible in Korea

44
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,340
Let's love as much as possible

45
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,810
That's none of your business

46
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,530
Brother

47
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,340
What are you doing?

48
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,180
I still haven't forgotten you, oppa

49
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,430
If I can't have it, no one can

50
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,370
You're here? What's up?

51
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,700
Why are you drinking all of a sudden?

52
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,670
I just wanted to drink beer

53
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,340
Do you want to do it too?

54
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,130
I'm sick of eating salad and chicken breast all day

55
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,550
How about some beer?

56
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,140
min

57
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,560
What's going on?

58
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,360
No, nothing happened

59
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,530
Nothing? Mr. Park Min,

60
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,910
are you trying to fool me now?

61
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,920
What the heck, that's a really weird look

62
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,630
What's going on?

63
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,170
Actually... I saw you and Minjeong earlier

64
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:43,720
this afternoon

65
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,220
I know that Minjeong did

66
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,140
it unilaterally

67
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,770
But I felt a bit strange

68
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,320
I feel like I'm blocking your path

69
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,710
Don't say things like that. What are you trying to stop?

70
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,090
You are my hope and I am your wish

71
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,930
what

72
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,350
Let's get drunk today

73
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,770
Are you okay?

74
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,770
You didn't drink as much as me

75
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,770
Okay, so if I get drunk today,

76
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,770
will you hug me?

77
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,690
Ah, what are you saying?

78
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,780
Are you going to hug me?

79
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,780
Ah, fall away,

80
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,570
fall away, why?

81
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,790
Why did you call me all of a sudden?

82
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,500
I heard

83
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,000
I heard you and Suho are preparing a unit group?

84
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,180
Oh right

85
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,970
That's why I called

86
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,850
I was going to ask you to give up on the unit group

87
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,650
Why should I do that?

88
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,110
Between my older brother and Suho oppa in the past

89
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,030
I reported it to CEO Jeong

90
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,780
That was me

91
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:38,620
I'm saying that it could happen again this time

92
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,130
My father was promoted quickly at the broadcasting station this time

93
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,920
Well... if you make a good decision,

94
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,390
I'll take care of you

95
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,390
I don't like it

96
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,770
You don't seem so strong and cool,

97
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,730
you look so petty

98
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,360
I'm not as weak as you think

99
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,570
and no matter what you do

100
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,910
Because there is no change between us

101
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,330
It's tough, so don't lose your strength and just do your job well
