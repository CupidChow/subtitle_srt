1
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,390
Ta-da

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,680
This is our second meeting in a long time

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,600
Isn't it too much? What is it?

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,520
Let's go in and talk. It's too cold outside

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,650
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,440
that is

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,610
Huh? Hey, what's that?

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,290
What? You're not going out?

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,540
Then you want me to keep standing outside in the cold?

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,460
Isn't that too much?

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,540
Then tell me, how did you find out about this place

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,880
and what is that carrier?

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,800
I've decided to live here with you now

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:50,920
what?

15
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,590
Who cares?

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,260
Um...as I please?

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,310
I just finished talking to the CEO

18
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,140
Didn't you hear?

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,930
what?

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,530
Representative

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,990
What is the situation now?

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,990
- What's the situation?

23
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,330
- So you're living together with Suho now?

24
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,950
Does it make sense to live with this kid right now?

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,540
You know what that kid did to me

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,000
- I don't know, that's why I'm doing this

27
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,420
- Until Suho Group makes a comeback

28
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,420
- You and Suho will make a unit group

29
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,090
- How great would it be if Suho got recognition and debuted?

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,760
- I finished talking with Suho's representative

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,810
- It's also a chance for you to debut

32
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,890
Representative

33
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,480
- If you don't debut this time, you don't know when you'll get another chance like this

34
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,820
-If you don't like it, quit or take this opportunity

35
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,030
It's your choice

36
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,780
Where is my room?

37
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,160
Can I use it with you?

38
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,540
I like the living room sofa too

39
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,800
Hey Lee Su-ho, this is the last time

40
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,630
Living as if there is and not

41
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,270
Hey! But you still have to give me a blanket!

42
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,050
A kid who can't even act like a man

43
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,260
is born and ruining my life

44
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,100
you...

45
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,690
When your mother died

46
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,240
You should have just died together with me

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
Go buy some booze,

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
fucking booze

49
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,710
-This is dying

50
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,540
Dead to die

51
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,050
Die!

52
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,940
are you okay?

53
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,860
Just being face to face with you in

54
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,860
this house is hard work for me

55
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,770
You know that too, sir

56
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,570
What did he do to us

57
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,110
I don't want to be with you even for a moment

58
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,240
I have no intention of debuting with you

59
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,070
I can't do it

60
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,830
Suho told me not to tell anyone

61
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,460
I have to say
