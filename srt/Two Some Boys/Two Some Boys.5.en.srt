1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,290
Oh? Mina

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,630
I think someone outside is calling your name?

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:06,840
Who?

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,550
Well? There was some drunk uncle who seemed to be calling your name while he was rambling,

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,680
so I thought, no way, it can't be

6
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,950
You can't go in here

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,320
Let go of this, I came to see my son,

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,780
and you're blocking me, what the hell!

9
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,290
Hey! Mina, Kangmin! Dad is here,

10
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,080
Just let go of this already!

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,670
Mister, talk to me

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,500
Huh? Aren't you Suho?

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,840
I'm overwhelmed with emotion because a big star is acknowledging me

14
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,300
Hey Suho, call Min over

15
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,300
You didn't even come home or bring any drinks

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,770
Talk to me, sir. I'll buy you a drink

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,810
Drink?

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,020
Great!

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,980
If it's a drink bought by a big star

20
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,000
Mina, I'm out

21
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,290
Kang-min, what are you doing here?

22
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:42,870
Ah..

23
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,330
Protect!

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Lee Soo-ho

25
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,210
Ah... the smell of alcohol

26
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,420
How much did you drink?

27
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,630
A little?

28
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,630
I... I drank a little

29
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,800
It's true

30
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,520
Did you drink because of your father?

31
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,810
Can I call that person my father?

32
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,690
You hit me like that

33
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,030
My mom is the one who stood by and let it get to that point

34
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,070
Soo-ho,

35
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,290
I've been really happy these days, you know?

36
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,290
I want to meet you again

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,790
I think I will be able to debut soon

38
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,380
I was really so happy

39
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,470
Then that person showed up

40
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,720
I'm scared and angry

41
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,270
Good things will happen when only good things are present

42
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,900
So don't worry too much

43
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,030
Ah...

44
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,530
Here, take this

45
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,370
This is where you shout out the stories you've kept in your heart

46
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,330
Then you'll feel a bit relieved, right?

47
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,380
Here? Yeah

48
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,050
Take a good look

49
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,590
Kangmin is a fool

50
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,390
What? I can hear everything!

51
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,180
Still, it sounds small. Try it

52
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,060
It really feels like a ghost,

53
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,730
and it clears your mind, you know?

54
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,240
Don't block my path, just get lost!

55
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,660
How is it?

56
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,660
Are you feeling a bit better?

57
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,500
Don't be sad anymore

58
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,960
Your pretty face is all ruined

59
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,420
Thank you

60
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,930
If you're grateful, at least give me a kiss here

61
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,680
Hey... this is a playground!

62
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,430
There's no one here

63
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,690
I'm going to fall! Hurry up

64
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,970
Hey, Lee Soo-ho!

65
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:42,720
Nyah nyah!

66
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,440
Here, drink this

67
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,230
You need to stay hydrated

68
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,150
Thank you

69
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,440
I can't drink it all by myself, let's share

70
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,200
Okay, you drink first

71
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,530
No, you drink

72
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,450
first, you drink first

73
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,380
Hello?

74
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,560
Yes, this is Kang Min speaking

75
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,100
What?

76
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,830
Minah, here drink this

77
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,840
You need to stay hydrated

78
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Thank you

79
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,260
I can't drink it all by myself, let's share

80
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,050
Okay, you drink first

81
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,260
No, you drink first

82
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,220
You drink first

83
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,730
Okay

84
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,870
Why? Did I do something wrong?

85
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,750
Am I dirty?

86
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,380
So cute

87
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
Hello?

88
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,490
Yes, I'm Kang Min

89
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
Yes, that's correct

90
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,710
Yes?

91
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,170
It's really cold outside; I'm going to catch a cold like this

92
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's go inside

93
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,090
Suho, it's me

94
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,350
Why do we need to exist with Father?

95
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,770
I was curious, you know?

96
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:08,270
Others liked it when they called their dad, dad

97
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,490
I wish my father and I would just disappear

98
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,830
I wished you would disappear from

99
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,830
my life

100
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,630
Why am I crying?

101
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,590
Mina

102
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I can't fully understand your feelings because I'm not you, but

103
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,980
the existence of a father is

104
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,150
No matter how harshly you speak to your child or how badly you treat them,

105
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,120
you are the one who raised and nurtured them,

106
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,330
so isn't it natural to have a more affectionate heart?

107
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,340
Your father must have felt a lot of regret about you

108
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,970
And he must have gone to a good place

109
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,810
Your father wouldn't want to see you like this, sad

110
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,060
Soo-ho

111
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,820
Stop crying now

112
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,870
My handsome face is getting puffy, so I can't get any uglier

113
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,540
Huh? I feel like I'm getting a bit uglier even now

114
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,720
Are you not going to date me if I get ugly?

115
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,470
I need to think about that a bit

116
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,970
Is that too much?

117
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,730
Just kidding!

118
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,310
Let's quickly go eat something delicious to lift our spirits

119
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm not hungry at all

120
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,320
What? You're such a liar,

121
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,330
your nose is going to grow, Mr. Pinocchio

122
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,500
Alright, enough of that, just find it quickly

123
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,290
Yes, I understand

124
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,790
Let's move quickly

125
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:47,310
- The word love has pain, laughter, and memories - Just as the ground hardens after the rain,

126
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:53,110
our love will also become stronger

127
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,210
- This is our love

128
