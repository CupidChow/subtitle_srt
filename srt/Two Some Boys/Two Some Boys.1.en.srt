1
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:22,583
Do it again

2
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,208
Do it again.

3
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:34,708
Do it again.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,833
Get up and dance again.

5
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,000
My legs are too weak, I can't get up.

6
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,375
Get up again.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,250
I can't do it anymore.

8
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,000
Kangmin!

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,291
You're not debuting?

10
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,833
The people you started with,

11
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:02,000
they're debuting and performing in broadcasts, overseas, and concerts

12
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,708
Aren't you jealous?

13
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,375
If you're going to practice like that, quit right now!

14
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:09,708
Huh?

15
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:11,625
Why?

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There are people practicing inside

17
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,333
Ah, sorry, but this is our time.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,083
What’s up with that? They didn’t even apologize, just left.

19
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,500
Isn’t that him?

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,375
Kangmin?

21
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:37,458
Kangmin?

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,625
Ah, the kid who almost debuted last year but didn’t?

23
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,583
He’s been a trainee for a really long time, I heard?

24
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,791
Hey, Suho. Don’t you know him?

25
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,375
Hey, guys, wait a second.

26
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,625
I’ll be right back

27
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,083
You guys adjust the intro part first

28
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:52,708
Let's go

29
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,166
Long time no see, Min

30
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,541
Get lost

31
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,416
It’s been a while, but isn’t this too much?

32
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,250
What did the delicious fish-shaped bun ver do wrong?

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,416
How have you been?

34
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,791
I’ve missed you a lot, Min

35
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,875
Don’t ever call my name with that mouth.

36
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,208
It disgusts me

37
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,666
Are you still not over it?

38
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,416
Who can forget being betrayed by the person they trusted the most?

39
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:40,833
How could that memory go away?

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,500
How could that memory go away?

41
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,291
Don’t show up in front of me again

42
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,333
This is from that fish-shaped bread shop you liked.

43
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,916
This is from that fish-shaped bread shop you liked.

44
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,000
I ran so fast to keep it warm.

45
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,583
Eat it before it gets cold

46
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,291
Ta-da!

47
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,208
What if the boss catches you?

48
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,750
We’ll be in trouble if we don’t make it for the diet by this week.

49
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,458
I got this from that place you said you wanted last time.

50
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,666
Eat it quickly.

51
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,375
Isn’t that place really far?

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,041
Did you walk there?

53
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,958
I ran so it wouldn’t get cold. It took about 30 minutes?

54
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,458
I did well, right?

55
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,458
Why go that far?

56
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,250
Sorry, we’ve been struggling with diets recently.

57
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,458
You’ve been really sensitive too.

58
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,208
But after eating this

59
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,375
you’ll be able to fight harder starting tomorrow!

60
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,916
you’ll be able to fight harder starting tomorrow!

61
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,208
Thank you.

62
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,583
Huh? But is this all red bean paste?

63
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,458
I like cream puffs.

64
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,291
Oh really?

65
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,750
I ate the last cream puff.

66
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:14,958
I’ll buy it again.

67
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:15,625
It’s okay.

68
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,750
I’ll just eat another cream puff!

69
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,041
What’s this?

70
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,708
This cream puff is sweet too!

71
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,041
Then I’ll eat it too

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,291
You crazy bastard.

73
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:23,958
Thank you, please like and subscribe!
