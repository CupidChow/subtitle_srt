1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,460
are you okay?

2
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,960
Huh? You're already leaving? Mina,

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,080
go eat breakfast

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,460
I cooked something delicious for you

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,460
it's okay

6
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,540
Oh, and

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,460
Just being face to face with you in this house is hard work for me

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,460
I don't want to be with you even for a moment

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,460
I have no intention of debuting with you

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,630
therefore

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,460
I wish you would leave this house today

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,960
please

13
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,460
Min, what's going on at this hour?

14
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,250
It's still a long way to go until practice time

15
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,460
Representative

16
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,290
I can't understand what you said yesterday

17
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,250
I can't do it

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,880
Can't you do it?

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,460
Why can't you do it?

20
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,000
Are you going to throw away such a great opportunity?

21
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,460
You know what he did to

22
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,460
us, sir

23
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,880
That's all in the past

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,250
Don't dwell on the past, just look to the future

25
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,290
Let's postpone today's practice until next time

26
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,460
I'll quit

27
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,750
what?

28
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,880
I'd rather give up everything

29
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,710
and go out than debut with that kid

30
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,960
Do you know what choice Suho made for you?

31
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,460
Suho told me not to tell anyone

32
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,250
I have to say

33
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,790
Between you and Suho, Jeong Daepyo threatened me on his own

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,380
I'm going to spread it to the broadcasting station

35
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,380
Suho said that he debuted at the agency that Jeong Daepyo was in

36
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,630
to stop that and worked without pay

37
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,670
and without a deposit, so he did it for you

38
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,080
I'm sorry, Suho

39
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,330
Why is this happening?

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,920
What bad happened?

41
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,420
I didn't even know that

42
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,290
no way

43
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,000
Did you hear from the representative?

44
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,380
I told you so strongly not to tell anyone

45
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,210
I'm sorry, Suho

46
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,210
Stop crying

47
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,750
Let's eat!

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,500
I'm delicious for you

49
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:54,880
omg

50
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,750
It's all blown up

51
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,170
This is a dish I made with all my heart...

52
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,750
Could it be that the food you made in the morning

53
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,960
Was it ramen?

54
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,880
Yeah.. sorry

55
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,540
Actually, I can only boil ramen

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,080
It's okay, I like spicy ramen

57
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,330
It looks delicious, right?

58
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,630
It must be delicious?!

59
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,000
Was it very difficult?

60
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,000
Just something... a little?

61
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,500
I'm sorry because of me

62
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,130
Stop saying sorry!

63
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,920
I'm really sorry

64
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,170
This is a penalty for using a forbidden word

65
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,710
Oh, what is it~

66
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,460
But I met you again like this

67
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,170
I love it so much right now

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,460
In the past, I didn't have a place to stay,

69
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,460
so I could only see you during practice

70
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,460
Now every morning when I open my eyes,

71
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,460
you are next to me

72
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,460
Even when I close my eyes, you are by my side

73
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm so happy right now

74
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:34,710
Minah

75
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,460
Actually, I had

76
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,460
a dream today

77
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,080
Because of the nightmare

78
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,920
I feel like I'm going to die

79
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,460
I was scared

80
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,460
Suho, you appear

81
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,460
You saved me

82
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,460
But when I opened my eyes,

83
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,460
you were in front of me

84
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,460
So I don't know how stable

85
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,880
it is

86
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,170
Let's not break up anymore

87
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:03,830
