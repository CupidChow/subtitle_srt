1
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,720
Oh, you are out of steamed egg already?

2
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,100
I'm sorry. They are all gone.

3
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,190
I forgot to save one for you.

4
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,550
Then...

5
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,560
I will have Kai Pa Lo.

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,560
Kai Po Lo is a five spice stew with hard-boiled eggs and pork.

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,390
Sure.

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,040
Don't you get bored of eating steamed egg everyday?

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,390
I like it.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,390
I don't know what else to eat besides steamed egg.

11
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,230
Oho ~

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,230
You are cooking here.

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,880
You have improved.

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,880
Like leveling up.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,340
What's leveling up?

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,400
Leveling up is getting better at doing things.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,160
Let me help you with that.

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,820
Uh-uh.

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,890
No.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,380
Let me do it myself.

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,770
Sit and wait to taste it.

22
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,560
- Hey!
 - Wow!

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,800
That's steamed egg.

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,690
You can make my favorite dish now.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,610
You are becoming more and more human, you know.

26
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,720
I know that I am a spirit.

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,610
But it feels great...

28
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,200
being able to do something like this.

29
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,150
It is like I'm alive again.

30
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,310
If you must know,

31
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,490
before I died

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,920
I knew how to cook for myself.

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,650
But do you know?

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,980
That stove there...

35
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,740
I don't even know how to use it.

36
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,990
I have never done anything with it.

37
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,180
What a waste.

38
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,640
You are so smart, P'.

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,350
To be able to cook like this.

40
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,120


41
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,200
Alright, Yom.

42
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,000
Receive my blessing.

43
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,000
Age. Beauty. Peace. Health.

44
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,530
Back when my father was still alive...

45
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,110
we would come out to offer food
 to the monks for merts for my grandma.

46
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,390
But after my father died, I have never did again.

47
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,290
Hey?

48
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,810
How about this?

49
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,810
Let's have a competition.

50
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,680
Whoever gets to the room first is the winner.

51
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,680
And the loser has to hang the clothes out to dry.

52
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,280
Let's do it.

53
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,400
You are challenging a athlete like me?

54
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,200
One second.

55
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,730
Oh, P'Mes!

56
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,990
Hey, wait for me! Don't cheat!

57
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,410
You should know who you are playing with.

58
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,540
Didn't you know I am a tricky ghost?

59
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,200
You cheated me.

60
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,710
Who was cheating?

61
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,320
Thun is the one who told me that...

62
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,100
It doesn't matter ho you win, only that you win.

63
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,680
I was not like this in the past.

64
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,240
I'm not sure who I got this bad habit from.

65
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,240
Fine, you play me like this.

66
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,290
Watch out.

67
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,430
<i>Thun.</i>

68
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,150
Hmm?

69
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,340
It's almost your birthday.

70
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,130
How did you know that?

71
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,840
What do you want?

72
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,450
What do you want to give me?

73
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,840
What can a homeless spirit like
 me what could I give you?

74
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,660
Looks like you like it up here.

75
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,370
Whenever we come up here,

76
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,920
you always stand here and look at the view like this.

77
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,680
Thun, do you know when I was there,

78
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,200
I always looked up at the sky. To the point I could 
forecast which days would have good weather.

79
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,800
Like today, if the clouds are like this...

80
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,440
it will rain this evening.

81
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,440
How do you know?

82
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,100
I've been looking at the sky for over ten years.

83
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,480
Do you miss the graveyard. P'?

84
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,160
I do.

85
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,560
I don't know how P'Jeng 
and Angoon are doing?

86
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,900
P'Jeng? Angoon?

87
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,470
Who are they, P'?

88
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,470
Spirits at the graveyard.

89
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,680
They might have reincarnated already.

90
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,440
Don't worry, P'.

91
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,260
No matter what, I will find a way to help you.

92
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,140
Here.

93
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,300
I saw you are aiming for some shoes.

94
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,400
Hey...

95
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,510
A 1500 baht discount?

96
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,990
There, like I thought.

97
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,380
A person like you would give me anything for free.

98
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,140
There is no way.

99
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,400
It's good that you know.

100
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,980
Then what do you want me to tell the coach?

101
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,220
Where are you going?

102
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,220
It's not that.

103
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,590
I need your help.

104
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,480
I need a list of patients who received treatment for heart disease 
during 1997 at the hospital were your sister works.

105
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,310
Hey?

106
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,310
What do you want them for?

107
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,110
Someone asked me to help them out with this.

108
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,730
Who?

109
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,210
Can you not ask me that now?

110
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,440
Help me first.

111
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,360
Please?

112
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,000
No.

113
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,430
You have to tell me first what you will use this for.

114
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,880
After you get them for me I will tell you.

115
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,260
Please, friend.

116
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,720
But I am not sure...

117
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,320
if my sister would help me with this.

118
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,320
I know.

119
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,730
But...

120
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,350
it is not too much for you, friend.

121
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,730
Please, dude?

122
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,170
Do you really believe...

123
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,640
that a 1500 baht discount could buy me?

124
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,600
But...

125
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,010
if it is 2000,

126
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,780
I will think about it again.

127
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,760
Where is Ai'Prince?

128
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,200
Prince.

129
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,680
I've been looking for someone who's 
wearing a university uniform for a while.

130
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,780
What are you wearing?

131
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,080
Well...

132
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,650
I ran out of uniforms.

133
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,330
And the others weren't ironed yet.

134
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,330
You look good in this outfit, too.

135
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,190
The other two didn't ask you anything
 about where you were going?

136
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,920
Well, no.

137
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,860
Why did you ask me to come here?

138
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,520
Why didn't you want me to tell them?

139
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,520
Well...

140
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,520
It's almost Thun's birthday.

141
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,500
I still haven't found a birthday present for Thun.

142
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,620
<i>And I thought that...</i>

143
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,270
<i>you could help me.</i>

144
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,160
Your taste is better than Ai'KhiaoKhiem.

145
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,160
So help me out?

146
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,160
<i>Don't you think...</i>

147
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,330
for someone like Ai'Thun...

148
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,840
I have no idea what he is thinking or what he likes.

149
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,720
I think...

150
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,800
you are pretty good at guessing people want.

151
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,340
He will surely like whatever you buy for him.

152
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,960
Me?

153
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,960
So...

154
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,480
the hat I gave you for your birthday, do you like it?

155
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,260
I like it.

156
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,520
 You say you like it but I never see you wear it.

157
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,180
I have worn it. You just didn't notice it.

158
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,240
How about this?

159
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,740
Huh?

160
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,740
If you can't think of anything...

161
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,740
just make his gift yourself.

162
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,320
Me?

163
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't know how to do anything?

164
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,600
Oh, practice then.

165
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,430
Let it seem like...

166
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,430
"I did this for you." Or something like that.

167
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,430
What should I make?

168
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,360
How about a chocolate cake?

169
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,630
Lately, Ai'Thun likes to eat chocolate.

170
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,280
Try making him a cake.

171
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,670
Yeah.

172
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,670
That's a good idea.

173
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,880
Then let's go buy the ingredients. Shall we?

174
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,510
Prince.

175
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,670
Will you help me make it?

176
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,250
<i>Can you?</i>

177
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,250
Please?

178
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,790
Yes.

179
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,130
Let's go.

180
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,730
Hurry up. Let's go already.

181
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,730
Hurry.

182
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,740
~ Can I love you? ~

183
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,200
~ Can I tell you that I love you? ~

184
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,190
~ I want to have beautiful days like this forever. ~

185
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,460
~ To have someone so kind like you with me. ~

186
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,780
It's almost your birthday.

187
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,540
How did you know that?

188
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,260
~ Can I love you? ~

189
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,240
What do you want?

190
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,280
~ Will I be able to love you? ~

191
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,960
What do you want to give me?

192
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,430
What can a homeless spirit like
 me what could I give you?

193
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,150
~ Can you not blame me? ~

194
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,200
~ If I want to ask you something like this. ~

195
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,970
~ Like that day you cared for me ~

196
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:02,410
~ My life is more beautiful than ever. ~

197
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:11,630
~ When I have the good stories of you in my heart. ~

198
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:26,680
~ When I have the good stories of you in my heart. ~

199
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,260
Behaviors of a cannabis addict.

200
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,750
I am sure of it.

201
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,740
His behavior matches all of the symptoms.

202
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,740
Inexplainable good mood. Talking to himself.

203
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,920
Like chocolate.

204
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,690
Right!

205
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,020
<i>One day, Ai'KhiaoKhiem invited...</i>

206
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,570
<i>Ai'Prince go mountain climbing.</i>

207
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,920
Even though he knew that Prince had asthma.

208
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,040
But Prince agreed to go with him.

209
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,430
And on the way up the mountain...

210
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,800
Ai'Prince had an asthma attack and died.

211
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,250
Hey... can I not die?

212
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,860
<i>When you come back home,</i>

213
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,040
<i>Prince's family wants to sue you.</i>

214
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,520
Are you able to be found guilty?

215
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,500
I can't.

216
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,720
Because I didn't intend for it to happen.

217
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,200
I'm free of guilt.

218
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,200
I am not involved in any of this.

219
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,600
So...

220
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,310
it could be said that

221
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,310
because you asked me to go with you.

222
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,620
Since you invited me,

223
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,620
you take on the responsibility
 to take care of each other.

224
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,140
You had a responsibility,

225
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,520
but you didn't take care of me.

226
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,820
That means you intended on killing me.

227
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,820
<i>But he...</i>

228
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,970
doesn't have any knowledge on how to help you.

229
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:49,800
<i>Yeah</i>

230
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,800
But...

231
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,320
if he deliberately asked me to go mountain climbing...

232
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,960
knowing that...

233
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,370
I had asthma.

234
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,940
I'm not that bad, am I?

235
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,200
Here.

236
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,800
Just kidding.

237
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,310
I bought these to share with you guys.

238
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,310
So what do you think?

239
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,460
Whose fault is it?

240
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,880
Who's fault?

241
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,460
You mean that death in the forest case?

242
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,160
Yes.

243
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,680
I think...

244
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,490
the person who invited him is not at fault.

245
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,910
Who could know that an accident would happen?

246
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,950
And one more thing,

247
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,550
that guy didn't even take care of himself.

248
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,310
But I think he is guilty.

249
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,160
I will tell my family to sue you.

250
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,510
If that doesn't work...

251
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,030
I will become a ghost and haunt you.

252
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,420
<i>Is that supposed to be scary?</i>

253
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,420
Yes, Grandpa?

254
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,420
In front of the buuilding?

255
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,590
Okay. See you.

256
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,590
I'm leaving. Bye, see you.

257
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,790
- Yeah
 - Thank you.

258
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,540
OK.

259
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,820
She is walking in the sun, too.

260
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,320
Oh, I will take this handout to her. She forgot it.

261
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,850
OK.

262
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,200
Plai.

263
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,430
Huh?

264
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,800
Grandpa, sawasdee khrap.

265
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,030
You forgot your handouts.

266
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,960
Oi ~

267
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,670
Thank you so much.

268
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,140
I'm leaving now.

269
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,880
See you.

270
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,280
Bye-bye

271
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,060
<i>Be sure to study.</i>

272
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,640
Hey...

273
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,500
Huh?

274
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,810
That is person is Thun, right?

275
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,700
With his handsome looks 
he must attract a lot of attention.

276
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,130
The girls always flirt with him, Grandpa.

277
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,130
Does that include you?

278
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,090
Oi!

279
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,800
If I wanted to be his girlfriend,

280
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,890
I would've done that a long time ago.

281
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,840
No way.

282
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,290
Be careful.

283
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,530
There is an old saying...

284
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,350
Refuse one with one fault, and take another with one two.

285
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,910
What does that mean?

286
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,240
Don't hesitate to choose who you want.

287
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,370
If you don't you will have no choice
but to choose one you don't want.

288
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,350
Oi!

289
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,540
If I can't get the good one, then I won't take any.

290
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,680
<i>Whoever you like or love, please choose wisely.</i>

291
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,340
I won't stop you.

292
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,750
I will let you choose for yourself.

293
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,790
Sure.

294
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,790
If and when I do really get a boyfriend,

295
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,400
don't complain to me later.

296
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,030
Looks like you really want to have a boyfriend.

297
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,160
I'm probably afraid that no one will choose you.

298
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,830
Grandpa!

299
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,710
[Go home safely. Be sure to study hard.]

300
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,200
- Grandpa
 - See!

301
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,760
I knew it.

302
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,130
Grandpa, don't look at me like that.

303
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,170
So stubborn.

304
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,250
Grandpa!

305
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,400
I'll hit you.

306
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,790
Shit!

307
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,280
You scared me, P'!

308
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,280
Ghost haunting!

309
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,160
Don't play like this again.

310
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,780
Sorry.

311
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,520
Hey...

312
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,630
A moment ago I felt...

313
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,920
Let me try again.

314
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,310
Maybe I imagined it.

315
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,050
But I really felt it too.

316
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,930
A real ghost trick, P'.

317
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,540
Like this?

318
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,740
Like that?

319
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,400
Who would be scared?

320
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,120
Why not?

321
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,120
A ghost as cute and handsome as you...

322
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,200
who would be scared?

323
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,810
Why were you trying to sneak into the room just now?

324
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,170
I just wanted to know what you
 do when I am not home.

325
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,630
So I was peeking.

326
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,730
I just everything a normal person would do.

327
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,350
Really?

328
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,140
Everything like a normal person?

329
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,550
What is it?

330
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,360
Giant kid, are you being cheeking here?

331
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,600
Here.

332
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,720
When you get sick of chocolate, let me know.

333
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,330
Thank you.

334
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,810
Eat a lot and gain more weight.

335
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,910
So you will be a chubby ghost.

336
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,820
Just joking.

337
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,930
Aren't you supposed to have practice this afternoon?

338
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,270
Is Thun skipping practice again?

339
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,380
Behaviors of a cannabis addict.

340
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,800
I am sure of it.

341
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,840
His behavior matches all of the symptoms.

342
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,020
Inexplainable good mood. Talking to himself.

343
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,010
Like eating chocolate?

344
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:38,700
Exactly.

345
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,460
But...

346
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,030
I don't think that's how he is.

347
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,560
Didn't you notice that he's been acting weird recently?

348
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,000
Talking nonsense.

349
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,330
He always wants to seperate from us and go somewhere.

350
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,240
My neighbor also behaved like this.

351
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,730
If the coach finds out about this, it would be bad.

352
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,710
So this is our mission, friend.

353
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,120
We will get him.

354
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,560
We should prove it first.

355
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,020
We don't know if it is true or not.

356
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,620
Hey, trust me on this.

357
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,210
Believe what?

358
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,120
My neighbor behaves...

359
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,590
Hey!

360
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,120
How long are you going to keep chatting?

361
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,280
Do you want to join us?

362
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,240
Am I your friend?

363
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,800
- I'm off now.
 - I'm off, too.

364
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,310
Oh, I'm so ready to excercise.

365
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,310
Can you take care of my basketball
 so I can play on my phone?

366
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,310
Thun.

367
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,310
There are a lot of misspellings.

368
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,200
Eight misspelled words.

369
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,760
You lose eight points.

370
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,890
And you finished five minutes late.

371
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,840
Here. Do it again.

372
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,850
Are you still curious about touching me?

373
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,900
I am I able to touch someone...

374
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,170
it would feel like...

375
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,710
that I'm alive again.

376
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,190
But I might be expecting too much.

377
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,800
<i>P'Mes?</i>

378
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,380
For me only be able to see you and talk to you...

379
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,900
That already makes me feel like
 we are living in the same world.

380
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,550
Right.

381
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,550
That's good enough.

382
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,280
Again?

383
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,890
Regulars here.

384
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,130
Knock on the door next time.

385
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,170
It's been many times.

386
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,520
Should I take back my keys?

387
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,350
What are you doing?

388
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,010
Practicing answering test questions.

389
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,010
Then why didn't you skip practice?

390
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,230
My stomach hurt.

391
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,650
You're lying.

392
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,360
Because when you answered,
 you lowered your eyes a bit.

393
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,950
<i>That is the behavior...</i>

394
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,930
of someone trying to hide something.

395
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,120
I'm studying.

396
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,440
What subject?

397
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,270
Criminal Code 3.

398
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,480
Then...

399
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,840
who were you talking to?

400
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,840
I'm not talking to anyone.

401
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,880
Liar.

402
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,350
Your voice could be heard outside the door.

403
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,780
That means you were talking to someone.

404
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,970
<i>Just because you heard me...</i>

405
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,360
doesn't mean I was talking with someone.

406
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,890
I'm just reading...

407
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,890
the Criminal Code 3 out loud.

408
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,980
So it made you think I was talking to someone.

409
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,700
So this...

410
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,840
this case is closed.

411
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,090
<i>Ai'Prince.</i>

412
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:28,860
<i>Ai'Khiao.</i>

413
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,240
And the fact that you came in and disturbed my studying...

414
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,900
means you are guilty of trespassing.

415
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,760
No,

416
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,440
Because we didn't have any special intention.

417
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,960
That's good, friend.

418
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,360
Plus, you gave us...

419
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,960
the keys to your room.

420
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,090
So that means,

421
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,090
you already gave me permission to use it.

422
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,260
Court listened.

423
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,670
Correct. Let's move onto the next question.

424
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,700
That's enough, bastards.

425
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,550
Do you guys have too much free time?

426
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,550
That is why you can come see me like this.

427
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,000
Instead of using your time to come and see me...

428
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,080
you should use that time to study the law code.

429
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,050
Wouldn't that be better?

430
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,620
Right? Dumbass!

431
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,850
He's scolding you.

432
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,640
<i>I'm scolding both of you.</i>

433
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,150
Wait!

434
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,720
Where are you going?

435
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,120
The court doesn't allow you to go.

436
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,670
Regards to the court,

437
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,770
I need to pee.

438
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,890
Oho ~

439
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,240
This is obvious.

440
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,950
Very obvious.

441
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,890
Weed smokers love to stay in dark places...

442
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,890
and like eating a lot of chocolate.

443
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,890
Something sweet and a dark place.

444
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,360
This is so obvious.

445
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,560
How would you know?

446
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,770
My neighbor back home is also like this.

447
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,570
Ai'Prince.

448
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,630
I think...

449
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,630
we need to have a serious talk with him.

450
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,870
But the evidence is not strong enough.

451
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,280
If you went to court, you'd lose.

452
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,150
How can it not be strong enough?

453
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:21,900
Look at this.

454
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,470
Here. An electric jos stick.

455
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:28,030
What normal person would turn on an electric joss stick 
in his room? Look they are all around the room.

456
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,680
It is crazy!

457
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,100
It is probably nothing.

458
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
I think we should continue searching! Go!

459
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,660
It might...

460
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,880
be... be... be nothing.

461
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,720
That's all.

462
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,300
Come. Keep searching.

463
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,480
Oh, fuck!

464
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,730
Ai'Prince.

465
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,230
Yes?

466
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,440
Ai'Prince.

467
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,320
What?

468
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,480
You did turn it off, right?

469
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,030
Yes, I did.

470
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,030
I a-a-already turned it off.

471
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,600
I will leave it to you to look.

472
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,460
Where are you going?

473
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,320
My stomach hurts bad.

474
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,970
I need to poop.

475
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,980
Good luck.

476
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,650
Here's the key.

477
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,290
See you.

478
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,880
Hey, hey, hey! I have a stomachache, too.

479
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,330
Hey, Thun.

480
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:32,810
Hmm?

481
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,080
Your friends...

482
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,080
are they studying to be lawyers or detectives?

483
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,920
My friends are always like that, P'.

484
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,730
I can;t keep up with this.

485
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,310
It is starting to get blurry, P'.

486
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,390
Do you know,

487
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,210
Ever since I began studying...

488
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,420
I have never tried this hard before.

489
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,680
 If I get an F again...

490
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,350
my mom will scold me for sure.

491
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,880
And I would probably lose my athletic scholarship.

492
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,920
Thun.

493
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,520
Hmm?

494
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,730
Let me ask you for real.

495
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,790
Why did you want to study law?

496
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,600
Well...

497
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,080
being a lawyer is cool, P'.

498
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,340
And I won't be cheated by anyone.

499
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,000
Or use your knowledge to cheat people like you said?

500
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,260
Hey, I was joking about that.

501
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,520
But why did you ask me?

502
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,130
Because you don't look like a lawyer at all.

503
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,180
Then what do I look like?

504
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,110
A basketball player, maybe?

505
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,240
You like it, don't you?

506
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,410
I'm already am, aren't I?

507
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,620
We don't know that.

508
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,000
If you know, then let me know.

509
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,920
P'Mes, I'm going to bed now.

510
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,760
I can't keep up anymore.

511
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,120
Thun.

512
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,910
Good night.

513
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,440
P'Mes.

514
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,640
For me only be able to see you and talk to you...

515
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,480
That already makes me feel like
 we are living in the same world.

516
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,360
He only has naked pictures of guys.

517
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,790
Naked pictures of guys? Seriously?

518
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,650
Let me see.

519
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,600
Hey, don't.

520
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,440
- Hey, I just want to see for a bit.
 - Hey!

521
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,240
Just for a little bit.

522
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,830
No!

523
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,120
- If you like guys, just say it.
- Hey!

524
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,060
</i>Hey dude.<i>

525
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,880
</i>Defamation article 326, 330 and what else?</i>

526
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,320
<i>331, dude.</i>

527
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,530
Wait!

528
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,960
What about defamation?

529
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,150
It was in the scope of the exam that
 the professor gave us in the last class.

530
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:17,950
Didn't you get it?

531
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,230
Hey, let me see.

532
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,060
Shit! Ai'Khiem!

533
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,150
We're doomed!

534
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,330
Give me that.

535
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,630
 But, Ai'Kae told me that.

536
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,990
We're doomed.

537
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,030
<i>Alright everyone. You can come in for the test now.</i>

538
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,220
- Shit!
 -Shit!

539
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,100
What should we do?

540
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,310
What now? Study? Study now?

541
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,310
How could you keep up? Are you crazy?

542
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,480
Then what?

543
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,550
I don't know.

544
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,620
Should we cheat?

545
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,040
You guys go ahead. I'm going to the bathroom.

546
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,370
Hey, where are you going?

547
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,160
- Why would he go to the restroom now?
 - Let's go now.

548
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,380
P'Mes Mung Ming, what are you doing? Help me.

549
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,450
Listen carefully.

550
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,680
The questions we studied last night, they were all wrong, P'.

551
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,240
KhiaoKhiem had the wrong scope for the exam.

552
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,560
I am about to go in to take the exam.

553
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,490
You need to help me.

554
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,320
Alright, everyone.

555
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,680
You may start your exam.

556
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,740
Mr. Chubby, who is a politician,

557
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,960
is accused by Mr. Skinny for owning 
several watches obtained illegally.

558
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,200
Mr. Chubby was displeased so he reported it to the police.

559
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,140
In this case, can Mr. Skinny e found guilty of this offense?

560
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,520
Does he have grounds to appeal?

561
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,340
I'm screwed.

562
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,880
OK, I need to determine the related laws first.

563
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,380
326 and 3...

564
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,380
3 what again? There are two laws.

565
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,490
It's defamation for sure.

566
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,510
Can really prove it?

567
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,600
We can prove it.

568
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:23,900
How could we prove it?

569
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,630
How could we prove it?

570
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,960
I got it, Thun.

571
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,400
P'Mes.

572
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,280
It can be proved because it is not a personal matter.

573
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,360
And it benefits the citizens following section 330.

574
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,360
Thank you.

575
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,290
No problem.

576
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,610
Are you aiming to score full marks?

577
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,380
I didn't write everything on there
 and crossed out some parts, too.

578
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,150
Isn't that smart?

579
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,570
I might not be that smart,
 but I am not that stupid either.

580
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,760
Now you are just acting clever.

581
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,760
Regardless, thank you, P'.

582
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,200
Oh, so stressful.

583
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,200
I'm dead. I'm dead.

584
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,900
Why is that? Couldn't you do any of it?

585
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,260
Yes, I studied all night long.

586
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,350
And look at this.

587
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,980
Nothing I studied was on the exam.

588
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,980
It's all KhiaoKhiem's fault.

589
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,050
Oh, what time did you go to sleep last night?

590
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,170
Well...

591
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,740
You said you would call me back.

592
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,740
But you didn't call me.

593
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,520
So I fell asleep.

594
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,460
Oh, right.

595
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,640
I talked with P'Chin last night.

596
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,280
I broke up with him...

597
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,720
Like you told me to.

598
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,450
Hey,

599
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,620
I just gave you advice.

600
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,620
And what did you tell P'Chin?

601
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,620
Well...

602
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,620
I told him that...

603
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,760
I'm dating you.

604
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,320
<i>Oh?</i>

605
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,320
<i>He might hate me because of this.</i>

606
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,060
<i>He won't.</i>

607
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,280
He has lots of girls so...

608
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,070
he won't care about me.

609
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,560
I hope that's the case.

610
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,800
<i>Oi!</i>

611
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,990
Shit, Ai'Khiem! It's all because of you.

612
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,990
I'm sorry.

613
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,730
It's all because of Ai'Kae.

614
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,200
Damn him!

615
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,920
I have to go make some more oaths.

616
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,360
Hope Luang Pu helps me again, please.

617
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,360
Luang Pu is a Monk statue.

618
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,860
- Please.
 - Luang can't help you now.

619
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,920
That's enough.

620
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,980
Stop complaining and scolding each other.

621
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,480
I couldn't even do the test.

622
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,480
I give up everything.

623
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,260
I will even give up guys.

624
00:36:58,910 --> 00:36:59,480
Boyfriend.

625
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,180
Hey, hold on.

626
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,570
Did you break up with P'Chin?

627
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,570
And she told him that she is dating me.

628
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,570
Now we will all get the damn?

629
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:07,980
<i>Why?</i>

630
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,630
What do you mean get the damn?

631
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,630
Don't make a big deal of it.

632
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,490
Come on. I'm hungry.

633
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,600
<i>Let's get something to eat.</i>

634
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,260
<i>What can we eat?</i>

635
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,550
The coach called for us to go in earlier.

636
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,490
Let's go to practice.

637
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,640
<i>Yes, let's go.</i>

638
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,810
If we are late we might get punished again.

639
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,030
What the heck?

640
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,870
You guys are so...

641
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,870
Fine, I'll go home.

642
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,190
Is that so?

643
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,760
<i>Yeah, I's depressed.</i>

644
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,530
<i>I couldn't even do the test.</i>

645
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,790
<i>Hey, Thun!</i>

646
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,600
<i>Hey, Thun!</i>

647
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,890
<i>Thun! Thun! Hey, Thun! Pass it to me!</i>

648
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,200
<i>Pass it!Thun! Thun! Pass it! Ai'Thun, pass it!</i>

649
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,410
<i>Oi, Ai'Thun!</i>

650
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,700
Hey why didn't you pass it to me? I was open.

651
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,000
Hey, what are you playing at?

652
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
If you don't want to play, 
go be a substitute over there.

653
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,450
Hey, calm down.

654
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,840
Again, again, again.

655
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:05,470
<i>Ai'Prince.</i>

656
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,770
<i>Ai'Thun!</i>

657
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,320
<i>Thun!</i>

658
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,870
Hey, you guys! That's enough!

659
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,940
Hey, what kind of game are you playing?

660
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:24,940
Earlier...

661
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,610
you had no focus at all.

662
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,610
On the basketball court,

663
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,360
you need to concentrate on basketball.

664
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,320
You have to be more focused than this!

665
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,720
Let's go practice some concentration.

666
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,490
Run and touch the edge of the court 100 times.

667
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,550
Go!

668
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,660
100 times, coach?

669
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,720
<i>Yes, go! Hurry!</i>

670
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,760
<i>Ai'Prince, stand up.</i>

671
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,130
<i>You get up first.</i>

672
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,440
<i>I can't get up.</i>

673
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,190
<i>Help me.</i>

674
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,300
<i>Faster, faster, faster!</i>

675
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,040
Touch the edge of the court and run!

676
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,460
No walking!

677
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,560
<i>Run faster!</i>

678
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
<i>Touch the edge of the court.</i>

679
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,640
Touch the edge of the court. Don't cheat!

680
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,670
Faster!

681
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,670
Ai'Prince, walk properly.

682
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,980
I  know it is really sticky around your balls.

683
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,280
Let's go take a shower, hurry up.

684
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,280
Damn it!

685
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,710
So tired.

686
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,860
Damn, it's all Thun's fault.

687
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
He's such a fucking show off but nothing to show.

688
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,630
Yeah, forget about him.

689
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,630
Hey, come and look at this.

690
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,170
I have a lot of naked pictures here.

691
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:48,960
What is it?

692
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,010
This is good.

693
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,020
<i>Look at the boobs.</i>

694
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,190
<i>Send them in the group chat.</i>

695
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:53,870
<i>Send them to the group?</i>

696
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,320
Yes.

697
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,630
Then I would get scolded by Coach Peter.

698
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,490
Are you crazy?

699
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,370
Oh, right.

700
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:57,950
Look.

701
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,560
It's alright, how about this?

702
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,520
I will create a group chat

703
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,070
and invite everyone.

704
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,220
Everything you have, send them all to the group.

705
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,130
Alright.

706
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,940
Don't let me find out you kept some to watch alone.

707
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,940
I will send everything, don't worry.

708
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,000
Send this one, too.

709
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,500
OK.

710
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,010
This one.

711
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:14,890
Create the group, dude.

712
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,250
I've created the group.

713
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,440
I've invited you all.

714
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,590
Damn it, Thun.

715
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,590
You're the only one that didn't accept the group invite.

716
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,310
<i>Are you keeping naked pictures to watch alone?</i>

717
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,680
<i>Let me check your phone.</i>

718
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,360
<i>Hey, it's not that.</i>

719
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,980
Maybe he only has naked pictures of guys.

720
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,430
Naked pictures of guys? Seriously?

721
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,390
Let me see.

722
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,270
Hey, don't.

723
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,080
- Hey, I just want to see for a bit.
 - Hey!

724
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,910
Just for a little bit.

725
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:37,480
No!

726
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,480
- If you like guys, just say it.
- Hey!

727
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,210
Damn it.

728
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:56,490
It's all because of you.

729
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,350
No, it's because of you. You dropped it.

730
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,110
I didn't mean to.

731
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,300
And that asshole, Ai'Eak...

732
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,580
He likes to say...

733
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,330
"Ai'Thun, you're gay. You're gay."

734
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,690
Gay, your ass.

735
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,310
I am so angry, P'.

736
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,690
Angry that I can't do anything about this.

737
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,580
Thun.

738
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,580
Oh, P'Mes.

739
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,580
Where have you been?

740
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,230
I was just walked around here.

741
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,720
Maybe I could remember something.

742
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,140
Sorry I didn't tell you first. I saw you with your friends.

743
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,320
Why are you sitting here alone?

744
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:09,930
It's nothing, P'.

745
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,490
But I saw it.

746
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,700
Friends always make fun like that.

747
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,620
Don't be mad at them.

748
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,920
Your right they always play like this, P'.

749
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,880
But I feel strange.

750
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,260
What do you mean?

751
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,880
Well...

752
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,880
I don't like this kind of situation.

753
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,850
I really don't know how to react to this.

754
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,210
I don't know if I should step in to play with them...

755
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,210
or just walk away.

756
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,640
It's like being persecuted all the time.

757
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,520
Why do you feel that way?

758
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,120
I don't know either, P'.

759
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,280
That's just the way I am.

760
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,320
It's freaking uncomfortable.

761
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,800
Thun, you can talk to me, alright?

762
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,910
I feel uncomfortable, P'.

763
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:20,680
Very uncomfortable.

764
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,520
Everytime they are talking about girls,

765
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,010
or about girlfriends.

766
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,480
I would always get asked...

767
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,120
like "When will I have you have a girlfriend?"

768
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,570
And when they talk about naked pictures...

769
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,570
and I don't participate with them.

770
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,970
I become joke material for them, P'.

771
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,430
And that asshole, Ai'Eak...

772
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:43,790
He likes to say...

773
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,540
"Ai'Thun, you're gay. You're gay."

774
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,850
Gay, your ass.

775
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,550
I am so angry, P'.

776
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,690
Angry that I can't do anything about this.

777
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,950
I'm so embarrassed, P'.

778
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,460
Embarrassed because I don't fight back with him.

779
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,540
I think I understand you, Thun.

780
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:18,910
 I'm sorry, P'.

781
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:23,580
It's alright.

782
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,580
It's good.

783
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,160
That you let it out like this.

784
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,840
~ Everything keeps changing ~

785
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,880
~ No matter where you live ~

786
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,660
~ I just want to tell you ~

787
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,320
~ No matter how long it is~

788
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,530
~ I'll be beside you ~

789
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,510
~ As time goes by ~

790
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:25,690
~ You might face good or bad ~

791
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:30,110
~ It might cause you to feel sad or down ~

792
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,490
~ Someone who you meet along your way ~

793
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:37,130
~ Can either be good or bad ~

794
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:41,690
~ It might make you want to start all over again ~

795
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:46,570
~ I will always be with you ~

796
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:53,370
How are you?

797
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:55,370
Are you okay now?

798
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,250
I'm fine, P'.

799
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,810
I'm going to head to class now.

800
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:07,870
<i>Oh, P'.</i>

801
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,150
The song last night was beautiful.

802
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,540
~ I'm still here ~

803
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,200
How is your work going?

804
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,120
Oi ~

805
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,120
We have to practice basketball.

806
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,910
We also have to help him with the Student Council's work.

807
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,520
Ai'Prince is going to become cool.

808
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:43,480
Do you think I wanted to take this position?

809
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,850
But when I apply for a job, I can
 put this as work experience.

810
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,390
<i>Damn!</i>

811
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,470
You make me look stupid.

812
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,010
Hey...

813
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,690
So where is Plaifah?

814
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,690
I haven't seen her lately.

815
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,080
Did she get back with P'Chin?

816
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,080
Are you jealous?

817
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,080
No.

818
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,880
Are you really thinking that, Ai'Thun?

819
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,880
Or is just your mouth that said no?

820
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,170
Let me ask you for real.

821
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:16,670
Do you have feelings for Plaifah?

822
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,390
I...

823
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:22,760
<i>Damn!</i>

824
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:25,820
Oho~

825
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,220
This clearly emphasizes my stupidness.

826
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,410
The scores for Criminal Code 3 have already come out.

827
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,840
The professor posted it on Facebook.

828
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,250
And tagged us, too.

829
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:35,680
Me...

830
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,250
you and Plai...

831
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,590
D-Dog took and chewed it!

832
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:43,500
Damn!

833
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,880
- My transcript!
 - What a shame!

834
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,350
Ai'Thun.

835
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,350
What is your score...

836
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,610
Hey!

837
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,400
78!

838
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:55,400
<i>How can that be?</i>

839
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,200
Hey, let me see that!

840
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:57,360
Hey?

841
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,950
Not just passed...

842
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,170
but the you got the highest score, too.

843
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,170
How could you do that?

844
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,460
You had the wrong exam scope we did, didn't you?

845
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,460
What cheat are you using?

846
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,350
You guys are still on that?

847
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:17,260
Haven't stopped yet?

848
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,330
I studied more than you guys and 
practiced more test questions than you guys.

849
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,330
I studied all of the Criminal Code 3.

850
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,800
You did?

851
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,800
Of course.

852
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,240
I am sure you used a cheat.

853
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,240
Are you raising the Kuman Thong right, Ai'Thun.

854
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,240
Kuman Thong is a household divinity of Thai folk religion. It is believed to bring luck and fortune to the owner if properly revered. Kuman, or Kumara means " Sanctified young boy"; thong means golden

855
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,010
Nonsense.

856
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:35,050
I know that are raising a Kuman Thong
 in your room. I saw the joss sticks.

857
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:37,050
What's your Kuman Thong's name? Say it now.

858
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:38,430
What is his name?

859
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:39,230
What name do you mean?

860
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:40,400
What's his name?

861
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,480
- Ai'Prince, take this.
 - What's your Kuman's name?

862
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:45,290
Bullshit, damn.

863
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:46,880
Keep working.

864
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,190
I'm not finished yet.

865
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,500
You've made me curious about this.

866
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,500
Hey, everyone, the scores came out,

867
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,920
Ai'Thun.

868
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,920
You cut this.

869
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,710
Your changing the topic.

870
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:58,430
Just keep working.

871
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,810
Ai'Khiem.

872
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:04,350
The list of patients tat I asked you to get. Did you get it?

873
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,840
I did.

874
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:15,840
Tell me first.

875
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,840
What are you doing with this?

876
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,080
I'm a private detective.

877
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,580
I've been working for years.

878
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,820
Right now, there is someone who wanted me
 to find personal information on someone.

879
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,820
But the reason I didn't tell you guys that...

880
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,820
If you knew, you would be in danger.

881
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:34,030
But I have to go now.

882
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,190
Don't tell anyone about this.

883
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:47,760
Is that so?

884
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,960
<i>How did Thun get this list of names?</i>

885
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:57,800
You don't have to know.

886
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,950
I have my ways.

887
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,100
Then how do you know which name is my name?

888
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,460
A patient with heart disease since birth...

889
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:08,760
and a young man.

890
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,920
Died around between years 39 and 40.

891
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,680
And often went to the hospital for treatment.

892
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:16,400
How many patients would match, P'?

893
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,860
<i>Wongsakorn</i>

894
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,680
Thanarungsiri

895
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,680
Can you remember now?

896
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,540
That it's your name?

897
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:36,540
P'Mes. P'Mes.

898
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,140
What does your name mean?

899
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:40,970
Wongsakorn means the root of the family.

900
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,570
Wongsakorn means the root of the family.

901
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,040
Yes.

902
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,040
My name is Wongsakorn.

903
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,100
Wongsakorn Thanarungsiri.

904
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,220
Finally.

905
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,770
We are getting close to the truth, P'.

906
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,280
We will be there soon, P'.

907
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,240
Aren't you happy?

908
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:43,120
P'Mes?

909
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,420
Are you ok?

910
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,010
P'!

911
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:19,800
This house...

912
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,980
was abandoned a long time ago.

913
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,130
So...

914
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:25,130
did you know the previous owner?

915
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,770
Both of them are already dead.

916
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:29,770
What was wrong with your body earlier?

917
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,680
It's like you were about to disappear.

918
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,140
It might be a sign...

919
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,410
that one day I will fade away.

920
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,310
I don't want you to disappear.

921
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:45,660
Happy Birthday to...

922
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,960
You're exaggerating.

923
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,960
Wish you happiness.

924
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,960
