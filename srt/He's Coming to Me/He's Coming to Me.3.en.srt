1
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,460
Come

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,140
Ai'Prince.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:12,600
Huh?

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,780
Did you check on the security guard?

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,300
Yeah.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,520
The keys?

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,160
Here.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,120
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,960
Hurry.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,480
Did you find anything, Ai'Khiem?

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,080
Fuck!

12
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,920
Hey! Who's there?!

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,320
Go hide! What are w waiting for?

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,400
Run!!

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,960
<i>Who's there?</i>

16
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,960
Ai'Khiem!

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,840
Wait for me!

18
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,500
Stop!

19
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,200
A Week Earlier

20
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,680
That should be enough.

21
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,680
28 out of 30.

22
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,680
You're quite good.

23
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,280
Uhh.. P',

24
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,440
when you were still alive,

25
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,760
did you play any sports?

26
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,760
If I had to guess...

27
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,540
probably not.

28
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,440
Right?

29
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,760
If you knew, then why did you ask?

30
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,860
If it was sports or physical education like this...

31
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,960
thats a bye from me.

32
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,520
But if it's academics or studying...

33
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,480
I'll fight for it.

34
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,120
Totally opposite of me.

35
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,920
I'm so lazy at studying.

36
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,080
I like to do sports more.

37
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,880
If you don't like to studying, why 
did you decide to study law?

38
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,060
It is quite difficult, didn't you know?

39
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,100
<i>Well, I never thought it would be this hard.</i>

40
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,040
Someone said that...

41
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,740
those who study law, are either smart or a cheater.

42
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,740
Because we are the one who know all the loopholes.

43
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,480
<i>Really?</i>

44
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,100
Then are you smart or a cheater?

45
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,340
I smart at cheating.

46
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,400
Well...

47
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,080
It is fun studying, P', but...

48
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,520
I also have basketball practice.

49
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,520
Between basketball practice and 
studying for exams the stress doubles.

50
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,980
I'm sorry. I won't ask you to skip practice next time.

51
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,980
Because of P',

52
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,480
I have come for punishment practice today.

53
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,660
It's all your fault.

54
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,780
If the Faculty of Law's basketball
 team loses this year,

55
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,760
it will be your fault.

56
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,300
Wait a sec.

57
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,380
Wait.

58
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,380
Aren't you suppose to say...

59
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,180
"It's alright, P'." or "I'm not angry at you, P'." 
 or something like that, right?

60
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,620
What's with this? Huh?

61
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,560
<i>It's just a match between faculties,
 does it need to be that serious?</i>

62
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,740
It does, P'.

63
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,060
Each year every faculty tries to win.

64
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,060
And next year, we will have internships,...

65
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,580
so we can't play anymore. That's 
why I want to end with a victory.

66
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,680
Let's exercise together, P'.

67
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,420
I forgot, sorry.

68
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,420
Do you want to play?

69
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:15,840
Hey.

70
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,200
Oho!

71
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
Come and get it from me! Come and get it from me.

72
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,280
<i>Oi... Didn't you tell me you have never played sports?</i>

73
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,280
There it is.

74
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,600
One more time, P'.

75
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,680
<i>Hey!</i>

76
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,000
I have finished the first part of our report.

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,100
What about you guys?

78
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,580
Almost finished.

79
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,580
Two lines already.

80
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,900
Two more lines left?

81
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,900
Just two lines finished.

82
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,260
Shit! Ai'Khiem!

83
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,680
Will you finish in time?

84
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,960
I will.

85
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,760
You should worry about Ai'Thun.

86
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,340
If we can't finish,

87
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,920
it will be because of his fourth part.

88
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,560
Connect to which Wifi?

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,660
Use this one.

90
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,760
What is the password?

91
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,400
I am so happy.

92
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,260
Hi, you guys.

93
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,440
Speak of the devil.

94
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,820
What work do I have to do?

95
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,100
How was it?

96
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,100
Was punishment practice fun?

97
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,040
It was fun...

98
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,500
Fun my ass!

99
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,900
That's your punishment!

100
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,900
Because you skipped practice with us.

101
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,040
Here.

102
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,920
The fourth part is yours to do.

103
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,920
This is a lot.

104
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,740
When is it due?

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,560
In three days.

106
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,560
Are you serious?

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,480
Shit! Will I be done in time?

108
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,900
<i>Don't make that stressed face.</i>

109
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,100
The reason we have to do all this work...

110
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,100
is totally because of you!

111
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,180
Yeah.

112
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,800
There was this person who persuaded us...

113
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,920
that from all the elective courses he
 could choose, he chose to take Chinese.

114
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,740
Is your father Bao Zheng, you idiot?

115
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,740
Bao Zheng or Justice Bao is famous Chinese TV series (1993)

116
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,420
My father's dead already, you bastard.

117
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,160
I'm sorry khrap.

118
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,900
I will tell my dad to haunt you for sure.

119
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,340
I had nothing to do with it, Dad.

120
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,720
But if...

121
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,880
you are still around, please help me not
 to get and F in my Chinese class.

122
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,880
He's still here. You will get it for sure.

123
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,100
He's here.

124
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,460
Is he really?

125
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,140
On the green umbrella?

126
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,260
Dad?

127
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,460
Dad?

128
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,820
Dad?

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,740
Hey, guys.

130
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,460
Help me find his dad.

131
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,900
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

132
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,340
We have a lot of work to do.

133
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,340
<i>Oho!</i>

134
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,160
How do I do this?

135
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,600
Are you sure you can do this, Thun?

136
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,260
<i>You have basketball practices, </i>

137
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,920
law class to study for,

138
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,560
and Chinese homework to finish.

139
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,180
Do you want me to help. I am finished.

140
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,280
It's alright.

141
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,620
<i>I don't want to bother you.</i>

142
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,480
Thank you ,though.

143
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,620
<i>But I don't mind bothering you.</i>

144
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,560
Please do it for me, Plai.

145
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,820
Please?

146
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,080
It's your own work. Do it yourself.

147
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,840
Ai'Thun had basketball practice, but
 you have nothing to do. So do it.

148
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,900
I will only do it for Thun.

149
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,240
Oho!

150
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,460
Khun Thun.

151
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,220
What do you think, Khun Prince?

152
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,000
It smells of love here.

153
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,160
Plai. what is your last name?

154
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,020
<i>I'm going to do the cover page first. 
I can't think of what to work on.</i>

155
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,020
Give it to me. Let m type it.

156
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,700
You take this instead.

157
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,800
You remember her name?

158
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,460
I do.

159
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,900
Do that. Do that.

160
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,640
Miss Plaifah Pongpornpittaya

161
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,000
<i>Can you do it?</i>

162
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,500
<i>I work on it at my dorm,</i>

163
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,140
<i>You guys, </i>

164
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,320
<i>I'm going back now.</i>

165
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,380
<i>See you.</i>

166
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,060
Bye-bye.

167
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,340
P'Mes.

168
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,480
P'Mes.

169
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,680
P'Mes!

170
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,040
What are you looking at?

171
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,380
Didn't you see what just happened?

172
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,380
<i>What was it?</i>

173
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,700
Who did he call?

174
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,860
P'Mes.

175
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,840
<i>P'Mes.</i>

176
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,440
Are you going to work? If not, I'll slap you.

177
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
- No, I just want to copy him.
 - Keep working. Hurry up.

178
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,940
Even though I can't remember much,

179
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,940
<i>but I am certain of one thing.</i>

180
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,460
I'm sure I have never done housework before.

181
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,520
Who normally cleans your room for you?

182
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,800
I don't do it, P'.

183
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,180
Usually my mom comes to do it for me.

184
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,800
She nags me a bit, then she will do it for me.

185
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,820
No doubt.

186
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,240
You don't even take a shower.

187
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,480
Ew ~

188
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,380
You haven't taken a shower for 20 years,
 but I never say anything to you.

189
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,340
Oh... I'm hungry.

190
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,960
此 生 能 与 你 在一起 真是 幸福

191
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,700
in this life being able to be with you is happiness

192
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,600
Yuck!

193
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,000
Who are you writing for?

194
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,180
 I'm not writing for anyone.

195
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,080
Our group has to do a report in Chinese
 about falling in love, greed, anger and lust.

196
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,260
I have to do the fourth part which is about love.

197
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,940
You can speak Chinese?

198
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,520
I have lived in a Chinese graveyard for twenty years,

199
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,520
wouldn't you think I can, Thun?

200
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,920
That is great!

201
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,560
My professor gives quizzes so often.

202
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,380
If P' taught me,

203
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,020
I would do fine.

204
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,100
Do you know, P', I spend so much time studying
 Chinese I almost forget that I am a law student.

205
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,240
好的! 好的!

206
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,240
"Hão de" means Alright!

207
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,680
You spoke Chinese again!

208
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,160
You should teach me.

209
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,140
How do I write this?

210
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,800
It is a lot, P'.

211
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,740
At first, I never thought I would understand Chinese.

212
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,340
But there were lots of Chinese people at the graveyard.

213
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,020
The grandpas and grandmas are Chinese.

214
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,360
P'Jeng is also Chinese.

215
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,260
He likes to scold people in Chinese.

216
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,500
I think that is why I know Chinese.

217
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,860
Or maybe I studied Chinese before.

218
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,940
<i>And now it is the time you have all been waiting for...</i>

219
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,940
The exam results.

220
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,000
<i>Come on.</i>

221
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Just accept the truth.

222
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,220
<i>Ai'Prince.</i>

223
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,940
You are overreacting.

224
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,120
Why are you so nervous?

225
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,120
Damn you, Ai'Khiem!

226
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,600
You are acting weird today.

227
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,020
<i>Usually for Professor Wichai's class...</i>

228
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,880
you never feel this confident.

229
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,120
This time...

230
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,220
I have something good.

231
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,220
<i>What is it?</i>

232
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,760
An amulet?

233
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,000
Buddha beads?

234
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,420
What do you have?

235
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,840
I took an oath...

236
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840
to offer a dog head, a cat head, and a buffalo head...

237
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,320
even red soda, ginger, and galanga tea.

238
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
I also offered to run around the stadium 100 times.

239
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,820
If this doesn't work...

240
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,800
 then I will take off my clothes and
 run naked around the university.

241
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,540
Please, don't.

242
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,000
Just thinking of it gives me nightmares.

243
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,800
Oho, you are insultinf me by saying that.

244
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,480
But if you get a good results will you
 be able to keep your oaths?

245
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,220
If I wasn't sure I could do it,

246
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,220
how could I look this confident?

247
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,780
Oh, if doing this can help you graduate
 there is no need to wai professor.

248
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,820
Just wai the Earth God instead.

249
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,560
Hey, hey, hey, hey ~

250
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,760
Even if you don't believe it,
 you still shouldn't mock it.

251
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,180
You should take it back. 
Don't say I didn't warn you.

252
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,180
It's not that I don't believe it.

253
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,820
I just have never seen than and I prefer not to see them.

254
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,840
<i>Even if you never seen one,</i>

255
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,840
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

256
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,840
Yeah.

257
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,540
Here.

258
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,680
Here is yours, Thunyakorn.

259
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,240
You did extremely well this time.

260
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,580
It wasn't him, Professor.

261
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,180
It's was me. I did it.

262
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,420
Hey, Thun...

263
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,980
How did you do it?

264
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,320
Hey ~

265
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,140
Hidden trick. Hidden trick.

266
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,940
You told us you couldn't do it.

267
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,260
Then how did you do it? Tell me.

268
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,860
<i>What did charm you use?</i>

269
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,220
You better tell us.

270
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,420
What did you use?

271
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,700
What charm? Here. It's me.
 Me! Me! Me! I'm the charm.

272
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,640
Why are you silent? Tell me.

273
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,800
I'm Google.

274
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,700
<i>I'm handsome.</i>

275
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,100
<i>I'm smart.</i>

276
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,100
But I'm not going to tell you guys.

277
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,340
Oh ~ Giant kid! You are so full of yourself!

278
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,180
Have you remembered something else, P'?

279
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,840
No.

280
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,960
I just drawing what remember.

281
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,960
Too bad.

282
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,060
If you can't remember your full name,

283
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,060
it will be hard to find out more.

284
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,140
It would be hard to ask the registration office.

285
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,760
You're right.

286
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,720
What kind of ghost am I?

287
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
No name or age.

288
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,520
Your drawings are nice, P'.

289
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,340
Maybe...

290
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,940
you studied at the Faculty of Fine Arts.

291
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,060
I don't know what I studied before I died.

292
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,660
but I am certain I liked drawing a lot.

293
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,780
Just holding a pencil puts me in an artistic mood.

294
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,600
Draw a picture for me.

295
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,700
I can't.

296
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,360
For something precious there
 must be something in return.

297
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,560
Spirit money is not that expensive, P'.

298
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,940
So this bracelet...

299
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,420
how is it related to the library?

300
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,160
Maybe we should find how they are connected.

301
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,100
In the library, I saw...

302
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,420
Saw what, P'?

303
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,780
Can you take me to the library again?

304
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,820
Thun...

305
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,320
I remember now.

306
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,340
<i>Now that I remembered I once studied here...</i>

307
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,220
everything looks familiar to me now.

308
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,400
What is, P'?

309
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,560
The university, of course.

310
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,720
That building wasn't that big before.

311
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,720
Over there.

312
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,040
That tree

313
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,560
wasn't that tall then.

314
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
How many years has it been?

315
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,240
Back then, I didn't go anywhere else.

316
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,400
I came to class at my faculty building...

317
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,180
and the library after class.

318
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,280
Nerd.

319
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,860
I'm not a nerd.

320
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,380
The library had air conditioner.

321
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,060
Ah ~ Rich kid?

322
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,060
Rich kid means cannot take hot weather.

323
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,700
Boyfriend?

324
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,520
Oh, Plai.

325
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,220
I was about to go find you at your dorm.

326
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,360
What for?

327
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,500
Why didn't you call first?

328
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,500
I did call, but you didn't answer.

329
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,860
I want to go somewhere quiet...

330
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,860
to wait for the faculty basketball game tonight.

331
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,860
Also...

332
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,720
to find a place to hid from P'Chin.

333
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,400
P'Chin asked me to watch a movie 
with him again, but I don't want to go.

334
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,760
I see.

335
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,560
Are you going back to your dorm now?

336
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,100
Can I go with you?

337
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,100
Ummm...

338
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,100
Sure.

339
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,100
But...

340
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,280
But what?

341
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,560
But...

342
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,480
I don't think you can escape from P'Chin

343
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,040
Huh?

344
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,200
Don't tell me...

345
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,100
<i>Plaifah...</i>

346
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,020
Oh, P'Chin. Sawsadee Kha.

347
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,020
Why didn't you answer my LINE message?

348
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,640
Oh, because...

349
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,640
my phone battery is dead.

350
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,220
Sawasdee Khrap.

351
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,260
You are...

352
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,820
Thun Khrap.

353
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,400
OH, N'Thun.

354
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,320
I'm P'Chin. I am...

355
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,000
Oh, P'Chin, shouldn't we get going?

356
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,740
Oh, right! I forgot.

357
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,480
<i>I have booked the tickets already.</i>

358
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,560
It's for...

359
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,460
the honeymoon seats.

360
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,440
How nice.

361
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,200
We'll sit together.

362
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,200
<i>No one will disturb us.</i>

363
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,260
Yes.

364
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,260
Shall we go?

365
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,920
Sure.

366
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,480
Let's go.

367
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,840
- See you later.
 - Okay.

368
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,580
See you.

369
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,700
<i>Bye ~</i>

370
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,440
<i>Let's go.</i>

371
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,260
Hey!

372
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,700
You didn't help her and you teased her like that.

373
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,360
Oh.

374
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,360
If Plaifah came along,

375
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,640
we'd have to go back to the dorm.

376
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,900
Does Plaifah go to your dorm often?

377
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,020
Umm...

378
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,340
Quite often.

379
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,340
She's even slept in my room.

380
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,220
She sleeps in your room?

381
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,760
The library.

382
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,580
If anyone saw me here, P;...

383
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,580
they wouldn't believe I would be in the library.

384
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,000
Thun.

385
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,360
Can you take me to the thesis section?

386
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,220
The thesis section?

387
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,320
If I really studied here,

388
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
I must have written a thesis.

389
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,480
This is it, P'.

390
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,840
Wait a second, P'.

391
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,280
<i>The probability assessment of breaking
 economic bubbles in economic growth.</i>

392
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,780
Can't you find and easier topic?

393
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,360
If I want to get a good score, I need to find a difficult topic.

394
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,040
Thun...

395
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,400
I remember now.

396
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,920
I wrote a thesis for this university.

397
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,860
The topic that I chose was...

398
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,800
The...

399
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
The probability assessment of...

400
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,500
The probability assessment of breaking
 economic bubbles in economic growth

401
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,500
Then, that means...

402
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,820
your thesis would be here.

403
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,500
And if we can find your thesis, we will know who you are.

404
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,660
We will know what your name is.

405
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,700
Let's go, P'.

406
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,460
There is no information in the system.

407
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,860
Is that even possible, P'?

408
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,300
Yes.

409
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,920
By the way, the thesis you're looking for, 
what year was it?

410
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,760
Umm... year?

411
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,600
Year 40.

412
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
Year 40.

413
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,780
If it's that old, there wouldn't be any
 information about it in the system.

414
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,080
It might still be in the archive room.

415
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,620
But some were damaged by the flood.

416
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,240
But there still might be a copy of it.

417
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,400
Then... can I go look there?

418
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,740
You can't.

419
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,820
To get in the archive, you
 need an letter of permission.

420
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,820
Because there is some
 confidential information there.

421
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,840
There are previous students' scores and old exam papers.

422
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,480
We can't allow anyone to see.

423
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,600
Understood.

424
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,720
It's really locked, P'.

425
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,060
Didn't she say we are not allowed to go in?

426
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,460
Even though I can't,

427
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,240
it doesn't mean you can't.

428
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,240
<i>Do you know? When I see you walk through walls, </i>

429
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,700
it feels like I am at Platform 9¾.

430
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,120
Platform what?

431
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,960
Harry Potter.

432
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,560
You don't know?

433
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,720
Nevermind. Let's try it.

434
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,220
Are you OK, P'?

435
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,480
I'm fine

436
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,920
But I can't get in.

437
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,480
What should we do next?

438
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,520
Hello.

439
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,660
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'll hurry there.

440
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,940
How about this, P'.

441
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,700
Let's think about this later.

442
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,700
I have to get ready for the basketball game.

443
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,160
Basketball Tournament

444
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,160
Patthananusartbandit University

445
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,160
Faculty of Law

446
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,160
Faculty of Communications Arts

447
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,400
Damn! When did Communications Arts become this good?

448
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,040
There are only five players.

449
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,660
If we lose, then we should stop playing.

450
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,660
Yeah, we can't lose.

451
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,340
If we lose, I don't know where to hide my face.

452
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,340
<i>Thun, go!</i>

453
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,980
Damn it, Thun!

454
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,400
What are you playing at?

455
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
When you had a 3-point chance,
 you didn't shoot anything.

456
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,900
Is that how a 3-point expert plays?

457
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,480
I would rather have AJ play as
 the shooting guard instead of you.

458
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,020
Hey!

459
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,000
Do you have the right to order
 the coach to switch position now?

460
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,500
Fuck!

461
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,460
 Hey! Sorry. Sorry. Sorry!

462
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,420
Stop!

463
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,580
It's my fault,

464
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,420
Whatever it is, we will win. Don't worry.

465
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,640
If we lose, I have Ai'Khiem's head as guarantee.

466
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,320
Fuck! Why involve me in this?

467
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,040
It's okay

468
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,860
The center is a strong player,

469
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,400
Ai'Khiem can't deal with him alone.

470
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,860
How about...

471
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,420
you pass me the ball so I can score?

472
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,600
You talk too much,

473
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,420
I'll make my own decision.

474
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,780
Let's go.

475
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,980
<i>How was that, Coach?</i>

476
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,440
<i>Without me, our team wouldn't shine like this.</i>

477
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,240
Sorry for interfering in the game.

478
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,560
Why are you apologizing?

479
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,200
Because you said it was a match of honor.

480
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,800
So it should have been won
 fair and square like a real man.

481
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,500
You watched too many cartoons, right?

482
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,420
The victory is more important than honor, P'.

483
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,240
Victory makes us much more handsome.

484
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,520
Oh?

485
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,620
Honestly, if you had helped from the
 beginning we would have won earlier.

486
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,120
Didn't you say this was a match of honor?

487
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,180
Give a minute, I will be right back.

488
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,380
<i>Look. Look at Thun. Who is he talking to?</i>

489
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,500
Sawasdee Kha, everyone. 
 We are doing a live right now.

490
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,600
Here's a water for you.

491
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,220
Thank you.

492
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,360
Yes, we are now with out 3-Point Hero.

493
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,720
<i>Did you see his shot?</i>

494
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,980
<i>It was so cool.</i>

495
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,480
<i>Come on, say hello to everyone.</i>

496
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,420
<i>Sawasdee Khrap.</i>

497
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,000
Say hello.

498
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,600
Bye-bye.

499
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,940
Here.

500
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,740
For you.

501
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,740
For me?

502
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,800
Last time you got upset because 
 I didn't have one for you.

503
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,500
Thank you.

504
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,200
<i>Cheers!</i>

505
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,440
Cheers!

506
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,380
Finally...

507
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,380
the Faculty of Law broke the curse...

508
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,700
for not having a win for 2 years in a row.

509
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,980
<i>Was you last shot...</i>

510
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,720
a coincidence or something?

511
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,460
If it wasn't...

512
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,880
you were too cool.

513
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,100
The hell with coincidence.

514
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,580
It was my skill.

515
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,680
You know who I am.

516
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,340
<i>Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.</i>

517
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,200
It was me, right.

518
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,940
This bastard is freaking sneaky.

519
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,580
First the exam score...

520
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,160
<i>and now the basketball game.</i>

521
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,400
Now tell me when...

522
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,020
you studied and practiced.

523
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,200
He didn't secretly study or practice...

524
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,980
I'm sure he has a charm.

525
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,300
Now tell me...

526
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,300
What is your charm?

527
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,180
<i>Tell us.</i>

528
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,820
Still on this?

529
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,120
- Tell me quickly.
  - Still?

530
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,180
Why are you still not telling me?

531
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,080
Will you stop that?!?

532
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,040
Fine!

533
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,320
I will tell you.

534
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,840
I do...

535
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,060
have a charm.

536
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,820
Wait, Thun.

537
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,060
Are you going along with him?

538
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,060
Be quiet, Ai'Prince.

539
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,120
Say it.

540
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,360
My charm is...

541
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,400
the previous years exam paper.

542
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,260
Confused?

543
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,760
Confused, right?

544
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,100
I knew...

545
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,760
Professor Wichai would use the
 previous year exam questions to test us.

546
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,410
That's how I did it.

547
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,540
So spent all day and night memorizing them.

548
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,540
And you saw the result.

549
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,960
I was able to do it.

550
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,690
If not, I would be dead for sure.

551
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,360
Damn!

552
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,710
That's crazy.

553
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,500
It's like the Bad Genius movie.

554
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,230
I also heard that...

555
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,370
the old exam papers are stored
  in the library's archive room.

556
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,240
What do you think?

557
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,950
Hold on, Ai'Thun.

558
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,950
 Are you saying that...

559
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,840
Are you serious?

560
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,690
How do you plan to get inside?

561
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,760
There's a lot of security guards.

562
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,880
Except Sunday.

563
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,360
Right!

564
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,360
Except Sunday.

565
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,920
Fine. Whatever you guys say.

566
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,090
Damn!

567
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,600
This is like...

568
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,150
Ocean's 11.

569
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,150
Ai'Khiem,

570
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,660
you are in charge of taking care of the cameras.

571
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,660
And as for you...

572
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,090
Mr. Secretary,

573
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,550
Get the keys.

574
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,620
Huh?

575
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,030
I am going along with your evil plan...

576
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,310
I'm in trouble already.

577
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,050
If it is not you, who else is it going to be?

578
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,400
You are the only one who can do this.

579
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,400
Let's do it this Sunday.

580
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:23,980
I'm counting on you.

581
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,150
Okay...

582
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,880
I will try.

583
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,970
The more information we gather...

584
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,910
the closer we get to know what happened to me.

585
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,640
This could help you to be reincarnated faster.

586
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,280
At least we are on the right track, P'Mes.

587
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,180
University,

588
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,250
benches,

589
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,430
the library, and the thesis.

590
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,740
The more information we gather...

591
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,770
the closer we get to know what happened to me.

592
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,630
This could help you to be reincarnated faster.

593
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,360
I just want to know truth of what happened to me.

594
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,240
If I am reincarnated...

595
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,850
we will think about that when that time comes.

596
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,310
Okay.

597
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,040
We will think about it later.

598
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,350
P'Mes.

599
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,950
 I'm going to bed now.

600
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,440
You should go to bed early, too.

601
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,530
Tomorrow we need to wake up early.

602
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
Wake up early tomorrow?

603
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,020
Why do we need to wake up early?

604
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,960
Tomorrow I will take you to...

605
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,540
At first...

606
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:24,830
when you told me that you will take me out somewhere...

607
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,160
I never thought you would bring me here.

608
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,160
A temple?

609
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,670
I've been wondering for a while...

610
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,240
if a ghost can enter a temple or not.

611
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,800
<i>Try to go in.</i>

612
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,460
<i>Okay?</i>

613
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,400
Oh, hot, hot, hot, hot, Thun!

614
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,410
Thun, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot...

615
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:55,880
Are you satisfied?

616
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,880
P'Mes...

617
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,020
are you teasing me?

618
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,850
That's what you wanted to see, right?

619
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,560
I think you have watched to many dramas.

620
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,560
<i>Let's go, giant kid.</i>

621
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,180
Oh ~

622
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,400
<i>So hot.</i>

623
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,970
Hey, Ai'Thun.

624
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,560
I've been wanting to ask since that day.

625
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,270
Why did you ask us to visit the temple with you?

626
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:25,950
Wait.

627
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,240
Why is it when Ai'Thun asked 
you to come to the temple...

628
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,710
you all came along?

629
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,800
But when I asked you to go to the shrine with me...

630
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,710
no one comes with me?

631
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,800
Hold on, Ai'Khiem.

632
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,270
I don't see how the the temple
 and a shrine are similar.

633
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,270
You studied for GAT/PAT but you didn't learn this?

634
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,270
GAT/PAT (General Aptitude Test and Professional and Academic Aptitude Test) Has a section on analytical and logical reasoning. Therefore it is brought up when Thai people question someone's reasoning.

635
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,050
I just want to take some merits, can't I?

636
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,050
Merit is a concept considered fundamental to Buddhist ethics. It is a beneficial and protective force which accumulates as a result of good deeds, acts, or thoughts.

637
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,070
You guys have sinned a lot.

638
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,720
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ~

639
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:50,300
You want to confess you sin that
 you cheated on the test, right?

640
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,640
Sorry, my friend.

641
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,490
This is a temple.

642
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,750
There is no one who will listen to your confession.

643
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,840
You guys are too mean.

644
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,440
Let's go inside and see Luang Por.

645
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,440
Luang Por is the word for a monk that is around their father's age.

646
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,320
Aren't you feeling hot?

647
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,890
<i>Let's go.</i>

648
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,300
- Is it hot here?
 <i>- Let's go.</i>

649
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,630
I don't feel anything.

650
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,790
I can stand here for another 100 hours.

651
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,480
Then you stay here.

652
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:04,990
Oh, hey!

653
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,320
I want to see the monk, too.

654
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:17,660
This chanting is to bless people after merit-making to
 have a long and high quality life full of power and happiness.

655
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,540
That should be good, yom.

656
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,540
Monks refer to no clerics as Yom.

657
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,110
You are young , but you still came
  to the temple on your own.

658
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,260
Is there something bothering you, yom?

659
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,260
It's nothing.

660
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,000
I just came to make merits.

661
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,000
Yom Thun.

662
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,720
Merit will not solve everything, Yom.

663
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,150
<i>Just do whatever it is that makes you feel peaceful, Yom Thun.</i>

664
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:48,080
By passing your merit out, you can help someone...

665
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,950
find peace in their body...

666
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,190
and soul.

667
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,030
But remember this, Yom.

668
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,520
We have our own karma.

669
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,370
It is a personal matter.

670
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,360
Life, growth, death, and rebirth...

671
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,480
is the law of nature.

672
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,560
Don't hold on to it...

673
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,110
or hold it back.

674
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,400
Let it be the way it is supposed to be.

675
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,600
Luang Por, khrap.

676
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,650
I have a question.

677
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,670
If a spirit doesn't remember their past.

678
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,670
what should they do to remember.

679
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:42,520
Whether it is a human or spirit...

680
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,180
we all have something that...

681
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,570
sticks with us.

682
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,360
What we hold on to can help them remember.

683
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,370
Whether it is an object

684
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,160
or a place.

685
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,890
That means...

686
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,250
if I take him...

687
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,360
to a place he is familiar with. It could
 help bring back his memories, right?

688
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,520
Thank you, Luang Por.

689
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,200
My turn. My turn.

690
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,200
 Luang Por, khrap.

691
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,640
Can you look into my future?

692
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,900
Ai'Khiem!

693
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,200
If you want to know your future,
 go see a fortune teller.

694
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
Don't bother Luang Por.

695
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,730
I can.

696
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,420
Then let me ask you, khrap.

697
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,110
I want to know if I will pass the exam?

698
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,510
And will I graduate in four years, Luang Por?

699
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:50,000
It's your own future to decide.

700
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,830
What did you get?

701
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,240
I got number 2.

702
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,400
Number 2: Two confused hearts...

703
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,640
You will get to live with someone far away.

704
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,640
Your charm...

705
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,360
will attract both men and women.

706
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:32,730
A sharp knife will cut off the dream path...

707
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:35,420
and the answer you are waiting for will soon arrive.

708
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,930
What does that kind of answer mean?

709
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,470
I don't understand.

710
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,960
I don't know either.

711
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,990
What about you, little girl?

712
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,000
- What? 
- What did you get?

713
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,690
Number 21

714
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,510
Number 21...

715
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:56,010
You care for someone but they never notice you love.

716
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,340
 Keep reading.

717
00:41:59,340 --> 00:41:59,950
No.

718
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,280
Why not?

719
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,290
It was talking about love. You don't want anyone to know?

720
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,300
Mind your own budiness.

721
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,160
Are you thinking of P'Chin?

722
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,160
To hell with P'Chin.

723
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:09,920
Ai'Prince?

724
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,150
What did you get?

725
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,990
Are you expert at nosing in other people's business?

726
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,160
I won't tell you.

727
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,610
Does someone like you believe in something like this?

728
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,950
It's none of your business.

729
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,560
Fine.

730
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,560
Heyy, you guys. I'm going to the restroom.

731
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,520
Ai'Khiem...

732
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,650
Can you take some pictures for me?

733
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,460
Hurry.

734
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,460
Guess, I am good at taking pictures.

735
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,640
You're holding my hand, too.
 Do you have feelings for me?

736
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,810
You talk too much.

737
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,350
<i>Are you taking a selfie?</i>

738
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,150
I told you to take a pictures of me.

739
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,920
Just stand there.

740
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,030
<i>Then take a picture of me.</i>

741
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,370
<i>I told you to just stand still.</i>

742
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,130
<i>How long are you going to argue with me?</i>

743
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:58,570
<i>OK, OK. Stay still, I'll take it.</i>

744
00:42:58,810 --> 00:42:59,760
<i>How are you, P'?</i>

745
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,120
Getting to come to a temple like this?

746
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,320
Well...

747
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,910
I feel cool.

748
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:06,910
It gave me good comfort.

749
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,820
Probably because someone 
pledged some merits for me.

750
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,120
Just leaving the dorm,
 you already looked happy .

751
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,120
Pay me back for what I paid 
for offerings to the monk.

752
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,410
Oh, giant kid! You're so greedy!

753
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:19,520
I'm kidding.

754
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,840
P'Mes, let's take a selfie.

755
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:24,080
What's a selfie?

756
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,080
It is like this?

757
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,500
If you take a photo, you won't
 be able to see me, right?

758
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,320
Come on, it's alright.

759
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:40,640
At least, I know that you are here.

760
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,270
Hey you guys?

761
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:00,840
Hmm?

762
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,770
Where are you going next?

763
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:03,230
I'm going back to the dorm.

764
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,110
I don't have anywhere else to go.

765
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:05,930
Oh, then...

766
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,360
Let's split up here.

767
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,890
I want to go buy some cosmetics.

768
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:13,790
<i>Hey, guys... </i>

769
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,250
What's with those faces?

770
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,300
I'm not asking you to come with me.

771
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,790
I don't want to listen to you whine.

772
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:21,550
Then,

773
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,780
do you want me to hail you a taxi?

774
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:23,920
No need.

775
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,920
<i>No one hails a taxi nowadays.</i>

776
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,370
I will call one through the app.

777
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,460
Don't worry.

778
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,260
See you.

779
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,010
Bye-bye.

780
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:30,560
See you.

781
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,640
See you.

782
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,430
Bye.

783
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,170
Feels so great to make merits!

784
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,290
Hey, guys...

785
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,240
I've changed my mind.

786
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,170
I will go with Plai.

787
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:45,130
I'm going.

788
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,740
What's the matter with him?

789
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,220
Wait, wait, wait.

790
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,690
Can you sit in the back?

791
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,060
Why?

792
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,570
Your body stinks.

793
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:57,900
Your feet stink, too.

794
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,900
It freaking stinks! Musty, too.

795
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,520
Really?

796
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,350
So please sit in the back. 
 You should smell yourself.

797
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:03,850
Do I smell?

798
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:04,810
Yes, a bit.

799
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:05,630
Sit in the back.

800
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:06,080
Come.

801
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,180
Fine.

802
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,390
It is nice to have a driver.

803
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,860
Please get in.

804
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:12,640
Clean the seat for me.

805
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:13,840
Very good.

806
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,840
Get back, footman.

807
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:16,890
Excellent.

808
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,170
Are you hot?

809
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,170
Of course I am.

810
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,070
Look at my shirt...

811
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,320
it looks like a blanket.

812
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,240
It's hot as hell.

813
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,760
What's with you?

814
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,680
Why are you smiling?

815
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:45,680
I'm full of merits.

816
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,860
I just feel great.

817
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:49,100
If you don't feel the same, maybe
 you don't have nough merits.

818
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,510
Or your merits were unsuccessful.

819
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:51,920
You are crazy.

820
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:12,270
<i>Oh?</i>

821
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:13,980
Ai'Prince, where are you going?

822
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,520
I'm... going with you.

823
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,540
Going with me?

824
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,050
Yes.

825
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,280
Great.

826
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:19,760
Now I have someone to go with.

827
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,080
What about the others?

828
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:22,540
They already went back.

829
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:30,730
You can get in first.

830
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:46,780
Thun.

831
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,600
Turn up the volume for me.

832
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,250
~ At first I was never cared about you ~

833
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:58,270
~ Whenever I saw you, I felt nothing special. ~

834
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,360
~ You appear to me just like everyone else. ~

835
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,310
~ Just an ordinary person ~

836
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:10,010
But then, it was my left chest.

837
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:13,470
Right where my heart is

838
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:18,840
Something is very wrong here.

839
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,320
Something that is in my heart.

840
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,280
Meeting like this who doesn't fall in love is crazy.

841
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,870
They must be stupid...

842
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:36,120
for not loving this person.

843
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:33,790
P'!

844
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,490
P'Mes.

845
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:40,490
What song are you listening to?

846
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:42,860
You've been smiling all by yourself.

847
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:45,160
"Mai Ruk Gaw Bah" by Mos Patiparn

848
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:45,160
"Whoever Doesn't Love This Is Crazy"

849
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,810
The song we listened to in the car.

850
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,460
Thun probably wasn't born yet.

851
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,460
Who sings it, P'? It sounds familiar.

852
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,120
It's Mos.

853
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,530
Mos Patiporn

854
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,560
P'Mos?

855
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:56,890
Did P'Mos sing, too?

856
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:00,110
He was very famous in the past.

857
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,110
Doesn't he sing anymore?

858
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,820
No.

859
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:05,820
He has two kids already.

860
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:09,200
He has been acting in dramas recently.

861
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,270
Should I find some of P'Mos's dramas to watch?

862
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:21,100
~ Meeting like this whoever doesn't fall in love is crazy ~

863
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,760
~ Might be confused because they don't have a brain ~

864
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,080
That's not it.

865
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,360
Oh.

866
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,680
~ Meeting like this who doesn't fall in love is crazy. ~

867
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,390
~ They must be stupid... ~

868
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:43,000
~ for not loving this person. ~

869
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:46,670
Keep singing, P'.

870
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,060
Keep singing what?

871
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,360
Please.

872
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,760
Just one more line.

873
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:53,640
No.

874
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:55,280
Oh, P'.

875
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,410
Please, please, please?

876
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,850
No.

877
00:48:58,170 --> 00:48:58,910
Just one more part.

878
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:02,430
How about this.

879
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:04,760
If I find P'Mos's for you to watch...

880
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,610
Let's trade.

881
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,520
The find the drama first and I will sing for you.

882
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,520
Promise me, P'.

883
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,650
 But we can't touch each other.

884
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,160
It's alright, P'.

885
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,170
Just seeing it and talking to you...

886
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,420
that's good enough.

887
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,180
We can make a promise to
 each other without touching.

888
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,210
Do you promise?

889
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,210
I promise.

890
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:06,730
Dude.

891
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,310
Are you sure it is worth it?

892
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:10,960
Of course it is.

893
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,350
Run!

894
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:16,970
Who's there?

895
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:18,970
Ai'Khiem!

896
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:19,710
Wait for me!

897
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,870
Hey, stop! Stop there!

898
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,880
Damn, Ai'Khiem! What is wrong with you?

899
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,110
I'm scared.

900
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:01,470
Damn, it's so dark.

901
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:08,190
You guys...

902
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:10,350
We will have to use the back door to the library.

903
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:12,000
- Let's go.
 - Follow me.

904
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:15,050
Shhh!

905
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,240
Come.

906
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:22,800
Ai'Prince.

907
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:23,480
Huh?

908
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,510
Did you check on the security guard?

909
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:25,040
Yeah.

910
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:26,520
Ai'Khiem, what about the cameras?

911
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,880
I am certain there are none on this door.

912
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,260
The keys?

913
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,700
Here.

914
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:34,800
Dude...

915
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:35,640
so...

916
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,280
will the exam be the same?

917
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,680
Are you sure it is worth it?

918
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,420
Of course it is.

919
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,840
Guys. Guys. Guys.

920
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,740
What's wrong?

921
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:04,880
The library at night is quite scary.

922
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,620
Don't be such a coward.

923
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,950
 Hurry up.

924
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:08,680
Ai'Prince!

925
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:14,960
Shit, it's scary.

926
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,960
Be quiet and keep walking.

927
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,670
Ai'Prince.

928
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,950
Damn it.

929
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:39,720
None of them fit.

930
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,120
Fuck!

931
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:43,120
Why did I let you take care of the key?

932
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,120
How would I know?

933
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,120
You just asked me to find the library key.

934
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,920
You...

935
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,180
You are not handsome and
 now you are no even smart.

936
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,140
Hold this.

937
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:55,930
I'll do it.

938
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:09,260
Damn.

939
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,140
All done.

940
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,290
How did you do that?

941
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,440
Jib jib.

942
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,440
"Jib jib" means "very easy"

943
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,040
My neighbor taught me.

944
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:14,890
What's his name?

945
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,120
His name is Jib you idiot.

946
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,320
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go! Hurry!

947
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,060
Oh, right.

948
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:31,790
Oh ~ What the hell?

949
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,120
There are hundreds of documents here.

950
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,760
Where should we start?

951
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:38,220
Then how about this.

952
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,040
We'll split up.

953
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,040
Whoever finds them first, let us know, okay?

954
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,040
Then you both search over there. 
I will look over here.

955
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:43,340
Okay.

956
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:45,340
Hey, Ai'Prince.

957
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,710
I want to go with you. I'm scared of ghosts.

958
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,080
Fine, hurry up will you?

959
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:14,320
Hey, be quiet.

960
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,120
What is it?

961
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:17,680
Didn't you say...

962
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,440
there was no security guard on Sunday?

963
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:21,320
Yeah.

964
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:22,620
Damn it!

965
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,760
Normally there are no guards at this time.

966
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,530
Let go of me and keep searching,
 so we can leave this place soon.

967
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:31,200
Hurry up.

968
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:39,040
Have you found it, Ai'Khiem?

969
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,260
We're already here, let's find it.

970
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,040
Ai'Prince!

971
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,100
What if...

972
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:53,050
that wasn't a human walking before?

973
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,050
Oh, Ai'Khiem!

974
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,960
I would rather face a ghost 
than get caught right now!

975
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,380
Ai'Thun,

976
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,680
what are you looking for over there?

977
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,680
Did you trick us?

978
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,150
Trick you, my ass.

979
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,440
I said they are stored here, so they must be here.

980
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,270
When did I ever trick you?

981
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,000
You guys should stop saying "trick".

982
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,610
It's a bad omen.

983
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:23,930
P'.

984
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:25,470
They only have thesis from Year 41.

985
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:27,470
<i>What 41?</i>

986
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,080
<i>Who are you talking with?</i>

987
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,600
What are you exactly looking for, Ai'Thun.

988
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:33,880
Fuck!

989
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,780
Shit! What the hell was that?

990
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,060
Fucking Ai'Khiem dropped a box.

991
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,080
Shit!

992
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:43,710
Be quiet.

993
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,000
Do you hear that?

994
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:50,640
What should we do?

995
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,640
Go hide, what are you waiting for?

996
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:32,140
Plai?

997
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,640
You scared us.

998
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,830
I can't do this anymore.

999
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:37,390
<i>I quit. Let's go back, everyone.</i>

1000
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,480
<i>I can't do this.</i>

1001
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,950
<i>It's to scary. Let's get out of here.</i>

1002
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:44,480
Let's go, Let's go back.

1003
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,340
Please?

1004
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,340
So, what are you doing here, Plai?

1005
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:50,440
Didn't anyone tell you
 that you're studying law?

1006
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:53,360
Did you forget that I'm 
also in the LINE group chat?

1007
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:57,100
And I'm the one who should ask
 you, what are you doing here?

1008
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:00,560
Well...

1009
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,430
Hey? Who's there?

1010
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,790
Run!

1011
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:04,430
Who's there?

1012
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:06,940
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

1013
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:08,520
<i>Ai'Khiem!</i>

1014
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,340
<i>Wait for me!</i>

1015
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:13,610
Hey, stop!

1016
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:14,510
Stop!

1017
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,710
Who are you?

1018
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:18,800
Stop!

1019
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,800
Stop!

1020
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,200
 Hey, stop!

1021
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,050
Damn!

1022
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:34,920
 If we got caught...

1023
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,920
we would have been in big trouble.

1024
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,000
That was fun!

1025
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:39,260
I never did something like that before.

1026
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,670
What do you mean fun, P'?

1027
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:41,870
We almost got caught.

1028
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,120
Thun?

1029
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,590
Who are you talking with?

1030
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,410
Umm...

1031
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:47,870
I mean...

1032
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,500
Shit! Thun! You are...

1033
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:50,570
What's wrong?

1034
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,790
Blood.

1035
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,800
Blood, blood!

1036
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,240
Dude, blood!

1037
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,590
Let's go to the hospital. Let's go!

1038
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:58,280
Guys, let's go to the hospital!

1039
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,020
Ai'Khiem.

1040
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,760
I'm alright. It's just a scratch.

1041
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:02,270
Scratch.

1042
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,270
Ai'Prince, are you alright?
 Ai'Prince!

1043
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,680
Ai'Prince!

1044
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,640
I'm afraid of blood.

1045
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,060
This is crazy!

1046
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,930
Help me out, will you?

1047
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,320
Let's go, let's go, quick.

1048
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,910
Let's go, let's go,

1049
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,910
What's wrong with you?

1050
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,640
So, what are you guys really up to?

1051
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:24,200
We were getting exam papers.

1052
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,040
Ai'Thun said here were some exam papers from previous
 years which the professor may use for our exam this year.

1053
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,540
Then you went there to steal?

1054
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,080
Yes. Keep it down, will you?

1055
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:34,620
Are you crazy?

1056
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,960
Look how it turned out.

1057
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:38,380
One got their head scratch and one passed out.

1058
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,380
- Hey? Who passed out?
 - Are you alright?

1059
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,760
Who passed out? No one passed out?

1060
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,760
Here, inhaler. Give it to him.

1061
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:48,360
Ai'Thun.

1062
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,270
I don't want to do this anymore.

1063
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,270
I am to nervous.

1064
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,490
Does it hurt?

1065
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:56,240
A bit. A bit. It hurts. It hurts.

1066
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:58,490
But it's alright. It's just a few stitches.

1067
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:00,490
Shall we go?

1068
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:02,800
Ai'Prince?

1069
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,220
Are you alright?

1070
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:05,480
I am.

1071
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,540
Let's go.

1072
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,290
Stand up.

1073
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:10,190
Are you alright?

1074
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,720
I'm afraid you will pass out again.

1075
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,760
Heart attack patient. Take him to
 the emergency room. Hurry!

1076
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,360
P'Mes?

1077
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:34,360
P'Mes?

1078
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,710
You came in and out of
 the hospital often, right?

1079
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:41,070
Heart attack...

1080
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,090
Guys, I will be right back.

1081
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,550
What was that?

1082
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:52,090
P', khrap?

1083
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:52,670
Yes?

1084
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:57,310
Do you have information about patients who were
 treated for a heart disease here?

1085
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,310
Between the years 39 and 40?

1086
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:00,940
What do you want them for, Nong?

1087
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:05,360
I'm doing research for a thesis.

1088
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,920
The patient's background information
 is considered confidential.

1089
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:13,480
So if you want ask for that information
 you need to submit a request letter.

1090
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,250
If you are working on a thesis, you 
might can ask your instructor for help.

1091
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:18,540
But...

1092
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,050
I am really need to have it soon.

1093
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,000
Can you give it to me, please?

1094
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,340
<i>I'm sorry, I can't.</i>

1095
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:24,570
You really can't?

1096
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:25,400
I can't.

1097
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,360
No I can't.

1098
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,240
Hey, Ai'Thun.

1099
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,920
What's wrong with you?

1100
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,040
You suddenly came back inside.

1101
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:34,910
Right?

1102
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:35,920
What's wrong with you?

1103
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:39,100
It's nothing.

1104
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,800
Then let's go home.

1105
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,520
So...

1106
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,570
Where's Ai'Khiem?

1107
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,960
Who is Ai'Khiem talking to?

1108
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:55,790
Oh...

1109
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,710
<i>That's probably P'Karn.</i>

1110
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,150
His older sister he told us about.

1111
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:01,150
Ai'Khiem's older sister?

1112
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,210
Ai'Khiem's older sister is a nurse?

1113
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:06,380
Yes.

1114
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,380
That's what I heard.

1115
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:36,780
[Preview]

1116
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,780
I need your help.

1117
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:46,140
I need a list of patients who received treatment for heart disease 
during 1997 at the hospital were your sister works.

1118
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:46,830
Hey?

1119
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:48,830
What do you want them for?

1120
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,830
Behaviors of a cannabis addict.

1121
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:52,120
I am sure of it.

1122
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,880
Didn't you notice that he's been acting weird recently?

1123
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,010
who were you talking to?

1124
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,010
I'm not talking to anyone.

1125
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,160
Liar.

1126
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,160
Your voice could be heard outside the door.

1127
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,750
He only has naked pictures of guys.

1128
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,380
Naked pictures of guys?

1129
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:05,080
Seriously?

1130
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,060
Let me see.

1131
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:06,940
Hey, don't.

1132
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,110
Hey, I just want to see for a bit.

1133
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:08,830
Hey!

1134
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:09,610
Just for a little bit.

1135
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:10,170
No!

1136
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,170
-  If you like guys, just say it!
- Hey!

1137
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:14,990
Sorry.

1138
