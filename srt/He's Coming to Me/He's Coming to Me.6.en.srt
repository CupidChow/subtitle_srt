1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,140
<i>I never thought...</i>

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,640
<i>the relationship between me and P'Mes...</i>

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,640
<i>would come to this point.</i>

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,210
When I was young, I hated this special ability so much.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,640
It was not fun being a kid you could see ghosts.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,640
Until I met P'Mes.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,320
A strange ghost who doesn't know how he died.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,500
it made realized that...

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,960
in this world,

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,540
there is still someone more unfortunate than me.

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,920
It was sad to think about.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,510
Being stuck in a place...

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,350
not knowing for how long.

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,730
Then if my gift...

15
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,200
can really help him,

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,610
then it could...

17
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,200
really be called a gift.

18
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,840
Somehow it is just like Spiderman saving the world.

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,840
But it is not that simple in reality.

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,840
And the reason a stupid kid like me is studying law...

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,100
is so that might get smart enough to be able to help, P'.

22
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,440
But now I don't know how it happened.

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,800
My feelings towards him are strangely changing day by day.

24
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,200
I don't know when it started.

25
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,610
But I know one thing...

26
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,070
I have already felt it.

27
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,890
And it felt really good.

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,890
And he is ...

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,420
the only one that makes me feel like this.

30
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,990
Right now...

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,790
I just want to follow my heart.

32
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,190
I won't let you go anywhere after this.

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,220
Go back to sleep.

34
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,310
P'Mes.

35
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,690
You?

36
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,500
How did you get here?

37
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,080
You didn't tell me first.

38
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,880
If I told you before, you would have time to prepare.

39
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,250
Prepare for what?

40
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,250
It's not like I hvae something to hide.

41
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,840
Are you sure?

42
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,080
Are you alright? Look at yourself.

43
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,080
I'm fine.

44
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,900
Just got sick.

45
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,160
Only had to take some medicine and see a doctor. I'll be fine.

46
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,610
No need to worry.

47
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,120
How ca I not worry?

48
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,620
When you have a child you will understand.

49
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,820
I didn't want you to think to much.

50
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,220
Just coming here is tiring enough.

51
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,820
Are you sure that I don't have to worry about you?

52
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,280
Are you sure?

53
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,640
Are you really sure?

54
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,360
What is it?

55
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,390
What is it?

56
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,120
Who reported to you about me?

57
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,120
No one reported.

58
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,320
KhiaoKhiem called me to come stay with you.

59
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,730
KhiaoKhiem?

60
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,610
You believed him?

61
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,640
Oh?

62
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,160
I didn't believe him.

63
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,160
So I came to see for myself and turned out like this.

64
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,500
Who would normally fall asleep 
on a terrace in the rain?

65
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,500
Is there something on your mind?

66
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,580
Do you feel troubled?

67
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,580
Or heartbroken?

68
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,520
Ai'Khiem was just kidding.

69
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,280
Do you want to come back
 home for a couple of days?

70
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,920
I don't.

71
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,420
Oh?

72
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,820
I have an assignment with my friends, 
I already have an appointment with them.

73
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,860
If you are not coming home, then I'll stay here.

74
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,710
I better stay here with you 
if you get sick like this.

75
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,130
Eat some porridge and take
 your morning medicine.

76
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,670
P'Mes...

77
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,850
Where are you now?

78
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,940
<i>Come.</i>

79
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,000
Spring from your feet a bit.

80
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,540
Stay focused. Shoot!

81
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,150
Come.

82
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,680
The wrist. The wrist.

83
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,600
<i>Catch the ball and shoot.</i>

84
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,520
Actually,

85
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,960
if you're not ok....

86
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,790
you don't need to come to practice.

87
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,070
I will tell Peter.

88
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,730
Yeah, right.

89
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,300
You will get sick again if you practice too much.

90
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,360
You're too nosy.

91
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,910
I haven't scolded you for calling my mom yet.

92
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,330
Bastard...

93
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,090
How can you say that?

94
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,030
I am just worried about you.

95
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Ai'Thun...

96
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,880
I'll be honest with you.

97
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,630
Your behavior right now is out of control.

98
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,630
There's nothing wrong with me.

99
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,820
Then why were you shouting on the terrace?

100
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,040
Who were your talking to?

101
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,900
Tell me.

102
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,950
Just calm down.

103
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,160
If you say you're fine, you're fine.

104
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,720
If you don't want to talk to us, we don't mind.

105
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,100
But there's a hotline 165.

106
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,000
They can help you.

107
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You're with him, too?

108
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,300
No...

109
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,180
I just...

110
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,590
If you still want to be my friends...

111
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,950
I am not a drug addict.

112
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,340
Maybe he really isn't a drug addict.

113
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,510
Maybe we are overreacting.

114
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,220
But my neighbor...

115
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,280
That's enough.

116
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,700
P'Mes?

117
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,880
Hey.

118
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,560
Sawasdee, Mom.

119
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,030
Have you changed your taste lately?

120
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,030
Change what taste?

121
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,300
Taste in songs.

122
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,000
Look!

123
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,240
These are all songs back from my time.

124
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,700
But at that time it was not easy to listen to them.

125
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,960
I had to record it from the radio.

126
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,900
Or I had to call the DJ to have them play it.

127
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,040
I made so many tapes at that time.

128
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
So I could go back and listen to them.

129
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,410
What happened to make you listen
 to the same music from my time?

130
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,710
<i>This child...</i>

131
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,430
<i>who used to complain about me listening to old songs.</i>

132
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,320
In the end, you listen to them yourself.

133
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,190
Are people listening to the 90's hits lately?

134
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,660
It seems like everything is about the 90's recently.

135
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,860
But here...

136
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,320
I am a true 90's student.

137
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,860
Someone recommended it to me. They're pretty good.

138
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,160
I am a fanclub of GRAMMY.

139
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,160
GRAMMY is a Thai music company

140
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,480
Whoever released a new song, I would know all about it.

141
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,470
This. This one.

142
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,170
This song.

143
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,600
P'Fluke Krekpon.

144
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,280
~ Only ask you to remember ~

145
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,600
~ Whenever you hear ~

146
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,500
~ Please know that this song is for you ~

147
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,800
I though it was Kang's song.

148
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,800
Kang Vorakorn - Porsche from Puppy Honey.

149
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,120
Hey...

150
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,390
This is the original.

151
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,960
At the time, Torfun and Marwin was very famous.

152
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,960
Song is on the OST for Torfun Kub Marwin (1996) Thai Drama

153
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,580
I used to call your dad, WinWin for a while.

154
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,780
Like the main character.

155
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,780
I'm so shy.

156
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,120
Mom?

157
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,720
Hmm?

158
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,490
Do you miss Dad?

159
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,440
I do.

160
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,060
But by now,

161
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,060
your dad...

162
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,120
been reincarnated and is old enough
  to be in primary school already.

163
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,860
Why do you love Dad?

164
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,170
At that time, I had just broke up with my first boyfriend.

165
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,070
So...

166
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,120
Your dad sort of went from the second 
choice to the first choice. Something like that.

167
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,320
It wasn't...

168
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,320
It was nothing. But more like he
 was always a part of my life.

169
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
Whereever I went or whatever I did...

170
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,450
he would always take care of me.

171
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,580
Whenever I turned he would be there.

172
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,180
Until one day...

173
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,180
he suddenly disappeared.

174
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,960
I was like...

175
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,390
You are in trouble, Kwan.

176
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,540
You're in trouble, Kwan.

177
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,110
You really love him.

178
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,520
From that moment on...

179
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,520
you dad was always part of my life.

180
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,880
That must be what you call love, right?

181
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:53,950
<i>What is this?</i>

182
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,170
What kind of feelings are you having?

183
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,170
Why are you asking for?

184
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,480
Nothing.

185
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,480
I'm going to take a shower now.

186
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:04,890
Ok.

187
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,600
Just go. You stink.

188
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,000
</i>Thun.<i>

189
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,610
Hmm?

190
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,920
It's almost your birthday.

191
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,600
How did you know that?

192
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,440
What do you want?

193
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,980
What do you want to give me?

194
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,610
What can a homeless spirit like
 me what could I give you?

195
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,210
Happy birthday, Thun.

196
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,750
I wish you lots of happiness and hope
 everything you wish for comes true.

197
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,750
If one day I am not here,

198
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,620
when Thun looks up at the stars 
in the sky or in this glass jar,

199
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,620
you will think of me.

200
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,440
Happy Birthday ~ P'Mes

201
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,940
Are you really not here anymore?

202
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,860
Mung Ming Who Doesn't Have A Real Name Like Everyone Else.

203
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:41,740
[How are you, P'? If you can read this, 
please find a way to let me know.]

204
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,460
Number 2: Two confused hearts...

205
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,490
A destiny beyond your dreams

206
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,270
You will get to live with someone far away.

207
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,540
Heaven cannot stop the path from going.

208
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,700
Your charm can attract both men and women.

209
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,650
Even if you choose to hold, to keep, you can't decide

210
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,760
A sharp sword will cut off the dream

211
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,700
Hesitation, loneliness and fear

212
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,100
Your belief will take you through the storm.

213
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,840
Then the answer you seek will be in your reach.

214
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,650
Right or wrong, it still binds the heart.

215
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:07,130
Then a light will shine to guide the way.

216
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,750
Hey?

217
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,300
What the fuck is with you?

218
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,770
What the hell is wrong with you, Ai'Thun?

219
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,290
Can't you hear? I said to pass the ball!

220
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:29,680
Hey!

221
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
What is wrong with you two?

222
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,120
If it is like what you said,

223
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,270
are you sure he will talk to me?

224
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,840
Ai'Khiem and I have tried every way.

225
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,320
We almost punched each other.

226
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,320
Is that so?

227
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,960
Then will he punch me too?

228
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,960
Because he is like this...

229
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,380
we want you to try.

230
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,540
If it is not me or Ai'Khiem...

231
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,390
it has to be you, Plaifah.

232
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,490
<i>Thun.</i>

233
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:47,870
Oh...

234
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,370
Why are you here?

235
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,120
I came to see a professor...

236
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,160
and I missed you.

237
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,960
Ai'Prince and Ai'Khiem put you up to this, right?

238
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,570
Yes.

239
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,840
And since we are at this point...

240
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,060
let me say this.

241
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,230
What's going on with you, Ai'Thun?

242
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,740
We are friends.

243
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,820
You said it yourself.

244
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,490
If there is a problem, say it.

245
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,890
It's nothing.

246
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,170
Thun...

247
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:18,860
What?

248
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,860
Do you think acting like this

249
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,400
makes you cool?

250
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,400
I told you it's nothing.

251
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,220
You don't want to talk to Ai'Prince...

252
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,260
or talk to Ai'Khiem.

253
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,080
I can understand that.

254
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,210
But this is me, Thun.

255
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,210
What the hell, Plai?

256
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,070
Then you consider me to be like your other friends, right?

257
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,800
Am I right?

258
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,800
Then what about that night...

259
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,560
I'm sorry!

260
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,160
I want to be alone!

261
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,880
So...

262
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,880
Can I sit with you?

263
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:24,810
Plai.

264
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,290
I'm sorry.

265
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,290
Sorry?

266
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,290
Ai'Thun also said sorry.

267
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,450
Why do you guys keep saying sorry to me?

268
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,450
Well...

269
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,540
I'm sorry for dragging you into this.

270
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,190
We're friends...

271
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,490
then you shouldn't say that.

272
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,870
The way you guys feel worried about Thun...

273
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,870
I feel the same way.

274
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,710
Do you know?

275
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,710
It is so bad...

276
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,570
that he doesn't tell us what he thinks

277
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,600
or if there is something wrong.

278
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,370
He is letting himself go crazy by himself.

279
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,990
Is there a problem between you and him?

280
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,760
Well...

281
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,660
On the night of his birthday...

282
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,750
I kissed him.

283
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,540
But nothing more than that.

284
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,720
And after that...

285
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,910
Ai'Thun doesn't talk to me like he used to.

286
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,980
I shouldn't have done it.

287
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,380
Plai.

288
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:55,760
Do...

289
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,040
you really like Ai'Thun?

290
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,760
If I say no now, it will be...

291
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,760
to late, right?

292
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,780
But it was quite a relief...

293
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,040
to be able to say it out.

294
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,620
And what do you...

295
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,620
think I should do?

296
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,960
Just tell him.

297
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:24,960
If you like him,

298
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,980
be straight with him.

299
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,950
Really?

300
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,280
Yes.

301
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,810
If it were you...

302
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,600
If you liked someone, would you tell them, right?

303
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:37,790
Yes.

304
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,560
Well...

305
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,240
at least...

306
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,870
he will know exactly what you think of him?

307
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,910
Actually...

308
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,910
maybe he is waiting for you.

309
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,970
It's so crazy to have these feelings.

310
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,140
If everyone could stop their feelings from happening,

311
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,870
no one would fall in love?

312
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,020
Thank you, Ai'Prince.

313
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,510
P'Mes.

314
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,200
Are you here?

315
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,870
If you have come to talk about what you said...

316
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,470
then just go away.

317
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,970
I haven't.

318
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,920
I'm sorry...

319
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,920
I called your mother the other day.

320
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,710
Okay.

321
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,350
Ai'Khiem.

322
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,210
I've lied to you about something.

323
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,000
That day I asked you to go with me to the archive room...

324
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,000
It wasn't to steal the exam questions.

325
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,350
Shit.

326
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,420
There.

327
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,440
I knew it.

328
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,970
And that time...

329
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,290
I lied to you that I'm a private detective.

330
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,870
I never thought you would be
 stupid enough to believe me.

331
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,960
Bastard.

332
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,030
You lied to me and you still insult me?

333
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,660
I'm sorry.

334
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,930
But right now, I am helping someone.

335
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,320
That is the truth.

336
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,580
So what's really going on with you, friend?

337
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,950
If I tell you that I can see ghosts...

338
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,140
will you believe me?

339
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,080
When I was a kid...

340
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,960
I went to Chinming with my dad,

341
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,590
and I met this spirit.

342
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,760
His name is P'Mes.

343
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,760
But...

344
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,760
he can't be reincarnated...

345
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,470
because he doesn't really know how he died.

346
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,210
Then what?

347
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,130
I went to meet him once every year.

348
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,130
Then I...

349
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,660
brought him to live with me.

350
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,760
Brought him to live with you?

351
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,960
You mean in our dorm?

352
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,340
Yes.

353
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,240
Shit!

354
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,590
Aren't you scared?

355
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,350
He is not scary.

356
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,880
He is just like you and me.

357
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,880
Another thing, he also once studied at this university.

358
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,620
Then when did you bring him here?

359
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,810
Well...

360
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,990
when I was skipping basketball practice a lot...

361
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,570
Around that time.

362
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,670
But right now...

363
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,600
I don't know where he has gone.

364
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,140
That is what I am stressed about.

365
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,840
Damn.

366
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,920
I don't know where I should to start.

367
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,270
How about this?

368
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,290
If what you are saying is true,

369
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,560
I think...

370
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,870
by now...

371
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,870
he might have reincarnated already.

372
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,870
Not yet.

373
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,870
I know it.

374
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,960
It is quite complicated.

375
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,240
Ai'Thun.

376
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,270
I know a lot of mediums who 
are good at this kind of thing.

377
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,360
Do you want to try?

378
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,590
Should I do that?

379
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,320
But thank you for believing me.

380
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,700
Yeah.

381
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,000
Let's go to practice.

382
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,770
We'll talk about what to do next later.

383
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,790
Oi~ Ai'Thun.

384
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,610
I'd be stupid to believe that.

385
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,460
Your mind must be already gone.

386
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,720
Good.

387
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,080
AJ.

388
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,520
<i>Prince! Prince! Prince! This way!</i>

389
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,420
Prince!

390
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,540
AJ.

391
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,720
Ai'Prince!

392
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,760
Pass it.

393
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,550
Prince.

394
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,920
This way.

395
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,010
Pass it.

396
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,180
Prince.

397
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,350
Ai'Prince!

398
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,450
Hey!

399
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,450
What the hell is wrong with you?

400
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,970
What the hell is wrong with you, Ai'Thun?

401
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,480
Can't you hear? I said to pass the ball!

402
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,790
Hey, what is wrong with you two?

403
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,300
What the hell is wrong with you, Ai'Thun?

404
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,200
<i>If you don't want to play basketball anymore.</i>

405
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,200
You should leave the team.

406
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,420
If you play...

407
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,180
you don't practice seriously.

408
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,950
You are holding us back like this.

409
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,380
We will lose the competition.

410
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,800
I don't care if we lose.

411
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,360
How can you say that, Ai'Thun?!?

412
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,000
You don't want to win, but I do!

413
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,240
At first...

414
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,600
I thought you were behaving like 
this because you were sick.

415
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,360
But now...

416
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,970
do whatever the hell you want.

417
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,220
I don't care anymore.

418
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,570
You really suck at this.

419
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,750
Just withdraw from our team.

420
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,010
Sure!

421
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,320
I suck.

422
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,630
And you're so good, right?

423
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,670
Then compete with me.

424
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,430
Compete for what?

425
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,750
What do you want from me?

426
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,540
You said you were good, right?

427
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,200
Then beat me in shooting the ball.

428
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,600
Fine.

429
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,600
But if I win...

430
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,600
you have to start practicing hard

431
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,170
and stop being stupid like this.

432
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,390
And you have to...

433
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,640
clear things up with Plai as well.

434
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,260
Clear up what?

435
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,100
How do you want this to end with her?

436
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,520
You know that Plaifah likes you.

437
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,440
What's that got to do with you?

438
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,650
Because I like Plai.

439
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,570
But Plai likes you.

440
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,440
If you don't have feelings for her, then tell her.

441
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,590
But if you do,

442
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,590
then I'll back off.

443
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,280
If you keep hesitating like this,

444
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,450
it's not only Plai that gets hurt.

445
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,750
Whatever you decide, make it clear.

446
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,610
I am not competing against you anymore.

447
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,610
What the hell do you mean?

448
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,300
Because I don't have feelings for Plai.

449
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,560
If you didn't, then why did you kiss her?!?

450
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,430
It's because I kisssed Plai...

451
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,700
that I know I am not attracted to girls!

452
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,120
What's wrong, son.

453
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,440
What happened?

454
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,510
I'm afraid that if I tell you, you'll be disappointed.

455
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,800
What do you mean?

456
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,080
I don't understand

457
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,040
P'Jeng.

458
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,340
It's already been a week,

459
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,240
 but Mes hasn't gotten any better.

460
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,180
<i>Didn't I tell you before, Ai'Mes?</i>

461
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,870
That feelings...

462
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,680
are the most dangerous thing...

463
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,100
for spirits like us.

464
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,160
Are there any spirits that have these kinds of feelings?

465
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,250
There is me, P'.

466
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,250
Because you broke the rules.

467
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,170
<i>It's fortunate that you could get back here.</i>

468
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,150
If you force yourself to use your power like that,

469
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,720
Maybe...

470
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,320
you won't be able to come back anymore.

471
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,640
Hey!

472
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,560
Why are you scaring him?

473
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,160
I'm not scaring him.

474
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:07,660
Do you know what spirits like us should do?

475
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,290
Wait.

476
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,000
Wait until our time comes.

477
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,860
<i>But you went away from that path.</i>

478
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,930
Because it felt good, P'.

479
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,470
You are not me, so you wouldn't understand.

480
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:26,960
What feels good?

481
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,690
You mean that relationship between you and Thun?

482
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,790
How do you think this relationship will end for you? Huh?

483
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,080
Do you see...

484
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,080
how this will turn out good for you?

485
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,610
You can't.

486
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,980
It's because it doesn't exist.

487
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,400
What should have ended...

488
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,440
you should let it end.

489
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:54,720
The more you force it...

490
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,510
the more painful it will be.

491
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,960
The more you will hurt yourself.

492
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,530
Alright, alright, alright

493
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,890
That's enough, P'Jeng.

494
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,620
Feel sorry for him.

495
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,570
P'Jeng.

496
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,190
Angoon.

497
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:16,990
Hmm?

498
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,160
I have something important to tell you.

499
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,160
I just found out...

500
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,580
I didn't die from a heart attack.

501
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,020
Ai'Thun.

502
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,190
You don't need to worry about us.

503
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,460
I'm OK.

504
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,080
I thought that...

505
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,650
you wouldn't want to be friends anymore.

506
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,650
What shit are you saying?

507
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,460
But you do need to give us some time.

508
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,930
Who would think this would happen?

509
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,160
You used to date N'Noey, the campus star.

510
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,850
Well, that was a long time ago.

511
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,580
And this is now.

512
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:38,940
So...

513
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,400
from then to now,

514
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:43,840
when did it happen?

515
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,600
I don't know either, dude.

516
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,280
So all this time you must have been uncomfortable?

517
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,940
Sometimes...

518
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,680
When you asked me about a girlfriend.

519
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,680
Well...

520
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,680
it was because we didn't know.

521
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,680
We are sorry.

522
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,350
It's alright.

523
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,990
At least now...

524
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,930
I managed to get past the hardest part already.

525
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,120
Which was telling you guys.

526
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,720
I'm happy.

527
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,360
You must be thinking that you don't 
want me to touch your butt anymore.

528
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,890
Then do you want to touch my butt now?

529
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,660
I'm kidding.

530
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,270
Sure.

531
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,680
We have nothing against this...

532
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,680
Ai'Plai does.

533
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,380
Plai...

534
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,380
She must have been shocked.

535
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,250
Does your mom know about this yet?

536
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,440
Sawasdee, Mom.

537
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,740
Right on time.

538
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,360
Hey!

539
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,360
Let's go shopping tomorrow.

540
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,360
It's been awhile since I have come here.

541
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,830
What actually happened with you?

542
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,430
Why are you clothes folded neatly in your wardrobe?

543
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,430
When did you learn to fold clothes?

544
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,160
Are you really my son?

545
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,160
Get out and bring back my son.

546
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,080
Thun.

547
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,080
<i>Thun.</i>

548
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,080
Thun?

549
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,080
Thun!

550
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,040
What's wrong, son?

551
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,460
Huh?

552
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,960
Are you alright?

553
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,160
Oh, it's nothing.

554
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,810
I'm just tired.

555
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,810
I have a lot on my mind.

556
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,720
The go take a shower and come out for dinner.

557
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,150
Everything will be done by then.

558
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,240
I don't want to eat.

559
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,930
I'm not hungry.

560
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,120
Oh ~

561
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,160
You don't want to eat? That's cruel.

562
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,090
Are you going to leave me to eat alone?

563
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,090
Just sit with me first.

564
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,100
Here, steamed egg.

565
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,190
Your favorite dish.

566
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,840
Whenever I cooked this, you always ate it all.

567
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,560
Wow! That's steamed egg.

568
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,720
You can make my favorite dish now.

569
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,720
You are becoming more and more human, you know.

570
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,530
Once you went to school but you wanted
 to eat steamed egg so much.

571
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,820
So I had to bring it from home to you, do you remember?

572
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:06,640
You?

573
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,130
Hmm?

574
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:10,720
When I was little, was I naughty?

575
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,520
Oho!

576
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,000
Of course, you were.

577
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,700
Do you remember the garden house?

578
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,960
You sneaked out on your bicycle 
to ride on the main road.

579
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,710
I almost had a heart attack.

580
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,710
But luckily,

581
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,640
after I hit you with a clothes hanger, you behaved better.

582
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,450
Let's eat dinner.

583
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,060
Thun...

584
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,350
Thun is sorry.

585
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,490
What is wrong?

586
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,180
What happened?

587
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,600
You can tell me anything.

588
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,670
I'm like one of your friends,

589
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,870
so I will listen to you as a friend.

590
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:11,360
Thun is referring to himself in 'third person." When Thais use their name in this way they are not speaking in the “third person” but are really speaking in the “first person”. They are simply using one way (of many) to say “I” in Thai.

591
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,530
Thun...

592
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,350
Thun doesn't know how to say it.

593
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,360
Thun is afraid that if I tell you, you will be disappointed.

594
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,170
Did you get someone pregnant?

595
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,800
If that was the case...

596
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,710
maybe you wouldn't be disappointed in me.

597
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,400
What do you mean?

598
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,820
I don't understand.

599
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,590
Thun...

600
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,200
Thun is not like other people.

601
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,200
You...

602
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,120
I'm so tired.

603
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,760
Thun thinks...

604
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,200
Thun...

605
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,410
doesn't like girls.

606
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,600
So you like guys, right?

607
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,560
I don't know why.

608
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,020
I'm so sorry.

609
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:16,380
Thun...

610
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,380
Why are you apologizing?

611
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,380
You haven't done anything wrong.

612
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,230
Thun was so afraid.

613
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,380
Thun was so afraid that he would make you sad.

614
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,640
Thun was really scared you would be disappointed.

615
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,140
Thun. Thun.

616
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,250
It's alright. Calm down. Calm down.

617
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,780
Listen to me. Don't be afraid.

618
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,120
No matter what, I will always love you.

619
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,120
Because Thun is the same Thun.

620
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,680
Right?

621
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,680
You didn't do anything wrong.

622
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,120
Do you believe...

623
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,320
that when you were young, I talk with your dad.

624
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,820
What our child woud be like, what they would like ...

625
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,160
we would accept everything and let you be what he is.

626
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,390
As long as he was happy was enough.

627
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,160
You didn't do anything wrong.

628
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,770
I love you so much, Thun.

629
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,730
Thank you, Mom.

630
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,370
I see...

631
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,220
is this what so stressed you lost your appetite?

632
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,220
Are you sure about this?

633
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:48,270
Thun knows what is and isn't right for me.

634
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,850
Thun doesn't want to lie to myself anymore.

635
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,520
That's good.

636
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,640
You were very brave to tell me.

637
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:05,800
I also want to tell you why...

638
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,950
I understand you, Thun.

639
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,950
I understand you a lot.

640
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,850
Because when I was your age...

641
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,430
I once dated this guy.

642
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,960
999 stars.

643
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:34,960
Every star represents one wish.

644
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,030
Here.

645
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:37,280
Another star.

646
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,680
Go ahead and make a wish for yourself.

647
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,170
Happy early birthday, P'Mes.

648
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,080
When did you have time make all these?

649
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,240
This is another gift.

650
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,300
I'm so lucky to have you.

651
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,300
Hey, don't tease me.

652
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,420
Do you know ho hard it is to
 record this without the DJ's voice?

653
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,510
Thank you, Kwan.

654
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,510
Those are in return for this.

655
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,640
Did you really make a wish for every star in here?

656
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:17,640
Yes.

657
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,640
The last one is for you to wish for yourself.

658
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,480
Can I unfold it?

659
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,640
You can't.

660
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:23,000
<i>It's funny isn't it?</i>

661
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,910
<i>I always wondered why I...</i>

662
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:27,870
<i>felt so close to Thun like that.</i>

663
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,870
<i>But I couldn't think of an answer.</i>

664
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,280
Sometimes, I think...

665
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,850
what mistake did I make in my past life...

666
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,330
that made my life now this complicated?

667
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:46,910
Eh?

668
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:47,880
Hey...

669
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,280
Are you telling me...

670
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,010
that you and...

671
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,420
Yes.

672
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,740
I am Kwan's ex-boyfriend.

673
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,610
- Damn!
 - Gosh!

674
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,530
Do you understand me now?

675
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,400
That's why I don't want to go back to Thun anymore.

676
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,600
<i>It's so strange.</i>

677
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,480
<i>Even though I can't remember anything.</i>

678
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,970
<i>But for someone...</i>

679
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,600
<i>even though it has been 20 years...</i>

680
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,850
<i>I have never forgotten her.</i>

681
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,620
Thun?

682
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,830
Thun, my son.

683
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:46,440
<i>I had been dating Kwan for a while.</i>

684
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,500
<i>Even though I knew that I hiding how I felt inside.</i>

685
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,670
Because I'm the only son...

686
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:55,150
P'Mes

687
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,240
<i>Do you understand what I am facing?</i>

688
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,340
<i>The time we had together was so perfect.</i>

689
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,630
<i>That I had no idea...</i>

690
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,960
<i>that he wasn't really as happy like me.</i>

691
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,010
<i>One day, he told me the truth.</i>

692
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,880
So that is the reason you decided...

693
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:47,560
to come back here?

694
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,560
Regarding Kwan alone,

695
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,860
I don't know how I can forgive myself.

696
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,120
I wronged her so much.

697
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,580
I made her said because I was not clear about myself.

698
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:02,490
And now, what I did to Thun...

699
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,720
is placing him in between Kwan and myself.

700
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,720
I really can't do that.

701
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,520
<i>But, Ai'Mes...</i>

702
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,540
Don't you care how Thun might feel?

703
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,870
Then how should I tell Thun?

704
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,080
Should I tell him...

705
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:31,400
"Thun...

706
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,360
I am your mother's ex-boyfriend."

707
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:36,640
Like that?

708
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,980
<i>Do you believe that when he told me the truth...</i>

709
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,190
I wasn't mad at him or anything.

710
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:50,410
I was glad that he had the courage to be honest with me

711
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:57,600
But I've never forgot about him.

712
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,440
Never really.

713
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,130
Did Dad know about this?

714
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,320
Of course he knew.

715
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,320
Your dad was the one who told me...

716
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,880
"You may have someone else in your heart..."

717
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,250
"But I am the real one for you."

718
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,690
Dad loved you so much, you know?

719
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:19,260
I know.

720
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:24,780
Did you ever meet him again?

721
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:27,710
I didn't.

722
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,500
It is like death split us apart.

723
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,270
Thun...

724
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,390
Fom now on,

725
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:40,380
live your life with happily.

726
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,740
Don't care about others.

727
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,160
I'm OK.

728
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,550
Thank you so much.

729
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:08,000
That's enough, Thun.

730
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,460
Why are you crying so much?

731
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,060
Oh, look at me.

732
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,100
Ah, are you hungry now?

733
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,270
P'Mes.

734
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:25,310
If you are still here...

735
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,000
I want to tell you...

736
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,180
that I miss you.

737
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:22,840
~ Sometimes it feels like you're still here ~

738
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:31,470
~ The beautiful story is still deep inside ~

739
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,140
~ Some old memories ~

740
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:40,460
~ Are still beautiful and never fade ~

741
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:48,030
~ It shines inside every time I think of them ~

742
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:54,170
~ Sometimes I still wonder where you are ~

743
00:53:56,110 --> 00:54:02,030
~ And have you ever thought the same ~

744
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:10,280
~ Remembering the old memories and hoping to repeat them ~

745
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:17,290
~ Good days and nights between you and me ~

746
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:20,460
~ And I am still smiling ~

747
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:24,520
~ Smiling though my tears ~

748
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:31,600
~ The past will never return but I have never regretted ~

749
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:37,560
~ I only remember what I used to have ~

750
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:41,560
~ Sometimes it feels great ~

751
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:47,840
~ Even if it can only be saved as memories ~

752
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:55,770
~ I only want to keep the good memories ~

753
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:03,240
~ Even though now I feel so lonely ~

754
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:12,350
~ Even though there are times I still wonder ~

755
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:20,920
~ Have you ever thought the same ~

756
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:27,630
 ~ Have you ever thought the same ~

757
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:54,460
Sawsadee, Plai.

758
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:16,940
Thun, offer the food.

759
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:17,640
Yes.

760
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:32,160
When you get sick of chocolate, let me know.

761
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,770
Thank you.

762
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:38,010
Eat a lot and gain more weight.

763
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,820
So you will be a chubby ghost.

764
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,440
Put the tray over there.

765
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:04,320
Four measures of growth. 
Life, beauty, happiness, health.

766
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:05,790
- It is well.
 - It is well.

767
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,440
Normally, you don't wake up this early.

768
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,040
What's gotten into you today? You got up and made 
breakfast and then woke me up to offer food to the monk.

769
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:17,630
Well...

770
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,010
I just miss Dad.

771
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:21,400
 So I wanted to do what Dad did.

772
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,670
 If he could see you now, he would be so happy.

773
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,130
Let's go inside.

774
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:30,880
Mom?

775
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,290
Hmm?

776
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,800
Thun thinks I should go talk with Plai.

777
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:38,810
I'll go with you.

778
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:41,660
Let's go.

779
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:43,390
Take that back inside.

780
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,920
Why do I have to remind you?

781
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:14,920
This is Plaifah's house?

782
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,380
Yes.

783
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,920
Are you disappointed?

784
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,920
You can't have a rich daughter-in-law now.

785
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:23,230
Can I change my mind now?

786
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:25,770
Do you want me to go inside with you?

787
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,100
No.

788
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,100
Just this much makes me look like mom's baby boy.

789
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,080
Alright, then I will wait for you here.

790
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:34,000
I'll go in.

791
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:34,510
Sure.

792
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:54,480
Auntie Nom, sawasdee khrap.

793
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,230
Sawasdee ja.

794
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,610
Are you coming to see Plaifah?

795
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:58,240
Yes, khrap.

796
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,360
Is Plaifah home khrap?

797
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:01,480
I haven't seen her come downstairs yet.

798
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,480
Do you want me to tell her that you are here?

799
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:04,620
Umm?

800
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,120
Can I go do that myself khrap?

801
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,070
I want to surprise here khrap.

802
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:11,420
Sure.

803
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,700
Thank you khrap.

804
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:18,880
Grandpa, sawasdee khrap.

805
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,700
Oh, Thun.

806
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,380
You're here for Plaifah?

807
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:22,910
Yes khrap.

808
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:24,120
She is upstairs.

809
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,460
Have you had breakfast yet?

810
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,640
Do you want to join me?

811
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:28,780
I've already ate khrap.

812
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,570
Please excuse me going to go find Plaifah khrap.

813
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:31,720
Make yourself at home.

814
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,440
Thank you khrap.

815
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,320
Sawsadee, Plai.

816
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:46,620
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

817
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:47,680
What's up?

818
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,740
If I told you first, you might not come to see me.

819
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,280
I...

820
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,060
I need to talk to you.

821
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,360
And I also want to apologiz to you.

822
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:10,720
I'm so sorry.

823
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,600
Why do you have to say sorry to me?

824
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:18,600
You didn't do anything wrong?

825
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:21,840
I was wrong.

826
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,620
I was stupid.

827
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,620
You realized that?

828
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:35,790
And I also wanted to apologize...

829
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,560
for making you sad.

830
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,600
I admit that I am really sad.

831
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,880
But I also understand you.

832
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,280
But I want to ask.

833
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:56,640
Why did you kiss me that night?

834
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,630
That's another thing.

835
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:08,060
I don't know why.

836
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,760
I just felt that way.

837
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,000
Actually,

838
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:16,720
I knew from the moment you kissed me...

839
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:18,490
you forced yourself.

840
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,490
 I didn't.

841
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:23,980
It's just...

842
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,880
You are the first girl I have ever kissed.

843
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,230
And you knew it...

844
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,540
that it wasn't right.

845
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:37,390
Something like that.

846
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,120
Oho ~

847
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,800
I should reconsider kissing, Plai.

848
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:41,800
Hey!

849
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:44,590
Your kiss was not bad.

850
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,160
It's just not for me.

851
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:49,340
That's even worse than before.

852
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:53,150
Then...

853
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,430
That means...

854
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,160
you have already kissed a guy?

855
01:01:58,590 --> 01:01:59,020
Huh?

856
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,430
Lawyer, that question is is off point.

857
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:04,910
Hmm?

858
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:06,620
So as a witness, I won't answer the question.

859
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,620
Are you ok now?

860
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:17,440
I will be soon.

861
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,310
I have only rejected others...

862
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,380
but right now I have been rejected...

863
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,010
so it hurts a bit.

864
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:27,100
Thun?

865
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:28,840
Why weren't you honest about this?

866
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,840
I heard it by chance,

867
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:33,740
I will remember that moment forever.

868
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,650
How was I supposed to tell?

869
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:41,560
It was so hard for me.

870
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:46,590
At that time, I couldn't even accept it myself.

871
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:53,640
But I know it now.

872
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,170
I'm happy for you.

873
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,770
For understanding your heart.

874
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,740
Let's be friends like before.

875
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,460
Things have never changed from the beginning.

876
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:14,760
If I remember correctly...

877
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:16,910
you definitely never wanted to touch me.

878
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,600
Plai...

879
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,680
Just kidding.

880
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,470
Are you going anywhere today?

881
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:24,940
No.

882
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:25,480
I'm lazy.

883
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:26,380
What about you?

884
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,360
I have to go to basketball practice.

885
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,320
Hmmm...

886
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:29,820
What time?

887
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,450
Auntie Nom, I'm leaving. Sawasdee khrap.

888
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:32,400
Sawasdee ja.

889
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:39,760
P'Mes.

890
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,500
<i>Thun?</i>

891
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:46,800
Thun!

892
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:48,830
Are you okay?

893
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:50,320
OK.

894
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:52,540
Do you want to meet my mom?

895
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:53,340
She came with me.

896
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:54,450
Oh?

897
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:55,400
You mom came with you?

898
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:55,880
Yes.

899
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:57,030
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

900
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:19,020
Home of Thanarungsiri

901
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,040
<i>You.</i>

902
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:23,700
This is Plaifah

903
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:24,820
Sawasdee kha.

904
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:25,560
Sawasdee ja.

905
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,060
This is my mom.

906
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:29,880
The word "Ter" means "you" but in a polite way.
Men often use "Ter" when speaking to women of the same age or younger.

907
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:29,880
At first when I heard Thun answer his phone "Ter, ter"...

908
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,220
I thought he was talking to his girlfriend.

909
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:34,060
It is me that he has been calling "Ter."

910
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,090
So it makes me feel younger.

911
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,250
Thun always talks about you. 
So I will leave him under your care.

912
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:38,960
Sure.

913
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:40,540
You can just leave Thun at my house.

914
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,040
Huh?

915
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,810
I am not afraid he will rape me now.

916
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:44,220
Plai...

917
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:45,360
Oh...

918
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:46,300
Excuse me...

919
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:48,650
Is your surname Thanarungsiri?

920
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:52,170
Ah, that is my grandfather's last name. 
I am using my dad's last name now.

921
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:53,320
Oh ~

922
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:53,800
OK.

923
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,350
Whenever you are free come have a meal with us.

924
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:56,560
Ok.

925
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,800
Bring Thun with you too.

926
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,990
In that case, I will leave first.

927
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:02,190
Ok, sure. Do as you please.

928
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,100
- Sawasdee kha. 
-  Sawasdee Ja.

929
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:03,680
- Bye bye 
- Bye bye

930
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:04,220
See you.

931
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:08,860
She's cute.

932
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,220
Mom, do you know someone named Thanarungsiri?

933
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:15,400
Yes.

934
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:18,590
Umm... Do you remember that guy I told you about?

935
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:19,700
Here.

936
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:20,840
Look.

937
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:24,110
<i>His last name was also Thanarungsiri. </i>

938
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,110
It maybe that...

939
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:27,660
Plaifah is his relative.

940
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:28,680
What a small world.

941
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:34,780
Thun?

942
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:00,330
What is it, son?

943
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:05,770
That senior's name as Mes, right?

944
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,360
Thun has something to show you.

945
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:46,890
The reason you never say P'Mes after that...

946
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,100
is because P'Mes had passed away.

947
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,160
Don't you want to know who you really are?

948
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:57,880
And how you died?

949
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:00,720
You mean...

950
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,120
I know where you used to live.

951
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,880
The name of the ghost that lives here is P'Mes?

952
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,000
Dude!

953
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:11,690
What should we do, Thun?

954
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:16,380
The only way for us to find the answer...

955
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:19,130
we have to go back to Plaifah's house.

956
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,600
Are you ready, P'?

957
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,600
