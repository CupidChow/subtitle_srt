1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,630
<i>What restaurant is it?</i>

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,970
<i>Why is it so far?</i>

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,520
A little farther and we will be at my house.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,110
When did I say I was taking you to a restaurant?

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,110
Oh...

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,500
You told me to dress nicely.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,790
Then where are you taking me?

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,940
If you knew it wouldn't be exciting.

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,390
Oh, you, can I ask you something?

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:23,790
Yes.

11
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,060
Why have you never come to Chingming with me?

12
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,000
Haven't I told you that I don't like those places already?

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,720
Going to the cementary...

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,720
makes me feel bad.

15
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,410
And when I went home, I always got sick.

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,410
Hey?

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,550
Don't tell me...

18
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,010
Surprise!

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,250
What kind of surprise is this? Not telling me this.

20
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,260
Look here.

21
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,620
He has all the symptoms of being heartbroken.

22
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,580
All he needs is to be crying in the rain.

23
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,940
If he had a chance to do that...

24
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,870
he would have.

25
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,750
For sure.

26
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,430
Hmm...

27
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,180
Maybe it will rain today.

28
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,910
My tape finished playing already.

29
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,800
Ah, Mes...

30
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,600
Hey,

31
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,890
we feel uneasy seeing you like this.

32
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,120
Look at you.

33
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,180
Just leave him be, Angoon.

34
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,100
Once in our lives,

35
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,670
we should learn about being heart broken.

36
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,480
As one of our life experiences.

37
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,390
P'...

38
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,240
<i>Hmm?</i>

39
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,060
Why do we need life experiences if we are already dead?

40
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:04,790
Right.

41
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,340
Oi~

42
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,040
You've been sad for too long.

43
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,250
I don't know how to comfort people.

44
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,800
But Mes is a ghost.

45
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't think we need to comfort Mes anymore.

46
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,230
The one who can comfort him is already here.

47
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,340
What?

48
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,900
Over there.

49
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,750
There. There.

50
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,720
I only see a dog.

51
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,770
Do you remember Grandma's grave?

52
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,800
Grandma's grave is over there.

53
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,920
The one next to it is Dad's.

54
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,340
How could I forget that?

55
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,080
After the funeral,

56
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,420
I never came back here again.

57
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,570
Yes.

58
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,280
So why did you bring me here today?

59
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,540
Thun has something to show you.

60
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,540
Thun is referring to himself in 'third person." As explained last episode.

61
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,140
The reason you never say P'Mes after that...

62
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,380
is because P'Mes had passed away.

63
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,930
And...

64
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,310
this...

65
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,130
And... And this is...

66
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,080
How did you come to know P'Mes?

67
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,670
 Do you remember what Thun told you when I was little...

68
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,740
that I saw something strange?

69
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,600
That time I went to Chingming with Dad.

70
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,680
That was the first time I met P'Mes here.

71
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,210
How did he die?

72
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,700
P'Mes had a heart attack.

73
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,880
But do you know?

74
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,380
The reason P'Mes hasn't reincarnated...

75
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,080
Is because really the cause of his death.

76
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,460
Thun...

77
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,440
brought P'Mes back to live with me.

78
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,850
I don't understand.

79
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,710
You are confusing me, Thun.

80
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,700
It is is complicated.

81
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,580
Let's say...

82
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,130
Thun thinks P'Mes must be around here now.

83
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,500
Thun brought you here to visit P'Mes.

84
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,420
P'Mes.

85
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,760
Hey, Mom?

86
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,390
I told you before...

87
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,150
I don't like to come to cemetaries...

88
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,440
Then I'll go stand over there.

89
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,160
Kwan...

90
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,420
is so sorry for you.

91
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,070
Kwan had no idea that...

92
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,480
that you...

93
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,240
passed away.

94
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,670
<i>It's alright, Kwan.</i>

95
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,290
It's not your fault, Kwan.

96
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,390
I never told you that I had heart disease.

97
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,960
About what Thun said earlier...

98
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,640
I learned that from Thun also.

99
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,890
For a long time I thought that I
 died because of a heart attack.

100
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
But now I don't know what the truth is.

101
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,680
So that is why you've been here all this time?

102
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,750
It wasn't always like this, Kwan.

103
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,240
Thun took me to live with him.

104
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,920
Thun?

105
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,710
Why didn't you tell me?

106
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,860
Don't be mad at Thun, Kwan.

107
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,320
Thun was trying to find out who I really am...

108
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,210
and what happened to me.

109
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,040
What about your relatives?

110
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,620
Your family?

111
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,340
Don't they...

112
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,140
For decades no one has ever come to visit me, Kwan.

113
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:56,990
Then...

114
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,630
Kwan will come.

115
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,550
Kwan will come to see you, P'.

116
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,140
Thank you, Kwan.

117
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,710
Before my time runs out,

118
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,670
I will find out how I died.

119
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,530
Can I help P' with anything?

120
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,830
Thun is trying to help me now.

121
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,640
Kwan...

122
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,350
About that day...

123
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,330
I am sorry.

124
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,700
You don't have to apologize to me.

125
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,650
Kwan has already forgotten about it.

126
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,240
Kwan has already forgave you, P'Mes.

127
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,070
I am glad to hear that.

128
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,400
I am glad...

129
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,500
that at least once in our life...

130
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,930
we got to share good times together.

131
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,660
I shouldn't have died so soon.

132
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,200
I didn't get to attend your wedding, Kwan.

133
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,580
We didn't have a wedding.

134
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,600
After I broke up with you,

135
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,240
well...

136
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,860
Thun's dad came into my life.

137
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,300
Actually, I should thank P'Mes.

138
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,370
Because normally I wouldn't look at a guy with Chinese looks.

139
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,670
What?

140
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,120
Dad heard you say that, you.

141
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,120
The word "Ter" means "you" but in a polite way.

142
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,340
Just let him hear it. I am sure he doesn't mind.

143
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,980
This was why you were afraid of ghosts.

144
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,410
I was, but not anymore.

145
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,660
I would be embarrassed.

146
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,490
Kwan.

147
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,240
If I have reincarnated yet...

148
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,700
we will see each other again, OK?

149
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:26,300
Yes.

150
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,570
Who would have thought the world could be this small?

151
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,970
This was...

152
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,970
the reason you left, right?

153
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,520
I'm sorry, Thun.

154
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,570
I thought this was best decision...

155
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,690
for both of us.

156
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,500
The best, P'?

157
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,680
What about me?

158
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,730
Did you think about how I would feel?

159
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,080
I don't have the heart, Thun.

160
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,360
I can't stop myself from thinking like that...

161
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,570
while knowing you are Kwan's son.

162
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,900
And then there is Plaifah.

163
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,050
This has nothing to do with Plaifah, P'.

164
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,560
There is nothing between me and Plaifah.

165
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,600
How can there be nothing with Plaifah 
and Ai'Thun? When that night Ai'Thun...

166
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,970
I kissed Plaifah?

167
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,380
<i>But if I didn't kiss her...</i>

168
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,370
I wouldn't know who I liked.

169
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,340
Thun, are you sure about this?

170
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,580
Is it because I made you like this?

171
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,660
You are part of it.

172
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,780
But actually it is because of you.

173
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,020
Do you know...

174
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,620
the hardest part of accepting myself...

175
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,980
was telling my mom and friends.

176
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,940
I already overcame that.

177
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,240
Right now, I don't care about anything else but you.

178
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,260
What about Plaifah, Ai'Thun.

179
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,000
I've already talked to Plaifah, P'.

180
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,170
But what is between me and you is not clear yet.

181
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,560
P'Mes khrap.

182
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,200
How do you feel about me?

183
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,840
It is not important how I feel.

184
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,090
Because, in the end, a relationship between us is impossible, Ai'Thun.

185
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,060
It has been impossible from the beginning, P'.

186
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,850
But don't you see the reason that we could be here together?

187
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,360
It is because we have never given up, P'.

188
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,240
Please come back with me.

189
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,440
I don't want to force it anymore.

190
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,780
I don't want to force myself to stay where I shouldn't.

191
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,180
Because I am a spirit...

192
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,180
and you are a human.

193
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,740
Then, at least...

194
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,180
let me keep my promise to you.

195
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,490
Don't you want to know who you really are?

196
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,060
And how you died?

197
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,890
You mean...

198
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,560
I know where you used to live.

199
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,660
Are you ready, P'?

200
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,530
How did you know I was at the cemetery?

201
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,280
Because I'm awesome.

202
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,760
Take it seriously.

203
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:46,760
Well...

204
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,520
Because the electric joss sticks were turned off.

205
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,760
With them off,

206
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,370
the only place you could go was the cemetery.

207
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,960
Since you came back with me...

208
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,680
let me be you guardian once more.

209
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,980
Did you miss this place, P'?

210
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,020
I did. I did live here for a few months.

211
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,440
So...

212
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,940
Did you miss the person who lives here, P'?

213
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,890
Everything is included.

214
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,680
I want to know what is stuck in my heart.

215
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,260
So the relationship between me and you...

216
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,650
is it a problem of your heart?

217
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,380
Don't we need to make an offering to the guardian spirit?

218
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,930
I've already done that, P'.

219
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,220
Now there are only two nosy guardians left.

220
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,450
KhiaoKhiem and Prince?

221
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,500
Umm, P'?

222
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,840
 I have decided...

223
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,160
 to tell them about you.

224
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:21,690
Warning at the bottom "Gambling is illegal. Parents should take care and advise."

225
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,170
So how are things between you and Plaifah?

226
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,700
What about us??

227
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,480
Shouldn't I ask you?

228
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,860
I'm OK.

229
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,690
You...

230
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,850
go ahead and take a chance.

231
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,850
Can someone like Prince even able to flirt with anyone?

232
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,640
 He just knows how to sit and like then from afar.

233
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,730
Do you think you are the second lead in a Korean drama?

234
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,530
There!

235
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,540
You don't have any right?

236
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,930
You laugh like that.

237
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,060
Put it down. Put it down.

238
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,300
You are so stupid.

239
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,010
You have a smart mouth, so take that.

240
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,530
And how could a second lead be as perfect as me?

241
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,780
I will keep going at this speed.

242
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,100
And someday, Plai will realize she can't live without me.

243
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,290
- Hmm...
 - Is that so?

244
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,290
Stop bragging.

245
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,290
It's your turn.

246
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,280
Two of clubs.

247
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,450
<i>Think carefully about it, friend.</i>

248
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,050
That two of clubs...

249
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,490
if you keep it to the end, you will lose twice.

250
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,100
I win.

251
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,820
Damn! What the hell was that?

252
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,000
Again?

253
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,300
This is a game for the brain...

254
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,970
used to trick stupid friends like you.

255
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,450
Does a person with a face like yours use their brain?

256
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,880
If you say you are using magic, I'll believe you.

257
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,090
Yes, I used magic.

258
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,090
Do you want to test it?

259
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:43,730
How?

260
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,000
How about this?

261
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Each of you pick two cards...

262
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,290
and I will guess what you picked.

263
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,620
Are you that good?

264
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,330
Choose.

265
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:07,700
Alright.

266
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,420
Yours are...

267
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,050
The queen of heart...

268
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:12,880
and ten of spades.

269
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,180
The queen of hearts and ten of spades.

270
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,520
Are you sure?

271
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,580
I'm sure.

272
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,680
Damn.

273
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,050
He's right.

274
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,050
As always.

275
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,050
And yours are...

276
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,300
The four of clubs and ten of diamonds.

277
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,740
The four of clubs...

278
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,920
and ten of diamonds.

279
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,170
This is crazy.

280
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,170
Did you really use magic?

281
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,760
Do you remember what I told you that day?

282
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:51,620
What was that?

283
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,700
He lives with a ghost named P'Mes.

284
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,370
He's in the room right now.

285
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,800
Is he sitting next to you?

286
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,800
He is sitting next to you.

287
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,490
Where is he?

288
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,490
If you still don't believe me...

289
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,340
Dude!

290
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,240
Do you see that?

291
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,160
Yes.

292
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,820
Dude...

293
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,820
I see it.

294
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,780
You guys are overreacting.

295
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,700
So that means...

296
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,740
what you told me the other day is true?

297
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,740
Uh..uh..uh P' khrap.

298
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,640
I don't mind if you stay in my friend's room.

299
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,680
But don't show yourself to us.

300
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,170
You have watched too many horror movies.

301
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,260
P'Mes is like a normal person. He looks like a normal person.

302
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,260
Doesn't matter. I don't want to see it.

303
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,850
I really don't.

304
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:03,970
But...

305
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,400
If he can give me some numbers for the lottery...

306
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,600
Then, please?

307
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:10,700
Dude...

308
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,880
That's enough, dude.

309
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,330
Let's go.

310
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:13,850
Where?

311
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,720
I need to poop.

312
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,080
I need to pee, too.

313
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,740
Let's go. Quickly.

314
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,040
Hurry, let's go.

315
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,080
- I'm going.
 - I can't move my legs.

316
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,440
<i>Go. Go.</i>

317
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,740
Why are you in such a rush?

318
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,260
Did you hear that?

319
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,170
They're all gone.

320
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,170
I won it all.

321
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,700
Am I good?

322
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,240
That was funny.

323
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,760
Did you see Ai'KhiaoKhiem's face?

324
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,210
He was freaking shocked!

325
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,010
You are a cheater, too.

326
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,260
I never told you I was a nice person.

327
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,500
Where is my cut?

328
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,500
Your cut?

329
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,500
How much do you want? Tell me.

330
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,800
What can I do with them?

331
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,480
I can't use them.

332
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,780
Then what do you want?

333
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,060
I will get it for you.

334
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,060
Oh... Buffet?

335
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,810
A sweet buffet?

336
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,530
It's already late.

337
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,530
You should go to sleep.

338
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,930
I will sleep like this tonight.

339
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,370
Ok?

340
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,890
If you don't think you will be sore, then it's up to you.

341
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,400
P'Mes.

342
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,730
I won't let you go anywhere else.

343
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,820
One day I will have to leave.

344
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,980
Can we not talk about that now?

345
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,210
Please, P'?

346
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,960
If you are sleepy, you can go to sleep first.

347
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,090
I want to stay like this.

348
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,880
Ever since you brought me back here...

349
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,380
don't you think you are spoiling me too much?

350
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,660
Behaving like you normally are is fine.

351
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,930
Because I know what it's like without you.

352
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,290
I won't let this time pass without making the most of it.

353
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,780
I will do everything I want to do.

354
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,800
Talk to you...

355
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,930
Look at you...

356
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,490
Looking at what?

357
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,100
Okay.

358
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Okay, I won't look anymore.

359
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,320
I'm not staring anymore.

360
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,320
I'm not looking.

361
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,240
I'm sleeping.

362
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,820
We need to wake early tomorrow.

363
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,500
Why do we need to wake up early?

364
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,700
We will go to Plaifah's house.

365
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,700
Plaifah's house?

366
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,050
The house of Thanarungsiri.

367
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,170
Are you ready, P'?

368
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,490
You wait here then.

369
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,460
I will go ahead.

370
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,100
Auntie Nom, Sawasdee khrap.

371
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,060
Oh, sawasdee ja.

372
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,060
Are you here to see Plaifah?

373
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,730
Yes, khrap.

374
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,330
Khao Lam is sticky rice mixed with sugar, sweet red beans & coconut cream stuffed into cylinders of hollow bamboo.

375
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,330
I visited the countryside and brought her some Khoa Lam.

376
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,490
Go ahead. She's in her room.

377
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,460
Thank you, khrap.

378
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,760
Where are you?

379
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,800
Here, Khoa Lam.

380
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,880
I brought it for you.

381
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,740
This is why you came to see me?

382
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,340
To bring me Khoa Lam?

383
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,540
Yes.

384
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,220
Just get to the point.

385
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,540
A person like you...

386
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,370
nevers gives you anything for free.

387
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,370
And now you are bringing me Khao Lam.

388
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,370
What do you want? Say it.

389
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,570
Can't you see my good side?

390
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,140
I just wanted to see you.

391
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,640
Hmm...

392
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,340
Why?

393
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,320
Change your mind?

394
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,860
Isn't it too late?

395
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:28,530
Hmm?

396
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,620
You are really not mad at me anymore, right?

397
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,010
Hmm?

398
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,810
Your face without makeup...

399
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,100
kind of bad.

400
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,800
That's some mouth you got.

401
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,370
I've never been to your room before.

402
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,250
Your house is so big, like a house in a series.

403
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,160
Why?

404
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,160
Are you disappointed you won't be able to marry me?

405
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:05,040
The inheritance of an only granddaughter.

406
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,040
Just think about it.

407
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,000
Ahh... you will live comfortably Ai'Prince.

408
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,530
What?

409
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,530
What about Ai'Prince?

410
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,100
Just kidding.

411
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,730
Hey, you.

412
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,800
Can I ask you something?

413
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,330
Your house is so big and just a few of you live here.

414
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,580
Yeah...

415
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,840
It's been that way since I was a little.

416
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,000
I don't have many relatives.

417
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,370
There is only my mom that is in America,

418
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,300
and my grandfather.

419
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,240
Do you have any relatives named Mes?

420
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,240
Mes?

421
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,860
I don't thinks so.

422
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,580
Why?

423
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,940
Oh...

424
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,880
My mom wanted me to ask because you 
have the same last name as her friend.

425
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,130
Hmm...

426
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,250
As far as I know, there's not any.

427
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,410
I used to wonder...

428
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,480
why I don't have any other relatives.

429
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,260
I even asked Grandpa about it.

430
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,090
What did you grandpa say?

431
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,740
Why do you want to know that much?

432
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,860
There aren't any.

433
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,170
There is just me,

434
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,500
Grandpa, and Auntie Nom.

435
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,610
Is Auntie Nom your relative?

436
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,960
No.

437
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,960
She is a maid.

438
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,960
She has been taking care of me since I was little.

439
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,650
But she loves me like her daughter.

440
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,650
I remember that one time...

441
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,130
My grandpa hit me...

442
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,130
because I went to play in the wood room.

443
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:30,860
But she said if he hit me...

444
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,300
she would quit her job.

445
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,690
How that? That's love.

446
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,050
Wood room?

447
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,180
Yes.

448
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,460
Didn't you see it downstairs? You passed it on the way here.

449
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,380
There is a room behind the cabinet

450
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,640
That is a secret room.

451
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,450
A secret room?

452
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,660
Like in Harry Potter?

453
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,320
Something like that.

454
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,760
Actually it is just an empty room.

455
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,760
I don't understand why he won't let anyone inside.

456
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,570
He won't even let me go inside.

457
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,570
He said that there are snakes in there.

458
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,420
I was so scared I never tried after that.

459
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,420
Then what is in there?

460
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,420
I don't know either.

461
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,050
It just seemed like a normal room.

462
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,500
There are lots of empty rooms in this house.

463
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,240
I can't remember.

464
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,000
What's up with you?

465
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,570
You seem strange.

466
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,580
Nothing.

467
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,240
Stay here.

468
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,570
I'll be back. Going to take a shower.

469
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,090
What are you doing?

470
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,480
Nothing.

471
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,160
I was looking for the bathroom khrap.

472
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,340
Where is the bathroom khrap?

473
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,200
It is that way.

474
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,970
Okay, khrap.

475
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,080
What are you looking for?

476
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,080
Oh, nothing khrap.

477
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,900
You're not going to the bathroom?

478
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,920
I'm all done khrap.

479
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,040
Auntie...

480
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,890
This house is so big, it must be tiring to clean it alone khrap.

481
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,530
I'm going back home now khrap.

482
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,220
Sawasdee khrap.

483
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,210
What should we do next, Ai'Thun?

484
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,760
The only way we can know the answer...

485
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,690
is to go back to Plaifah's house again.

486
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,360
<i>Here's your after meal medication, sir</i>

487
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,660
Is Plai awake?

488
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,900
She is.

489
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,460
Thun came to see her this morning.

490
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,410
Oh...

491
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,210
Then let's invite him to join us for breakfast.

492
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,500
He already gone back.

493
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,860
Good morning, Grandpa.

494
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,360
Where did you get Khao Lam from?

495
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,360
Oh, Thun brought them for me.

496
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,500
And where is Thun? I thought he would be here.

497
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,620
He already went back.

498
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,490
Oh, he really went home.

499
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,580
 Do you want some? I will prepare it for you.

500
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,020
I can't eat it.

501
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,610
It has coconut milk. The doctor restricted coconut milk.

502
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,570
Okay, kha.

503
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,300
You woke up so early. Where are you going?

504
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,410
I'm going to the club.

505
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,410
They want to talk about...

506
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,640
the big charity event they are arranging next week.

507
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,290
Do you want to go?

508
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,370
No, I don't.

509
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,920
It is boring and hot, Grandpa.

510
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,540
I prefer to stay at home.

511
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,160
Alright, up to you.

512
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,520
Please eat.

513
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,250
It is Kang Liang soup and...

514
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,900
brown rice.

515
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,720
All of your favorites.

516
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,580
Thank you, Auntie Nom.

517
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,290
- Oh, please eat.
 Oh, Grandpa.

518
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,890
Can I ask you something?

519
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,380
Do we have any realtives named Mes?

520
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,580
What do you ask?

521
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,580
Oh, this morning...

522
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,580
Thun asked...

523
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,360
because his mother...

524
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,140
used to have a friend with our last name.

525
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,140
Oh...

526
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,500
There are a lot of people with the same name.

527
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,280
I thought so, too.

528
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,880
Let's eat, Grandpa.

529
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,020
Then...

530
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,680
I am going to warm this up, it's gotten cold.

531
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,620
Okay.

532
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,980
Eat up, Grandpa.

533
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,540
Umm, P'...

534
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,220
I have something to show you.

535
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,380
I found this photo in Plaifah's house.

536
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,650
It's true I really lived there.

537
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160
These people...

538
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,450
Do you remember, P'?

539
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,570
I remember this little girl.

540
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,900
Who is she, P'?

541
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,290
The girl is my cousin.

542
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,420
Her name is Roong.

543
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,940
One day Roong got married and had a child.

544
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,440
Roong brought her daughter to me to name her.

545
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,080
I named her daughter...

546
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,210
Plaifah.

547
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,880
Plaifah?

548
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,490
I am Plaifah's uncle.

549
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,770
That is why I felt strange the first time that I met her.

550
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,360
You are her uncle?

551
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,240
What should we do next, Ai'Thun?

552
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,770
The only way we can find out the answer...

553
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,620
is to go back to Plaifah's house again.

554
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,130
We are close to the truth now, P'.

555
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,480
Are you happy?

556
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,980
What are you thinking, Thun?

557
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,860
I'm afraid, P'.

558
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,920
I am afraid I might fail at this again.

559
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,680
I'm afraid I might disappoint you again, P'.

560
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,130
I'm afraid...

561
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,940
that I might not be able to keep my promise to you.

562
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,210
We have to have hope, Ai'Thun.

563
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,120
No one is as desperate as me.

564
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,120
But I am not afraid anymore.

565
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,530
I know you have tried your best.

566
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,050
But we have to fight together.

567
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,240
Fighting, P'.

568
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,660
For as long as we can.

569
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,280
In that case...

570
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,980
we need a team this time.

571
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,720
<i>You are telling me that....</i>

572
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,240
the reason invited P'Mes to live with you...

573
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,240
is because you want to help him get reincarnated

574
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,940
And for him to be reincarnated...

575
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,650
he has to know how he died.

576
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,060
So we need to take him to Plaifah's house to restore his memories.

577
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,680
Right.

578
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,060
How can can we be sure...

579
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,410
that you aren't lying to us like that time at the library?

580
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,560
I can swear that

581
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,360
I am not hiding anything from you this time.

582
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,240
How about this?

583
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,240
Do you want to see P'Mes's face?

584
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,370
Here...

585
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,180
This guy is...

586
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,050
P'Mes.

587
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,440
Look at this so you know who you are helping.

588
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,640
And this is Plaifah.

589
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,490
Shit...

590
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,740
She's so cute.

591
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,500
Is this the right time?

592
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,500
This is...

593
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,880
Grandpa. You still remember him, right?

594
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,700
The rest are all relatives,

595
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,130
The have already died.

596
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,520
I found this photo folded in the frame

597
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,960
It's like they don't want anyone to know about him.

598
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,520
Don't you find that strange?

599
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,250
Fine.

600
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,610
I believe you.

601
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,610
How can we help? Lay it out.

602
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,610
KhiaoKhiem and I will...

603
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,960
take P'Mes to Plaifah's house.

604
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,160
Why are both of you here?

605
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,450
I forgot my Law book in Plaifah's room khrap.

606
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,780
It is very important since it is exam week khrap.

607
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,210
Can I go in and find it khrap?

608
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,580
<i>Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.</i>

609
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,580
But it is term break right now.

610
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,530
You're right.

611
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,840
Let's start over.

612
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,880
Why are both of you here?

613
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,050
The other day, I think I dropped
 a necklace in Plaifah's room khrap.

614
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,050
The necklace is very important khrap.

615
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,400
It belongs to his mother khrap.

616
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,380
Yes khap

617
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,900
I have to give it back to my mom khrap.

618
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,320
Can I go in and find it khrap?

619
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,680
Alright. Follow me.

620
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,100
Oh! What about me?

621
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,460
You have to take Plaifah out of the house.

622
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,700
Why does it have to be me?

623
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,850
Hey, damn it, Ai'Prince.

624
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,440
Do you want to switch with me?

625
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,180
No.

626
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,720
Wherever Plaifah is, I must be there.

627
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,100
Good.

628
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,260
In that case,

629
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,580
your mission is...

630
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,130
to get Plaifah out of the house.

631
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,620
And keep her with you as long as you can.

632
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,220
Hello, what's up?

633
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,060
Can you come out to meet me?

634
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,680
I have something to say to you.

635
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,760
<i>Then...</i>

636
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,170
<i>what if Plaifah refuses?</i>

637
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,960
I'm not good at lying like you two.

638
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:40,680
Bastard!

639
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,240
Can you not interrupt me for a moment?

640
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:42,980
How about this?

641
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,700
You tell Plaifah you are ill.

642
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,720
Seriously ill.

643
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,320
What's wrong?

644
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,770
Well... ny stomach hurts.

645
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:54,210
<i>Can you take me to the hospital?</i>

646
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,880
Ohh... It hurts so bad, Plai.

647
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,880
OK, OK, OK, sure.

648
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,260
Then...

649
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,450
your job is to keep Plaifah away for as long as you can.

650
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,450
I'll keep you updated by messaging you on Line.

651
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,460
Alright.

652
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,780
This is a walk in the park.

653
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,560
Oh...

654
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:16,940
Yes khrap?

655
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,940
Do you remember where you left it?

656
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,090
Where did you leave it?

657
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,250
I left it upstairs khrap.

658
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,260
Eh... Where did I leave it? I can't find it.

659
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,570
I can't remember.

660
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,770
Umm..

661
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:57,650
Auntie Nom khrap.

662
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:58,640
Umm...

663
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,970
If you something else to do, you can go do it khrap.

664
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,620
We don't want to bother you khrap.

665
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,690
What's next?

666
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:17,970
P'Mes? Where is P'Mes?

667
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:18,490
P'Mes?

668
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,300
How could I know? I can't see P'Mes like you do.

669
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,180
Damn it!

670
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,820
I forgot P'Mes can't come inside.

671
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,570
What should we do?

672
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,450
That room I showed you earlier on the way here.

673
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:40,540
Do you remember?

674
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,170
Behind the cupboard. The room behind the cupboard.

675
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,080
I do.

676
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,930
Find a way to get in that room.

677
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,250
And we will meet in the room.

678
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,320
I will go get P'Mes.

679
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,570
Okay.

680
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,080
P'Mes.

681
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,890
How are you?

682
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,260
It is bad.

683
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,100
So where are Thun and Ai'Khiem?

684
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:10,660
Ai'...

685
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,140
Ai'Thun already went back home.

686
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,580
And Ai'Khiem...

687
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,580
went to buy something.

688
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:18,720
Is that so?

689
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,540
Yes.

690
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,800
What kind of pain are you in?

691
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,440
Well... it hurts a lot.

692
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,800
It keeps changing.

693
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,540
Plai, what if it is something bad? Auntie

694
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,540
I have never hurt like this before.

695
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,400
I don't know either, but...

696
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,800
Give me your ID card, I will go check you in.

697
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,600
Wait here.

698
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,520
Send the message.

699
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:16,860
P'Mes!

700
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,860
Why didn't out call me if you couldn't get in the house?

701
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,540
I thought this was Plan B.

702
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,620
There's no Plan B.

703
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,140
I just totally forgot about it.

704
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,540
Wait here for Sec, P'.

705
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,290
Why did they have deliver a package right now?

706
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,200
Package for Khun Plaifah khrap.

707
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,020
Please sign here.

708
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,050
Ai'Khiao...

709
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,120
Ai'Khiaokhiem, hurry back to Plaifah's 
room. Auntie Nom is going there.

710
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:19,570
Shit!

711
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:11,330
I knew it.

712
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,050
What are you all up to?

713
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:14,380
Let me see it.

714
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:15,770
Give it to me.

715
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,690
It's not what you think khrap.

716
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,100
Where's Thun?

717
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,160
The bathroom khrap.

718
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,570
He's in the bathroom khrap.

719
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,360
What did the doctor say?

720
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,130
He said...

721
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,780
It is probably gastritis.

722
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:11,570
See.

723
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,700
You should eat on time.

724
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,700
Yes, Ma'am.

725
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:18,500
Are you feeling any better?

726
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,240
Well, it still hurts a bit.

727
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,700
Take some medicine.

728
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,320
 Take medicine? Yeah, that's right.

729
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,400
Give it here.

730
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,290
It's alright.

731
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,170
I can take it myself.

732
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,140
Then...

733
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,140
I will get you some water.

734
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:38,340
Just wait here.

735
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:38,880
Okay.

736
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,970
I knew it.

737
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:01,610
You guys...

738
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,260
What are you all up to?

739
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,600
Let me see it.

740
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,240
It's nothing.

741
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:07,820
Let me see.

742
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:10,840
If you plead guilty now...

743
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,730
your punishment will be reduced.

744
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,200
Decided.

745
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,260
Let me see.

746
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,320
I said let me see it.

747
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:25,520
Enter the house?

748
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,520
What is this about?

749
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,260
What is this?

750
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,640
Are you guys planning to sneak into my house?

751
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,780
I was just helping him out.

752
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,250
Help how?

753
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,250
You owe me an explanation.

754
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:48,980
Oh... Ai'Thun, I'm sorry.

755
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,440
Can you get in?

756
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,000
It's locked.

757
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:04,890
I think this is our room, P'.

758
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,100
You can go inside first.

759
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,210
What should we do next?

760
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:33,920
Try open it.

761
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,700
What is that?

762
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,810
A universal key.

763
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,130
Where did you get it?

764
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,610
My neighbor gave it to me.

765
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,320
Who is that?

766
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,540
Why is it so hard?

767
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:50,810
Can you go faster?

768
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,570
- What if Auntie Nom comes?
- I need to concentrate so calm down.

769
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:00,040
Hello kha?

770
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,570
Is it unlocked yet?

771
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:05,940
Ai'Thun, give me a minute.

772
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,800
What's that?

773
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,400
OK.

774
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:29,370
- Hey.
 - Hey.

775
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,340
P'Mes.

776
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:00,780
P'Mes?

777
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,780
P'Mes!

778
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,600
Can you remember now, P'?

779
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,290
This is my room.

780
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:16,580
I lived here.

781
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,400
And I died here.

782
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,400
What now, P'?

783
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,080
What did you see?

784
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:26,650
What else was there, P'?

785
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:30,690
 It's the same, Ai'Thun.

786
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:33,140
It's the same.

787
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:35,560
Everything is just like my dream.

788
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,800
I don't want to know anymore.

789
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,140
P', but we have come this far!

790
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,650
 I don't want to see myself die repeatedly
 for a hundred times, Ai'Thun.

791
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,160
 I can't take this anymore.

792
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,160
Ai'Thun...

793
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,940
If you're going to do anything, do it quickly. 
I can hear Auntie Nom coming.

794
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:56,090
Hang in there a bit more, P'.

795
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,420
P'!

796
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,650
This is as far as I can help you.

797
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,920
You have to remember...

798
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,860
what happened that day!

799
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,660
You felt pain in your chest.

800
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,730
Then what happened?

801
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:33,660
I tried to find my medicine.

802
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,100
But I couldn't find it.

803
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,600
The pain was getting worse.

804
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,460
I't was like a bubble growing in my chest.

805
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,620
Finally I couldn't stand it...

806
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:45,840
 and I fell to the floor.

807
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:53,480
No.

808
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:54,880
That's not what happened.

809
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,700
There has to be something more to it.

810
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:58,700
Yes...

811
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,380
After that I saw...

812
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,740
I feel regret for wasting time.

813
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,520
You should have told me earlier.

814
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,500
The time we have left...

815
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,060
it is priceless to me.

816
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,130
~ I will remember you like this ~

817
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:44,420
~ Remember this feeling ~

818
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:47,680
~ Keep it in my heart when we are apart ~

819
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,520
When I was young...

820
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:50,200
I would always wake up early for the day I got to go to Chingming. I wanted to get there as soon as possible.

821
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:54,490
~ I will look at you for the last time ~

822
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:56,050
Because I knew I would get to meet you.

823
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,650
~ I will remember everything ~

824
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:03,170
~ And I will keep this heart for only you ~

825
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,040
~ I promise ~

826
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,040
