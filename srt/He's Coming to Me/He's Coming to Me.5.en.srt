1
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:20,960
P'Mes!

2
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,800
Are you ok?

3
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:31,980
P'!

4
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,960
Nevermind. I'm fine.

5
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,060
Strange.

6
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,850
I can't remember anything.

7
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,920
If I really once lived here,

8
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,920
I should be able to remember something.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,920
But...

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,890
this address is the address we
 got from the hospital is here, P'.

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,800
But now it has become an abandoned house.

12
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,000
Then how about this, P'.

13
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,040
You wait here.

14
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,490
And I will go ask someone around here.

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,490
<i>Auntie, Auntie.</i>

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,490
Yes, boy?

17
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,490
May I ask you a question?

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,670
Do you know anything about this house?

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,860
This house

20
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,860
was abandoned a long time ago.

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,060
So...

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,060
did you know the previous owner?

23
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,670
Both of them are already dead.

24
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,110
But since they died,

25
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,490
no one has lived here for 20 years.

26
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,040
But I heard...

27
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,040
it is worth more than 10 million.

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,640
And they didn't have any relatives?

29
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,860
I don't know.

30
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,220
The son...

31
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,220
must have went to live with thier relatives.

32
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,420
Son?

33
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,420
What was their son's name, Auntie?

34
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,640
His name...

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,180
What was his name?

36
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:54,970
- Mes.
- Mes.

37
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,350
Yes.

38
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,440
His name was Mes.

39
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,200
P'Mes.

40
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,700
P'Mes.

41
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,870
I thought you would be here.

42
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,470
Is there  something you want from me?

43
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,650
I can't sleep.

44
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,520
So I decided to come out to talk to you...

45
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,090
but I couldn't find you.

46
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,120
You normally are already asleep by 8 or 9, right?

47
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,710
I've been thinking about you.

48
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,830
<i>P'Mes... </i>

49
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,290
who exactly are you?

50
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,440
Why is it so hard to find information about you?

51
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,240
Right.

52
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,400
Even though we know where I studied,

53
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,870
know where I used to live...

54
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,650
But somehow we turn out knowing nothing.

55
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,160
But at least we know that your
 name is Wongsakorn.

56
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,490
Sometimes I feel like...

57
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,970
maybe I was a nobody even when I was alive.

58
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,900
It is sad just thinking about it.

59
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,880
Even though you are no longer alive...

60
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,360
but you are still someone to me.

61
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,600
Don't give up, P'.

62
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,440
I will help you no matter what, P'.

63
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,910
I made a promise to you,

64
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,840
Thank you for trying to keep your promise, Thun.

65
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,260
Just this much is enough for me.

66
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,010
P'Mes.

67
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,030
This afternoon what was wrong with you?

68
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,080
I don't think you looked okay.

69
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,210
It was like you were about to disappear.

70
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,730
A spirit who breaks the rules...

71
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,360
the more power we use,

72
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,160
the weaker our body becomes.

73
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,800
It might be a sign...

74
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,020
I am not human...

75
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,670
And I should stop forcing myself to do things.

76
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,910
I don't want you to disappear.

77
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,140
In the end, we all have to leave each other.

78
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,820
One day I will be reincarnated.

79
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,840
One day, I will disappear.

80
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,300
Then you should be more careful with your body.

81
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,390
I won't let you go anyhwere.

82
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,740
Thun...

83
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,290
My time is running out.

84
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,720
Let me do what I want to do.

85
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,800
Because there maybe no tomorrow for me.

86
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,280
No.

87
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,040
It  must not be today.

88
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,540
It must not be tomorrow.

89
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,360
It must not happen at all.

90
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,650
If this was really my last day,

91
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,040
I would like you to know...

92
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,980
that I am glad to have met you, Thun.

93
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,470
Don't make that kind of face.

94
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,400
Just being in a graveyard for 20 years is sad enough for me.

95
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,970
Tomorrow will be your birthday.

96
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:44,970
That's right.

97
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,480
It probably almost midnight.

98
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,990
Just one more minute.

99
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,670
Thun have you ever heard...

100
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,720
that if...

101
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,680
<i>wish upon a star...</i>

102
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,360
that wish will come true?

103
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,630
Maybe you can try.

104
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,840
P'Mes...

105
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,010
My birthday this year,

106
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,280
I will never forget...

107
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,920
that you were were with me.

108
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,830
Can you sing Happy Birthday to me?

109
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,750
Happy birthday to you ~

110
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,890
 Happy birthday to you ~

111
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,030
Happy birthday, Happy birthday ~

112
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,680
Happy birthday to you ~

113
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,330
What did you wish for, Thun?

114
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,320
Oh...

115
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,480
Here.

116
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,200
Happy Birthday.

117
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,550
This is your gift.

118
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,520
I could only find this to cook in this room.

119
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,950
Thank you.

120
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,090
But next time you know you 
can't use your power like this?

121
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,220
Yes, I know.

122
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,430
Stop complaining.

123
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,630
I just wanted to do this for you.

124
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,990
It's cute.

125
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,100
Just eat it, don't play with it.

126
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,410
Oh, P'Mes...

127
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,410
Let's go travelling today.

128
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,170
Where are we going? I don't want to.

129
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,170
Didn't you say you don't want me to us much power?

130
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,170
Please?

131
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,000
Today I will allow you to use your power.

132
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,570
It's my birthday.

133
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,800
Do this for me.

134
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
We are here, P'.

135
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,840
~ It's not difficult to see the signs and know ~

136
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,630
Where are we going?

137
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,930
You will see.

138
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,990
~ That for a long time her heart was for you ~

139
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,160
~ It's not difficult to guess that she ~

140
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,770
Do you want to rid a duck boat with me?

141
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,770
~ Wants to love you seriously ~

142
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,400
No.

143
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,670
I'm lazy.

144
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,320
~ Don't pretend to torture her ~

145
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,770
Are you for real? You are taking
 advantage of me here.

146
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,360
~ Don't pretend to make her sad ~

147
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,170
Why?

148
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,530
~ Don't pretend to bild a wall to obstruct it ~

149
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,080
Why should you complain because of this? You are an athlete.

150
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,970
That's true, but I can feel tired, too.

151
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,970
~ It will be more complicated ~

152
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,330
~ But my heart is not ready yet ~

153
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,340
P'Mes.

154
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,000
Hmm?

155
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,600
~ Not ready to have anyone ~

156
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,700
Do you want to ride a bicycle?

157
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,720
No.

158
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,780
I don't know how.

159
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,210
~ My mind and heart needs time ~

160
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,160
Oh?

161
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,930
I can teach you.

162
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:40,830
No.

163
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,360
~ Just a little longer to know each other ~

164
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,080
I'm lazy

165
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,180
Hey, try to balance it.

166
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,040
Umm...

167
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,490
~ Tomorrow I will go with you ~

168
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,000
Try to balance yourself.

169
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,170
There, balance yourself.

170
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,880
Like that. Slowly. Slowly.

171
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:52,400
~ If you can be the same person for a long time ~

172
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,260
Don't forget to move your legs.

173
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,250
Like that. Faster.

174
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,410
Don't go to fast.

175
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,480
~ Don't abandon each other that care for each other ~

176
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,740
There. You almost got it.

177
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,400
Faster. Faster.

178
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,000
~ Like I do when I love someone ~

179
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,960
I'm going to let go now.

180
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,880
~ Tomorrow I will go with you ~

181
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,050
~If you still understand ~

182
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,060
What is it?

183
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,090
I was just looking, there was nothing.

184
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,650
Here.

185
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:19,200
~ Tomorrow I will bring my heart and go with you ~

186
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,790
Tada ~

187
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,280
There you go.

188
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,800
Oh, hey.

189
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,100
You didn't know how to ride a bicycle?

190
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,680
You hadn't ridden in a duck boat.

191
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,480
And you don't know how to cook.

192
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,150
What did you do while you were alive?

193
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,150
Probably nothing like this.

194
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,510
Like you were a rich kid?

195
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,510
Absolutely.

196
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,080
Hey!

197
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,150
In one more year we will be the same age.

198
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,880
Wait.

199
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,020
Is that so?

200
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,730
Yes it is.

201
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,740
Because I was 22 years old when I died.

202
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,740
Why would I grow older after I died?

203
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,990
Could that be?

204
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,960
Then...

205
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,380
from 1997 to now is...

206
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:56,960
Doesn't count!

207
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,030
That is advantage of being a ghost,

208
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,500
I will always stay at this age.

209
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,650
No more, no less.

210
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,760
Is that so, Uncle Mes?

211
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,850
Uncle Mes.

212
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,080
Let's eat.

213
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,500
Looks like uncle must be hungry. 
Like Uncle hasn't eaten 20 years.

214
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,240
Just kidding.

215
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,690
I am going to go throw this away, P'.

216
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,610
P'Mes.

217
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,640
Let's try something.

218
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,130
Are you ready, P'?

219
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,560
One. Two. Three. Start.

220
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,660
Follow me. Follow me.

221
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,440
That's it. Move slowly.

222
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,050
Like a number eight.

223
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,140
Why are we doing this?

224
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,550
It is beautiful.

225
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,180
I am enjoy watching.

226
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,850
That's it. Move it like the number eight.

227
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,080
With a plastic bag?

228
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,650
It is filled with air so it's as pretty 
as a kite or something like that.

229
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,660
Hmm?

230
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,610
Turn around! Turn around! Turn around! Turn around!

231
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,680
That's it.

232
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,150
What's wrong with him?

233
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,450
He is probably crazy.

234
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,150
Let's get out of here.

235
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:25,870
That's it.

236
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,010
P'Mes.

237
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,060
I know now...

238
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,720
how it feels when people see me talking to myself.

239
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,040
You like to tease people.

240
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,490
Because I love to see you happy and smiling.

241
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,280
Don't forget to come help with 
the student council's work, alright?

242
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,280
Damn, why did you 
remind me so early?

243
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,280
I booked the table already
 with your name, Thun.

244
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,000
<i>I'm tired.</i>

245
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,880
Oh, P'...

246
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,680
Come to my birthday party tonight.

247
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,300
I'm just going to a birthday party.

248
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,510
I don't think we need to buy new clothes.

249
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,580
It is my birthday, P'.

250
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,160
You should dress up nicely.

251
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,320
Why do I have to look nice? No one can see me.

252
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,400
When he's smiling or whatever he's doing ~

253
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,260
Even though others can't see you...

254
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,400
but I do.

255
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,760
~ Whether laughing or talking ~

256
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,320
Let's go.

257
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:33,290
~ It makes me look at you and not want to look at anyone else ~

258
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:25,320


259
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,760
I think this color suits you.

260
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,330
~ No need to be shy, no need

261
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,720
~ Just be yourself as you are ~

262
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,120
~ I am here and I just keep looking at you ~

263
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,020
Try it on, P'.

264
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,280
~ I just want to look at you ~

265
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,080
~ Just looking at you is enough ~

266
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:09,550
~ I'm not asking for anything more ~

267
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,400
~ Not planning to bother you ~

268
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,170
~ I just want to look at you ~

269
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,840
~ That won't be a problem for you? ~

270
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,720
How about this one?

271
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,230
~ Looking at for you for a long time ~

272
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,180
Umm... very handsome, P'.

273
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,040
You like it, right?

274
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,670
~ Can make me happy ~

275
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,620
Shall we go now?

276
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,620
Don't we have to pay for it first?

277
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:42,830
~ Looking at you for a long time ~

278
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,950
~  Meeting like this who wouldn't fall in love is crazy ~

279
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,580
~ If you don't missed, your brain is not that good ~

280
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,780
~ If you don't love this best person ~

281
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,130
If it wasn't his birthday, I would
 definitely not dress up like this.

282
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:27,960
It's so embarrassing.

283
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,420
Are you? Are you?

284
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,120
Are you embarrassed?

285
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,480
Look at my outfit first!

286
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,020
If there was a bottle of red soda, it would be perfect.

287
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,020
Khiem is dressed as Kuman Thong. People normally offer red soda to Kuman Thong.

288
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,510
Come on.

289
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,510
It's his birthday so deal with it.

290
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,350
What the heck?

291
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,400
There are a lot of members in Avengers.
 Like Ironman. Don't you know him?

292
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,850
Boom! It's freaking cool.

293
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,740
Instead he picked a ghost theme?

294
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:51,020
But even though it's a ghost theme, I still look handsome.

295
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,280
Right.

296
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,280
That means it's not because of the theme.

297
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,070
Hey ~

298
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,600
You both are on the same side.

299
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,960
On the same side. Wait a moment.

300
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,800
Let me call the birthday boy first.

301
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Here, Ironman.

302
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,820
Thun, where are you?

303
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,510
It is embarrassing standing in front of the club.

304
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,880
Hurry up, will you?

305
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,250
Yes, come quick.

306
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,440
Oh? hey!

307
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,740
Wait for me!

308
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,030
<i>Thank you!</i>

309
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,960
<i>So are you drunk yet?</i>

310
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,280
Not yet!

311
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,680
No, who is drunk? None.

312
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,080
Hey! Thun is here.

313
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,080
oh, damn it, Thun.

314
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,840
Are you late because you spent time finding that outfit?

315
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,340
<i>Wearing a ghost costume like that,
 how can you walk like normal?</i>

316
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,080
You should walk like a ghost.

317
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,480
How?

318
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,190
Like this.

319
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:44,560
This?

320
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,210
Yes!

321
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,520
Like this? Like this?

322
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,600
Why don't you just poke me in the face?

323
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,520
Or like this?

324
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,620
Take a seat quickly.

325
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,430
Cam so late but making a fuss.

326
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,610
Yes. Come. Come. Come.

327
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,470
Today is our beloved friend, Thun's birthday.

328
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,300
Cheers!

329
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,850
- Cheers!
 - Empty it.

330
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,570
Don't rush.

331
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,930
Take it easy. I can't keep up with you all.

332
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,650
Hey!

333
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,780
Drink first, be drunk first. We will pay just the same.

334
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,300
This damn Ai'Prince already calculated
 this. You think I didn't know?

335
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,710
You're so...

336
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,510
right!

337
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,280
- Of course.
 - Of course.

338
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,150
~ Eye to eye with here ~

339
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,700
~ The encounter face to face this time ~

340
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,490
~ My heart is fussy ~

341
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,520
~ It's fussy that I don't know where to go ~

342
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,560
~ In the night that the sky sparkles ~

343
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,080
~ Where the stars are bright ~

344
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,850
~ Please tell me that you are having fun ~

345
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,440
~ Still don't want for the morning to come ~

346
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,440
I have an idea.

347
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,000
Huh?

348
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,500
Let's play a game, guys.

349
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,500
Bring it on.

350
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,660
I'm not scared.

351
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,940
 Come.

352
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,930
Truth or Dare.

353
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,790
At this point, there's no more "truth" than this.

354
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,640
That's a good pronunciation.

355
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,960
Come friends.

356
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,770
That figures.

357
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,560
What is it? Just tell me.

358
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,570
Truth or dare?

359
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,910
A dare of course.

360
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:29,880
That's great.

361
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,060
Dance for one song.

362
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,000
Dance?

363
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,820
On the chair.

364
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,930
On the chair, too?

365
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,330
P', play music please!

366
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,520
Next it will be Ai'Prince's turn, for sure.

367
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,480
Ah, let's see.

368
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,040
Oho, as I expected!

369
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,330
You got lucky!

370
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,620
What will you choose?

371
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,190
Umm.., I choose...

372
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,950
Dare!

373
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,830
Come.

374
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,700
Let me dare him for this one.

375
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,790
Go for it, Plai!

376
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,860
Khun Prince.

377
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,790
Yes.

378
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,040
If you could choose one of us to kiss...

379
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,630
Who would you kiss?

380
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,610
I'm not going to kiss.

381
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,120
Wow, bottoms up.

382
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,870
 The whole glass.

383
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,720
Bottoms up like that, let me kiss you once!

384
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,720
NO!

385
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,010
That's enough

386
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,070
Next!

387
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,080
Perfect!

388
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,760
- Our Ai'Thun
 - What is it going to be?

389
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
What will you choose?

390
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,600
Truth or dare?

391
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,350
T-T-Truth.

392
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,370
Truth?

393
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,370
Then...

394
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,800
I have a question.

395
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,970
What is it?

396
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,820
Who is P'Mes?

397
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,940
Yeah.

398
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,080
- Who is he?
 - Who? Who is he?

399
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,970
P'Mes.

400
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,920
Who is he?

401
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,580
Who is he?

402
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,460
He is...

403
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,100
Is?

404
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,580
<i>Is?</i>

405
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,320
<i>Is?</i>

406
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,440
Is?

407
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,840
My friend on Facebook.

408
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,720
Your spit is all over my face now, friend.

409
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,760
Mes Mung Ming Who Doesn't Have
 a Real Name Like Everyone Else.

410
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,320
Mes?

411
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
He likes to eat sweets.

412
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,190
My turn, my turn. My turn!

413
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,520
It's like its your destiny today.

414
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,190
Again?

415
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,130
What will you choose? Truth or dare?

416
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,520
I will go with dare then.

417
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,800
I am sure a person like you...

418
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,180
doesn't have the guts to sing on stage.

419
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,050
Are you?

420
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,220
Are you?

421
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,630
Are you brave enough to do it, baby?

422
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,960
Are you afraid?

423
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,210
Fine!

424
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,960
A person like me,

425
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,960
always keep their word.

426
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,230
Alright. Hurry, go!

427
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:57,950
Bring it on.

428
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,020
You are brave enough?

429
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,920
Let's do this.

430
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,040
P' can you let my friend sing?

431
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,050
<i>Sure, come up.</i>

432
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,280
Applause! Applause for my friend!

433
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,980
You can ask for his number. He is still single!

434
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,590
~ At first I was never cared about you ~

435
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,520
~ Whenever I saw you, I felt nothing special. ~

436
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,900
~ You appear to me just like everyone else. ~

437
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,650
~ Just an ordinary person ~

438
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,070
~ After we started dating ~

439
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,680
~ The more you looked better ~

440
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,170
~ So many things about you ~

441
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,960
~ Perfectly match me ~

442
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,330
~ But then it hit my left chest ~

443
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,210
P'Mes?

444
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,450
What song are you listening to?

445
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,690
"Whoever Doesn't Love This Is Crazy"

446
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,360
The song we listened to in the car.

447
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,610
Who sings it, P'? It sounds familiar.

448
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,890
It's Mos.

449
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,890
Mos Patiporn

450
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,510
~ Meeting like this who doesn't fall in love is crazy. ~

451
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:02,090
~ They must be stupid... ~

452
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:08,080
~ for not loving this person. ~

453
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,600
~ Meeting like this who doesn't fall in love is crazy. ~

454
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:22,410
~ They must be stupid for not loving this person. ~

455
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,220
Bottoms up.

456
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,960
You are such a hard drinker.

457
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,250
Is your other thing hard too?

458
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:02,920
Thun.

459
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,440
Happy Birthday.

460
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,440
Hey.

461
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,510
It might not taste good.

462
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,920
But I really made it myself.

463
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,400
You made it yourself?

464
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,190
Of course.

465
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:14,920
Don't you know who I am?

466
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,920
Chef Plai. Didn't you know?

467
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,040
Oho!

468
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,130
What a surprise.

469
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,790
You seem to like to eat chocolate lately.

470
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,790
So I think you will like it.

471
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,000
Thank you, Plai.

472
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,580
Is this touching enough?

473
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,810
Is it touching enough?

474
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,550
You have to be touched by it.

475
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,810
Make a wish, Thun.

476
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:48,460
Happy birthday to...

477
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,940
You're overacting.

478
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,570
Wish you much happiness.

479
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,310
We can't drive while drunk

480
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,950
We should take a taxi.

481
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,390
That's a great idea, buddy.

482
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,490
Taxi.

483
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,820
Hey. Hey. Hey!

484
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,730
Plai! Plai!

485
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,260
Are you alright?

486
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,920
Hey, are you alright?

487
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,530
Fine.

488
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,010
I am but I don't think I can go home like this.

489
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,680
I'll get scolded.

490
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,040
You know you are a lightweight with alcohol but you still drank.

491
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,560
What to do now?

492
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,730
Why?

493
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,800
When you drink, you should drink until you are drunk.

494
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,960
That's right!

495
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,140
Why drink without getting drunk?

496
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,460
You're the husband.

497
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,990
You should take care of your wife.

498
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,810
I'll get a taxi.

499
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,580
It's alright. It's alright.

500
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,780
Do you want to go get the taxi with me?

501
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,960
You go.

502
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,800
Yes?

503
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,400
We want to go to Kaset, P'.

504
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,470
Oh, Kaset?

505
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,470
Yes?

506
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,320
That's too far. I won't go there.

507
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,160
Oho! If it was close we would walk there, P'.

508
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,890
Why would we want a taxi then?

509
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,560
Hey!

510
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,920
Are you aggravating me?

511
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,080
Yes I am, Do you want to fight me?

512
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,560
Hey! Hey! Hey! 
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

513
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,800
But if you don't take us...

514
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
you are breaking the law, don't you know?

515
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,520
Yes, you're breaking the law.

516
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
You know a lot. Are you threatening me?

517
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,000
Yes.

518
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,070
You are drunk. Go away.

519
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,330
I won't take you.

520
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,320
Drunk? Who are you calling drunk?

521
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,500
Hey!

522
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,700
Do you want to fight?

523
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,700
- Hey, go take care of your friends.
- You are scared right?

524
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,300
- Take of your shirt! You and me!
 - Don't take it off!

525
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:00,960
<i>Thun!</i>

526
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,850
Plai!

527
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,530
Ai'Khiem, let's go.

528
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,920
What are you doing? Get down!

529
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:08,920
Plai!

530
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,770
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling a ride.

531
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,000
We will go with this.

532
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,900
Let's go back this way then.

533
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,260
<i>What about the taxi?</i>

534
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,040
Forget about him. Hurry get in.

535
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,280
Sure, let's go.

536
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,280
There's so many places he won't go.

537
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,720
Get your legs in, Ai'Khiem!

538
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,200
<i>OK.</i>

539
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,520
Move this way.

540
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
Let's go, P'!

541
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:13,180
Walk faster. I need to go pee.
 I can't hold it any longer!

542
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,370
<i>What's wrong with you? You're always like this.</i>

543
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,900
What disease do you have?

544
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,470
If you don't go back home won't
 your grandpa scold you?

545
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,710
If I go back like this, I would be scolded for sure, Ai'Prince.

546
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,040
If you get better, I can take you back home.

547
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,340
You keep talking here, Ai'Prince.

548
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,560
I said I needed to pee.

549
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,380
I can't hold it anymore.

550
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,370
Walk faster.

551
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,720
Don't you worry.

552
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,000
You are acting like I've never slept in Thun's room.

553
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,000
No, it's just that...

554
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,470
It's alright. I won't rape him.

555
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,800
Me?

556
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,630
Me? I'm the best gentleman in this building.

557
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,120
Yes.

558
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,970
Don't worry.

559
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,930
Before you are a gentleman, just 
give me the kay first! Hurry!

560
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,150
The key, not the kay.

561
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,200
The key!

562
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,750
Open the door.

563
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,470
Just a minute.

564
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,590
<i>Ai'Thun!</i>

565
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,090
<i>Just a moment, I'm looking for it.</i>

566
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,680
Open it!

567
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,760
There!

568
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,470
Look at him.

569
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,920
Acting like a kid.

570
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:29,980
Here.

571
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,390
Are you serious?

572
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,100
Don't you know who I am?

573
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,370
Plai, the real woman 2018.

574
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,270
When you drink, you drink a lot.

575
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,870
Who would think that the Star of the 
Faculty of Law would get drunk like this.

576
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,170
What kind of girl is this?

577
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,170
This is not the first time I am like this.

578
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,920
That's true.

579
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,920
Ever since first year...

580
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,520
after we finished cheer activities.

581
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,480
Then,

582
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
I was drunk.

583
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,830
After welcoming juniors?

584
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,690
Drunk, too.

585
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,690
When exams are over?

586
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,080
Still drunk.

587
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,080
And when you are happy?

588
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,850
Extremely drunk.

589
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,830
<i>You are so...</i>

590
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,200
<i>Seriously, you are drunk when you get a boyfriend
 and break up with a boyfriend.</i>

591
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,680
And everytime I am drunk,

592
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,950
you are always taking care of me.

593
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,160
Well, if it's not me, who else?

594
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,080
Right.

595
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,000
If not you then who?

596
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,720
I have lived alone for so long,

597
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:04,640
but suddenly someone appeared and is
 able to talk to me. Isn't it great?

598
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,070
Thun.

599
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,190
I have to warn you.

600
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,930
You are just a ghost,

601
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,930
you aren't supposed to have feelings toward someone.

602
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,930
We aren't in the same world with him.

603
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,150
I am not human...

604
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,850
And I should stop forcing myself to do things.

605
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,150
My time is running out.

606
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,480
In the end, we all have to leave each other.

607
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,670
One day, I will disappear.

608
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,600
If this was really my last day,

609
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,980
I would like you to know...

610
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,840
that I am glad to have met you, Thun.

611
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,680
P'Mes?

612
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,500
P'Mes?

613
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,800
P'Mes, where are you, P'?

614
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,620
P', come out and talk to me.

615
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,970
Get home safely.

616
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,100
See you.

617
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,090
Happy birthday, Thun.

618
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,900
I wish you lots of happiness and hope
 everything you wish for comes true.

619
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,900
Have you ever heard it said...

620
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,100
if you wish upon the stars, the wish will come true.

621
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,550
I have collected stars for you.

622
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,000
So that you can wish every day.

623
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:37,420
I'm sorry for secretly using your magazine to make these.

624
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,680
Don't scold me for using my power.

625
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
If one day I am not here,

626
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,840
when Thun looks up at the stars 
in the sky or in this glass jar,

627
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,840
you will think of me.

628
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,640
Happy Birthday ~ P'Mes

629
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,160
P'Mes.

630
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,740
P'Mes?

631
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,540
What's wrong? Hangover?

632
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,890
Maybe.

633
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:26,960
Then...

634
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,630
Do you want something sweet to drink? I'll buy it.

635
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,480
No, it's alright.

636
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,140
Umm, we were so drunk last night, right?

637
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,580
But it was fun.

638
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,630
Yes.

639
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,780
So...

640
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,260
Do you have basketball practice this evening?

641
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,730
Yes.

642
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,410
Thun.

643
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,920
Is there something wrong?

644
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:03,920
No...

645
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,210
There's nothing wrong.

646
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,120
I have to go now.

647
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,180
Hey guys, I'm leaving here.

648
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,880
See you this evening.

649
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,150
Damn it!

650
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,430
What the hell!

651
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,030
<i>Does that help you feel better?</i>

652
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,980
Let me join you.

653
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,800
Come on.

654
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,160
Do you feel better, Plai?

655
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,640
You can cry if you want.

656
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,070
You know...

657
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,200
I don't like to cry.

658
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:17,850
Then...

659
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,080
Can I help you with anything?

660
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:30,780
No one can help me.

661
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:43,950
Maybe I can.

662
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,630
At least...

663
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,490
I can help you wipe your tears.

664
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,720
Is this about Ai'Thun?

665
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,250
Did Ai'Thun do something to you last night?

666
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,620
I'm sorry.

667
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:41,550
You can sleep on the bed.

668
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,320
No.

669
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,900
Ai'Thun didn't do anything.

670
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:03,820
Actually,

671
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,170
being a friend...

672
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,170
is better, right?

673
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:13,550
It's my fault.

674
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,000
If we really are friends...

675
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,120
if there's anything, you can ask us for advice.

676
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,400
I can't tell him about this.

677
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:32,620
Do you understand?

678
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,690
Take this back.

679
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,690
What I gave,

680
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:41,790
I won't take back.

681
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:56,590
I'm leaving now.

682
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,730
I do understand.

683
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,010
Why wouldn't I understand?

684
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:38,540
I'm sorry.

685
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:40,000
Come. Come. Come.

686
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,200
Ai'Thun.

687
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:52,720
Hey?

688
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:56,190
What's wrong with you?

689
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:57,790
Why?

690
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,260
Ai'Prince, calm down.

691
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,800
Look at him.

692
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,920
I'm sorry.

693
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,970
What the fuck are you playing?

694
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:05,470
Hey?

695
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,010
Just choose what to do.

696
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,900
Alright, let's practice!

697
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,170
Hey guys!

698
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,210
Do you want to eat noodles with me?

699
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:39,740
You can go, I'm not hungry.

700
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,190
Then I can eat with you, Ai'Prince.

701
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:44,970
Let's go.

702
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,140
I won't go.

703
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,290
I'll have some bread.

704
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:51,520
This meal...

705
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,130
Fine.

706
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,350
Fine!

707
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,760
All out.

708
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,440
Fine, I can eat alone.

709
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:11,870
P'Mes?

710
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:14,520
P'Mes?

711
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:17,530
P'Mes?

712
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:19,530
P'Mes, where are you, P'?

713
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,920
P', come out and talk to me.

714
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:27,690
P'Mes, don't disappear like this.

715
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,780
P'Mes, come out and talk to me.

716
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:39,130
Where is he?

717
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,410
Where is he going?

718
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,640
Why wouldn't he go eat with me?

719
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,250
P'Mes?

720
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:03,440
P'Mes?

721
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,690
I know that P' is here.

722
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,590
Can P' come out to see me?

723
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:16,780
P'Mes?

724
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,080
Can P' come out to see me, please?

725
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:21,840
P'Mes?

726
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:23,840
Where have you been?

727
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:25,840
I didn't go anywhere.

728
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,000
I just stayed here.

729
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,850
Then why didn't you tell me?

730
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,850
I've called you many times.

731
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,110
What do you want from me, Thun?

732
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:35,440
Well...

733
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,960
Well... why do I have to want anything from you?

734
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,120
<i>I called you, so you should answer me.</i>

735
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,640
It is you that are wrong.

736
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,640
I just stayed where I was supposed to.

737
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,640
What the hell?

738
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:48,960
Can we talk nicely to each other, P'?

739
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,610
Where were you last night?

740
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,280
You friend was with you last night.

741
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,120
Did you want me to stay and watch that?

742
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,550
Watch what?

743
00:50:58,170 --> 00:50:58,810
P'Mes?

744
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:00,040
Wait, P'!

745
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:01,740
Where are you now?

746
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,500
Can you stop being stupid?

747
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,560
Yes!

748
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,080
I am acting stupid on my own 
for walking away like that!

749
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:10,730
But I'm not rude enough to watch
 you and Plaifah kiss each other.

750
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,430
Okay.

751
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,180
Then we should talk about this.

752
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,180
Come out and talk.

753
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,240
P', come out and talk with me now.

754
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:21,870
Come out, P'!

755
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:23,180
Come out!

756
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,180
That's fine.

757
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:32,350
If you don't want to come out, then you listen to me.

758
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,660
I know that you are mad at me.

759
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:41,080
Do you really think I don't know
 how you feel about me?

760
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,520
I'm not that stupid, P'!

761
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,760
But you should understand...

762
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,900
how different I am from other people!

763
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,650
Do you think it's easy being me?!?

764
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,540
<i>Ever since I met you, </i>

765
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,030
ever since I have seen you...

766
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:04,320
I feel like I am a lucky person.

767
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,440
<i>P' is the only one who listens to me.</i>

768
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,840
<i>P' always helps me.</i>

769
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,710
At first,

770
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:21,610
I brought you to live with me because I pitied you.

771
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:24,190
I just wanted to help you.

772
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:26,190
I just wanted P' to know who P' really was.

773
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:29,760
But now that's not the case anymore!

774
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,020
Thun.

775
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:36,250
Thun!

776
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,770
Why do you think an idiot like me would choose to study law?

777
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,590
Because if it turns out you didn't die from a heart attack,

778
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,600
I can find that person and prosecute them.

779
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:56,940
I also have feelings for you...

780
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,870
but I don't know what to call it.

781
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:03,630
Thun, I am here.

782
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:05,680
P' is here!

783
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,520
P'Mes.

784
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,240
Do you hear me?

785
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:12,650
Are you listening to me?!?

786
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:14,650
P'Mes!

787
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:17,580
Thun, that's enough!

788
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,280
Where are you?

789
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,240
That's enough! I understand. 
I heard what you said!

790
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,240
I understand you now!

791
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,500
Okay!

792
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,500
If you don't want to come out...

793
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,860
I will stay here.

794
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,300
I'm not going anywhere else!

795
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,930
Thun, enough!

796
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,020
Go inside! I beg you!

797
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,540
Go inside! I beg you.

798
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:12,400
~ There is someone next to you, ~

799
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:18,890
~ All alone, can't you see?

800
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:24,040
~ Not loud enough to make you hear ~

801
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,190
~ No matter how many times I’ve tried to tell you. ~

802
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:33,920
~ You just can’t see my love. ~

803
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:40,080
~ I am right here. Can you see me? ~

804
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:43,960
~ I am in all your stories ~

805
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:49,340
~ Embracing you with love ~

806
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:56,270
~ Is a fading shadow of someone who cares ~

807
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:57,150
Hello.

808
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:02,300
~ What can I do to make you see? ~

809
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,150
Sawasdee khrap.

810
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:11,400
~ If I could, I wish you could feel my love ~

811
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:18,030
~ I dream we would be in love, instead of you looking right through me ~

812
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:25,120
~ I yearn to manifest love to you ~

813
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,970
~ For once I wish I could tell you ~

814
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:36,490
~ That my heart is wholly yours ~

815
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:48,410


816
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:49,760
Ai'Thun.

817
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,480
Ai'Thun.

818
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,010
<i>Seriously, I saw him.</i>

819
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:11,180
Then open the door.

820
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,710
- Ai'Thun.
 - Ai'Thun.

821
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:21,960
He's not here.

822
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,030
Are you really crazy, Ai'Thun?

823
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:27,290
Come.

824
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,030
Ai'Thun!

825
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:40,760
Hey!

826
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,860
- Ai'Thun?
 - What's wrong?

827
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:44,910
Thun.

828
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:47,500
Ai'Thun.

829
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,320
Ai'Thun, what's wrong with you?

830
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:51,600
Are you alright?

831
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,560
Thun.

832
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:54,920
Come.

833
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,820
Ai'Khiao, let's take him.

834
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:01,200
Why are you sleeping here?

835
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,200
Who am I?

836
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,720
And, and what about me?

837
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:34,920
Prince, the Student's Council Secretary.

838
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:36,840
And you,

839
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,720
KhiaoKhiem from Kaeng Khoi.

840
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,720
Grandson of Kumron

841
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,940
You even mentioned our titles.

842
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:46,280
What are you playing at? You frightened your friends.

843
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:47,390
Yes.

844
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,390
We were worried about you a lot.

845
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,900
It's nothing.

846
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,400
The hell with nothing is wrong.

847
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,400
If it was nothing, would you be in then hospital?

848
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:57,450
Are you stupid?

849
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:00,220
You slept on the terrace all night in the rain.

850
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:02,440
I....

851
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,180
Sawasdee khrap, doctor.

852
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,120
Sawasdee khrap.

853
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:12,720
How is he, doctor?

854
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,030
Actually,

855
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,300
it's nothing serious.

856
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:20,300
Just a little exhaustion.

857
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,950
If there are no complications...

858
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:26,730
if he rests for a couple of days he will be fine.

859
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,850
If there's nothing else, I'll excuse myself.

860
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,260
Thank you, doctor.

861
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,040
<i>Sawasdee khrap.</i>

862
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:38,920
What's up with you, Ai'Thun.

863
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,740
If there is something, you can tell us.

864
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:45,610
<i>We're your friends.</i>

865
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,610
If there is something...

866
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,160
we can take it no matter what.

867
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:58,110
Fine.

868
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,980
I'll confess first.

869
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:04,620
Once...

870
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:06,620
I used to...

871
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,830
competed pooping with a dog.

872
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:12,640
Ai'Khiem.

873
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,210
Now do I have to tell a ridiculous
 story to compete with you?

874
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,210
Don't you have any?

875
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,700
I'm fine, you guys.

876
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,700
But can you take me back to the dorm?

877
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,720
I want to rest at the dorm.

878
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,360
You should sleep here.

879
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:34,640
Go home when you feel better.

880
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:36,640
I'm fine, really.

881
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,250
The doctor already said that I'm fine.

882
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,420
Take me home.

883
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,640
Why are you wanting to rush home like this?

884
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,200
I'm afraid of ghosts.

885
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:51,040
The ghosts here are terrifying.

886
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,040
I can't stay here.

887
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:53,960
Take me back.

888
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:55,210
Ask the doctor for me.

889
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,270
Ok. Ok. I will ask him.

890
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,000
You can go with him.

891
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Why are still standing there?

892
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:22,910
Thank you, friend.

893
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,350
Are you sure you can stay here yourself?

894
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:27,660
You don't want us to stay with you?

895
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,850
I'm sure. I'm fine.

896
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,310
<i>Then...</i>

897
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:33,680
The food from the hospital...

898
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,730
can I have it?

899
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,990
Yes, go ahead.

900
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,330
You seem unsatisfied.

901
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:42,330
I will give you an apple.

902
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:44,220
In case you're hungry.

903
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,350
It's his not yours.

904
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:49,280
Then get well soon.

905
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,390
I will tell Coach that you are sick.

906
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:52,880
Okay?

907
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:53,680
Thanks a lot.

908
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:55,160
See you.

909
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,380
Let's go, Ai'Khiao.

910
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:57,040
Get well soon.

911
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:22,600
Thun.

912
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,280
I'm sorry.

913
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,290
Because I was stupid, you got sick like this.

914
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:36,590
It's all my fault.

915
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,210
I should let myself have feelings for you like this.

916
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:44,280
You just helped me because you pitied me.

917
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,280
It should stop there.

918
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:54,200
A relationship between us is not possible.

919
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:59,370
But I already have feelings for you, Thun.

920
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,720
I already feel them. What am I supposed to do?

921
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:07,850
P'Mes.

922
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:10,460
P'Mes, where are you?

923
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:19,100
P'Mes.

924
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:23,560
P'Mes.

925
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,630
It is really you.

926
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:30,520
How are you feeling, Thun?

927
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:39,210
Why just now...

928
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:42,920
I don't know either.

929
01:03:58,490 --> 01:03:59,790
Are you better?

930
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:03,390
I better.

931
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:07,230
Where have you been all night?

932
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:10,200
Why didn't you show yourself to me?

933
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,990
I was always there.

934
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:16,570
But I couldn't make you see me.

935
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,600
It feels terrible, P'...

936
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,600
when I don't have you.

937
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,690
P'Mes.

938
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:52,010
~ What can I do to make you see? ~

939
01:04:52,010 --> 01:05:01,230
~ If I could, I wish you could feel my love ~

940
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:06,860
~ I dream we would be in love, instead of you looking right through me ~

941
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:08,330
P'Mes

942
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,390
Where are you now?

943
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:13,100
You?

944
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,250
You will get sick again if you practice too much.

945
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,320
You're too nosy.

946
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,590
Bastard.

947
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:24,590
How can you say that?

948
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:25,690
What the fuck is with you?

949
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:27,160
What the hell is wrong with you, Ai'Thun?

950
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,360
We are friends.

951
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,360
You said it yourself.

952
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,850
If there is a problem,

953
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:32,840
Say it.

954
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,220
What's wrong, son?

955
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,830
What happened?

956
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:40,300
If I tell you, you would misunderstand.

957
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,810
What do you mean?

958
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:43,950
I don't understand.

959
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:46,360
Unless you are not really here anymore.

960
