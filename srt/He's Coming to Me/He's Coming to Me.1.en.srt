1
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,760
~Every time that I'm here~

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,760
~I would always look for the shining stars~

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,000
1997

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,000
Mes's Birthday

5
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,360
~Cause I just want to see~

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:46,480
~Want to see when the stars fall from the sky above~

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:57,200
~And wish for the star to continue to shine and lead me to the way of hope~

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:06,000
~There is just one wish in my mind~

9
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,840
My story is so simple.

10
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,440
My heart stopped beating and I died.

11
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,280
Dream.

12
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
Again.

13
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,480
You might wonder how a ghost could dream, right?

14
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,080
I just found out after I died, too.

15
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,880
Well, actually, I have had this dream for years already.

16
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,520
Since my 22nd birthday.

17
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,920
Right!

18
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,920
That was also the day I died.

19
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,440
You might think it is cool.

20
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,440
But really it is sad.

21
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,680
Oh...

22
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,920
My name is Mes.

23
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,720
That is all I could remember.

24
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Needless to say I am a ghost.

25
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,400
I am a ghost who somehow has a 
Soundabout and headphones with me.

26
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,880
Being a ghost at such a young age,

27
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,880
many people might think it's unlucky, right?

28
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,880
But there is something worse...

29
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,080
As you can see.

30
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,120
2000

31
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,720
I appear to be a lonely ghost with no relatives.

32
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,160
Many years have passed  but no one has come to visit me.

33
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,160
That is probably why.

34
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,240
That I am not able to be reincarnated yet.

35
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,440
2006

36
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,680
Oh...

37
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,520
There are three reasons a spirit is still here.

38
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,840
First,

39
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,440
perhaps the person's life span is not over yet.

40
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,440
Secondly,

41
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
no one arranged a spirit sending worship for them.

42
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,800
Third,

43
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,080
they don't know how they died.

44
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,640
We can rule the third reason out because like I said,

45
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,080
I died from a heart condition.

46
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,080
A disease that had I lived with since I was young.

47
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,440
And the first choice,

48
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,880
if I died because of my illness, my lifespan would have been over.

49
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,320
See...

50
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,480
the young boy who visits the grave
 next to mine has already grown up.

51
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,320
Hmm...

52
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,960
So all that is left...

53
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
No one came to visit me...

54
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,760
or came to send me off.

55
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,400
~You said you love, you said you miss, but you never get into its meaning~

56
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,760
2007

57
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,120
Tee!

58
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,800
~Like you never know, like you never see~

59
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,680
Tee!

60
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,080
Tee!

61
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,000
You grandparents might be frightened because of you.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Ten years have passed.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,480
Long enough for this kid to become a young adult.

64
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,480
But still no relatives come to visit me.

65
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,720
How long must I wait like this?

66
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,720
~Come and play in my heart like this~

67
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,120
~You also have that symptom, right?~

68
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,440
Tee.

69
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:40,440
2008

70
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:40,440
First Year of Chingming

71
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,320
~My heart just beat in the love beat~

72
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,240
Tee!

73
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,000
Tee!

74
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,760
Aren't you hot dressed up like that?

75
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,880
Put that in your pocket.

76
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,200
Or I will take it from you.

77
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,280
Oh, mom.

78
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,200
Don't you understand teenagers?

79
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,000
Go clean this up.

80
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,160
Place it in order.

81
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,160
Fine

82
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,680
Papa.

83
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,280
Why is this grave brown, not green like the other graves?

84
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,240
Because their relative doesn't pay the maintenance fee, dear.

85
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
So no one waters the grave for them.

86
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Aw, what a pity.

87
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Doesn't he have family, Dad?

88
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,640
Well, I don't know.

89
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,640
Dad, can I please have a incense sick?

90
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,520
Here you are.

91
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,640
I give you these candies, P'.

92
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,720
Let's go.

93
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,920
We have to burn the paper gold and money for our grandparents.

94
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,720
Ok.

95
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,640
It's getting hotter here every year.

96
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,560
P'Jeng. Angoon.

97
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,120
Hmm?

98
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,240
We must be the only spirits with no relatives
 who get sick of Chingming.

99
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Oi~

100
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,440
I don't who gets sick of it, but this man surely doesn't.

101
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,040
His stomach gets filled every year.

102
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,960
How? Did someone come visit?

103
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,920
He stole from other graves. He is good at stealing.

104
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,120
Ghosts like us with no relatves,

105
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,360
need to know how to survive.

106
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,080
The owner of the grave has already gone

107
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,760
but their family still comes to visit with plenty of food.

108
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
It would be a waste to leave it there.

109
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
So cunning.

110
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,320
Hey, Mes?

111
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,520
How about you?

112
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,640
Anyone come to visit you this year?

113
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,000
Are you still waiting for your relative to come?

114
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,160
Waiting or not waiting is still the same.

115
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,720
Now I just wonder, why doesn't anyone
 in my family miss me at all?

116
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,560
They might also be dead, Mes.

117
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,480
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

118
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,400
Thinking that way is good.

119
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,720
Look at me!

120
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,600
Not sad. Not worried.

121
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,880
I feel so relieved.

122
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,760
And when the time comes we will get reincartnated.

123
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,280
- Don't think too much.

124
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,280
- Right. Right.

125
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,520
At least you still have us.

126
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,480
P'Jeng. Angoon.

127
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,600
Is it possible for someone to be able to communicate with us?

128
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,680
Like... be able to see us?

129
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,640
Who? How?

130
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,000
Tell me! I promise to not tell anyone else.

131
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,800
Who is able to see you? Tell me!

132
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Today, Angoon.

133
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,000
There was a boy who passed my grave.

134
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And I think we made eye contact.

135
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,280
Are you dreaming?

136
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,280
How could someone made eye contact?

137
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,360
Are you crazy?

138
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,360
Maybe you are just feeling too lonely.

139
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,040
You just lonely. Lonely.

140
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,440
But I think there is at least 
one person who can see us.

141
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,720
Look. Here he comes.

142
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,240
Has he got diabetes yet?

143
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,240
Hey!! Uncle!! Those are my candies!!

144
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,680
Look at him!

145
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
That old but still eats candy like a child.

146
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Then what should you eat at your age?

147
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,880
Some poop.

148
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,520
Good at trapping me.

149
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,520
How did you die?

150
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,400
Huh?

151
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,240
How did you die?

152
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,040
Huh?

153
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,040
Oh, I just slipped on my own pee.

154
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,360
Second year of Chingming

155
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,360
2009

156
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,360
Oh.

157
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,360
Didn't you like them?

158
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
Why did you only eat one piece?

159
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Oh my...

160
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Hmmm...

161
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,440
Then... What do you like to eat, P'?

162
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,920
What would I like to eat?

163
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,320
I... like to eat chocolate.

164
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
I like to eat grilled pork.

165
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
I like...

166
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,920
Forget it.

167
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,920
Look at you.

168
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,080
You should wear a cap. It is hot out here and you might get sick.

169
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,280
Dad.

170
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,560
Dessert again?

171
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,080
Tell me. You really do see me, right?

172
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,360
Can you see me?

173
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,320
Hope you find it delicious, P'.

174
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,720
Oh, wait.

175
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Wait, nong.

176
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,640
Thank you!

177
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,680
What kind of dessert is this?

178
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Thid year of Chingming

179
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,280
2010

180
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,800
I wonder who made up the belief that 
popping firecrackers drive away bad spirits?

181
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
See? Does it drive anything away?

182
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,440
It's noisy and annoying.

183
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,320
Hey, nong!

184
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,040
It's you again.

185
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
You can see me right?

186
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,040
Nong?

187
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Why don't you answer me?

188
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,280
Can you hear what I say, Nong?

189
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,640
Nong, you can see me, right?

190
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,960
Can you hear what I say?

191
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,280
Why don't you say anything?

192
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,440
Chocolate?

193
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,800
Grilled pork?

194
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,480
Hey!

195
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,480
Your wearing a cap, too!

196
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,960
Have a delicious meal, P'.

197
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,400
Hey, nong!

198
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Nong stop!

199
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,320
Then bring me some meatballs next year, please.

200
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,680
It's true.

201
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,680
It must be true.

202
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,680
Nong must be able to see me!

203
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,080
P'Jeng!

204
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,640
Angoon!

205
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,640
Where are you?

206
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,200
Am I beautiful?

207
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,840
Tell me.

208
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,840
P'Jeng! Angoon!

209
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,200
P'Jeng. Angoon.

210
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,360
What is it?

211
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,600
Do you remember the nong I told you about last year?

212
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,080
Nong last year?

213
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,000
Oh!

214
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,200
The nong who brought you candy last year, right?

215
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,480
Yes, I can remember. Why?

216
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,640
It must be true.

217
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,480
The nong is able to communicate with me.

218
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,280
Still? You haven't stopped dreaming?

219
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Looks like you are too lonely. Aren't you?

220
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,960
Why would I be lonely?

221
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,760
I'm with you and Angoon every day like this. How could I be lonely?

222
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,440
Then you are dreaming!

223
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,760
 The first few years my family stopped coming...

224
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,760
I was just like you.

225
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,640
Will see. Do you want to bet me?

226
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,400
If the nong brings me meatballs next year...

227
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Then he is able to see me.

228
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,440
Want to bet?

229
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,680
Yeah.

230
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,320
Then I will wait for that.

231
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,680
But is year is a long time. I might have already gone by then.

232
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,920
Hey...

233
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,120
You have waited for longer that 10 years already,
 can't you just wait for another year?

234
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
Hey, Angoon!

235
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,000
Hmm?

236
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,480
I'm sure that you won't be reincarnated soon.

237
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,560
Why?

238
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,760
Bad people wait a long time to be reincarnated.

239
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,260
Just like you.

240
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,860
2011

241
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,860
Fourth year of Chingming

242
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,560
P'

243
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,560
I brought you meatballs.

244
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,660
Have you already gone?

245
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,280
P' must have already been reincarnated.

246
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,520
Not yet.

247
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,520
I am right.

248
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,900
You really can see me.

249
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,260
 Don't pretend like you can't see me.

250
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,260
You can see me, right?

251
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,320
Thun. Thun. Let's go.

252
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
Yes, Dad.

253
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,260
From what you have told me,

254
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,040
<i>I believe that kid can't really see you.</i>

255
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,020
<i>I think you are just over thinking it.</i>

256
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,880
 That kid might be scared of you.

257
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,020
Yes, scare of you.

258
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,840
Hey, P'Jeng!

259
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,640
Oi! Do you aim to comfort him or make him kill himself.

260
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,820
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

261
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,820
How can he die again?

262
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,920
Here.

263
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,920
What is it?

264
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
P'Jeng and Angoon can eat this.

265
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
I don't want to eat it anymore.

266
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,380
Chingming is so boring.

267
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,940
Oh, Mes!

268
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,560
Hey!

269
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,800
<i>This is all because you you!</i>

270
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,220
You know that Mes is very sensitive.

271
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Can ghosts be sensitive too?

272
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,940
Yes.

273
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,760
And I am about to kick you, too.

274
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,480
<i>Why don't you know anything?</i>

275
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,060
Is it spoiled?

276
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,820
Why don't you understand teenagers?

277
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,720
<i>P'? P'?</i>

278
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,600
<i>P', where are you?</i>

279
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,600
Who is that?

280
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,600
Nong?

281
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,180
<i>P', help me please!</i>

282
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,560
Nong!

283
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,480
<i>P', where are you?</i>

284
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:06,920
Nong!

285
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,200
Nong!

286
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,780
<i>P', help me please! Where are you?</i>

287
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,440
Nong!

288
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,440
P'!

289
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,580
Nong!

290
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,260
Nong!

291
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,400
My dad is dead, P'.

292
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,520
Nong!

293
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,780
Nong!

294
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,700
Why did the nong look that scared?

295
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,360
No, Mes!

296
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,160
You are a ghost.

297
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,680
So you aren't supposed to be scared of ghosts.

298
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,260
Nong?

299
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,940
Nong?

300
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,080
What... what happened to you?

301
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,300
My dad is dead, P'.

302
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,640
I wish to see my dad.

303
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,300
P', can you help me find him?

304
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,180
I have looked everywhere,

305
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,300
but I can't find him.

306
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,580
Could please help me?

307
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,120
It is okay.

308
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,100
Please stop crying first.

309
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,520
Or I won't undrstand what you are saying.

310
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,140
Please don't cry.

311
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,880
I know that you are strong.

312
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,660
Isn't that right?

313
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,700
And strong people don't normally cry. Right?

314
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,980
Very good.

315
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,140
Is your dad...

316
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,720
who is about this tall...

317
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,720
and...

318
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,240
has pale skin? Right?

319
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,480
Yes. Yes.

320
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,920
Oh.

321
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,040
That man...

322
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,040
Have you already seen my dad?

323
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,220
I have.

324
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,640
Right before you came.

325
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,920
I got to talk with him, too.

326
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,320
Do you want to know what he told me to tell you?

327
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,600
Yes, P'.

328
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,500
He said please tell my beloved son...

329
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,020
that he knows you are strong.

330
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,840
So don't cry.

331
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,140
You dad didn't disappear...

332
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,060
but you dad has just changed to watching
 after you from the sky instead.

333
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,920
Then where is my dad right now?

334
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,440
You dad is on the way to heaven.

335
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,020
I guess he might be in the sky already.

336
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,340
He may be watching at you right now.

337
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,340
So don't cry.

338
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,740
Or your dad might worry about you.

339
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,260
Yes.

340
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,580
Hey?

341
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,340
If you can talk with me like this,

342
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,780
that means...

343
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,780
you have always been able to see me?

344
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,780
Yes.

345
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,820
Then why did you act like you couldn't see me?

346
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,620
Because I was afraid that my dad...

347
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,620
would find out I could talk with ghosts...

348
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,340
he might hit me.

349
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,440
I had once talked with a ghost...

350
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
and my dad found out.

351
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,120
He said if I see any ghost...

352
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,120
not to talk to them.

353
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,320
Or he wouldn't take me anywhere.

354
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,380
And he might take me to the hospital.

355
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,880
Because he doesn't want me to be different from others.

356
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,560
Then you don't need to afraid anymore...

357
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,520
because I already talked with your dad.

358
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,700
Yes,

359
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,020
By the way, what is your name?

360
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,020
We have been talking for a while,
  but I still don't know your name.

361
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,600
My name is Thun.

362
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,420
My name is P'Mes.

363
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,600
Okay, P'Mes.

364
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,080
Then will Thun...

365
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,720
come to visit me on Chingming next year?

366
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,720
I will.

367
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,440
Then I will wait for you.

368
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,700
Can you promise?

369
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,700
I promise.

370
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,160
P'Jeng, am I beautiful?

371
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,380
Yeah, beautiful.

372
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,720
Hey, P'Jeng.

373
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,600
Whoa...

374
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,160
What happened to Mes today?

375
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,080
Looks like he is full of joy and has a smile on his face.

376
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,280
A sulky, lonely ghost.

377
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,880
What is going on with you?

378
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,380
P'Jeng, didn't you see?

379
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,840
That little boy came to visit him today...

380
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,180
and talked to Mes.

381
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,900
That innocent boy?

382
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,900
Hey...

383
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,340
Yes, P'.

384
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,780
You see. I told you that he must be able to see me.

385
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,120
You guys didn't believe me.

386
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,380
Oh, great...and then?

387
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,140
This is awesome.

388
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,140
I have been alone for a while...

389
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,940
but suddenly someone appeared and is able to talk to me.

390
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,140
Isn't it great?

391
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,000
Annoying!

392
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,040
Didn't we usually talk to you?

393
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,360
You did.

394
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,600
But it is not like when I talk with the nong.

395
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,640
I have to warn you.

396
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,220
You are just a ghost,

397
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,220
you aren't supposed to have feelings toward someone.

398
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,840
The feelings...

399
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,880
will make you be greedy to no end.

400
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,240
Didn't you know?

401
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,860
And if possible...

402
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,240
just avoid him.

403
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,240
We aren't in the same world with him, okay?

404
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,020
I know.

405
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,700
But I will just keep talking to him...

406
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,040
in case I feel lonely.

407
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,060
Talking with ghosts is boring.

408
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,580
He said he is bored talking with us.

409
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,540
I have a way to get rid of being bored.

410
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,360
What is it?

411
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,640
You are new here.

412
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,720
Do you saw the tall coconut trees...

413
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,720
that have grew from here to there?

414
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,260
This woman here...

415
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,740
climbed up and down, up and down
 to not be bored until the trees were gone.

416
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,740
How did you know?

417
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,220
I saw it.

418
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,620
I know that a spirit should not 
get involved in the human world,

419
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,080
2002

420
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,080
Fifth year of Chingming

421
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,520
but can Nong Thun...

422
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,520
be the exception?

423
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,240
Because I am not the one who started this

424
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,360
The nong is the one who started talking with me.

425
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,180
I just want to have one more friend.

426
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,180
Nothing could go wrong.

427
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,660
<i>Then Thun will come to visit me on Chingming next year?</i>

428
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,960
<i>Yes, I will.</i>

429
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,900
<i>Then I will wait.</i>

430
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,200
<i>Can you promise?</i>

431
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,720
<i>I promise.</i>

432
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,800
It seems that boy lied to me.

433
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,560
He promised to come but he never came.

434
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,780
P'?

435
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,780
P'?

436
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:47,020
P', don't tease Mes like that.

437
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,560
Hey, Mes...

438
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,560
the nong hasn't come yet?

439
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,560
Hey, maybe he is busy. Like taking a test or something like that.

440
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
He might come next year.

441
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,140
Standing here waiting for that boy.

442
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,240
You have lost you mind.

443
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,800
How am I waiting?

444
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,120
Who is waiting?

445
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,200
 I just came to play with the birds.

446
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,780
I don't believe that.

447
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,420
P'!

448
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,400
See! He is walking away!

449
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,220
2013

450
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,220
Sixth year of Chingming

451
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,760
Thun!

452
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,440
Thun!

453
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,040
Thun!

454
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,560
Thun!

455
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,560
Thun!

456
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Tay!

457
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,020
Oh, Mom!

458
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,200
Come here. Where have you been?

459
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,280
I have been looking for you everywhere.

460
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,400
2004

461
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,400
Seventh year of Chingming

462
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,520
I know that I shouldn't adhere to 
anything since I have already died.

463
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,020
But can you imagine,

464
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,120
not knowing how long you have to live like this...

465
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,720
With hope appearing fro one day each year.

466
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,800
Then that hope makes you disappointed again.

467
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,400
How is it going, Ai'Mes.

468
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,740
Oh, P'.

469
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,320
Are you giving up on waiting for that kid?

470
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,720
He probably won't come anymore.

471
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,100
I told you...

472
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,360
 that humans and ghosts...

473
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
live in two different worlds.

474
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,100
I know, P'.

475
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
You have told me this so many times.

476
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,060
It's good that you.

477
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,140
Hey...

478
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,040
Look at Ai'Tee...

479
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,040
He is quite cool.

480
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,940
This girl?

481
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,220
My girlfriend.

482
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,420
Very beautiful, right?

483
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,420
Eh? What?

484
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,420
You want to have grandchildren soon?

485
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,420
Sure, we will do that tonight.

486
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,840
Are you crazy? Why did you say that?

487
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,840
It is still daytime.

488
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,740
Look at him.

489
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,780
He is not afraid of his own grandparents.

490
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,840
Aren't you used to this?

491
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,300
Ai'Tee changes his girlfriends every year.

492
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,680
Who would think that with those looks
 he can change girlfriends that often?

493
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,940
Didn't you know...

494
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,940
when I was young...

495
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,580
I was more popular that Ai'Tee.

496
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,560
So girls sent me letters to me everyday.

497
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,560
Some with perfume on them.

498
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,560
I am that handsome.

499
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,560
You are such a liar.

500
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,780
You never believe me.

501
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,760
Nevermind then.

502
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,140
Let's see what Ai'Tee brought for me to eat.

503
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,920
Mmm... The chicken looks delicious.

504
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,220
Do you want some?

505
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,040
No, I'm not hungry.

506
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,340
You shouldn't refuse my kindness.

507
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,220
Oh...

508
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,640
Are you waiting for some dessert from that boy?

509
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,240
You can only dream about it.

510
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,100
It will never happen.

511
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,140
Umm... This is good.

512
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,800
Then I will go.

513
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,220
Yours is here, P'.

514
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,020
Thun.

515
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,940
Do you want to know what it is like outside?

516
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,260
What do you mean?

517
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,520
Wow!~

518
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,520
I finally got to come out!

519
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,680
<i>Where have you been?</i>

520
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,280
You promised to come.

521
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,060
I'm sorry.

522
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,240
Where have you been?

523
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,840
Well,...

524
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,840
after my dad died,

525
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,840
I moved to live with my mom.

526
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840
Then I needed to study for my university admission.

527
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
I had not time, P'.

528
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,760
But when I realized you must be lonely,

529
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,240
I decided to come here.

530
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,820
Who is lonely?

531
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,000
No way!

532
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,820
But do you know that making someone wait for you is evil?

533
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,220
Keeping someone waiting is evil?

534
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,860
But you are a ghost,

535
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,860
is it still evil?

536
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,080
I think it is not that evil.

537
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,980
Your face tells me you aren't angry at me anymore, right?

538
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,980
Who is angry?

539
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,340
Why would I be angry at you?

540
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,340
Eh? Are you sulking?

541
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,340
Then how about this...

542
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,560
after this I will come to visit you every year?

543
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,060
What did you eat all these years?

544
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,060
Why?

545
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,160
You look like a giant.

546
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,500
Just chocolate. Do you want some?

547
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,220
<i>Such nice weather today, P'.</i>

548
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,740
It has only been a few years...

549
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,740
the trees grow really fast.

550
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,140
Others must think you are crazy...

551
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,940
talking alone.

552
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,940
I have gotten used to it, P'.

553
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,420
Used to it?

554
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,720
Cause in the years that I didn't come,

555
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,860
you are not the only spirit I saw.

556
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,620
Really?

557
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,940
Can you see other spirits besides me, Thun?

558
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,000


559
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,000
Tell me. Tell me.

560
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,660
Then let's take turns.

561
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,380
Because I want to know about P', too.

562
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,080
Since I have known P',

563
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,280
I don't really know much about P'.

564
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,900
I only know that your name is Mes.

565
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,620
Umm.

566
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,000
Alright.

567
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,720
P', do you know...

568
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,600
if a spirit hasn't been reincarnated it 
could be caused by three reasons.

569
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,160
 I already know that.

570
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,380
First,

571
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,380
they still have lif span left.

572
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,500
Second,

573
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,820
no one prepared them a worship.

574
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,460
Third,

575
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,460
they don't know how they died.

576
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,840
And do you know...

577
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,520
that if I concentrate on a spirit

578
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,780
I can see that spirit's color?

579
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,260
Color?

580
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,260
What do you mean color?

581
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,040
Like that spirit,

582
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,780
he still has life span left so I see him in blue.

583
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,940
And...

584
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,400
that spirit...

585
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
her family hasn't done the worship so she is in yellow.

586
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,160
Lastly,

587
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,160
a spirit who doesn't know how they died

588
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,840
I will see them in red.

589
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,940
What about me? What color do you see?

590
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,940
It is my turn to ask P'.

591
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,000
What else do you want to know?

592
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,420
I told you that all I can remember is that my name is Mes.

593
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,560
There must be something else. Let's try to recall your memories.

594
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,380
My name is Mes.

595
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,220
I think I did well in university...

596
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,220
because I almost got a first class honor.

597
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,680
But...

598
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,700
my mom and dad passed away during that time.

599
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,700
After that...

600
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,140
I kept going in and out of the hospital all the time.

601
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,140
Until...

602
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,140
I died because of a heart attack.

603
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,640
That's all I can remember.

604
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,360
What is it?

605
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,680
Oh...

606
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,820
I just feel sorry for you.

607
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,260
It happened long ago.

608
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,260
No need to feel sorry for me now.

609
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,040
Umm, P'.

610
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,440
I have to leave now.

611
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,360
Oh!

612
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,660
But...

613
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,460
you will really come back next year, right?

614
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,140
I will see you again, P'.

615
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,420
2015

616
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,420
Eighth year of Chingming

617
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,180
P'Mes!

618
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,680
P'Mes!

619
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,040
Why did you bring so little this year?

620
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,860
Oho!~

621
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,860
What is little?

622
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,860
All of these are your favorite.

623
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,440
It's chocolate.

624
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,360
2016

625
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,360
Ninth year of Chingming

626
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,200
Do you see this one?

627
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,920
Which one?

628
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,920
This one's name is Mek.

629
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,640
The one next to it is Mork.

630
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,600
I was a masseuse.

631
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,480
2017

632
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,480
Tenth year of Chingming

633
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Does it taste good?

634
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,440
Yes, it does.

635
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,060
What is this?

636
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,060
It's called French fries.

637
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,460
French fries, oh.

638
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,840
2018

639
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,840
Eleventh year of Chingming

640
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,000
Why did you bring so much this time?

641
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,320
Because previous years I only brought you food, right?

642
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,380
So this year...

643
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,780
I brought these this year.

644
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,580
You aren't planning to have me wear that outfit for real, are you?

645
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,600
Do you want to try?

646
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,800
Hey!

647
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,800
You really can change to this outfit!

648
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,340
Sub boy.

649
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,340
Like this?

650
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,040
Then...

651
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,600
do you want to try something else?

652
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,920
I will burn them for you.

653
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,980
How is it , P'?

654
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,280
Umm... P' thinks it is not right.

655
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,140
Then...

656
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,240
do you want to try this one?

657
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,800
How is it?

658
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,800
Quite strange.

659
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,800
But you look handsome, P'.

660
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,040
You can wear this to Siam, you know.

661
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,260
Are people still going to Siam these days?

662
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,880
Have you ever been anywhere before?

663
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,560
I don't even have anyone to visit 
or pay respect to me, Thun.

664
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,700
Where can I go?

665
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,620
A spirit like me...

666
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,240
can't go anywhere out of this area...

667
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,900
without an invitation like a joss stick lighting.

668
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,300
Then...

669
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,960
do you want to know what it is like outside?

670
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,360
What do you mean?

671
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,740
Wow!~

672
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,100
I finally got to come out!

673
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,420
Are you still okay?

674
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,060
I'm alright, P'.

675
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,420
Oh?

676
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,320
Let's go.

677
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,540
Are you ready, P'.

678
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,780
How was it?

679
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,520
Who told you to light the joss stick in 
the car while the air conditioner was on?

680
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,860
You almost go to live with me instead.

681
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,900
But it's worth it, isn't it, P'?

682
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,820
Thank you, Thun, for taking me here.

683
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,420
Why did you decide to take me here?

684
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,960
I didn't bring you for nothing.

685
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,600
How about...

686
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,240
we play a question answer game together?

687
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,240
Each of us takes a turn...

688
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,300
but I start because I brought you here.

689
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,500
Why do you like to play this game so much?

690
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,800
Because there was someone who told me if I want to 
know about someone just take turns asking.

691
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,120
Really?

692
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,120
Who told you that? Your girlfriend?

693
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,120
You have already asked.

694
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,400
When was that?

695
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,400
A few minutes ago.

696
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,520
Now it is my turn to ask.

697
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,420
You are a ghost...

698
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,000
but why do you have a mp3 player with you?

699
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,860
It's not a mp3. It's called Soundabout.

700
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,440
Soundabout?

701
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,120
Why is it with me?

702
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,900
I also wondered.

703
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,080
Maybe I died with it.

704
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,820
But why did someone say...

705
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,820
that we couldn't bring anything with us if we died?

706
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,080
See?

707
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,080
I have a Soundabout in my hand.

708
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,620
It's your turn to ask.

709
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,300
Do you have a girlfriend yet?

710
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,740
I do.

711
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,700
What about, P'?

712
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,740
I don't know...

713
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,600
but such a face like mine shouldn't be single.

714
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,200
You are so into yourself.

715
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,000
Then let me ask you something else.

716
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,260
How did it feel when you died, P'?

717
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,360
Well...

718
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,320
just slept...

719
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,860
and then I had no consciousness.

720
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,960
I woke up later in the graveyard.

721
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,900
Why? Do you want to try it?

722
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,940
Oh~

723
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,160
I don't want to.

724
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,900
There's no rush, P'.

725
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,540
I still have lots of things to do.

726
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,020
Sorry, P'.

727
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,400
So do you have anything else you want to do?

728
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,640
Of course.

729
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,080
Sometimes...

730
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,020
I think why was my life so short?

731
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,060
But what could I do?

732
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,740
I was born with this illness.

733
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,480
And do you think...

734
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,940
Oh?

735
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,040
P'Mes?

736
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,260
Where is he?

737
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,160
P'Mes?

738
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,700
P'Mes?

739
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,000
I never though that this world could change this much.

740
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,540
Next time...

741
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,200
P'...

742
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,100
I might not be able to come here anymore.

743
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,920
I'm sorry, P'.

744
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,160
I was enjoying our conversation and 
a forgot to light another joss stick.

745
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,160
It's alright.

746
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,900
I already had enough happiness.

747
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,740
Thank you for today.

748
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,860
I never though that this world could change this much.

749
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,320
Next time...

750
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,020
P'...

751
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,480
Next time...

752
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,960
I might not be able to come here anymore.

753
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,420
Why?

754
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,880
Well...

755
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,660
my family plans...

756
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,620
on taking my grandma and dad to be cremated.

757
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,220
So I won't be coming here for Chingming anymore.

758
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,780
This year is probably the last year.

759
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,240
That is why you took me out traveling around.

760
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,740
If there is a chance, we will see each other again, P'.

761
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,640
Wait, Thun.

762
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,580
For everything...

763
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,860
you have done for me I am thankful.

764
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,680
I have to go now.

765
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,580
Please come visit me sometime.

766
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,340
<i>Why is this grave brown, not green like the other graves?</i>

767
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,360
<i>Because their relative doesn't pay the maintenance fee, dear.</i>

768
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,180
<i>So no one waters the grave for them.</i>

769
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,460
<i>Aw, what a pity.</i>

770
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,880
<i>Doesn't he have family, Dad?</i>

771
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,160
<i>Well, I don't know.</i>

772
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,620
<i>But...</i>

773
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,500
<i>you will really come back next year, right?</i>

774
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,060
<i>I will see you again, P'.</i>

775
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,240
<i>Have you ever been anywhere before?</i>

776
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,700
<i>I don't even have anyone to visit 
or pay respect to me, Thun.</i>

777
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,080
<i>Where can I go?</i>

778
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,040
<i>A spirit like me...</i>

779
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,480
<i>can't go anywhere out of this area...</i>

780
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,260
<i>without an invitation like a joss stick lighting.</i>

781
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:14,760
<i>Thun?</i>

782
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,220
Wake up or we might be late for class.

783
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,460
Hurry!

784
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,460
Get up and go!

785
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,920
<i>Hurry, stop your act!</i>

786
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,300
Today we have Professor Thawatchai's class.

787
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,260
Only one second late and the door will be locked.

788
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,520
So hurry up.

789
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,080
Okay...

790
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,580
give me five minutes.

791
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,000
Hey, Khiao?

792
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,200
Hey, Prince.

793
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,060
Have you heard of...

794
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,580
an English section student who died because of a heart attack?

795
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,020
Who was that?

796
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,080
People have been sharing this on Facebook since last night.

797
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,700
Isn't it a pity?

798
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,060
He died before he graduated from university.

799
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,060
Then why did you bringing this 
drama up so early in the morning?

800
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,300
How could I let this go?

801
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:07,480
My sister who is a nurse told me that there was
 only one relative that came to pick up his body.

802
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,900
It was like he doesn't have any family.

803
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,300
If you think about it...

804
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,300
It was unfortunate.

805
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,740
He died before he graduated.

806
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,860
And became a ghost with no family.

807
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,700
<i>Why are you talking about a ghost?</i>

808
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,700
<i>It is gibberish.</i>

809
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,300
Ah...Here is some bread, Khiao.

810
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:30,800
Ok.

811
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:31,980
Hey, Prince.

812
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,400
Please tell the professor that I won't attend the class today.

813
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,120
I am going to go visit my mom.

814
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,180
Do you seriously need to go visit your mom?

815
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,180
Yes.

816
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,440
This is a three credit class, right?

817
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,060
So I can miss three times.

818
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,300
I'm going to take a shower so leave.

819
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,500
Prince, he is talking to you.

820
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,980
Hurry, I'm going to take a shower.

821
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:51,780
Who are you talking to?

822
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,060
Both of you. I am going to take a shower.

823
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,500
Thun...

824
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,500
why did you come back here?

825
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,920
I lost something, P'.

826
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,240
It must be around here.

827
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,420
What is it?

828
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:45,320
I could help you find it.

829
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,600
I found it.

830
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,400
Mes,...

831
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,880
come stay with me.

832
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,500
How could I go stay with you?

833
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,080
Will you light a joss stick for me all the time?

834
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,180
Who will light the new joss stick for me?

835
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:28,520
And you will have to smell the smoke all day long?

836
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,460
Let me ask you again.

837
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,780
Are you sure about this?

838
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,320
The one who should answer that question is P'.

839
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,600
A ghost with no future like me...

840
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,740
only lives for the day I am reincarnated.

841
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,560
Being anywhere but here is good enough.

842
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,220
But a ghost like me knows the word 'consideration', you know?

843
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,000
I'm not bringing you to live with me for free.

844
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,720
You need to be good...

845
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,420
and pay me a rental fee.

846
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,960
Do you want the burned paper money?

847
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,540
Hmmm...

848
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,540
Then how about this...

849
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,620
if I have a tutor who almost got a first class honor...

850
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,500
that would be cool, P'.

851
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,620
I give you a place to stay

852
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,780
and you teach me in return.

853
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,560
It is a win-win.

854
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,520
And if I can get 3 or 4 more A's...

855
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,520
I will give you anything you want.

856
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,520
Thun,

857
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,740
then drive me back to my grave...

858
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,740
or just turn off the electric joss stick now.

859
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,860
Oh, P'.

860
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,860
Do you remember that you once asked me...

861
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,680
what color I saw from you?

862
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,800
Yes, I remember. Why?

863
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,140
I see you...

864
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,680
in a red color.

865
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,680
And what does that mean?

866
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,680
I means...

867
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,620
you didn't die because of a heart attack.

868
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,900
[Preview]

869
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,340
It's quite strange.

870
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,680
That you first roommate is a ghost?

871
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,280
Extremely cook!

872
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,880
Let's make up some rules, shall we?

873
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,820
First of all,

874
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,820
wherever P'Mes want to go, whatever P'Mes
 want to do, P'Mes need to tell me first.

875
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,940
Are you trying to be my guardian?

876
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:43,200
Second, P'Mes can't use being a ghost to
 do anything more than necessary.

877
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,760
Shit! P'Mes!

878
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,260
Go play somewhere else.

879
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,120
Don't you think Thun is strange lately?

880
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,760
I'm ready.

881
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,180
Ready for what, P'?

882
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,660
Today is the weekend.

883
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,000
Hey?

884
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,000
Oh, hell, P'!

885
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,700
Prince. Prince. Ai'Thun! Ai'Thun!

886
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,700
Prince, what's going on?

887
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
