1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,600
Sorry to bother you.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,880
It's nothing, P'.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,440
How do you know what we have to use for a offering?

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,240
Because...

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,720
I'm smart.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,040
It's Google, P'.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,040
What is Google?

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,540
Google is Google.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,460
But I actually wonder why we need to use Thai desserts?

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,980
Don't the Gods get bored of it and want to eat something else? Maybe bingsu or cold crepes?

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,620
Bingsu?

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,020
Cold crepes?

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,420
What are those?

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,420
P'Mes, do you really not know?

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,480
Well, you you will know them after
 you live here for a while.

16
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,200
Oh?

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,300
<i>P'Mes.</i>

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,120
<i>- P'Mes.</i>
- P'Mes.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,440
Is something wrong, P'?

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,180
Huh?

21
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,000
Is something wrong?

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,040
No, I feel a bit weird.

23
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,440
Something like... moving to a new place?

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,300
I think so.

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,120
Because before this, all I saw was just grave
 and a grave and a grave and a grave.

26
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,560
Actually, I also felt the same way the
 first time I moved to the dorm.

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,760
Well, let's go.

28
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,620
P'Mes.

29
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,940
Can you act like a normal person?

30
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,560
Let's go.

31
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,180
Welcome ~

32
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,080
Oh.

33
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,200
Come in, P'Mes.

34
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,400
How is it? Beautiful?

35
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,680
This is my room.

36
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,880
Did you decorate yourself?

37
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,420
Yes, I did it all.

38
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,420
I love basketball.

39
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,180
Thun!

40
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,920
Uh...P'Mes, this is my bedroom.

41
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,400
But, but, but, but....

42
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,060
Would it better if you sleep out here?

43
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,060
How about over there?

44
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,060
It's totally fine.

45
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,720
I've been sleeping in a grave for so long...

46
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,100
sleeping on a sofa would be much better!

47
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,380
Awesome!

48
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,820
Do you live here alone?

49
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,200
Yes, I live here alone.

50
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,040
I can't live with other, you see?

51
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,100
I always make a mess like this.

52
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,220
 If I had a roommate we would have lots of fights.

53
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,220
Some days I also don't take a shower.

54
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,780
Ew... not taking a shower?

55
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,020
But P'Mes hasn't take a shower for longer than me.

56
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,680
There!

57
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,320
Seems like you like teasing people.

58
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
Well, it's quite strange.

59
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,200
Like having a ghost as your first roommate?

60
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,880
It is so cool.

61
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,120
Oh~

62
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,580
Why did you come back so fast?

63
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,020
Where are my gifts?

64
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,100
Gifts?

65
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,340
What gifts?

66
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,540
You said you couldn't attend class because
 you wanted to go visit your mom.

67
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,200
Then, where are our snacks?

68
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,200
Snacks?

69
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,200
Oh, I forgot.

70
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,460
Why are you guys like this? Can't you 
knock on the door before coming in?

71
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,390
I want my key back.

72
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,590
No way.

73
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,420
When you lose your key you will borrow mine.

74
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,260
Isn't that true?

75
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,440
What were you doing?

76
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,300
Masturbating?

77
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,320
What the heck? Masturbating!

78
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,010
Oh ho ~

79
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,010
You have no food at all.

80
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,010
What is your refrigerator for? Huh?

81
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,770
Smile. Smile.

82
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,100
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

83
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,070
Why are you looking at me?

84
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,210
Go.

85
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,280
Okay, go, go, go, go.

86
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
I'm going to basketball practice. 
I will be back later tonight.

87
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,450
Who are you talking to?

88
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,450
I'm talking with both of you.

89
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,560
Then let's go.

90
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,500
What? What is it?

91
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,510
But what did you just say?

92
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,070
I'm going to basketball practice. 
I will be back later tonight together.

93
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,040
Thun!

94
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,530
Khiem, you're the best.

95
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,640
Okay then...

96
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,040
Thun, it is your turn today to collect the basketballs.

97
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,060
Good luck.

98
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,080
Here.

99
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,780
28. 29.

100
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,080
<i>Here.</i>

101
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,220
30. All here.

102
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,020
Plai.

103
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Here is your water.

104
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,280
Are your finished?

105
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,260
I'm hungry.

106
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,420
Sure. I am hungry, too.

107
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:10,840
Okay.

108
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,840
<i>Ai'Prince, Ai'Khiem!</i>

109
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,660
<i>Ai'Prince, Ai'Khiem!</i>

110
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,660
Let's go!

111
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,220
Okay.

112
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,940
Let's go. I'm hungry!

113
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,560
Want to fight, Prince?

114
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,160
No!

115
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
<i>Both of you hurry up!</i>

116
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,520
Oh ho ~

117
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,920
I'm thirsty, too.

118
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,540
Buy it yourself.

119
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,700
Hmmm... you are using two standards here, Plai.

120
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,580
Are you crazy?

121
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,900
Between friend and boyfriend, how could I treat them the same?

122
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,820
Friend and boyfriend?

123
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
Fine...

124
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,280
Keep acting like this.

125
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,940
Someday if you two end up falling for each other real...

126
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,940
It would serve you right.

127
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,960
There is no way.

128
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,540
It is better being friends.

129
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,360
Right, girlfriend?

130
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,640
Let's go. I'm hungry.

131
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,200
Let's go.

132
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,480
- I need to finish this first. 

133
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,460
- Let's go get changed.

134
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,160
- Where are you taking me?

135
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,080
- To change our clothes.

136
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,840
Oh, right. Let me help.

137
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,680
Come on, let me help you take off your pants.

138
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
Stop playing around!

139
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,000
Didn't you say P'Chin invited you to watch a movie?

140
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,160
Why are you eating this much?  
Didn't he treat you to a meal?

141
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,740
He did.

142
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,460
But it didn't taste good.

143
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,720
When you eat in front o a guy you have 
 to look elegant. I can't eat like this.

144
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,760
It is unlike eating with you 
guys, it's much more delicious.

145
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,380
But we are all guys, too?

146
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,380
It's not the same.

147
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,540
With a guy like P'Chin...

148
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,500
you have to care about appearance like crazy.

149
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,980
For example, "N'Plai, would you like this?"

150
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,320
Or "N'Plai, P' thinks this one is good."

151
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,980
I can't stand that.

152
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,400
<i>It gives me goosebumps.</i>

153
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,800
Being polite is good.

154
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,860
<i>No! I don't like it.</i>

155
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,100
Was it like...

156
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,100
Sawasdee khrap, N'Plai khrap

157
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,300
<i>Umm... Here it is.</i>

158
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,560
<i>Do you like this khrap?</i>

159
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,940
Yes, this one is good.

160
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,240
Or like this, N'Plai khrap, would you like some steamed egg khrap?

161
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,960
Sure.

162
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,700
Or... N'Plai khrap, would like any of my muscle khrap?

163
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,160
Let me give you some khrap.

164
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,340
N'Plai khrap. Would you like something to drink khrap?

165
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,720
P'Prince will buy it for you khrap.

166
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,320
Why are you guys making fun of him like that?

167
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,320
Hey, where are you going?

168
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,200
To buy some drinks.

169
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,820
I'll go with you.

170
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,300
He must be like...

171
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
N'Plai khrap...

172
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,540
Even though I don't have a sports car,

173
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,460
I can make you love me khrap.

174
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,580
 Ew ~

175
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,540
<i>N'Plai khrap, can I give a ride home khrap.</i>

176
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,460
Stop teasing here.

177
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,060
Oh, four glasses of green soda, please.

178
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,660
Okay.

179
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,080
Make it three.

180
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,520
Oh?

181
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,380
Plai doesn't drink green soda.

182
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,460
And a glass of red soda, please.

183
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,060
Okay.

184
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,740
You are so meticulous. They were right to pick you
 to be the secretary of the Student Council.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,140
I remember this...

186
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,660
because Khiao told me once...

187
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,660
if Plai ever drank green soda...

188
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,900
it means Plai has a crush on him.

189
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,900
Hmmm.

190
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,160
So since first year,

191
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,160
she hasn't drank the green soda anymore.

192
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,160
You remember everything.

193
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,840
Can't believe they both take that seriously?

194
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,580
I know.

195
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,440
Thank you.

196
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,040
Here it is.

197
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,400
Here.

198
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,040
Thank you.

199
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,820
Let's go.

200
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,420
Hey, wait a second.

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,680
How much?

202
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,620
40 baht.

203
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,960
Oh. Here.

204
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,600
Thank you so much.

205
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,540
Here's yours.

206
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,540
Here.

207
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,300
Your green soda.

208
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,280
Thank you khrap

209
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,340
And here...

210
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,340
the girlfriend's red soda khrap.

211
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,340
Aw, you are so cute, boyfriend.

212
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,960
You even remember that I don't drink green soda.

213
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,940
Oi~

214
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,500
If you keep playing like this, why don't 
 you just become a couple for real?

215
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,060
Don't

216
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,740
These are mine.

217
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,940
Why?

218
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,380
You won't share with your friend?

219
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,380
It's mine.

220
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,380
If you want some, go buy it then.

221
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,380
Do you usually eat chocolate?

222
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,940
Last time I brought some from Japan, you didn't eat any.

223
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,420
Well...

224
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,940
I just want to try it.

225
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
<i>Just a piece?</i>

226
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,900
Go buy some!

227
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,900
I need to go. See you tomorrow!

228
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,660
See you.

229
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,340
What are you doing?

230
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,680
Do you want to use the computer, P'Mes?

231
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,680
Is that a computer?

232
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,580
Yes.

233
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,580
Wow, so cool!

234
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,900
How is it cool, P'?

235
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,900
It is just an ordinary laptop.

236
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,680
If Thun ever saw a computer from my
 time, you would know how cool this is.

237
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,120
If you see my iPad,

238
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
P' would think it is from the future.

239
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,920
After 20 years in a grave...

240
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,100
time went on like this, isn't this the future?

241
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,620
20 years? Isn't that like time warping to the future?

242
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,680
Warp?

243
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,120
What is warp?

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,760
Warp...

245
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,560
is like time jumping. Time jump to the future.

246
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,960
Do you get it?

247
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,620
Never mind, then.

248
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,000
I know you like it.

249
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,160
So I bought it.

250
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,540
Thank you.

251
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,460
From now on, I will turn on the
 electric joss sticks all around the room.

252
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,240
So when I am not here you can use anything in the room.

253
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,500
So you won't get bored, P'.

254
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,700
For real?

255
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,420
Yes.

256
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,120
P'Mes, you know sometimes you act like a kid.

257
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,500
Since...

258
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
we are going to live together,

259
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,540
Let's set up some rules.

260
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,920
What are the rules about?

261
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,880
First of all,

262
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,800
wherever P'Mes want to go, whatever P'Mes
 want to do, P'Mes need to tell me first.

263
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,760
Are you my guardian or something?

264
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,500
Second...

265
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,400
P'Mes can't use being a ghost to
 do anything more than necessary.

266
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Don't play tricks on people.

267
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,860
Don't let them know about you.

268
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,580
If someone finds out, it could turn into a big problem.

269
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,580
Are you threatening me?

270
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,780
Yes, I am.

271
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,780
I am letting you stay here with me...

272
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,380
so that makes me your guardian.

273
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,040
If anything happens to you,

274
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,040
I am responsible for it.

275
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,880
Actually,

276
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,980
I just saying it...

277
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,820
if you're not stubborn, that should me enough.

278
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,280
Okay?

279
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,320
I won't be stubborn.

280
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,360
Who is calling me?

281
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,940
Hello?

282
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,460
<i>Thun, have you arrived at your dorm?</i>

283
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,920
I have. What's up?

284
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,920
</i>How are your grades?  <i>

285
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,680
My grades?

286
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,180
Nothing below a B.

287
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,640
Lie...

288
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,020
If you know that, then why do you ask me?

289
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,360
<i>About you going out at night and 
drinking. Be sure to not drink too much.</i>

290
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,840
For that I can assure you I only drink a little, for real.

291
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,400
<i>Right...</i>

292
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,720
<i>The other day, I saw that your friends 
tagged a photo of you in a bar.</i>

293
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,320
<i>Your face was all red. And you dare 
say that you don't drink?</i>

294
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,640
Hey... I am going to have my friends unfriend you.

295
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,320
You are keeping so many secrets.

296
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
What time will you come this week?

297
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,840
So I can prepare you some food?

298
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,840
Oh ~

299
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,840
I won't be going this week.

300
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,020
Oh... why?

301
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,200
I have basketball practice this week.

302
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,940
<i>Ah, Okay. Okay.</i>

303
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,940
<i>Talk to you later.</i>

304
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,420
Okay, bye-bye.

305
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,120
What are you looking at?

306
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,900
Well, P', I am going to take a shower now.

307
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,060
- Hey!
 - Hey!

308
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,760
What are you doing here, P'?

309
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,760
I was about to ask you to help me...

310
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,420
with that small computer.

311
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,160
But...

312
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,380
I don't think I need it now.

313
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,380
If you don't need it now...

314
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,600
can you get out, P'?

315
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,360
Do you want to have a Facebook account?

316
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,580
Can I?

317
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,600
Of course!

318
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,200
But I have to register for an email for you first.

319
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,620
I'll register for you.

320
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,420
What are you doing?

321
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,540
Do you eat this every morning?

322
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,200
Do you want some, P'?

323
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,640
So...

324
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,000
this is why you are a giant kid.

325
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,180
Let's eat, P'.

326
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,860
Actually, I should let you eat first.

327
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,860
Mes can only eat spirit food, thus Thun doesn't need to prepare another set of food for him.

328
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,240
It wouldn't be expensive.

329
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,020
Sure, we can do that.

330
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,780
Did you sleep well last night?

331
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,320
I did.

332
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,220
My main job is sleeping.

333
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,220
What about you? Sleep well?

334
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,420
Me?

335
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,180
Of course.

336
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Uhh... P'.

337
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,360
I need to go to the university.

338
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,020
What would you like to do today?

339
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,940
What?

340
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,260
You want to use the computer?

341
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,780
P', you already know how to use a computer, right?

342
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,680
Then...

343
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,060
And you know how to type?

344
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,280
I do. It's easy.

345
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,280
This is the internet, P'.

346
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,600
It is used to search for information.

347
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,920
Eh. P'?

348
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,220
What is your full name?

349
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,220
Maybe I could search for you.

350
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,840
I can't remember.

351
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,780
That's alright.

352
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,820
You can just play on the computer when
 I am not here so you won't get bored.

353
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,480
<i>Thun, hurry! Are you ready?</i>

354
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,040
Okay.

355
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,760
I'm ready. I am coming.

356
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,780
P'Mes, I am going to class.

357
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,780
See you in the evening.

358
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,820
Due to an act of injustice...

359
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,160
that led to violent riots was...

360
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,220
is subject violations to the law under Article 72, Criminal Code.

361
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,680
Then, that is all for today.

362
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,320
See you next class.

363
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,380
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

364
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>Hey...</i>

365
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,140
<i>What?</i>

366
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,620
What you did that day led to violent riots!

367
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,300
Hey, you all.

368
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300
What was the first 15 minutes about?

369
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,240
I couldn't write it down.

370
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,460
Hey,

371
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,820
You can borrow my notes to copy.

372
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,420
I noted all the keywords here.

373
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,080
You can return it to me later.

374
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,820
Let me see it.

375
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,240
Wow! You are good at taking notes.

376
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,680
Can I borrow them, too?

377
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,880
I've changed my mind.

378
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,120
I won't let you borrow it.

379
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,700
What the hell?

380
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,660
"You are good at taking notes."

381
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,660
"You are good at taking notes?"

382
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,660
"I won't let you borrow."

383
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,640
What's the deal? You are so evil.

384
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,880
Don't be an obstacle like that. That is the ninth girl already.

385
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,360
Oh. But look at Thun.

386
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,200
He's been keeping his virginity for this long.

387
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,480
Those who come into his life have to be screened by us.

388
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:04,980
Really?

389
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,800
Wait! Wait Wait!

390
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,160
Who said that I a virgin?

391
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,140
- Oh! 
- Oh!

392
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,880
Oh!

393
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,940
Oh, hey...

394
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,860
~ This isn't like what we talked about together, when you told me you were choosing him and that you'd never... ~

395
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,860
They are singing <Ao> by Atom Chanakan, because Plai's "Oh, hey" is part of the lyrics.

396
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,860
- That's enough. That's enough. ~

397
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,860
Come home~

398
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,920
You're crazy!

399
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,200
Who's turn to be the sugar daddy this weekend?

400
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,420
It's yours.

401
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,640
Why do you ask? Are you planning on standing us up?

402
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,700
Me again?

403
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,320
It's yours.

404
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,480
- Me?
 - Yes?

405
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,880
Then...

406
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,240
I want to watch a movie.

407
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,940
<i>Huh?</i>

408
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,220
Watch a movie again?

409
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,220
So boring, Ai'Prince.

410
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,700
Then...

411
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,900
What does Plai want to do?

412
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,520
I will let you choose this time.

413
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,860
But if you all want to watch a movie,

414
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
I am ok with it.

415
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,680
What movie do you want to watch?

416
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,820
Let's just choose at the theater.

417
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,660
Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

418
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,720
Ai'Thun!

419
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,460
What's wrong?

420
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,460
Did you forget to log out of Facebook?

421
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,320
What is it?

422
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,960
[How to reincarntate]

423
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,700
How to reincarntate...

424
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,800
Shit!

425
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,600
<i>P'Mes?</i>

426
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,980
<i>What do you mean by "How to reincarntate"?</i>

427
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,020
I was playing around on the internet and it asked..

428
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,880
"What's on my mind?"

429
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,460
So you posted a status like,

430
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,760
"How to reincarntate?"

431
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,300
or "How to bring your memories back?" Like that?

432
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,300
I can't do that?

433
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,280
This one is Facebook, P'. It is not Google.

434
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,280
You don't understand?

435
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,320
Let me explain.

436
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,000
This is a website...

437
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,800
is Google.

438
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,380
This is the search bar.

439
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,020
Type in whatever you want to see or want to do to know.

440
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,340
You put it here in this box.

441
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,800
Then the results will show up.

442
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,860
But what you were using was Facebook.

443
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,600
It's like an online house,

444
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,780
like you have an online world.

445
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,560
You can connect with friends through the internet.

446
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,120
It's very convenient and easy.

447
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,800
Hey, let me show you.

448
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,500
This is my Facebook. Do you want to see my photos?

449
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,380
Ai'Prince...

450
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,200
and this is Ai'Khiao.

451
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
My close friends that you saw that day.

452
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,980
What about this one?

453
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,240
This is Plai.

454
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,700
Your girlfriend?

455
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,700
Why?

456
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,300
I'm just asking.

457
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,660
 Do you want to have a Facebook account?

458
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,900
Can I?

459
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,320
Of course! But I have to register for an email for you first.

460
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,000
I'll register for you.

461
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,280
How about this name?

462
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,540
Mes Mung Ming Who Doesn't Have
 A Real Name Like Anyone Else

463
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,540
Mes Mung Ming Who Doesn't Have
 A Real Name Like Anyone Else

464
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,000
Do you like it?

465
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,980
I do.

466
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,880
I'm so glad that you like the name.

467
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,720
I will try to like it.

468
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,640
~I keep asking continuously why I love~

469
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,000
~It's like I'm thinking hard that I love you.~

470
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,800
~In my heart~

471
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,960
~An uncertainty~

472
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,200
~It's not like you're someone important~

473
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:44,800
~It's not like you're someone that I dreamed of in my heart~

474
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,440
~No need to worry~

475
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,480
~What the heart once drawn to keep~

476
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,540
Oh, P'Mes...

477
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm leaving now.

478
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,860
~I got eased once I met you~

479
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,320
I will come back soon.

480
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,220
Bye-bye.

481
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:05,420
~The image of that person is no longer in my heart~

482
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,720
~There is only you~

483
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,880
~You look the best more than anyone else~

484
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
~Please be confident~

485
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
~Just be yourself~

486
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,960
~In the way that I love is enough~

487
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,560
~No matter what I will love~

488
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,040
~And I love you the most, forever~

489
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,120
How your day, P'.

490
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,120
I'm so bored.

491
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,100
I'm so tired.

492
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,140
~No need to be afraid, no matter what~

493
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm going to sleep now. Bye-bye.

494
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,100
~I will love you~

495
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,020
What are you doing, P'?

496
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,160
I'm ready.

497
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,900
Ready for what, P'?

498
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,560
Today is the weekend.

499
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,360
Even though I'm a ghost, I can count the days.

500
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,120
Oh~

501
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,880
I'm in trouble.

502
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,620
Oh, P'...

503
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,200
can we change it to another day?

504
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,580
Why?

505
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,800
I have tutored you you many days.

506
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,340
Didn't you promise me that you 
 will take me out on your day off?

507
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,500
But today is Ai'Princes day to be the sugar daddy.

508
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,080
I am planning to make him broke.

509
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,420
Then take me with you.

510
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,280
<i>I can't, P'.</i>

511
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,140
If I take you with me, they will figure it for sure.

512
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,180
Like lighting the electric joss stick or talking alone.

513
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,980
It'll be bad,

514
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,200
Let's go another time.

515
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,520
Are you ready, Khun Thun?

516
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,240
<i>I already sent a Line message to Plai...</i>

517
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,960
<i>that you are ready.</i>

518
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,220
Do you know I have emptied my
  stomach for 100 years for this.

519
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,600
All just for you, Ai'Prince.

520
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,880
Oho ~

521
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,180
- Are you planning on making the most out of my money?

522
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,440
- Absolutely.

523
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,740
Are you ready? Let's go.

524
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,580
<i>Let's go.</i>

525
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,360
Let's go.

526
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:48,980
Shall we?

527
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,940
Hey, let's go.

528
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,940
What's wrong?

529
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,220
Stomach ache.

530
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,220
Ignore it. We'll find medicine for you later.

531
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,340
It really hurts.

532
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,480
It hurts a lot.

533
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
That much?

534
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,240
Yes.

535
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,520
<i>Do you want to go see a doctor?</i>

536
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,560
That's not necessary.

537
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,060
I'll just stay here and rest.

538
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,060
Are you sure?

539
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,220
I will feel better after I get some rest.

540
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,460
I was planning to eat Korean barbecue
 after we watched the movie.

541
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,200
You will miss everything.

542
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,320
Yeah, it is fine. You guys can go.

543
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,720
<i>Are you sure?</i>

544
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,160
Will you be okay?

545
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,800
- Are you sure you will be alright?
- Are you sure you will be alright?

546
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,420
Ai'Khiem, hurry! Before he changes his mind!

547
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,020
Oh, so stingy.

548
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,600
<i>You're not worried about your friend?</i>

549
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,420
<i>Forget him. He will be fine.</i>

550
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,180
Let's go.

551
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,420
Get better soon, friend.

552
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,500
Okay, thanks.

553
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,240
You're good at acting.

554
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,080
I'm a future lawyer,

555
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,500
so I need to understand psychology.

556
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,080
Also...

557
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,480
I don't want to break my promise with you.

558
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,120
Thank you.

559
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,360
So where do you want to go?

560
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,280
Hey!?

561
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,280
We are in trouble, P'.

562
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,920
Ai'Prince! Ai'Prince! It's Ai'Thun! Ai'Thun!

563
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,840
Let's go, P'.

564
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,820
Hurry up, let's go.

565
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,200
P'Mes!

566
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,340
That's cool.

567
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,100
Let's go, P'.

568
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,320
259 baht?

569
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,780
I'll order. Pick what you want to eat.

570
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,780
I don't have the heart to order any.

571
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,300
Why?

572
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,920
What kind of shaved ice could be this expensive?

573
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,520
Shaved ice?

574
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,200
This is bingsu, P'.

575
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,220
Oh, yeah, bingsong... bingsu whatever.

576
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,440
That's it. Then...

577
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,540
I'll order for you, ok?

578
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,040
I won't eat it.

579
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,460
Chocolate?

580
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,000
There.

581
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,940
Let me order it for you.

582
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,280
I want to order, please.

583
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,980
OK...

584
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,420
I want the chocolate bingsu.

585
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,820
And watermelon smoothie.

586
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,540
OK.

587
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,040
Do you want to eat this?

588
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,320
Ready?

589
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,640
1... 2... 3...

590
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,320
Dig in!

591
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,000
I thought you said you didn't want to eat?

592
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,600
You look like you really love the dessert here.

593
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,540
Try the watermelon smoothie, P'. It's very good.

594
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,300
You like it, right?

595
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,880
Oh ~

596
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,280
It's 5,500!

597
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,540
This pair of shoes is the same price as a television!

598
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,400
Television?

599
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,880
Do you know the last person who
 said that to me was my dad.

600
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,620
Isn't it the same?

601
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,040
It's the same.

602
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,700
Is there something wrong?

603
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Oh, it's nothing.

604
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,100
I'll take this pair, please.

605
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,080
Sure, sir.

606
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Ok, please go the cashier.

607
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,160
You're buying it?

608
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,380
It's 5,500!

609
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,380
You want a pair?

610
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,140
Here are you shoes.

611
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,380
I've paid.

612
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,780
Ok, thank you.

613
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,860
Thank you.

614
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,820
You didn't pay any cash?

615
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,140
I have paid already.

616
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,380
<i>He might be talking on the phone.</i>

617
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,660
People don't use cash anymore nowadays, P'.

618
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,660
What is that?

619
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,860
You're confused?

620
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,960
There are a lot of things for you to learn.

621
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,180
It will be to teach you.

622
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:06,980
Let's go.

623
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,360
When we let Ai'Prince pick the movie, it
 is another cute romantic movie like that.

624
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,160
Oh.

625
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,720
It's my right to choose.

626
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,480
And Plai picked it, too.

627
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,820
It was a majority vote. It was 2 to 1. So we won.

628
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,820
It's your right!

629
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,920
Your right!

630
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,200
You two are always on the same side.

631
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,900
If Thun came with us,

632
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,540
he wouldn't choose that kind of movie.

633
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,360
Oh, it's called democracy. Ever heard of it?

634
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,460
Yeah, ever heard of it?

635
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,000
I forgot to take a social studies class.

636
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,580
What about Ai'Thun?

637
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,420
How is he?

638
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,160
Might have died in the bathroom.

639
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,720
Yeah, or he might...

640
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,260
<i>How about...</i>

641
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,620
I bring you hear again next time, okay?

642
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,620
Do you want to eat anything else?

643
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,420
I am full right now.

644
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,260
Hey?!

645
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,260
We are in trouble, P'.

646
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,060
Ai'Prince! Ai'Prince! It's Ai'Thun! Ai'Thun!

647
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,640
Prince!

648
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,820
What's wrong with you?

649
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,800
Hurry up?

650
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,140
This way, P'Mes!

651
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,280
Ai'Prince!

652
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,960
- Hurry up! 
- Calm down.

653
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,680
Hurry up!

654
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,660
In here, P'.

655
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,440
Why do they only love me at times like this!

656
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,620
Hurry up, Ai'Prince! Over here!

657
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,760
Are you sure that it was him?

658
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,520
It must be him.

659
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,060
Why don't you just call him?

660
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,060
Why are we running?!

661
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,700
Right.

662
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,420
Then why did you follow me?

663
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,640
Call him!

664
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,980
Just call him!

665
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,140
<i>Did he pick up?</i>

666
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,140
<i>- I just called. 
 - Hurry up.</i>

667
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,940
He's not picking up.

668
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,400
It probably wasn't him.

669
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,400
Why would he lie to his friends?

670
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,140
We will see if he lied or not.

671
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,140
Let's check on him at the dorm! Hurry!

672
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,280
- Quickly  
- Oh, let it go!

673
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,880
<i>- Hurry!</i>
 - Back to the dorm?

674
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,820
- P', hurry. Hurry up,
  - What happened?

675
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,440
They are coming! My friends are coming!

676
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,580
What am I going to do? This is not good!

677
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,200
Oh, you guys.

678
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,120
<i>See. I told you it wasn't him.</i>

679
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,040
Ai'Thun, you were here all day?

680
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,780
Of course.

681
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,000
I slept here all day.

682
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,000
I missed the movie, too.

683
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,880
Ai'Khiao says he saw you at the mall.

684
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,120
I told him that it wasn't you, 
 but he didn't believe me.

685
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,460
Then why did you turn off your phone?

686
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,620
My phone?

687
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,620
Was it turned off?

688
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,060
Oh, yeah.

689
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,460
Here, I turned it on.

690
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,820
You got lucky.

691
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,980
Hey, you guys!

692
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,420
What?

693
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,380
<i>What?</i>

694
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,780
What...?

695
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,340
What about Plaifah?

696
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,820
Right Where is Plaifah?

697
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,480
Hey, she is calling me.

698
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,480
Hello, Plai.

699
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,360
 Damn, you made me run like 4 x 100.

700
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,900
I still don't feeling well.

701
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,420
Yes, Ai'Prince and Ai'Khiao are here with me.

702
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,140
<i>He said he saw me at the mall?</i>

703
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,640
<i>That's crazy. Don't believe him.</i>

704
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,180
<i>You guys should go home.</i>

705
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:58,860
Give me a second.

706
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,120
I want to sleep some more and talk to Plai, too.

707
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,860
Go. go, go.

708
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,700
Was that really not you?

709
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,000
It wasn't me. I was here sick.

710
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,960
But I think...

711
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,580
- Ai'Prince...
  - I'm opening the door. Let's go.

712
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,520
See you. I'll go see you when I am better.

713
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,280
Bye.

714
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,720
It's okay now.

715
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,480
Yeah.

716
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,260
They just ran off and totally forgot about me, you know.

717
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,880
And you what?

718
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,020
They asked me as if he was my girlfriend.

719
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,020
If you really had a girlfriend, they would stop.

720
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,500
That's why I don't have a girlfriend.

721
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,700
<i>I really want to know what kind
  of girl would be your girlfriend?</i>

722
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,900
<i>I just got home. That's all. Let's end the call.</i>

723
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,700
See you at the university.

724
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,600
Bye.

725
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,460
Ok, bye.

726
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,860
Grandpa, I am home.

727
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,540
I missed you so much.

728
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,640
You are back already.

729
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,220
Didn't you say you will be late?

730
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,220
I missed my grandpa so I came home early.

731
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,100
Sweet talking like this...

732
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,100
what do you want from me?

733
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,580
You do this with your boyfriend.

734
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,020
<i>Your medicine, sir.</i>

735
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,120
Who can I do that with?

736
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,060
I don't have a boyfriend.

737
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,520
Boys nowadays are boring, Grandpa.

738
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,540
Really?

739
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,900
What about Thun?

740
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,900
I heard you call him boyfriend.

741
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:17,900
Oh...

742
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,360
That is not serious.

743
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,140
We are just joking around with each other.

744
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,400
Actually, being friends is better.

745
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,240
Really?

746
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,480
If we were dating...

747
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,980
and we broke up...

748
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,600
we might not be able to look at each other's face.

749
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,460
I'm going to take a shower now.

750
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,040
I'll come down after to have dinner.

751
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,580
Okay.

752
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,200
Be quick. I'll wait for you.

753
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,100
Okay.

754
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,020
I'm going to take a shower now.

755
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,060
<i>Hey! It's true.</i>

756
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,320
I didn't know at first...

757
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,060
But do you remember last night
  when I kicked your shoes bag?

758
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,940
Does that mean you can touch objects now?

759
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,380
It's not that easy.

760
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,960
But I can do it now.

761
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,740
That's cool.

762
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,740
Hey, P'...

763
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,620
If you can touch me...

764
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,120
you will be no different from an ordinary person.

765
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,960
I think I can only touch objects for now.

766
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,860
But it's alright.

767
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,820
This is good enough.

768
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,300
Now let's see...

769
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,560
I can turn on the television myself.

770
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,280
I can turn on and use the computer by myself.

771
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,840
<i>I can even light the electric joss stick by myself, too.</i>

772
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,320
Or perhaps do the laundry yourself,

773
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,640
mop the floor yourself, or clean the bathroom yourself?

774
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,540
Hey,

775
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,840
are you using me?

776
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,840
It's because you can do it.

777
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,900
By the way, Thun...

778
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,260
Can I ask you something?

779
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,780
Who is your girlfriend?

780
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,800
Why are you asking?

781
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,480
I don't see you taking pictures
  with any other girl but Plaifah.

782
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,120
Are you Plaifah's boyfriend?

783
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,960
Why do ask me so much?

784
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,660
Are you my boyfriend?

785
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,140
What does that mean?

786
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,330
You told me once before...

787
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,640
you had a girlfriend,

788
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,740
but I have never seen her.

789
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,740
I used to have one.

790
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,340
But we already broke up.

791
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,370
That day I didn't finish answering your question.

792
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:44,340
I don't like girls who are bossy.

793
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,890
I don't like girls who get jealous.

794
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,700
 It is tiring to keep arguing.

795
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,990
Being single is more comfortable.

796
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,210
Why are you smiling, P'?

797
00:44:58,610 --> 00:44:59,820
I'm heading to class now.

798
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,080
Wait, wait, wait.

799
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,610
Can I go with you to the university today?

800
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,890
No way.

801
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,380
We almost got caught yesterday, P'.

802
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:14,130
Staying the room by myself is lonely
 and I don't have anything to do.

803
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,400
Please, let me go to university with you.

804
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:20,020
I promise I will do all the housework.

805
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,140
I'll sweep the floors, mop the floors,

806
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,780
wash and dry the clothes,

807
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,300
and even clean the bathroom.

808
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:29,300
Please.

809
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,860
Please, let me go with you.

810
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,360
You have to stay close to me.

811
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,010
Really?

812
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:42,160
Thun is the best.

813
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:46,350
P'Mes.

814
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,520
P'Mes, quickly.

815
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,470
Or else I am going to be late for class.

816
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,380
<i>What's up, you guys?</i>

817
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,310
Hey.

818
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,730
I transferred the dorm rental fees to you.

819
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,540
Add another 500 for your liquor.

820
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,940
I have it noted. Why did you forget that detail?

821
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:10,540
Fucking stingy.

822
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,170
Ouch! That hurts!

823
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,340
It's all you.

824
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,090
Where's Plaifah?

825
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:17,770
This morning she said P'Chin will pick her up.

826
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:18,500
P'Chin?

827
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:20,170
Chin...

828
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,770
Chin the sugar daddy?

829
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:22,930
Yes.

830
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,030
Let's wait we should hear him coming soon.

831
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,650
You'll see...

832
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:29,800
First the sound of someone speeding up.

833
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,800
Followed by the sound of the car exhaust.

834
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:34,240
See?

835
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:36,800
Then watch carefully.

836
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,700
His care will stop perfectly right in front of our faculty.

837
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:40,580
Watch!

838
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,550
And then you will see...

839
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:47,630
him being a gentleman.

840
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,630
He will open the door for the lady.

841
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,560
<i>See, exactly what I told you would happen.</i>

842
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,870
<i>"Sawasdee Khrap, I'm leaving now khrap."</i>

843
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:12,850
Walking so beautifully.

844
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:13,450
Shut up.

845
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:15,630
You told us you didn't like him,

846
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,680
so why did you let him give you a ride.

847
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,010
Why? Jealous?

848
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,260
My grandfather is in the hospital,

849
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,320
so P'Chin offered me a ride.

850
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,490
What time is it?

851
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:26,320
Should we head to class?

852
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:27,690
Let's go.

853
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:28,730
Shall we? Hurry up.

854
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:29,340
Let's go.

855
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,100
Hey, Plai, Plai. Plai.

856
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,960
He is really muscular. Are his muscles real?

857
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,200
Stop it!

858
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:36,760
P'Mes?

859
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:38,840
Is there something wrong?

860
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:41,230
It's nothing.

861
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:42,200
<i>Let's go.</i>

862
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:49,950
There was a couple riding a motorbike
 together and got into an accident.

863
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,270
<i>The woman fell and lost consciousness.</i>

864
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,270
But the man dodn't help her.

865
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,960
Because he thought his girlfriend was already dead.

866
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,130
<i>But then eight days later she died.</i>

867
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:07,260
<i>In this case, can this man be 
found guilty  based on the law?</i>

868
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,210
Professor, khrap?

869
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:10,810
I think he was found not guilty.

870
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:17,520
The court said the defendant and it
 led to the death of the second victim.

871
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:24,590
The defendant caused the victim
 to fall from the motorbike.

872
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:28,570
That made her lose consciousness for eight
 days without informing anyone.

873
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:31,070
So the defendant knew the consequences...

874
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:34,220
that if that victim or the woman didn't die.

875
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,790
He would be found guilty of attempting
 to cause the death of another.

876
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,830
Shit! P'Mes!

877
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,000
Go play somewhere else.

878
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:43,660
<i>Khun Thunyakorn.</i>

879
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,050
Please be quiet.

880
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,660
What's the matter?

881
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,090
I can't keep up with the lesson khrap.

882
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,740
Stay focused, Thunakorn.

883
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,280
If you want to be a lawyer in the future...

884
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,960
how could you show that confused face to the judge?

885
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,540
Khrap.

886
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,200
Ai'Khiem.

887
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,500
Do you think Ai'Thun is being weird today?

888
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,060
Maybe he hasn't recovered from his stomach ache.

889
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,060
That is not relevant.

890
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,400
Can you wait outside the classroom?

891
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,400
If you're here, I can't learn anything.

892
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:31,220
But you told me to stay close to you.

893
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,620
It is fine to not be this close.

894
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,940
Please go wait outside.

895
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:37,200
<i>Hey.</i>

896
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,500
If you are not ready to learn,

897
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,500
then you can go outside.

898
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,720
Please excuse me.

899
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:05,950
Why aren't you going?

900
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,280
He called for you.

901
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:09,460
He's calling me?

902
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:10,820
"Ai'Khiem. Ai'Khiem."

903
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:12,680
I don't think so, bastard.

904
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:15,220
<i>"Ai'Khiem. Ai'Khiem."</i>

905
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:22,780
If you 're in the classroom, I can't learn anything.

906
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:24,400
Please stay here, P'.

907
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,400
Don't you want me to stay close to you?

908
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,700
P'Mes.

909
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,820
I know. Don't get upset.

910
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:33,930
Wait for me here in front of the
 classroom. I will pick you up later.

911
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,420
Wait for me here in front of the
 classroom. I will pick you up later.

912
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,880
That is all for today.

913
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,280
See you next time.

914
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,300
Thank you.

915
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,020
See you.

916
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,480
Plai

917
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,120
Plai, come.

918
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,120
Ai'Prince.

919
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:57,900
Ai'Prince.

920
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,320
Come here.

921
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:03,660
What?

922
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,190
Don't you think Ai'Thun seems a little crazy lately?

923
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,640
Maybe he didn't get enough sleep.

924
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,450
That's not the reason.

925
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:16,990
Ho... He seems like he has been cursed.

926
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,990
Cursed. Don't you know cursed?

927
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,360
Are you sure?

928
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:21,610
How do you know?

929
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:22,980
How could I not know?

930
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,500
My neighbor acted like this before.

931
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,940
Don't make me say this...

932
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,380
but it was...

933
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,240
What symptoms, you guys?

934
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:37,960
Ah... your stomachache symptoms.

935
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,260
- Right
 - How are you feeling, friend?

936
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,260
I'm Okay.

937
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,610
Let's go. We have lots of work to do.

938
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:43,320
Right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

939
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,120
Hurry, what are you waiting for?

940
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:49,730
What I said is true.

941
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:50,350
No!

942
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:55,440
Ai'Prince

943
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:16,430
What kind of petitions should we be looking for

944
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:18,140
I can't think of any.

945
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,080
Then...

946
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:21,660
I will help you find a rare case petition.

947
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:23,660
Deal! Don't change your mind.

948
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,060
Oi... Let's get something to eat.

949
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,900
I'm hungry and need to eat something. Let's go.

950
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:29,900
Thun?

951
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,020
Huh?

952
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:33,020
You guys can go first. I am 
going to use the restroom.

953
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,640
What was he looking at?

954
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,380
I told you.

955
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:43,660
He's being weird.

956
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:46,250
Do you believe me now that he is cursed?

957
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:48,250
Yes, I believe you.

958
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,000
Told you so. Let me call my neighbor first.

959
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,240
P'Mes?

960
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,280
P'Mes!

961
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:31,260
P'Mes.

962
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,880
P'Mes, why are you here?

963
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,280
I told you to wait for me in front of the classroom.

964
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,130
<i>What would I do if you got lost?</i>

965
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:40,670
How would I find you?

966
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,860
Are you able to go back to the dorm?

967
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,700
P'Mes.

968
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:46,700
P'Mes.

969
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,490
Are you listening to me?

970
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,160
Economic Management, Economic Analysis,
 Marketing Management.

971
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,550
I brought them all from the shelves for you.

972
00:54:58,090 --> 00:54:59,100
Thank you.

973
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,900
How many books can we borrow with the library card?

974
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,750
Two books.

975
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:07,220
But I only have one card.

976
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,520
I have another card with me, P'Mes.

977
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:10,450
<i>P'Mes.</i>

978
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:11,380
P'Mes!

979
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:14,440
Thun.

980
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,070
I think I studied here before.

981
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,780
[Preview]

982
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:02,500
There is no information in the system.

983
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,730
Is that even possible, P'?

984
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,340
What kind of ghost am I?

985
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,770
No name or age.

986
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:10,730
If you can't remember your full name,
it will be hard to find out more.

987
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:14,130
I just want to know what happened to me, that's all.

988
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:15,260
P'Mes.

989
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:18,340
Who did he call?

990
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,330
Ai'Prince.

991
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,100
Huh?

992
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,100
Did you check on the security guard?

993
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:21,620
Yes.

994
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:22,840
Dude.

995
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,290
Are you sure about this?

996
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,940
I am.

997
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:32,420
Run!

998
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,010
Who's there?

999
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,400
Ai'Khiem, wait for me.

1000
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,820
Hey, stop! Stop there!

1001
