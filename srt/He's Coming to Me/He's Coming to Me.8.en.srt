1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,290
No one can really imagine...

2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,290
what it will be like after death.

3
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,640
Until you...

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,410
Wait. Wait...

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,610
I didn't curse you.

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,020
In most movies or books...

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,280
it is often said that your body will lighter.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,640
And you will walk towards a white light.

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,120
Seriously...

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,520
I didn't see anyt white light at all.

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,330
When I realized it...

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,970
Well, here I am, as you can see.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,680
I have no memories.

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,610
Actually, I have been living here for more than 20 years.

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,340
Who said that when you die time stops?

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,680
That's not true.

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,320
Here...

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,500
you may close your eyes this year

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,500
and when you open them again...

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,500
It could be just a minute...

21
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,810
or maybe a year that has passed.

22
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,360
And the reason I care about counting time...

23
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,090
is because of one person.

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,250
The one who makes me wait until next year.

25
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,490
Waiting for the next Chingming to arrive.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But today...

27
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,290
I finally came back here again.

28
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,200
When the truth was revealed,

29
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,500
The truth that happened...

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,420
on my 22nd birthday...

31
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,090
and the same day I died.

32
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,690
1997
Mes's Birthday

33
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,980
Pad Kra Pao is Holy Basil Stir-fry dish

34
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,980
Looks like you are getting fed up with Pad Kra Pao.

35
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,120
No khrap.

36
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,440
I'm just not hungry.

37
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,120
If you just didn't feel hungry,
 you wouldn't have such a long face.

38
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,690
Is there anyhing bothering you?

39
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,010
Hmm?

40
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,650
I miss Dad and Mom, Auntie Nom.

41
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,580
They are resting in peace.

42
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,410
How about I prepare food tomorrow as an 
offering to the monks for a blessing for them?

43
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,770
That is great khrap.

44
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Thank you, Auntie.

45
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,610
Then...

46
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,360
smile, please?

47
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,010
So your parents can see and easy...

48
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,320
that you are living happily,

49
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,320
Okay?

50
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,320
Khrap.

51
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,100
Oh,

52
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,770
since it is your birthday kha,

53
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,180
will you go celebrate with your friends?

54
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,960
I am not planning on going anywhere, Auntie.

55
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,960
By 10 PM, I would be sleepy.

56
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,620
It wouldn't be fun to go out.

57
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,660
It's up to you then kha.

58
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,520
Oh?

59
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,820
Are you full already kha?

60
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,700
Then take your medicine kha.

61
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,850
Here, water.

62
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,460
Thank you khrap.

63
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,560
Take the medicine kha.

64
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,610
I remember it now.

65
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,520
Before I died,

66
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,460
I saw someone at the door.

67
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,810
Who was it, P'?

68
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,600
Uncle Phop?

69
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,140
Auntie Nom?

70
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,900
Grandpa.

71
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,330
Is Grandpa your uncle?

72
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,930
That means that your father is Grandpa's brother.

73
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,320
What are you doing in here?

74
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,780
Get out of here!

75
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,500
My apologies khrap...

76
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,330
for not asking permission from you first.

77
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,080
But I have some questions for you Grandpa khrap?

78
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,340
Do you know someone named Mes khrap?

79
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,800
Who is Mes?

80
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,960
I don't know.

81
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,720
Mes, Wongsakorn Thanarungsiri.

82
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,440
There is no one with that name in this house.

83
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,400
Then can can you tell me khrap...

84
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,970
who this person is in this photo?

85
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,460
Where did you gt his picture from?

86
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,850
That isn't important khrap.

87
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,850
are you going to admit now khrap...

88
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,480
that you know P'Mes?

89
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,980
And that P'Mes is your nephew...

90
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,650
who used to live here.

91
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,260
 Yes.

92
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,800
Mes is the son of my older brother.

93
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,940
But he has been dead for more than 20 years already.

94
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,760
Why would you ask about him?

95
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,240
Then can you tell me something khrap?

96
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,100
Why everyone here let P'Mes 
become a ghost without relatives?

97
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,100
Abandoned him at the cemetery

98
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,490
 and no one even visited.

99
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,090
And this room?

100
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,090
Why did you lock up the room where P'Mes died?

101
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,280
That is none of your business.

102
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,020
The reason I came here...

103
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,020
is because I want to know

104
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,020
why P'Mes has been left like he doesn't exist.

105
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,640
Why does everyone here act like P'Mes never existed?

106
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,400
Why is that?

107
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,100
Because I'm the one who ordered 
everyone not to talk about him again.

108
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,080
Including this room.

109
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,220
Mes was an unfortunate child.

110
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,260
He had heart disease since he was born.

111
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,850
Before his father and mother died...

112
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,280
I promised his father...

113
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,160
that I would take good care of him.

114
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,880
But I didn't keep my word.

115
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,480
After I lost my brother...

116
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,970
and then to lose my nephew.

117
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,840
 Do think that was easy?

118
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,500
To see your family dying one after the other?

119
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,730
On the day Mes died...

120
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,960
was the worst day for the family.

121
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,540
In this room...

122
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,080
This very spot...

123
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,620
The more I see it, the more I remember it.

124
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,140
Every single day, each day...

125
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,770
If you were me...

126
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,940
do you think you could overcome this feeling?

127
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,760
So you left P'Mes at the cemetery?

128
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,810
It is my fault.

129
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,800
It is my fault I have never visited him there.

130
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,330
I have never prayed for him.

131
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,980
Every time I see something about Mes,

132
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,780
it makes me feel even more regret.

133
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,040
I regret that I didn't take care of him well enough.

134
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,900
<i>I don't want to talk about this anymore.</i>

135
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,600
 That's enough, Thun.

136
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,930
I feel sorry for you, Grandpa.

137
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,020
<i>That you have had to suffer for this.</i>

138
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,020
<i>I understand...</i>

139
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,540
<i>that you want to forget about him.</i>

140
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,940
But isn't it because you feel guilty...

141
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,680
<i>that you let P'Mes die without helping him?</i>

142
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,200
Thun!

143
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,850
What are you trying to say?

144
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,860
Stop talking nonsense.

145
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,600
I am not talking nonsense.

146
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,690
P'Mes told me that Grandpa you 
stood by and watched him die!

147
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,600
Ai'Thun.

148
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,680
What kind of child are you?

149
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,960
Why are you slandering someone older than you like this?

150
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,440
Thun...

151
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,300
that's enough!

152
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,180
You have made him sad enough.

153
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,360
I have to say this khrap.

154
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,020
Everything that happened...

155
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,220
is my family matter.

156
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,290
It's none of your business.

157
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,690
It is my business.

158
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,410
The reason I'm saying this...

159
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,650
 is because I'm the only one who can communicate with P'Mes.

160
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,500
I don't believe you.

161
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,340
Stop lying to your elder.

162
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,940
Get out of my house.

163
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,120
Or I'll call the police to arrest you...

164
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,730
for breaking and entering.

165
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,800
I'm not going anywhere.

166
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,290
Until I know the truth.

167
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,250
In order for me to help P'Mes...

168
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,760
I need to know why P'Mes can't be reincarnated!

169
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,500
Mes died a long time ago!

170
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:02,970
Khun...

171
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,640
It has nothing to do with you!

172
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,780
Calm down, please.

173
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,580
Get out!

174
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,490
Get out of here!

175
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,170
Khun...

176
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,860
Even if you kick me out of this house...

177
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,820
you can't get rid of  P'Mes his house khrap!

178
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,500
Do you believe me now...

179
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,290
that P'Mes is here!?!

180
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,900
Mes?

181
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,500
Uncle Phop!

182
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,460
Why didn't you help me that day?

183
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,410
Why didn't you do anything?

184
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,410
Now can you answer my question khrap?

185
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,040
Why didn't you help P'Mes that day?

186
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,640
Khun...

187
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,080
Khun...

188
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,210
I was wrong.

189
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,370
I didn't mean for it to happen that way.

190
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,540
<i>I still remember that it was Mes' birthday.</i>

191
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
Here it is.

192
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,680
The chocolate cake...

193
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,440
I was the one who asked Nom to buy it.

194
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,720
Everyone in the house was preparing his birthday surprise.

195
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,360
I went to go get him.

196
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,960
But when I got there,

197
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,760
Mes was already on the floor.

198
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,340
I was shocked.

199
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,010
I couldn't move.

200
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,300
All of my strength left my body.

201
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,090
I didn't know what to do.

202
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,690
I don't know what I should do.

203
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,760
It was my fault.

204
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,410
If I had helped Mes in time,

205
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,800
it wouldn't be like this.

206
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,460
I regret this.

207
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,560
I feel terrible for letting him die.

208
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,080
It was my fault.

209
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,690
I'm so sorry.

210
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,360
I love you, Mes.

211
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,170
<i>When you were alive...</i>

212
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,200
<i>I did my best to take care of you.</i>

213
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,820
I took you to the hospital...

214
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,820
and made sure you always had your medicine.

215
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,160
You can ask Nom about this.

216
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,880
<i>I tried to do everything I could.</i>

217
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,620
And if Mes hadn't of lost his medicine...

218
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,860
you wouldn't have died.

219
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,970
For 20 years, I have tried to forget this.

220
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,930
and now you make me recount it.

221
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,460
Why did you do this?

222
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,820
We're sorry, Grandpa.

223
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,060
You should apologize to Grandpa now.

224
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,890
Grandpa is already feeling guilty about this.

225
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,040
How could Grandpa know...

226
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,040
P'Mes would lose his medicine that day?

227
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,080
It might have really been P'Mes' time to die.

228
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,050
P'Mes khrap,

229
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,050
Please forgive Grandpa khrap.

230
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,500
I saw your spirit...

231
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,530
 as red.

232
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,020
What does that mean?

233
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,020
You didn't die from a heart attack khrap.

234
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,970
That's right khrap.

235
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,260
You took care of P'Mes the best as you could, right?

236
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,180
And you also asked Auntie Nom to care for him, right?

237
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,180
Auntie Nom khrap...

238
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,410
What do you remember about that day?

239
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,080
I am the one who took care of Khun Mes.

240
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,980
Everyday, I prepared Khun Mes' food and his medicine myself.

241
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,500
The boss always reminded me...

242
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,180
that I shouldn't ever miss it.

243
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,440
No matter what kind of medicine Khun Mes had...

244
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,760
or if there was new medicine,

245
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,020
or what dose...

246
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,600
I was the one that knew.

247
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,640
Was there anything out of the ordinary that day?

248
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,940
There wasn't.

249
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,170
I still remember that the doctor had
 changed the medicine for him.

250
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,340
New medicine?

251
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,290
Wait khrap.

252
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,000
How did you know it was a new medicine?

253
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:17,960
Because...

254
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,410
I prepared his medicine myself everyday so I have to remember.

255
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,410
<i>How did you know...</i>

256
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,410
<i>which medicine was for what?</i>

257
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,330
I didn't.

258
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,330
Khun Mes had a lot of medicine.

259
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,330
He also had a lot of vitamins.

260
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,220
Master is the one who told me.

261
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,370
Is it possible...

262
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,370
that the new medicine...

263
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,000
was not to treat the heart...

264
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,400
but to precipitate P'Mes's heart attack?

265
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,300
Don't say such trash!

266
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,520
Who would be crazy enough to do that?

267
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,540
<i>That's true.</i>

268
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,100
Who would have done it?

269
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,930
Let's think about it?

270
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,960
Who would inherit and benefit from P'Mes's property...

271
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,820
if P'Mes were to die?

272
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,540
You are accusing me of that I intentionally caused Mes to die, right?

273
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,540
Wasn't that the case?

274
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,000
If it wasn't, how do you explain...

275
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
why his medicine was missing?

276
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,800
Honestly,

277
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,650
was supposed to be the only one to
 know about the medicine missing.

278
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,320
You had Auntie Nom change the 
medicine that P'Mes normally took.

279
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,330
<i>That medicine was not to treat...</i>

280
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,340
<i>but to exacerbate P'Mes heart condition.</i>

281
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,810
Then you removed his medicine from his room.

282
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,690
And after P'Mes had the heart attack you didn't help.

283
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,010
<i>You are acting innocent because P'Mes died of a heart attack.</i>

284
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,140
But you probably don't know...

285
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,810
that letting someone die without offering help...

286
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,770
is as guilty as someone how committed an intentional murder!

287
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,780
This happened a long time ago!

288
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,290
Why are you bringing it up now?

289
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,970
Thun, that's enough.

290
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,970
I don't want to know anymore.

291
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,080
I'm sorry, P'Mes.

292
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,860
The reason you can't be reincarnated...

293
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,960
is because you didn't die from a heart attack.

294
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,640
<i>But someone intentionally caused your death.</i>

295
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,640
And that person...

296
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,240
is you, Grandpa!

297
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,520
That's not true!

298
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,300
I didn't kill him!

299
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,330
Sir...

300
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,000
<i>Whether it is true or not you know you should know.</i>

301
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,540
If you didn't do it,

302
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,460
then say you didn't do it.

303
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,170
But you don't need to tell me...

304
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,700
you can tell your beloved nephew.

305
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,090
He is right here now.

306
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,930
Say it, Grandpa khrap.

307
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,930
That you didn't intent to kill P'Mes.

308
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,300
<i>That you didn't want P'Mes inheritance.</i>

309
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,520
Say that you didn't want for this to happen!

310
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,450
That you didn't kill him!!

311
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,290
I'm sorry.

312
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,860
I didn't want this to happen.

313
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,330
Mes...

314
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,620
I'm sorry

315
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,400
Twenty years ago...

316
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,740
after Mes's father and mother passed away...

317
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,930
Everything that father earned...

318
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,290
and owned...

319
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,290
belonged to Mes.

320
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,600
It was my fault.

321
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,200
If I wasn't greedy at that time...

322
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,860
and took out a loan to speculate.

323
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,570
Maybe things wouldn't have been that bad.

324
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,820
But it was 15 million.

325
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,650
Where could I find that much money?

326
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,250
The 1997 financial crisis that affected most Asian countries at the time.

327
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,250
It was during the Tom Yum Kung financial crisis.

328
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,580
Everyone was going bankrupt.

329
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,580
The economy was collapsing.

330
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,400
I had now way out.

331
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,640
I had lost everything.

332
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,340
I was desperate.

333
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,810
I didn't really want it to happen, Mes.

334
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,900
But I foolishly thought...

335
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,740
if only you would die...

336
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,160
I was evil person.

337
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,160
A cruel man.

338
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,600
I wanted Mes's inheritance.

339
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,020
I wanted it so much that I would 
take away my own nephew's life.

340
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,160
I was wrong.

341
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,940
I'm sorry.

342
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,300
Mes.

343
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,380
Sir.

344
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,340
Can I ask you something?

345
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,420
How do you feel about me?

346
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,530
If you want something special to eat...

347
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,530
just tell Auntie Nom, OK?

348
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,170
You have to eat something.

349
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,040
About the charity for the dead with no relatives...

350
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,980
I have arranged everything for you.

351
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,020
Next week the lawyer...

352
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,020
will bring the documents...

353
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,410
for you to look through.

354
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,260
The name of the charity is Thanarungsiri.

355
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,260
Just like you wanted.

356
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,780
Wongsakorn...

357
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,180
The charity...

358
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,330
Wongsakorn Thanarungsiri.

359
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,330
Grandpa...

360
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,100
We can't go back and change the past.

361
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,540
But we can spend the time we have left...

362
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,730
in a better way.

363
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,330
<i>I want o apologize to you again.</i>

364
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,560
I don't have the guts to show my face
 to your grandfather again.

365
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,020
You guys are always like this.

366
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,850
You didn't even ask me for advice.

367
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,560
Isn't there a sign prohibiting me on your house now?

368
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,440
Yeah.

369
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,440
That's actually a good idea.

370
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:52,940
P'Mes is here.

371
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,900
Sawasdee kha, P'Mes.

372
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,760
Sawasdee, Plaifah.

373
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,490
P'Mes said "Sawasdee."

374
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,610
Grandpa wants to establish a charity for

375
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,580
to help the dead with no relatives.

376
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,850
I came to ask you, P'Mes...

377
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,480
Actually I should be calling you Uncle, right?

378
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,890
Why do you need to ask P'Mes about starting a charity?

379
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,740
Because Grandpa use the name Wongsakorn Thanarungsiri...

380
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,740
for the charity.

381
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,600
So I want to ask permission first.

382
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,730
In the past,

383
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,220
our family has wronged you in many ways.

384
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,850
Grandpa wants to use this opportunity
 to atone for his sins.

385
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,980
And...

386
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,980
to let everyone know that ...

387
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,740
you are part of our family...

388
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,380
and you exist.

389
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:06,960
Thank you.

390
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,000
P'Mes says "Thank you."

391
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,340
There is one more thing we intend to do for you.

392
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,500
What is it?

393
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,200
We want to do the ChingMing worship for you, Uncle Mes.

394
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,740
Do you think a cup of milk tea can make
 up for the fact that you lied to me?

395
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,500
That's crazy.

396
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,500
I just wanted to buy it for you...

397
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,040
not to make up for tricking you.

398
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,690
Milk pudding tea, less sweet.

399
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,280
You know me well.

400
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,520
I just remember...

401
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,700
what you like and don't like.

402
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,370
What else?

403
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,060
Hmm?

404
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,250
You...

405
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,850
like whipping cream.

406
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,660
 You made a mess.

407
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:18,340
Hmm?

408
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:18,940
There.

409
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:19,700
Where?

410
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,360
Here.

411
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,420
Is it gone?

412
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:22,970
Not yet.

413
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,170
Over here.

414
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,280
There, there, there. Right there.

415
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,730
<i>You like to complain about spicy food, </i>

416
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,580
<i>but you still like to eat it.</i>

417
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,240
It's spicy.

418
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,680
You ordered a spicy dish, 
if it wasn't it would be crazy.

419
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,330
But it's delicious.

420
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:36,960
Want some?

421
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,880
Just eat.

422
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,180
And...

423
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,130
You like the color blue.

424
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,260
That's enough.

425
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,850
Did you bring this from home?

426
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,010
No, I didn't.

427
00:30:59,290 --> 00:30:59,850
But...

428
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,320
if it's romantic...

429
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,050
then give me some points.

430
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,220
Aren't you a quote making factory?

431
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,810
We are friends...

432
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,080
will it work to change our 
relationship from friend to lover?

433
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,800
Well...

434
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,200
90% of people who are dating...

435
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,460
they started...

436
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,170
from being friends.

437
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,010
Where did you get that statistic from?

438
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,360
The internet.

439
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,810
The number 21...

440
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,250
Because of love...

441
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,010
You look from afar...

442
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,010
but are not seen.

443
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
It's hard to utter...

444
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,080
the word love.

445
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,280
Because your current self isn't good enough.

446
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,370
If you turn to look at the one beside you...

447
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,960
to find a bigger heart is near you.

448
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,960
The love is already interwoven.

449
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,640
Just wait for the time that person looks back at you.

450
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,000
When the person afar realizes your feelings...

451
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,760
Not knowing one heart waits here too

452
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:18,580
Like love that always surrounds you...

453
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,920
Close to sight, close to heart...

454
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,650
but you ignore it.

455
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,090
I didn't prepare this.

456
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:39,450
Plai...

457
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,940
I...

458
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,500
Can you give me a chance?

459
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,200
I really like you.

460
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,610
I know.

461
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,520
But...

462
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,800
If one day...

463
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,580
this doesn't work out...

464
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,010
can we go back to being friends again?

465
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,300
Then...

466
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,480
that means that now...

467
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,100
Can you really smile by looking at the phone like that?

468
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,330
Ai'Prince and Plaifah are in a relationship now.

469
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,500
This makes me feel less guilty.

470
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,930
Where can you see that?

471
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,930
Here on Facebook.

472
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,530
If there was something that has been bothering me.
 It's the fact that we still can't touch other.

473
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,860
You're right, P'.

474
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,880
Why is it sometimes we...

475
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,800
P'.

476
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,780
Shouuld we try again?

477
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,220
Ai'Thun!

478
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,300
Ai'Thun!

479
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,940
Ai'Thun!

480
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,540
Thun?

481
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,540
I'm right here!

482
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,010
I knew you would be here.

483
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,060
What 's up?

484
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,540
What are you excited about? Did you win the lottery?

485
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,280
Not exactly but close.

486
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,780
I got the same number. I won. Two numbers matched. I won!

487
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,780
Where's P'Mes? Is P'Mes with you?

488
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,280
Why are you looking for P'Mes?

489
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
I won the lottery using P'Mes's age.

490
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,490
Exact match. No need to reverse digits. 22!

491
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,260
Here!

492
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,140
22?

493
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,740
Yes.

494
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,650
22. Why did you swap for your father?

495
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,880
I'm not going to be mad at you for insulting my father.

496
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,570
P'Mes khrap.

497
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,740
P'Mes.

498
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,080
Thank you so much, P'.

499
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,880
Thank you so much khrap.

500
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,210
P'Mes is sitting on the bench.

501
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,130
Over here?

502
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:22,660
Yes.

503
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,610
P'Mes khrap.

504
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,360
Thank you so much, P'.

505
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,970
Thank you khrap.

506
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,360
Oh, here, P'.

507
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,300
Take a look.

508
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,010
Here. 22.

509
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,600
-22.
- 22. Hug P'Mes, too.

510
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,100
Thank you so much, P'.

511
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,460
How do you expect me to hug him?

512
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,210
But it's alright.

513
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,490
Thank you so much, P'Mes.

514
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,520
I love you so much, P'Mes.

515
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,120
I love you so much.

516
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:14,640
Is it OK for P'Mes?

517
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:22,000
~ Tomorrow you will  leave me ~

518
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,260
~ Time leads you away from me ~

519
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:32,330
~ And I will never know how long I will have to wait ~

520
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,420
~ Just to see you today ~

521
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:47,050
~There is only silence in my heart ~

522
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,920
~ I want both of us ~

523
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:57,580
~ To remember this time forever ~

524
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:04,970
~ The way you look at me, only I can understand ~

525
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:10,440
~ There are so many words inside ~

526
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,080
~ I will remember you this way ~

527
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,250
~ Remember this feeling ~

528
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:22,930
~ Store them in my heart when we are far apart ~

529
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:27,650
~ I will look at you for the very last time ~

530
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,680
~ Will remember everything ~

531
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:36,140
~ And I will keep this heart for only you ~

532
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,240
~ I promise ~

533
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,340
~ I promise ~

534
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,540
I can't imagine, P'.

535
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,690
That if you are no longer with me...

536
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,200
How will I live my life?

537
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,000
Just like you lived before.

538
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,060
I like have you in my life much more.

539
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,010
I like it, too.

540
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,170
Sometimes I regret having a short life.

541
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,060
But it is also good.

542
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,900
If not, I would just be an old man.

543
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,200
We wouldn't have met each other.

544
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,200
We could certainly meet, P'.

545
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,200
I believe that.

546
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,080
Even though you are a ghost and I am human,

547
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,850
we still met each other.

548
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,650
If you're reincarnated...

549
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,060
would you rather be a girl or a boy?

550
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,120
Girl or boy is not important, Thun.

551
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,410
It's weird, right?

552
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,240
I've tried so hard to get reincarnated for so long.

553
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,090
But when the time is almost near...

554
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,450
I just want too stay longer.

555
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,540
I regret that the time we had

556
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,120
for the memories between us.

557
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,540
I will never forget, P'.

558
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,800
I promise.

559
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,460
Thun...

560
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,580
Can I ask you something?

561
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,580
What are your feelings for me?

562
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,220
I...

563
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,580
What's up, Plai?

564
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,180
Fine, Fine... Thank you so much.

565
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,490
What's the matter?

566
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,410
Plai said...

567
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,360
she set the date for you Chingming worship.

568
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,480
When?

569
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:57,940
This Sunday.

570
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:09,420
P'Mes.

571
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,650
There is a place I want to take you.

572
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,500
What a waste of time, right?

573
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,260
We should have told each other sooner.

574
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,720
Although my time is running out...

575
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,160
it is precious to me.

576
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,370
I remember when I was a kid...

577
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,370
every school break...

578
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,010
I would ask my mom to bring me here.

579
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,970
Before going to Chingming,

580
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,970
my dad would bring me here.

581
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:15,450
So...

582
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,850
who lives here now?

583
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,090
My mom.

584
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,460
For a long time, I didn't know why my mom chose to live here.

585
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,250
Why?

586
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,450
I think...

587
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,010
Mom doesn't want to see ghosts often,

588
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,080
so she chose to live far away.

589
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,480
And now a ghost came to her.

590
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,130
Oh...

591
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,380
You came so quietly.

592
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,170
Oh, You. Sawasdee.

593
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,330
Kwan.

594
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,650
Sawasdee kha, P'Mes.

595
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,320
Have you eaten yet?

596
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,320
Not yet.

597
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,610
Good. Let's have dinner together.

598
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,610
Let's have dinner together, OK?

599
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,660
Oh...

600
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,730
It's a bit strange, right?

601
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,730
I'm sorry, Kwan.

602
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:09,880
I...

603
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,880
don't know how to act either.

604
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:14,040
It's alright.

605
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,240
Let's say...

606
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,240
Kwan...

607
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,290
would like to warmly welcome you as my old friend.

608
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,410
And as a new friend of Thun's kha.

609
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,220
What are you saying?

610
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,580
So formal.

611
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,120
I don't know how to do it.

612
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,650
Let's just eat then. Eat. Eat.

613
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,650
Eat a lot, P'.

614
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,740
After we finish eating...

615
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:37,090
I will put the bed sheets in your room. They are in my room.

616
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,130
It's OK. I can do it myself, Mom.

617
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,650
Normally, he never brings anyone home but Prince and KhiaoKhiem.

618
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,330
I thought he would never have a lover.

619
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:49,810
You...

620
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,620
Hmm?

621
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,900
What?

622
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,520
"You" what?

623
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,520
I will go make the bed now.

624
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,530
I just teased you a bit, but look...

625
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,650
Actually...

626
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,050
I want to thank you...

627
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,960
for making Thun do better on his exams.

628
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,960
It was nothing, Kwan.

629
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,960
I just did what I could.

630
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,960
It's not just that.

631
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,300
The ups and downs Thun has had have been bad.

632
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,900
At first I thought he would lose his sports scholarship...

633
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,520
But...

634
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,050
he told me you helped him study for the exam.

635
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:33,060
Oh...

636
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,050
You already know what I've done.

637
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,050
I do.

638
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,660
Before he applied to university...

639
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,560
I didn't know that Thun wanted to study Law.

640
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,760
But now...

641
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:50,200
whatever he wants to learn, wants to do, or become...

642
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,200
it doesn't matter anymore.

643
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,600
As long as he can take care of himself it is enough.

644
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,810
There's no need for him to take care of me.

645
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,060
Kwan...

646
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,080
about me and Thun...

647
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,080
It's alright, P'.

648
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,400
There's no need to say it.

649
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:14,690
The feeling of love...

650
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:15,970
is hard to say...

651
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,970
And it is hard to stop, too.

652
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,130
But I do believe...

653
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,380
something that has happened is always something good.

654
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,330
Thank you, Kwan.

655
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:36,920
Well...

656
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,810
It's just like a scene in a movie, right?

657
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:41,170
It's like...

658
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,040
bringing his lover...

659
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,250
home to have dinner with his family.

660
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:52,330
I believe when you stay at someone's
 home, if you don't help out...

661
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:54,130
Oh, you want to help make the bed, right?

662
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:55,100
The room is there.

663
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,560
Then... I should go help Thun.

664
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:15,480
What are you looking at, P'?

665
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,360
Your pictures when you were young.

666
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:20,100
For real...

667
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,100
when you first met me...

668
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,650
you weren't scared at all?

669
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,290
If you looked at yourself in the mirror...

670
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,100
you would know your face is not scary at all.

671
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,490
There goes my reputation as a ghost.

672
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,960
Umm... P'...

673
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,480
When I was a kid...

674
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,610
the day I got to go to Chingming,

675
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:43,170
I would wake up very early because I want
 to got there as soon as possible.

676
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,170
What a weird kid.

677
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,210
It's true, P'.

678
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:47,370
Well...

679
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,180
when I went to Chingming...

680
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,970
I knew I would get to see you.

681
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,080
Then...

682
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,500
is this a photo of us?

683
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,650
See? I was right here then.

684
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,500
Not that picture.

685
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,500
Here...

686
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,520
This is our picture.

687
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:09,610
This one.

688
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,900
How can that be a picture of us?

689
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:15,900
I can't see myself in it.

690
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,340
You're not there?

691
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:20,860
Just wait a moment...

692
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,080
Here.

693
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,780
If you remember my face like that...

694
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:37,680
I'll be mad.

695
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,780
Even though I don't see you...

696
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,370
I know that you were right there.

697
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,660
Right here.

698
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:47,560
Over there.

699
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,720
Over there.

700
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,130
Everywhere we went together...

701
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:52,500
you are there in all of them.

702
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,740
You really shouldn't have grown up.

703
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:11,330
P'...

704
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,210
Are you asleep?

705
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,530
Not yet.

706
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,610
I don't wan't tomorrow to come.

707
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:51,920
I probably won't sleep tonight, P'.

708
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,880
Me, too.

709
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:57,880
Then...

710
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,880
how about we take turns asking 
each other questions, OK?

711
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,010
Like the first time you took me out of the cemetery?

712
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,320
When the joss stick burned out.

713
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:10,970
You can ask me, P'.

714
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,970
I'll answer all your questions.

715
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,620
In that case...

716
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,330
what did you wish for on your birthday?

717
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,060
I wish for miracles to be real.

718
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,810
I wish for you to know who you are.

719
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,780
And for me to find a way to help you.

720
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,080
What about the song you sang on your birthday?

721
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,570
<i>Who did you sing it for?</i>

722
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,060
Well...

723
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,860
I sang it for someone who introduced the song to me.

724
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:57,260
So...

725
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,330
have you ever thought about...

726
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,570
when our relationship changed between us?

727
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:11,090
Actually, it never changed.

728
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:19,700
Because since the first time I met
 you I have always felt this way.

729
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,690
You are special to me.

730
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,920
Even though...

731
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,460
I wasn't clear at that time...

732
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,840
what I was.

733
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:38,380
P'...

734
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,680
Do you remember when you asked me...

735
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,770
how I felt about you?

736
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,450
I love you, P'.

737
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,330
 No matter who you are...

738
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:02,940
or what you are...

739
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,210
I still love you.

740
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,860
You have already asked me lots of questions.

741
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,860
Let me ask you a question.

742
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:31,800
So...

743
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,500
What are your feelings for me?

744
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,880
I love you, Thun.

745
00:51:57,970 --> 00:51:59,850
But I wasn't brave enough to tell you.

746
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:02,300
I was afraid I woudl ruin everything.

747
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,410
Regardless...

748
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,970
I still found my happiness.

749
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,450
What a waste of time, right?

750
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,260
We should have told each other sooner.

751
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,140
It's alright.

752
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,180
It's alright, Ai'Thun.

753
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:32,260
Although our time together is running out...

754
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,860
it is still precious to me.

755
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,280
Just before I leave this world...

756
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,820
I have someone I love.

757
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,200
And he also loves me.

758
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,580
So shall we try to close our eyes and make a wish?

759
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,810
<i>If there is really is a miracle...</i>

760
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:12,460
<i>I wish to hug the person I love...</i>

761
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:13,920
<i>one more time.</i>

762
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,240
~ How many more days? ~

763
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,770
Is this true?

764
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,570
~ How many more nights? ~

765
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,480
Yes, P'.

766
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,010
~That I will have you with me ~

767
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,530
We can really touch each other.

768
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,460
~ How many breaths ~

769
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:05,880
~ Can we meet each other happily ~

770
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:11,580
~ We only have a little time left ~

771
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,660
~ For me to prepare my heart ~

772
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:25,450
~ What will now only be in my memories ~

773
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,200
I know now, P'.

774
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,690
Everytime when we could touch each other...

775
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:24,680
It was because of my wish.

776
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,160
A wish from my from my heart.

777
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:33,690
~ From now on, from this moment ~

778
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:38,400
~ I will count every breath ~

779
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,240
~ I want to keep the time ~

780
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,680
~ Every memory in my heart ~

781
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:51,760
~ From now on, from this moment ~

782
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,730
~ I will love you with all my heart ~

783
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:03,890
 ~ I remember you from today until the day we part ~

784
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:08,970
~ That I love you ~

785
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:12,160
~ How much has been lost ~

786
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,610
~ Because time passed by ~

787
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:23,170
~I regret our yesterdays ~

788
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:29,580
~ What I did for you wasn't enought ~

789
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:35,580
~ For the time we have left, every single moment ~

790
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:40,420
~ From today to the last day ~

791
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:37,970
P'Mes

792
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:48,370
~ I will do everything with all my heart ~

793
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,210
I'm not letting you go anywhere, OK?

794
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:54,100
~ From now on, from this moment ~

795
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:59,490
~ I will count every breath ~

796
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:02,050
~ I want to keep the time ~

797
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:06,120
~ Every memory in my heart ~

798
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:12,770
~ From today to the last day ~

799
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:17,650
~ I will love you with all my heart ~

800
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:24,560
 ~ I remember you from today until the day we part ~

801
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:29,000
~ That I love you ~

802
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:36,400
Can you promise me?

803
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,280
If I'm not here anymore...

804
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,380
you have to be happy,  OK?

805
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,060
Can it not end like this?

806
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:00,980
KhiaoKhiem.

807
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:02,130
Prince.

808
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:06,170
I want to thank you for helping Thun out for me.

809
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,700
P'Mes says thank you to both of you...

810
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:12,050
for helping me with P'Mes problem.

811
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:15,960
It was a pleasure, P'Mes.

812
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,080
I am sorry, P'...

813
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:23,020
for sometimes making things hard for you and Thun.

814
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,440
It's alright.

815
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,060
If we didn't have both of you...

816
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,450
we probably wouldn't have been successful.

817
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,000
Plai...

818
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,680
I want to thank you.

819
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,540
Don't blame yourself.

820
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,540
Don't feel guilty.

821
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,800
What you have for me...

822
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:57,200
is good enough for me.

823
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,250
P'Mes says,

824
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,490
Thank you...

825
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:03,740
Don't blame yourself.

826
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:05,740
and not to feel bad for him.

827
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,060
What you are doing...

828
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,060
means a lot to P'Mes.

829
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,810
Thank you kha.

830
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,330
Please remember this, Uncle Mes.

831
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,840
You are a Thanarungsiri.

832
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,580
You are a member of our family.

833
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,370
You will always exist, Uncle.

834
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:33,370
And you will always bee in my heart.

835
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,320
Please tell Uncle Phop for me...

836
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,120
that I forgive him.

837
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,490
Take care of him well, Plai.

838
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:52,300
Please tell Grandpa...

839
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,660
that P'Mes forgives him.

840
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,440
Take good care of him.

841
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:00,860
I will.

842
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:03,300
I promise.

843
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,140
Thank you, Kwan.

844
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,460
I am glad we got to meet again.

845
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,860
I was blessed...

846
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:29,420
for you to be part of my life.

847
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,530
You have become a great mother.

848
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,610
Look at him.

849
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:44,240
Thank you to your family...

850
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,160
for taking care of me since I was alive...

851
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,080
until now.

852
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,820
Please don't worry about Kwan.

853
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,490
Thun is smart.

854
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:55,960
He will be able to take care of me.

855
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:05,050
And some day,

856
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,380
we will meet again.

857
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:11,860
Until next time.

858
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,000
My time has come.

859
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,900
Be happy for me, P'Jeng. Angoon.

860
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,000
I am extremely happy.

861
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:52,370
Why would I be sad?

862
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,650
Good luck.

863
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:57,860
Lonely ghost.

864
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:04,340
Ai'Mes...

865
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,020
May we meet again someday.

866
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:16,600
I love you P'Jeng and Angoon.

867
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,700
Thank you for everything you have done for me.

868
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,160
Thun?

869
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:56,010
~ Someone is right here ~

870
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:53,650
Thun?

871
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:03,130
~ All alone, can’t you see? ~

872
01:02:57,890 --> 01:02:59,130
Don't scold me..

873
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:01,940
but I don't want you to leave.

874
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,410
~ Not loud enough to make you hear ~

875
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:12,410
~ No matter how many times I’ve tried to tell you ~

876
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,170
No one can resist the truth, Thun.

877
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:18,340
~ You just can’t see my love ~

878
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:14,940
And because we can't resist the truth...

879
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:17,740
we have to accept it.

880
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,890
It is the least painful way.

881
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:25,170
~ Have you ever felt it? ~

882
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:26,650
But why does it have to be this way?

883
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:33,210
~ It never seems like you do ~

884
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:29,360
Because everything is predestined.

885
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,620
Can't there be a miracle?

886
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:41,850
 ~ All I can do is love you. A mystery that can never be solved ~

887
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,650
Can it not end like this?

888
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,010
From the first day we met until now...

889
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:47,540
~ I cannot bring myself to say ‘I love you’ ~

890
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,570
has been the greatest miracle in my life.

891
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:47,540
I don't expect anymore that this.

892
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:54,050
~ I am right here. Can you see me? ~

893
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,000
How should I live from now on?

894
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:02,890
~ I am in all your stories. Embracing you with love. ~

895
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:58,720
Can you promise me one thing?

896
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,250
If I am no longer here...

897
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:09,640
~ Is a fading shadow of someone who cares ~

898
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,640
you must be happy, OK?

899
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:16,140
~ What can I do to make you see? ~

900
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,960
I will try, P'.

901
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:24,650
~ If I could, I wish you could feel my love ~

902
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,010
Can you please do it for me?

903
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:31,500
~ I dream we would be in love, instead of you looking right through me ~

904
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:31,640
Thun...

905
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:38,760
~ I yearn to manifest love to you ~

906
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:36,400
We only have one life...

907
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:40,130
Live it to the fullest.

908
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,130
~ For once I wish I could tell you ~

909
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:49,680
~ That my heart is wholly yours ~

910
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,610
Be happy every single day

911
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,160
you have left in you life.

912
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,680
My giant kid.

913
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:24,620
~ I am right here. Can you see me? ~

914
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:28,370
~ I am in all your stories ~

915
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:33,740
~ Embracing you with love ~

916
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:40,400
~ Is a fading shadow of someone who cares ~

917
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:46,920
~ What can I do to make you see? ~

918
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:55,610
~ If I could, I wish you could feel my love ~

919
01:05:55,810 --> 01:06:02,330
~ I dream we would be in love, instead of you looking right through me ~

920
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:09,850
~ I yearn to manifest love to you ~

921
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,610
By the way, what's your name?

922
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:10,520
We've been talking for so long but 
don't know each others names.

923
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:13,090
~ For once I wish I could tell you ~

924
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:12,730
My name is Thun.

925
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:14,730
My name is P'Mes.

926
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:21,040
~ That my heart is yours no matter what ~

927
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:15,850
Khrap, P'Mes.

928
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:28,290
~ For once I wish I could tell you ~

929
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:36,560
~ That my heart is wholly yours ~

930
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,040
I love you, P'.

931
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,050
Fighting.

932
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:23,780
I'll wait for you in the car.

933
01:07:58,570 --> 01:07:59,820
It's too much of a coincidence, P'.

934
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,080
P'Mes?

935
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,920
Why are you here?

936
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,720
How is it possible, P'?

937
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,360
Didn't you wish for a miracle?

938
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,130
Hey guys?

939
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:31,320
What is it?

940
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,800
<i>Who is Ai'Thun talking to?</i>

941
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:36,680
Aren't you used to it?

942
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:39,240
Your friend not like anyone else.

943
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,240
Right...

944
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,900
So I really have to get used to this?

945
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,580
Of course.

946
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:52,320
Wait...

947
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:54,320
Why are you here? I'm confused.

948
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:57,620
I don't know either.

949
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,690
But when I was about to go to the light...

950
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:03,200
there was a voice telling me

951
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,200
that is not my time yet and to wait.

952
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:08,240
But you already met all the conditions.

953
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,370
My relatives already did the blessing for me.

954
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:14,500
I know why I died already.

955
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:16,900
Or maybe...

956
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:19,050
You still haven't fulfilled your life expectancy!?!

957
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:21,050
It is not your time yet!

958
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:23,170
Yeah ~

959
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,840
Ai'Thun, that guy..

960
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:31,820
Something got in my eye.

961
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,180
You alright?

962
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:38,500
Yeah, let's go.

963
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:56,100
What's wrong with you, Ai'Khiem?

964
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:57,680
Guys?

965
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:58,290
Yes?

966
01:09:58,760 --> 01:09:59,580
Who's that?

967
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,640
Who did she come here with?

968
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,100
Damn...

969
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,640
So pale...

970
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,320
Definitely like BNK.

971
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:17,850
What are you talking about, Ai'Khiem?

972
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,570
What girl are you talking about?

973
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:20,040
Yeah...

974
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:21,320
Over there.

975
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,500
The one shaking her hips. Don't you see?

976
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:24,290
Are you crazy?

977
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:26,140
The only girls here are me and Mom Kwan.

978
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:30,000
What the...

979
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,660
Pretty like that....

980
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:33,580
I will go talk to her for a bit.

981
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:35,320
Dude, dude.

982
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,780
Yes?

983
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:37,570
I will be right back.

984
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:38,650
- Umm
 - Huh?

985
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:40,720
Do I look handsome?

986
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:41,820
Extremely handsome.

987
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,820
He is going that way, then we better go this way.

988
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:45,260
You're crazy!

989
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:46,780
Let's go!

990
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:50,920
No one would believe me if I told them...

991
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,920
that our story...

992
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:54,580
began with...

993
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:56,580
Just a piece of candy?

994
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:58,970
Seriously,

995
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:00,970
why did you give me candy that day?

996
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:02,970
Because...

997
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:04,650
your grave was so old...

998
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:05,890
so I felt sad for you.

999
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:09,460
Are you saying that you have been
 kind since you were a kid?

1000
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,090
Handsome since I was a kid is better.

1001
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,260
Hey, P'...

1002
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:18,080
You have liked me since I was kid, right?

1003
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:20,770
That's crazy.

1004
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:22,090
Who would think like that?

1005
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,520
You're crazy.

1006
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:24,560
Well, because...

1007
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,560
when I was a kid I was so handsome...

1008
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,680
and so fair skinned like a Chinese boy.

1009
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:30,930
Did you really not like me?

1010
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:33,420
Think again.

1011
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,600
Lying is a sin, you will go to hell, you know.

1012
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,340
Tell me frankly.

1013
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,500
Did you like me?

1014
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,940
Yes, a little bit.

1015
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:49,250
Then...

1016
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:51,250
what about our relationship after this?

1017
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:56,240
I don't know if the room owner wants me
 to come back with him or not.

1018
01:11:58,730 --> 01:11:59,240
But...

1019
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:01,610
the rent is expensive, P'.

1020
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:03,610
Will you be able to pay it?

1021
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:07,080
I don't have any money.

1022
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:09,080
Can I pay with something else?

1023
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:14,850
How will you pay me then?

1024
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:18,290
Hold on...

1025
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:20,040
What does that smile mean?

1026
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:22,040
That depends on how you think.

1027
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,160
Is that's the kind of person you really are?

1028
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:27,930
You just noticed?

1029
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:31,850
Alright.

1030
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:34,570
Wait, P'.

1031
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,540
I've never seen you make that kind of face before.

1032
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:38,690
Oh...

1033
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,140
I never told you I was innocent.

1034
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:43,520
Hey...

1035
01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:45,940
Should I start to be afraid of you now?

1036
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:53,050
It feels like I am about to be haunted by a ghost.

1037
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,000
Not yet.

1038
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:55,580
If you are going to be haunted,

1039
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,170
it should be like this.

1040
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,930
Nobody knows...

1041
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:03,100
how long we will stay in this world.

1042
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,680
or when our time will run out.

1043
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:07,360
Me or Thun,

1044
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:09,490
one of us will leave the world first.

1045
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:10,680
Therefore...

1046
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,480
if there is a chance to love,

1047
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:14,480
love with all your heart.

1048
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:17,050
Since we never know what tomorrow brings.

1049
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:18,360
Then...

1050
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,160
let that be tomorrow's story.

1051
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:22,690
For today,

1052
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,410
we live every day,

1053
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:25,760
every time,

1054
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,330
every moment to the best.

1055
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:30,280
It is worth it that we are still alive.

1056
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:33,130
That alone is enough.

1057
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:36,130
