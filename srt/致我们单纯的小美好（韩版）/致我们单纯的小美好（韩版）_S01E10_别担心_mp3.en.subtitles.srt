1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,373
You've waited for me without fretting

2
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:44,252
And entered my heart peacefully

3
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:49,924
You're lovely from head to toe

4
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:55,180
I'm proud that you're my woman

5
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,932
Jin-hwan.

6
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,603
What is it, Sol-i? You're scaring me.

7
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:05,148
My MP3 player battery's dead.

8
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,358
No, never. This is practically part of me.

9
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,528
You borrowed my book, too.
Are you trying to take everything from me?

10
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,660
Excuse me, Heon.

11
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,872
Heon. I made these over the weekend.

12
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,208
Here.

13
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:27,462
I made some cookies,
and I wanted to give you some.

14
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,173
Enjoy.

15
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,261
Please.

16
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,429
Hi, guys.

17
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,396
What's wrong?

18
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,316
My MP3 player battery's dead.

19
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,567
I see.

20
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,530
-Here, use mine.
-What?

21
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,532
-Don't you need to listen to it?
-No.

22
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,617
Thanks so much.

23
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,633
Compound relative pronouns

24
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:18,096
are formed by adding "ever"
to relative pronouns. Do you remember?

25
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,222
-Yes.
-Yes.

26
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,015
"Now I know one thing.

27
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,185
I'm still living,
even though I feel like I'm dying.

28
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,855
'I feel like I'm dying.
This isn't living.'

29
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,108
A life that echoes these words
is still a life."

30
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,570
Goodness. This is so sad.

31
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,697
Hey. Sol-i.

32
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,824
Wait. I only have few pages left.

33
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,702
What?

34
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,623
-Shin Sol-i.
-Yes.

35
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,333
Yes?

36
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,046
Hardly a day goes by
that you don't pay attention in class.

37
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,048
I'm sorry, ma'am.

38
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,466
Give me that, too.

39
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,218
Pardon?

40
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,095
What else?

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,066
-You can't have them for a week.
-Wait, Ms. Moon.

42
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,861
You can take the book,

43
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:18,239
but could you please
give the MP3 player back?

44
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,407
No.

45
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,546
Sol-i.

46
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,464
What?

47
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,134
"You can take the book, but could you
please give the MP3 player back?"

48
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:42,222
I can just pay the late fee for your book,

49
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,642
but he can't survive
without his MP3 player for a week.

50
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,268
Anyway, I'm really sorry, guys.

51
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,313
It's okay. I have another one at the pool.

52
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,400
I brought a lot of heat packs today.
Who needs them?

53
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,569
Me! Give me two.

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,823
Ha-young, don't catch a cold.
There's a flu going around.

55
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,326
-I'm okay.
-I'm worried about you.

56
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,578
I heard it's a nasty flu.

57
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,914
You might have to be hospitalized
if you catch it.

58
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,167
I won't get to see you then.

59
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,503
Jeez, you're so annoying.

60
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,963
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

61
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:16,923
This one is warmer.

62
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,062
I think Heon is done eating.

63
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,107
Heon, wait for me.
Don't you need a heat pack?

64
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,200
"I wish to live.
I wish to live in Cheongsan.

65
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,496
I wish to eat wild grapes and hardy kiwis
as I live in Cheongsan."

66
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,540
This song has

67
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,919
a very stable structure of A-A-B-A.

68
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,797
Su-jin, are you okay?

69
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,717
Hui-ji, you too?

70
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,011
Sir, she's been coughing
since the first period.

71
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,555
You should've told me sooner.

72
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,475
Let's go to the health office. Get up.

73
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,520
I'm sorry, guys. Do some self-study, okay?

74
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,896
-Yes, sir.
-My goodness.

75
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,148
You should've told me.

76
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,114
Hey, do you think they have the flu?

77
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,574
I saw the news yesterday,

78
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,285
and it said that you can die
from this year's flu.

79
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,788
Once someone catches it,
it spreads really quickly.

80
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,624
One out of ten will die from the flu.

81
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,793
How many of us will die then?

82
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,795
Three people?

83
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,006
Two already got the flu.
Who's the last one?

84
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,468
Stop lying, Se-hyeong.
People don't die from the flu.

85
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,219
They said it's serious this time.

86
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,306
Don't you watch the news?
Some people already died overseas.

87
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,724
Die?

88
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,983
Sol-i! Sol-i's next!

89
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,651
Sol-i. She's next.

90
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,910
A lot of vaccines have been developed.

91
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,913
If you get treated in time, you won't die.

92
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,499
No, my mom said you would.

93
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,837
Brother, are you okay?

94
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,798
You're not sick, are you?

95
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,674
No, I'm okay.

96
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:29,222
We should get treated in time, then.

97
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,361
Darn it. Look at Sol-i.
She looks really sick.

98
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,572
You're right. She doesn't look well.

99
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,740
Ha-young.

100
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,160
Am I going to die? I won't, will I?

101
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,373
Sol-i, it'll be all right.
Nothing will happen.

102
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,876
You should go to the health office first.

103
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,419
Shall I go with you?

104
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,924
No, it's okay. I can go on my own.

105
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,585
Sir, where is Su-jin?

106
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:44,547
Su-jin's condition got worse,
so she went to the hospital.

107
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,300
Sol-i, you have a mild fever.

108
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,844
Do you have any other symptoms?

109
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:53,014
No. I just sneezed twice.

110
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,765
I'm totally fine, Mr. Lee.

111
00:07:55,975 --> 00:08:00,438
So it can't be the flu, right?

112
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,232
Take some medicine and rest up first.

113
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,238
By the way, why do you have
dark circles under your eyes?

114
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,075
That's strange.

115
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,371
Take some rest first.

116
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,666
Okay.

117
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,609
Yes, ma'am.

118
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,778
It's nothing serious.

119
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,863
Yes. Don't worry.

120
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,032
Yes, ma'am.

121
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,828
I heard back from Su-jin.

122
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,622
She has the flu.

123
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,125
It's very contagious,
so why don't we send everyone home?

124
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,794
Let's do it right away.

125
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,088
Send all the students home.

126
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,423
Quarantine the two students

127
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,218
in the health office
until the others go home.

128
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,054
I'll report this
to the principal right now.

129
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,013
Okay.

130
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,683
All right. Move it.

131
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,603
I never thought
I'd thank Su-jin for anything.

132
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,523
No, I should thank the flu, not Su-jin.

133
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,983
Flu, thank you!

134
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,693
-Let's go to the internet cafe.
-Sure, let's go.

135
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,363
Will you go see Sol-i?

136
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,867
Heon, aren't you going to see Sol-i?

137
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,413
Make up your mind right now.

138
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,499
Let's go without him.

139
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,417
Come on.

140
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,711
Heon, why aren't you coming?

141
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,589
She'd rather see you than us!

142
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,300
Gosh.

143
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,799
-Brother.
-Sol-i.

144
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,135
-Sol-i.
-Guys.

145
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,889
Why are you here?

146
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,224
Because we're worried.
Are you okay, Brother?

147
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,101
-Are you okay?
-What did the nurse say?

148
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,146
I'm okay. I don't feel sick at all.

149
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,107
By the way, where's Heon?

150
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,529
Heon? He couldn't come

151
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,823
because Ms. Moon asked him
to do something.

152
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,619
I see.

153
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:06,248
Brother, you'll be able to go home soon,
so don't worry.

154
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,334
Okay. Thanks.

155
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,544
You should go home now.

156
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,921
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

157
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,465
-Bye.
-Thanks.

158
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,552
Bye.

159
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,834
OUR HAPPY TIME

160
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:11,981
Why are you here?

161
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,774
Well…

162
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,946
Could you give this to her?

163
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,247
To whom?

164
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,601
Heon asked me to give this to one of you.
Whose is this?

165
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,937
But that's Heon's.

166
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,857
Give it to me, sir.

167
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,151
I asked him to lend it to me.

168
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,819
Okay.

169
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,318
ON

170
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,962
This is Heon's voice.

171
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,675
I'm hearing things now.

172
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,387
Am I really sick?

173
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,933
Don't go anywhere else.
Go straight home, okay?

174
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,810
If you go somewhere else,

175
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,562
you'll get a scolding, okay?

176
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,313
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

177
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,525
Mr. Lee, when will Sol-i get to go home?

178
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,571
I'm still monitoring her.
You should go home first.

179
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,823
I'm worried about Sol-i.

180
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:31,620
When a space probe is out of order
in space,

181
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,748
do you know what the other probes
have to do?

182
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,834
They have to stand by.

183
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,879
So you should go home first.

184
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,178
He must be into space, too.

185
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,516
Ha-young, I think he caught the flu, too.

186
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,768
"Space"? "Probe"?

187
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,479
What was that? What was he talking about?

188
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,065
You don't need to know.

189
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:05,404
"Love is to endure anything
for someone gladly

190
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,200
and at times to take courage
to change oneself."

191
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,160
What's this?

192
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,787
-"That's what I realized through Yun-su."
-What's that?

193
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,997
What's he talking about?

194
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,208
That brat. I'll catch you.

195
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,878
"In our near-80 years of life,

196
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,507
we said we didn't know,
and simply turned away

197
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,011
from the dark back alleys,
the abandoned forests,

198
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,933
the valley of terror, the desert of truth,

199
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:38,228
and the arrogant, harsh rivers.

200
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,564
And we will have thought,

201
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:45,402
'It starts with a small stream
with a different name.'

202
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,448
-"'But it flows and reaches a place.'"
-This is Heon's voice, right?

203
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,117
-"'It's called the sea.'"
-Goodness, Sol-i.

204
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,536
She'll get all better now.

205
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,165
"I said quietly,

206
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,585
'Rest in peace.

207
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,881
I love you, Mother.'"

208
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,596
OUR HAPPY TIME

209
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,099
"And…

210
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,103
he said,

211
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,690
'Don't worry.'"

212
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,539
I'd love to be sick a bit longer.

213
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,353
OUR HAPPY TIME

214
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,566
NO, THANKS
I WON'T MARRY YOU!

215
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,528
No, thanks. I won't marry you!

216
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,834
Who in the world did this?

217
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,127
Come out this instant!

218
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,920
Open the door!

219
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,048
Who's in there?

220
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,383
Open up! One, two…

221
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,219
Who locked the door…

222
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,475
Why are you here?

223
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,643
Are you the only one here?

224
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,063
Who else is in here?

225
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,316
Come out. Hey.

226
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,444
Hui-ji, you've gotten much better.

227
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,113
Sol-i, you don't have a fever anymore.

228
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,531
You can go home now.

229
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,491
Okay.

230
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,077
Is Su-jin okay?

231
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,330
Yes, she'll be fine if she takes medicine
and gets some rest.

232
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,582
Okay, thank you.

233
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,104
Heon, are you done
with the apology letter?

234
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,065
Shall I write it for you?
I can finish it in a minute.

235
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,988
I'm almost done.

236
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,869
SHIN SOL-I

237
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,334
-What's up?
-Heon.

238
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,629
I think you should host a radio show.

239
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,965
No, you could be a singer.

240
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,968
I knew you had a great voice,

241
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,263
but it sounded really nice
through the speakers.

242
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,640
Today I started reading this book called

243
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,976
He Was Cool Like a Wolf.

244
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,062
The male protagonist is really cool.

245
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,066
Can you read this for me, too?

246
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,527
-I'll think about it.
-Really?

247
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,989
You didn't say no.
You said you'd think about it.

248
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:17,906
Yes.

249
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,659
Thank you, Heon.

250
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,175
Sol-i.

251
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,928
I have something to tell you
about the flu.

252
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,809
Flu literally causes symptoms
which are much worse than a cold.

253
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,686
In other words,

254
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,564
it's like a severe cold.

255
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,901
Symptoms of the flu are just like a cold.

256
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,571
Usually, you get better
after several days.

257
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:02,075
And for young, healthy people,
it doesn't cause much problem.

258
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,956
Sorry. I didn't poop this morning.

259
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,588
You should record again.

260
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,552
Gosh. Sorry again.

261
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,541
Will that be enough?
Your rival prepared something huge.

262
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,877
-Who would like a wild girl like you?
-I do.

263
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,545
I told you I'd get you a star.

264
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,423
The only star in space
that's named Kang Ha-young.

265
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,884
-They said it'd snow.
-Do you believe the weather forecast?

266
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,844
-It's snowing!
-Who did this?

267
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,848
-I hope it snows this Christmas.
-Heon, take this.

268
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,059
-I don't want to wear this.
-Just wear it. It's cold.

269
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,686
Put them on. I'm not cold.

270
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,854
-What?
-It's dangerous.

271
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:20,153
