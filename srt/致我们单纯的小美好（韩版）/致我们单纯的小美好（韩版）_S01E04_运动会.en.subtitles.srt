1
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:40,915
JUNE 2006, SUMMER OF SEVENTEEN

2
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,966
Why do you look so sad?

3
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,385
What about you? Why are you so sad?

4
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,222
CHA HEON'S BIRTHDAY

5
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,516
Heon's birthday is coming up.

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,393
I want to buy him a watch,

7
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,187
but I'm broke.

8
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,563
What about you?

9
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,898
FIELD DAY

10
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,526
I want to buy my dad a gift,
but I'm short of money.

11
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,946
If it's a gift for your dad,

12
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,033
I'll chip in.

13
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,332
Forget it. That's nowhere near enough.

14
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,752
Great. Then, I'll take it.
Many a little makes a mickle.

15
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,171
Many a little makes a little.
Give me that.

16
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,841
Guys, breaking news!
You won't believe this.

17
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,718
I just overheard the faculty meeting.

18
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,970
Guess what the first prize is
for the field day?

19
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,640
It's…

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,351
-A whopping…
-"Whopping"?

21
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,393
Spit it out.

22
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,646
A 1,500,000-won gift certificate!

23
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,399
It's a 1,500,000-won gift certificate!

24
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,485
-Isn't it awesome?
-One and a half million?

25
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,113
That's about 50,000 won per person.

26
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,119
Guys, while we're at it,

27
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,329
does anyone want to do the hurdle relay?

28
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,998
It consists of 50m hurdles, a sack race,

29
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,417
and eating a hot dog while hula hooping.

30
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,794
You have to do all three.

31
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,212
-Shall we?
-Yes.

32
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,213
We'll do it.

33
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,721
-One, two, three.
-Let's go!

34
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,266
-Do you want to start practicing today?
-Yes.

35
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,950
Run. Faster.

36
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,410
Faster.

37
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,870
This way.

38
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,372
Go faster.

39
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,623
Faster.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,751
I'm sure we'll win first place.

41
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,421
-Right? 1.5 million won is ours.
-Ours.

42
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:55,758
Hey, Ha-young. I got you boiled eggs.

43
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,678
Eat up. You need a lot of protein
before the field day.

44
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,346
You're making sense for once.

45
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,556
Here you go.

46
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,934
I'm offering you all the eggs I have.

47
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,895
Thanks.

48
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,771
If it's okay with you,

49
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,732
may I devote my life to you, too?

50
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,902
No.

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,531
Hey, Sol-i. You're the last runner
in the hurdle relay.

52
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,116
Go for it.

53
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,581
Shin Sol-i.

54
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,417
The fate of the 1.5 million won
is in your hands.

55
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:13,962
Don't worry.

56
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:14,963
I'll be your coach.

57
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,673
Let's see how good you are first.

58
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,259
He's an athlete. He must be good.

59
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,079
THEORY AND PRACTICE
OF TRACK AND FIELD HURDLES

60
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,367
Heon!

61
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,077
I think we were meant to be.

62
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,953
I can't believe
we bumped into each other here.

63
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,501
Heon, I keep knocking over hurdles.

64
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,753
Is it because I can't keep my balance?

65
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,047
By the way,

66
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,841
weren't you good at hurdling
in middle school?

67
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,176
I won't help you.

68
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,596
You're so cold.

69
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,725
What's that book about?

70
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,061
I just picked it.

71
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,604
HUMAN ANATOMY

72
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,897
Bye.

73
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,235
He just picked it?

74
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,033
Did you find the book
your coach asked you to find?

75
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,245
No. It's not here.

76
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,330
Let's just go practice.

77
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,374
Okay.

78
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,089
Am I taking too much
of your training time?

79
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,299
No worries. I practiced a lot already.

80
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:06,717
All right.

81
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,639
When you're hurdling,
the quicker the jump, the better!

82
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,559
Lean forward as you run.

83
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,310
Lower your center of gravity.

84
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,187
And most importantly…

85
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,025
DON'T LOSE YOUR BALANCE

86
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,528
Don't lose your balance!

87
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,700
Give it a try.

88
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,805
Are you okay?

89
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,392
You did great.

90
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,936
Good. You're fast.

91
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,646
Come on.

92
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,940
That's not how you do it.

93
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:03,858
What are you doing?

94
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,943
-Get out.
-No.

95
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,945
Watch how I do it and learn.

96
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,655
-Get out.
-What? No, thanks.

97
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,656
Get out.

98
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,743
-No.
-Get out. I'll teach you.

99
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,997
Hey, are you okay?

100
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,499
What's your problem?

101
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,751
Ha-young, are you okay? Can you walk?

102
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,753
All I did was pull the bag a little.

103
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,087
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,089
I'll take her to the nurse's office.

105
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,642
Get off me.

106
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,937
-Ha-young, are you okay?
-Are you okay?

107
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,899
-One, two, three.
-Three.

108
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,826
How did you get hurt?

109
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,288
She fell while practicing for
the field day and sprained her ankle.

110
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,334
Mr. Lee, is Ha-young
going to be all right?

111
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:08,297
Can someone die
from spraining their ankle?

112
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,175
Why are you overreacting?

113
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,719
Mr. Lee, I'm really okay,

114
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,513
and I recover really quickly.

115
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,015
I'll be perfectly fine in a few days.

116
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,101
It's swollen quite a bit. Are you sure?

117
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,228
You have to go to the hospital.

118
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,272
You need to wear a splint.

119
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,315
You can't join the race.

120
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,900
Ask someone else to do it.

121
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,319
But I have to.

122
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,904
Ha-young, listen to Mr. Lee.

123
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,698
I'll find someone to replace you.

124
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,955
I'll wash your hair

125
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,582
and carry your backpack.

126
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,875
I'll be your hands and feet.

127
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,919
Do you need anything?

128
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,046
Stop it, Jin-hwan.

129
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,134
It doesn't hurt much, though.

130
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,321
SHIN SOL-I

131
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,910
Heon, what are you doing?

132
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,412
I'm studying. What's up?

133
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,498
Well, it's nothing important.

134
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,418
Come to think of it,
because of the hurdle practice,

135
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,962
we haven't biked home together in a while.

136
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,006
You're talking as if we do that every day.

137
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,343
We still bike home together quite often.

138
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:40,056
Heon, how about we
we meet at the playground briefly?

139
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,599
Now?

140
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,559
But I'm studying right now.

141
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,228
I have something to tell you.

142
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,441
Say it over the phone.

143
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:54,987
Well, Ha-young hurt her leg today.

144
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,199
It's because Se-hyeong suddenly
pulled a prank.

145
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:03,162
So the school nurse said
she might not be able to do the race.

146
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,581
But you don't need to worry.

147
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,626
It's not serious.
She'll get better with a little rest.

148
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,378
-Okay.
-Oh, right!

149
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,296
Something really funny happened.

150
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,757
Jin-hwan tried to lift Ha-young up.

151
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,469
But he couldn't. He struggled so hard.

152
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,096
Isn't it so funny?

153
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,309
Heon, are you listening?

154
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,645
-Yes.
-Okay.

155
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,147
Anyway, we need to find a replacement
for Ha-young.

156
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,191
It's too bad, isn't it?

157
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,202
Jeez.

158
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,083
Do you know why she's practicing so hard?

159
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,251
She wants to buy

160
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,545
a birthday present for someone.

161
00:11:59,093 --> 00:11:59,927
Heon!

162
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:13,858
Dae-sung, you should teach her again.
She can't jump a single one.

163
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,238
I tried my best.

164
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,283
Ha-young. Don't be bothered.

165
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,869
Sol-i doesn't have the right build
to begin with.

166
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,957
Jin-hwan, you're too hard on her.

167
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,625
He's right. Cheer for her.

168
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,884
Let's go, Shin Sol-i!

169
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,887
Let's go, Shin Sol-i!

170
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,140
Let's go, Shin Sol-i!

171
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,057
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,156
Dae-sung. Move aside. I'm tired.

173
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,951
Your posture is completely wrong.

174
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:08,871
What?

175
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,378
Heon, will you help me?

176
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,132
I saw the other girls, and it looked like
none of them could hurdle right.

177
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,303
Your short legs aren't to blame,
so don't worry.

178
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,180
Are you here to insult me?

179
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,390
Will you practice or not?

180
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,476
I will!

181
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,660
Your records don't look good.

182
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,999
I hear you spend more time on
the running track than you do in the pool.

183
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,046
-The field day is next week--
-Which has nothing to do with you.

184
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,173
Does it include swimming?

185
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,719
Focus on the swim meet.

186
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,442
DON'T LOSE YOUR BALANCE

187
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,874

00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,266
Yes?

209
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,060
Don't be nervous.

210
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,197

225
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,484
Why is she so fast?

Mi-nyeo, hurry up!

235
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,222
Good job!

00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,565

DAZZLING CLASS SEVEN

244
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,241
Thank you, Teddy Bear.

245
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,634
-Heon!
-Shin Sol-i!

246
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,927

Dae-sung, thanks so much.

249
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,809
I can't believe I had to go
at the important moment.

250
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,310
Thank you so much.

251
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,105
No problem. I had fun.

252
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,941
Man, you're sweating a lot.

253
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,359
It was really hot.

254
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,027
I bet.

255
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,867
GIFT CERTIFICATE

256
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,625
Jeez, Se-hyeong.

257
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,006
I thought it was 1.5 million won,
but turns out it's 150,000 won.

258
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,716
How many zeros were there?

259
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,721
I can't buy anything with this.

260
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,850
Anyway,

261
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,352
I have to go see my dad now.

262
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,815
Now? Why? You'll get caught at the gate.

263
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,192
But I have to go now. I'm already late.

264
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,278
Actually, my dad is

265
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,407
departing today. I won't be able to
see him for a few months.

266
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,992
Then you should hurry.

267
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,327
-Is there any way?
-Jump over the gate.

268
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,498
The one behind the nurse's office.

269
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,965
Go. Ha-young, you can do it.

270
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,179
Hey, what are you doing?

271
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,182
Hurry.

272
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,893
The dean's coming. Ha-young, hurry.

273
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,978
What are you doing?

274
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,605
How dare you touch my Ha-young?

275
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,565
Then what? Do you want her to get caught?

276
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,234
Hey, what are you doing over there?

277
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,194
Spread out now.

278
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,279
You rascals!

279
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,114
What do you think you're doing?

280
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,742
Stop right there. What are you doing?

281
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,203
Step aside.

282
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,206
Wait, sir. There's a dog!

283
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,457
Help me.

284
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,292
I'm scared of dogs.

285
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,335
-Please.
-What?

286
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,502
Where?

287
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,882
What?

288
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,177
Go away.

289
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:21,762
Go on.

290
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,473
Hey!

291
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,350
YUIL HIGH SCHOOL

292
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,110
What for?

293
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,987
Your pants are ripped.

294
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,501
Thank you.

295
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,545
-I'm not off to--
-You won't do anything bad, right?

296
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,005
Yes. What?

297
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,715
What? No.

298
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,261
Don't get caught.

299
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,237
-You really won't do it?
-No.

300
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,031
You're a member of Class Seven, too.

301
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,575
Everyone will be wearing one.
You should too.

302
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,121
Look, Heon!

303
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,468
Thinking about hurdling makes me
so nervous.

304
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,069
Happy?

305
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,490
Yes, I'm happy.

306
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,993
It's good.

307
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,328
You look handsome.

308
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,189
-"Let's go, baby."
-I'm not a baby.

309
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,483
"That man is mine. He is my boyfriend."

310
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,193
Why can't you say that?

311
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,488
-Can I love you?
-Can I love you?

312
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,448
-Will you?
-I'll think about it.

313
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,658
The male lead is already taken.

314
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,327
-Who is it?
-Can't you take a hint?

315
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,745
"Sir! Can't you see my baby's scared?"

316
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,705
Thanks. Every day is exciting.

317
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,706
You're the best, Brother.

318
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,458
No. Don't do it.

319
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,460
-Have you seen Sol-i?
-Heon.

320
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,711
Shin Sol-i.

321
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,133
