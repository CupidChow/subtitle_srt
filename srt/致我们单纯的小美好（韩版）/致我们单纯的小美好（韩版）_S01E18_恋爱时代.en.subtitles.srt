MEDICAL SCHOOL
ONE-DAY PUB

10
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,316
Nice.

11
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,193
I wanted to ask you,

12
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,569
what's your name?

13
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,780
I'm Shin Sol-i.

14
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:15,784
Your name is as pretty as you look.
Are you a freshman? What's your major?

15
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,494
Who invited you?

16
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,621
Well, I…

17
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,957
Why do you have so many questions?

18
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,668
Oh, you're Heon's friend.

19
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,755
There's hard liquor on that table.

20
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,927
Heon, I can hold my drink.

21
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,766
Why don't we play a game?

22
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,769
Playing a game will liven up the mood.

23
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,145
Yes, let's play a game.

24
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,730
How about the Game of Truth?

25
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,815
All right.

26
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,859
My bad. I'll spin it.

27
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,118
Goodness, it's Ji-hui.

28
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,202
Hey.

29
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,913
Okay, pay attention. I'll ask a question.

30
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:05,416
"There's someone I like here." Yes or no?

31
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,837
Come on. Say it.

32
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,631
Say it.

33
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,841
-Say it.
-Say it

34
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,884
-Say it.
-Say it.

35
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,969
-Say it.
-Say it.

36
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,137
-Say it.
-Say it.

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,429
No way.

38
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,807
Well, I…

39
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,477
You like someone. Who is it?

40
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,072
Sol-i. Help me.

41
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,950
-Love shot.
-Okay.

42
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,076
I like

43
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,745
-Cha--
-Ouch!

44
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:47,792
I have

45
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,462
a sudden stomachache.

46
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,797
-Right now?
-Yes.

47
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,138
My girlfriend isn't feeling well.

48
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,890
We'll get going.

49
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,267
Let's go.

50
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,728
-What?
-She's his girlfriend?

51
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,405
Heon,

52
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,241
I have a question.

53
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,744
What is it?

54
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,162
Earlier…

55
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,706
I mean,

56
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,500
by any chance, did you

57
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,464
really just call me your girlfriend?

58
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:43,181
I mean, I'm not sure if I heard it right.

59
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,480
I did.

60
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:56,319
Since when?
Since when was I your girlfriend?

61
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,948
I don't know.

62
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,876
Heon. My boyfriend.

63
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,629
Wait for me!

64
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,804
Sol-i, are you that happy
that you're Heon's girlfriend now?

65
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,681
Yes, I am.

66
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,974
I'm so happy.

67
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,893
All your hard work paid off.

68
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,103
You finally made it.

69
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,854
Ha-young.

70
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,357
Heon and I

71
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,067
even held hands.

72
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,486
That's great.

73
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,197
"Hands"?

74
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,616
-You've only held hands so far?
-Yes.

75
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,702
Sol-i.

76
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,037
You're still a baby.

77
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,414
What do you mean?

78
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,250
How far have you gone with Heon so far?

79
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,210
What?

80
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,464
Then, you and Jin-hwan…

81
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,550
No way!

82
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,722
Baby, you have so much to learn from me.

83
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,224
Let's take care of those clothes first.
Let's go.

84
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,476
-Now?
-Finish your drink.

85
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,824
What are you doing tonight?

86
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,035
What? Tonight?

87
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,162
Nothing much.

88
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,458
In that case,
don't go back to your dorm tonight.

89
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:34,876
Stay with me.

90
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,093
All night?

91
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,680
You and I together?

92
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,311
But I'm not mentally prepared.

93
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,648
Sol-i.

94
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,067
What are you imagining?

95
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,568
What?

96
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,653
I'm going to do my assignment
in the library.

97
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,324
I was asking you to stay with me
if you weren't busy.

98
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,415
I see.

99
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,002
That's what you meant.

100
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,643
Heon, the night air feels
nice and cool these days.

101
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,269
Right?

102
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,105
Right.

103
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,621
Sol-i.

104
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:54,956
Yes?

105
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,083
Where are you going?

106
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,501
I'm not going anywhere.

107
00:06:59,127 --> 00:06:59,961
Come here.

108
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,713
Why?

109
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,347
Okay.

110
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,872
Excuse me.

111
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,999
You're so my type.

112
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,043
May I have your number?

113
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,381
Hey! Who do you think you are?

114
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,093
Who are you?

115
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,762
He's my boyfriend.

116
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,266
What?

117
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,121
You know what?
We should stay together all day.

118
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,957
Don't go overboard.

119
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,375
How did you know I was here?

120
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,252
I'm your boyfriend.

121
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,255
I will go and find you,
no matter where you are.

122
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,132
Really? You're amazing.

123
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,467
Study.

124
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,396
What's this?

125
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,817
"Do you have a boyfriend?
You're a goddess."

126
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,780
"Can we meet if you have time? 010-53…"

127
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,919
What's this? A poem?

128
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,589
"Kang Ha-young, you're my black hole.

129
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,507
You make me fall for you.

130
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,509
I will love you forever"?

131
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,470
He must be crazy.
How dare he? Who is this?

132
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,600
Hey, look at me, poet.
Who wrote this poem?

133
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,143
I'll throw them all out.

134
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,938
Forget it. I'll go home.

135
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,099
We're done.

136
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,268
Great. Thank you.

137
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,227
Thank you.

138
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,691
Let's go straight to Seongsu-dong.
You have a commercial shoot soon.

139
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,151
Okay. Let's go.

140
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,694
Sorry about the tight schedule.

141
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,238
You have to finish everything
before the season starts.

142
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,823
I know. Don't worry.

143
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,286
Hi, Dae-sung. I'm a huge fan.
May I have your autograph?

144
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,788
Sure. What's your name?

145
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,206
-It's Ji-hye.
-Ji-hye?

146
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,960
DECEMBER 2012, WINTER OF TWENTY-THREE

147
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,767
WAITING FOR YOU ON A WINDY DAY

148
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,689
Read.

149
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,409
Jin-hwan, don't you have
any classes today?

150
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,203
I only called Ha-young.

151
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,372
I don't. We're a couple, anyway.

152
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,624
Heon!

153
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,375
Oh, hi.

154
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,253
You and your girlfriend are famous now.
Look at this.

155
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,090
See you. Let's go.

156
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,218
Bye.

157
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,348
Sol-i. You should've told us about this.

158
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,391
How could you do the photoshoot
without us?

159
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,519
I'm so disappointed.

160
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:35,105
Jin-hwan, you don't even attend
Hankuk University.

161
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,651
I practically do because my girlfriend
and my friends go there.

162
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,947
Heon, you look great in this picture.

163
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,032
Right?

164
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:45,991
Sol-i.

165
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,326
Yes?

166
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,119
You knew, didn't you?

167
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,413
Yes.

168
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:56,335
Actually, a reporter
from the school newspaper contacted me

169
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,214
and said he'd give me this.

170
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,676
I'm sorry. Are you angry?

171
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,764
He said we looked so good together,
so he took the photo without realizing it.

172
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,397
Take us with you.

173
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,316
It's just for two people.

174
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,195
You disloyal jerk.
When did you become a romantic?

175
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,655
You're so ungrateful.

176
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,241
Yes, we'll go on our own.
Get lost, Jin-hwan.

177
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,035
Ha-young, look at them.

178
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,328
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

179
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,080
CARDIOVASCULAR CENTER

180
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,215
Mr. Jeong Jin-hwan, please come in.

181
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,551
Yes.

182
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,482
Are you really okay?

183
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,318
Of course.

184
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,528
Aren't you going to tell Ha-young?

185
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,743
No, I won't.

186
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:12,661
That means

187
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,872
you should keep this a secret.

188
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,897
Why did you call me?

189
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,982
I was focusing on my studies.

190
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,699
I'm really busy because the first draft
of my master's thesis is due today.

191
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,745
Is something wrong?

192
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,100
Let's break up.

193
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:18,852
What?

194
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,231
We've been going out for too long.
We're getting sick of each other.

195
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,821
Jin-hwan, are you kidding me?

196
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,824
I'm sorry.

197
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,870
This isn't funny at all.
What the hell are you doing?

198
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,707
You said you were busy. You should go now.

199
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,625
I'll get going.

200
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,213
Hey!

201
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,225
-Heon, you're here.
-Hi.

202
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,563
Why do you have so much in your bag?
Isn't it heavy?

203
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,857
-No.
-Do you want me to carry it?

204
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,817
No, it's okay.

205
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,572
When did you get here?
Why didn't you call me?

206
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,408
He's really handsome.

207
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,701
Is she his girlfriend?

208
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,995
-He's way too good for her.
-I agree.

209
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,998
Don't listen to them.

210
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,378
I didn't hear anything.

211
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,423
I have something to tell you.

212
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,591
What is it?

213
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,052
Jin-hwan will go into surgery.

214
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:34,887
What?

215
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,889
He told me not to tell Ha-young.

216
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,017
But the surgery's quite risky,
so I think we should tell her.

217
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,977
No wonder.

218
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,188
Ha-young is really shocked

219
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,440
because Jin-hwan suddenly
broke up with her.

220
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,151
You should talk to her
so that she doesn't get upset.

221
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,945
Okay, I will. Don't worry.

222
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,363
Good.

223
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,162
THE 100 GREATEST SPORTSMEN

224
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,998
Dae-sung is on a roll!

225
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,666
He took first place again.

226
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,087
I heard he's famous abroad, too.
He's a superstar now.

227
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,756
Did you guys see his automobile advert?

228
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,593
He looked so cool
with the convertible car.

229
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,522
Mr. Jeong Jin-hwan,
prepare for your surgery in 30 minutes.

230
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,619
Jin-hwan.

231
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,793
Ha-young.

232
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,213
Are you stupid? Did you think
I wouldn't know if you didn't tell me?

233
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,299
I was sorry.

234
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,054
-So…
-Don't be sorry.

235
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,348
It's okay as long as you survive.

236
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,652
I'll be waiting. See you after surgery.

237
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,616
Okay.

238
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,743
Okay.

239
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,396
JUNE 2014, SUMMER OF TWENTY-FIVE

240
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,052
Okay. Who's next?

241
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:24,139
-Me!
-Me!

242
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,057
-Me!
-Hey.

243
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,101
I've been looking for you.

244
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,271
It's a scary lady. Run away!

245
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,235
Go back!

246
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,239
Goodness.

247
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,913
Take my love.

248
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,081
No, thanks.

249
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,257
JULY 2015, SUMMER OF TWENTY-SIX

250
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:16,775
Heon!

251
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,533
Heon, shouldn't you be at the hospital?

252
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,910
I came here to see you.

253
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,161
Aren't you tired?

254
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,123
Part-time jobs are always hard.

255
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,000
Here.

256
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,960
Thanks.

257
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,588
Sit down. I'll do it.

258
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,257
Really?

259
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,219
Thank you.

260
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:52,811
Thank you.

261
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,861
-He's so cute.
-Thank you.

262
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,446
-I'd like one, too.
-Thank you.

263
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,323
-He's so handsome.
-Thank you.

264
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,492
-Thank you.
-You're so good-looking.

265
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,036
-Me, too.
-Thank you.

266
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,829
-Give me one more, please.
-Thank you.

267
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,082
-Thank you.
-Let's ask for one.

268
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,626
-Give me one, please.
-Thank you.

269
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,753
-Me, too.
-Thank you.

270
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,421
You'll get sunburned. Put this on.

271
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,132
It's hot.

272
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,842
I know. Just put it on.

273
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,719
Why?

274
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,304
Just put it on!

275
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,373
Why are you already here?
I said I'd go to you after work.

276
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,086
You're always busy,
so I don't mind coming to see you.

277
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,838
Haven't you heard?
I'm the best mentor you can find.

278
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,465
Heon, are you busy?

279
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,218
Your boyfriend's a doctor.
You should call him right now.

280
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,679
I recommended you
for the training program in the US.

281
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,182
Dr. Cha will go to the States, won't he?

282
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,435
Kim U-hyeon, male, 53. TA.

283
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,437
-V-tach!
-A hundred and fifty joules.

284
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:22,234
I can't take it anymore.

285
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,362
Let's break up.

286
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:32,911
