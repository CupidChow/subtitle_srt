00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:42,709
DECEMBER, 2007, WINTER OF EIGHTEEN

2
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,842
Ha-young, are you cross-stitching?

3
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,802
I'm giving it to Mr. Lee
before winter break.

4
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,013
It's Christmas Eve on that day.

5
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,973
What about you? What did you get?

6
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,022
Ta-da. I bought a card.

7
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,107
-Isn't it pretty?
-Will that be enough?

8
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,611
Your rival prepared something huge.

9
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,202
What's that? A muffler?

10
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,246
-I want to knit one too.
-Do you know how?

11
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,539
Don't you?

12
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,000
I was hoping you'd teach me.

13
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,753
What a headache.

14
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,466
Ha-young, it's Christmas soon.

15
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,218
Is there anything you'd like?

16
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,262
Like for instance, a star in the sky.

17
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,765
Why? Would you get it for me?

18
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,809
Should I? Do you want a star?

19
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,436
You and your nonsense.

20
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,440
Should I make you see stars?

21
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,651
As long as I'm next to you.

22
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,237
I lose.

23
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,240
-Sol-i, hurry up.
-Sure.

24
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,575
Wait for me!

25
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,208
Here.

26
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,252
I'm fine.

27
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,129
Put them on. I'm not cold.

28
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:12,924
Thanks.

29
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,013
What?

30
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,850
It's dangerous.

31
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,212
I wish it would snow this Christmas.
Don't you?

32
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,133
Sure.

33
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,186
Dad, you're the best!

34
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,022
Mr. Shin, I'm impressed.

35
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,065
Right? Isn't my dad awesome?

36
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,694
-Will I be able to do that?
-Of course.

37
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,905
You need to help me.

38
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:24,996
Goodness.

39
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,374
My daughter has a crush on a boy.

40
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,753
No wonder she wanted to learn how to knit.

41
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,465
Who is he?
Which prick dared to take my little girl--

42
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,217
Stay put, will you?
You're driving me nuts.

43
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,303
We should ask Sol-i. Sol-i!

44
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,056
-Sol-i--
-Hey, stay still!

45
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,809
She hasn't written anything else.
Let's see how it goes.

46
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,520
Our daughter is old enough to marry now.

47
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,898
Seriously, Gi-heon?

48
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,566
Get a grip on yourself.

49
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,984
Your daughter's only--

50
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,695
Hey.

51
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,572
What are you guys up to?

52
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,286
Your father wants to sing at this hour.

53
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,579
You can't.

54
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,164
Get back to your studies.

55
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,916
Sure.

56
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,210
Honey, please.

57
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,342
Cut it out.

58
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,263
Goodness, Heon.

59
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,808
-Hello.
-Can we have a talk?

60
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,351
Sure.

61
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,857
There's something I'd like to ask.

62
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,859
How is Sol-i at school these days?

63
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,486
Sorry?

64
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:43,324
Is there a boy
she's particularly close to?

65
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,664
-Not really.
-Think about it.

66
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,917
Isn't there someone
she constantly hangs out with?

67
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,127
Not really.

68
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,508
Sol-i's here. Have fun at school then.

69
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,968
Sure. We'll get going.

70
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,315
What would Heon know?

71
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,608
He's probably too busy
studying all the time.

72
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,320
Who can it be?

73
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,741
You guys are so old-fashioned.

74
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,659
Knitting is so old-school.

75
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,911
Elementary kids wouldn't even do this.

76
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,621
Wang Se-hyeong, get lost.

77
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,874
-Give it back.
-Yes, ma'am.

78
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,834
You guys are so boring.

79
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,381
Ha-young.

80
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,635
What does this look like? A muffler?

81
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,636
Yes.

82
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,847
A doormat, actually.

83
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,100
Right?

84
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,686
I think I'm screwed.

85
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,521
I'll never get it right.

86
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,983
How about a wish bracelet?

87
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,402
A wish bracelet? What's that?

88
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,197
It's a bracelet made by braiding thread.

89
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,240
You just have to wear it.

90
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,410
The day it wears off and snaps
is the day your wish comes true.

91
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,040
Sounds nice, but is that easy to make?

92
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,417
Yes, super easy. Don't worry.

93
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,878
Great. What about you?

94
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,846
-It's so pretty!
-Isn't it?

95
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,906
TO MR. LEE

96
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,550
Se-hyeong, good luck.

97
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,886
She's here!

98
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,474
What? What now?

99
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:17,061
I knew it, Kang Ha-young.
Not that easy. I like that.

100
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,984
What is it? Just spit it out.

101
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,487
I'll give you a chance to be my girlfriend
this Christmas.

102
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,072
How's that?

103
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,825
Wang Se-hyeong, are you out of your mind?

104
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,079
Sure, you can play
hard to get at least once.

105
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,206
Being the man I am, I'll be generous.

106
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,708
You get three passes.

107
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,799
Kang Ha-young, be my girlfriend.

108
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,384
Hey.

109
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,595
Get lost.

110
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,473
Think carefully. This is your last chance.

111
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,767
I said, get lost. Am I insane?

112
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,519
I'll never say yes.

113
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,481
You're a funny one, Ha-young.

114
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,316
I thought I'd be generous.

115
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,443
Just live on your own
and die old and lonely.

116
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,487
Who would like a wild girl like you?

117
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,322
I do.

118
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,290
Kang Ha-young, let's go.

119
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,299
Did I just lose against Jeong Jin-hwan?

120
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,428
So humiliating.

121
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,071
Hey.

122
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,491
That was loyal of you
to swoop in and help.

123
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,744
Of course. I'll always be by your side.

124
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,581
Anyway, thanks again.

125
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,168
You should have thanked me later.

126
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,506
-Ta-da!
-What's this?

127
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,930
I told you I'd get you a star.

128
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,308
Hey, this is a scam.

129
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,310
They're not officially recognized.

130
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,189
Still, the name of this star
can't ever be changed.

131
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,858
This is the only star in space

132
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,236
that's named Kang Ha-young.

133
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,490
Okay. I appreciate it.

134
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,576
Thanks.

135
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,710
Cha Heon, this is for you.

136
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,343
Please. Don't accept it.

137
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,804
What's up?

138
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:04,687
All right.

139
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,486
What's the subject here?

140
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,282
-"Our group members," right?
-He accepted it. Damn it.

141
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,700
What about the object?

142
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,286
How's the bracelet coming along?

143
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,121
It's Christmas Eve tomorrow.

144
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,290
Forget it. I won't give him anything.

145
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,502
Why not?

146
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,769
Mom!

147
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,605
Did you see a pink card in my room?

148
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,317
-What?
-Have you seen a pink card?

149
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,195
-Sol-i, who is that card for?
-Hey.

150
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,072
Just stay still.

151
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,786
Is this card--

152
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,707
-Wait. Why is it cold?
-It's chilly today.

153
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,418
Sol-i, who is that card for?

154
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,421
What do you mean?
I just bought it because it's pretty.

155
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,637
Hold on. Why does it smell like kimchi?

156
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,140
Dad, doesn't this smell sour to you?

157
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,768
I don't smell anything.

158
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,812
Anyway, what is that?

159
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:29,814
What?

160
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,444
Oh, this?

161
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,657
I was just testing a new pen I bought.

162
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,243
I told you.

163
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,286
Good night then, Sol-i.

164
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,871
You, too, Mom and Dad.

165
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,116
Cha Heon, this is for you.

166
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,379
Sol-i.

167
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,885
All right, guys.

168
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,388
The winter break
of your junior year is crucial,

169
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,599
so study hard next week

170
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,226
and see you again in the make-up class.

171
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,145
-Got it?
-Yes!

172
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,396
Great job.

173
00:12:58,777 --> 00:12:59,945
Woo Dae-sung.

174
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,115
-What's up?
-Why isn't it snowing?

175
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,576
Snow? The snow that falls from the sky?

176
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,580
They said it'd snow.

177
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,207
-Who did?
-The weather forecast.

178
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,001
I've been calling them every day
for the past week.

179
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,505
We're supposed to have heavy snow by now,

180
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,715
but why is the sky clear?

181
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,675
Do you believe the weather forecast?

182
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,103
Okay, here I go.

183
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,398
-Come here.
-What?

184
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,484
-Take that!
-Take that!

185
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,029
Ha-young.

186
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,406
Get down now. My heart's about to drop.

187
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,997
Shin Sol-i, you go up there.

188
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,750
Why? I'm shorter than Ha-young.

189
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,003
-I can't reach up there.
-Right. That's why I'm telling you.

190
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,755
Your center of mass is lower than hers,

191
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,674
so you won't fall off. I promise.

192
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,800
Hurry up.

193
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,803
Get up.

194
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,722
-Over there.
-But…

195
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,579
Use this.

196
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,134
It's snowing!

197
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,760
-It's snowing!
-It's snowing!

198
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,387
-Really?
-No way.

199
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,848
-Wow!
-It's snowing!

200
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,643
What the hell? It's fake.

201
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,646
-It's still pretty though.
-Right?

202
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,634
Hey! Who did this?

203
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,844
It's one of you guys again, isn't it?

204
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,305
-We don't know.
-What do you mean, you don't know?

205
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,558
Get out and sweep the ground.

206
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,268
Make it spotless, okay?

207
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,895
I don't think that's necessary.

208
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:39,813
What?

209
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,316
It's snowing for real now.

210
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,115
-My gosh.
-No way.

211
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,128
The weather forecast was right.

212
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,548
Weather forecasters, I apologize.

213
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,102
It's so pretty.

214
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,059
Come on, Ha-young.
I got this to walk you home.

215
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,531
You, too.

216
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,965
-It's snowing!
-Sweet!

217
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,843
-Where are you going?
-It's so pretty.

218
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,148
I don't want to wear this.

219
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,900
Just wear it. It's cold.

220
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,318
I don't want to.

221
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,655
Oh Hui-ji gave it to you.

222
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,660
My mom bought it for me.

223
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,959
Really?

224
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,505
No wonder!

225
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,092
It's pretty, it's super warm,
and it smells so good.

226
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,013
Heon, close your eyes.
I have a gift for you.

227
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,361
Open your eyes.

228
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,573
What's this?

229
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,034
A wish bracelet and a Christmas card.

230
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,662
Wear the bracelet every day.
Your wish will come true.

231
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,420
Are you sure it's a bracelet?
Isn't it a necklace?

232
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,092
It's not!
Just wrap it around your wrist twice.

233
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,510
Let me put it on for you.

234
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,722
Once.

235
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,350
Twice.

236
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,813
Gosh, it's so pretty!

237
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,028
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

238
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,660
Thanks.

239
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,086
Sure. Merry Christmas to you, too.

240
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,649
That's so pretty! I'm home.

241
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,861
This is new. Whose muffler is this?

242
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,697
Where's the muffler I got you?

243
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,865
Oh, this?

244
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,827
-It's Heon's.
-Cha Heon's?

245
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,205
Cha Heon? Of course.

246
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,373
Are you hungry I'll get you a snack.

247
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,458
Sure.

248
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,170
-Dad.
-Yes?

249
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,930
Goodness, my daughter…

250
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,767
To my dad, Shin Gi-heon.

251
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,603
Dad, I love you.

252
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,814
No way. It was for me.

253
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,317
The "honey" was me. "Gi-heon."

254
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,486
Unbelievable.

255
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,404
Goodness.

256
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,575
-How is Sol-i at school these days?
-Sorry?

257
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,622
Is there a boy
she's particularly close to?

258
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,291
Probably me.

259
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,628
Please think long and hard.

260
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,839
Isn't there someone
she constantly hangs out with?

261
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,384
That would be me.

262
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,474
Sol-i's here. Have fun at school then.

263
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,976
Sure. We'll get going.

264
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,196
What were you and Mom talking about?

265
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,826
Nothing. We talked about the weather.

266
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,911
I see.

267
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,144
I'm not following you.

268
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,478
I know. Who cares?

269
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,355
What are you doing here?

270
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,025
-I thought you were waiting for me.
-Since when?

271
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,112
I must be out of my mind.

272
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,905
Then, I'll sit next to her.

273
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,992
-How did you get here?
-All I did was follow you.

274
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,118
And I ended up here.

275
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,328
Is something wrong?

276
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,372
I have to go first,
so I can't walk you home. I'm sorry.

277
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,876
Heon. Meet me at the trail over there
in five minutes.

278
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,796
Everything looks so romantic.

279
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,256
I prepared this for you.

280
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,467
To hell with it. Sol-i, be my girlfriend.

281
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:29,139
