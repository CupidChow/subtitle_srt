1
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,733
Sol-i.

2
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,527
I think our relationship began

3
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,322
around that time.

4
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,662
YUIL HIGH SCHOOL WELCOMES
THE NEW CLASS OF 2006

5
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,750
Heon. The thing is…

6
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,794
What is it?

7
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,256
I like you.

8
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,343
I don't like you.

9
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,311
Then, I'll figure out a way.

10
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,744
You always followed me around
with your short legs.

11
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,924
So I started wondering

12
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,303
if you could follow me every time.

13
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,730
So I tried going faster.

14
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,239
And you caught up with me

15
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,782
at an unexpected moment.

16
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,167
Before I knew it,

17
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:53,172
I started to wait for you and observe you.

18
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,677
Then suddenly I realized

19
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,471
that you always got yourself in trouble.

20
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,976
Why are you fooling around
when you're supposed to study?

21
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,060
Stand up.

22
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,439
What the hell is this?

23
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,483
"Which makes me want you even more.

24
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,195
-Give--"
-Give me your love

25
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,032
Don't bring tears to my eyes

26
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,118
These words

27
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:26,831
Can be said more easily than breathing

28
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,209
-Yet I can't say them confidently
-Yet I can't say them confidently

29
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,630
-All I do is hide
-All I do is hide

30
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:39,636
-Like a coward
-Like a coward

31
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,683
Where did it go?

32
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:47,977
Try to think.

33
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,646
This is crazy.

34
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,691
I think it's in my Korean language
notebook.

35
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,820
Because of you,

36
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,699
I did something
that I would never try to do.

37
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,086
Hey, what was that?

38
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,296
Nothing, sir.

39
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,678
Get it together, all right?

40
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,888
You guys are going to be seniors soon.

41
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,682
Got it?

42
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,393
Yes, sir.

43
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,111
I wrote a letter of apology
for the first time in my life.

44
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,907
"Abusing the authority as a teacher
and reading a personal letter of a student

45
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,411
was not only a violation
of the student's civil rights

46
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,996
but was also highly…"

47
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,457
This isn't how you write an apology.

48
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,418
You don't sound apologetic at all.

49
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,838
This is my specialty, so let me help you.

50
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,052
ON

51
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,013
I even stepped up to do something

52
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,056
no one asked me to do.

53
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,393
"I said quietly,

54
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,855
'Rest in peace.

55
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,151
I love you, Mother.'"

56
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,948
OUR HAPPY TIME

57
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:24,907
"And…

58
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,327
he said,

59
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,705
'Don't worry.'"

60
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,670
I couldn't believe myself either.

61
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,868
Then one day,

62
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,751
every single thing you did
started to bother me.

63
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,592
Sol-i.

64
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,887
You're a total loser.

65
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,517
So I said harsh things out of anger

66
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,645
and hurt your feelings.

67
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,566
I was too young back then,

68
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,864
so I put my pain before yours.

69
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:58,042
But when I found out
that you might transfer to another school,

70
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,420
I couldn't sleep a wink that night.

71
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:23,401
I was truly afraid
that you'd leave me for good.

72
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,408
I'm here to pick up
the literature performance assessment.

73
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,201
Oh, right.

74
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,998
I think it's too heavy
for one person to carry, though.

75
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,723
Shin Sol-i.

76
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,185
Don't go.

77
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,619
That was why

78
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,163
I approached you first.

79
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:24,170
I slowly began to realize
that you were really cute.

80
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,924
Heon.

81
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,177
Can you plug your ears for a minute?

82
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,852
As I looked at you,

83
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,106
I started smiling genuinely more often.

84
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,194
I'm sorry. I was fixing my clothes.

85
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,991
Before I knew it,

86
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,577
I was already looking after you.

87
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,917
That sleeve turned wet.

88
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,236
Heon, you waited for me!

89
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,530
-Who said that?
-Come on.

90
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,407
Why don't you tell me honestly?

91
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,911
Shin Sol-i,
don't you have any self-respect?

92
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,080
No, I gave it all to you.

93
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,968
So you and I became closer
than anyone else.

94
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,887
Heon.

95
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,016
You know…

96
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,230
that I like you a lot, right?

97
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,565
Sol-i.

98
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,941
Yes?

99
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,778
Would you be able to remember

100
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,780
what happened tonight?

101
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,033
Yes!

102
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,439
That's how we started dating.

103
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,275
Go in.

104
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,741
-I'll go now.
-Okay.

105
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,543
Sol-i.

106
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,504
Yes?

107
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,480
Bye.

108
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,213
At the time,

109
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,133
I was certain that I found

110
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,844
the answer to our relationship.

111
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,530
Hurry up.

112
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,752
I didn't realize that I was writing

113
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,129
the wrong answer.

114
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,177
After a recovery period in the ICU,
if there are no issues,

115
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,555
he'll move to a general ward
for another week of recovery.

116
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,806
Good work.

117
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,019
Keep monitoring his ECG
after moving him to the general ward.

118
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:54,231
Do an additional echocardiography
and an enzyme test.

119
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,316
Yes, sir.

120
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,777
Who's doing the next surgery briefing?

121
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,237
SORRY, I CAN'T TAKE THE CALL RIGHT NOW

122
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,034
What brings you by unannounced?

123
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,330
Until then,

124
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:13,751
I never imagined myself without you,
not even once.

125
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,254
Let's break up.

126
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:19,757
What?

127
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,178
What are you…

128
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,432
You're going to the US.

129
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,312
Why didn't you tell me?

130
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,439
Therefore,

131
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,817
your reaction felt so unfamiliar.

132
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,321
To be honest,

133
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,449
I thought I could make you stay.

134
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,954
Are you Sol-i's boyfriend?

135
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,373
Could you tell Sol-i that I'm here?

136
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,960
Sol-i packed up and moved out today.

137
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,462
Didn't you know?

138
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,808
Only then did I realize

139
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,938
that I underestimated our situation.

140
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,408
Sol-i.

141
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,743
I'm leaving today.

142
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,039
Will you

143
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,459
come to see me?

144
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,589
Don't wait for me.

145
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,893
Even so,

146
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,229
I was selfish to the end.

147
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,026
The three years in the States
I spent without you

148
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,361
went by very quickly.

149
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,749
There had never been a time
when I felt so uneasy

150
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,209
and so stifling in my life.

151
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,516
Why are you always so uptight?

152
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,977
Are you going to stay?

153
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,698
What does a shoe put on to dress up?

154
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,911
A shoelace!

155
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,831
Isn't that funny?

156
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,586
Goodness.

157
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,927
I was in terrible pain every single day.

158
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,354
And

159
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,942
when I met you again, I realized

160
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,112
that I never had

161
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,865
any other choice but you
in the first place.

162
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,119
I had to get you back

163
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,414
because you're the right answer
to my life.

164
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,385
Sol-i.

165
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,665
Sol-i. Now I know

166
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,210
that compared to my egostic self,

167
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,505
you're a really good person.

168
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,316
Not only do you accept me,

169
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,568
who is cold and indifferent,

170
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,321
but you also love me.

171
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,075
Ta-da.

172
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,161
Will you marry me?

173
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,256
Sure.

174
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,759
But Sol-i,

175
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,428
you're not ordinary either,

176
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,307
because you came back to me.

177
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,767
Congratulations.

178
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,105
I'm saying I'm very lucky…

179
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,113
Heon, you're really drunk.

180
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,662
I'm not drunk at all.

181
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,922
Don't go.

182
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:03,559
…because I'm back with you,
the one-of-a-kind Shin Sol-i.

183
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,687
I will

184
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,023
never let you go.

185
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,443
Sol-i,

186
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,737
thank you so much

187
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:21,326
for staying by my side
since those beautiful days.

188
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,351
NO THANKS.
I WON'T MARRY YOU

189
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,104
There's a guy I like.

190
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,110
My dream

191
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,239
is to marry him.

192
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:49,873
CHEERS TO OUR YOUTH THAT WERE, ARE,
AND WILL ALWAYS BE BEAUTIFUL

193
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,520
-One, two.
-Cut.

194
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,563
Let's start over.

195
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,649
I'll do it again. I'm sorry.

196
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,193
"Heon, you waited for me!"

197
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,195
One more time.

198
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,823
I danced and Sol-i…

199
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,241
-I sang.
-She sang.

200
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,451
-Are you making fun of me?
-No.

201
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,620
- Did you set me up?
-We're serious.

202
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,915
This is my first acting experience.

203
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,501
I'll do my best. Let's go.

204
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,586
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

205
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,380
Let's go.

206
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:44,886
I'm proud that you're my woman

207
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,347
I used to be gruff

208
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,558
Now I smile all the--

209
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,645
Jeong Jin-hwan!

210
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,063
"How…"

211
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,440
"How can…"

212
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,738
Who was that?

213
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,535
Where is she going?

214
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,787
-Hey.
-What?

215
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,414
-I'm sorry.
-Isn't it here?

216
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,582
-No. You passed it.
-No? I did.

217
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,792
-Are we competing for the ending?
-Yes, you are.

218
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,377
Here we go.

219
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,295
One.

220
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,089
-I can't do it.
-Next dialogue.

221
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,425
Come on.

222
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,178
What's going on? I can't continue.

223
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,890
"But he's already…" I'm sorry.

224
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,224
"Both domestically…"

225
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,060
I'm really sorry.

226
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,062
"Dae-sung hasn't…"

227
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,856
I'm really sorry.

228
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,359
I guess that's all for me, Director.

229
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,320
I guess I can't do it.

230
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,614
"I believe the statement
to be contradictory.

231
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,784
I'd like to…"
I'm sorry. I looked at the camera.

232
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,330
-NG.
-I did it the other way.

233
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,456
How did you know?

234
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,420
-I'm sorry.
-Wait.

235
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,591
These are my real tears.

236
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,885
"You know it's Sol-i's birthday
this Saturday, right?"

237
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,597
What was my line?

238
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,682
-"What does that have to do with me?"
-Okay. I'm sorry.

239
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,519
"'He is my boyfriend.'
Why can't you say that?"

240
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,686
One more time.

241
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:22,442
"Anyway, Heon, someday in the future…"

242
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,654
-"In the future…"
-Why are you stuttering?

243
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,280
-"In the future…"
-Why?

244
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,365
Come in!

245
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,742
Again.

246
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,911
-Sorry.
-What?

247
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,124
A little closer.

248
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,584
Okay, one more time. A little closer.

249
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,671
"Sol-i missed you so much.

250
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,799
This much!"

251
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,053
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

252
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,638
Next.

253
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,268
You must be husband and wife.

254
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,352
-No.
-Yes.

255
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,312
-No.
-Yes.

256
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,524
What's your relationship?

257
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,067
We're siblings.

258
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,615
"The refrain? Got it, sir."

259
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,785
I'm sorry. It's hard not to laugh.

260
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,455
"My girlfriend isn't feeling well."

261
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,459
I'm sorry. I forgot the lyrics.

262
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,795
Not lyrics. I meant my lines.

263
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,047
"Next week!"

264
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,341
"Go, Park Ji-sung!"

265
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,802
-It wasn't just me.
-"Go, Park Ji-sung!"

266
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:47,152
You're lovely from head to--

267
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,571
Good work, everyone!

268
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,864
Heart.

269
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,782
-The end.
-The end.

270
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:58,330
