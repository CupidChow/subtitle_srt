00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:42,375
JUNE 2008, SUMMER OF NINETEEN

2
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,259
Where did Mr. Lee go?

3
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:12,906
Sir.

4
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:14,866
You're here again.

5
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,789
Well, I…

6
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,753
I felt dizzy during class earlier.

7
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:32,926
I kind of had a stomachache
after lunch, too.

8
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:38,389
And sometimes I have
this weird ringing in the ears.

9
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,059
Then,

10
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,103
today,

11
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,527
this will do.

12
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,366
Thank you.

13
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,743
You should go back to class
before it starts.

14
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,912
Okay.

15
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,627
Bye.

16
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,807
What's that? Can I have one?

17
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,142
No, you can't.

18
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,977
Let me have one, please.

19
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,520
I feel really dizzy.

20
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:29,774
Come on.

21
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,485
You're so annoying.

22
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,075
Happy?

23
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,579
Thanks, Ha-young. You saved me.

24
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,456
You're my vitamin.

25
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,669
Mr. Lee is looking for you.

26
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,421
You should go.

27
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,924
Heon, can you come with me?

28
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,395
What's up?

29
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,108
Nothing. Let's go.

30
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,360
What are you doing here?

31
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,077
Let's go.

32
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,039
What? Okay.

33
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,423
Let's see.

34
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,050
Yes.

35
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,593
There.

36
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,137
This one is good.

37
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,597
This is good, too.

38
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,850
Super delicious.

39
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,064
Dae-sung, is it okay to buy this much?

40
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,816
Yes, of course.

41
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,319
I can buy you everything
from there to here.

42
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:00,740
Sweets are the best cure
when you're depressed.

43
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,368
Are you depressed? Why?

44
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,994
You don't feel well these days?

45
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,791
-Is that it?
-What?

46
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,796
-What?
-Oh.

47
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,340
You were talking about me, not you.

48
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,259
Sorry.

49
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,139
Can you even focus on studying right now?

50
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,812
I'll take care of it.

51
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,605
You're hurting my pride.

52
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,190
Jeez.

53
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,945
Hey, you just wait here.

54
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,157
Hey, why are we here?

55
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,618
What's the best seller of our time?

56
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,703
It's

57
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,957
He Was Cool Like a Wolf.

58
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,502
Don't tell anyone.
Part Two came in yesterday.

59
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,879
How did you find out?

60
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,381
Don't ask.

61
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,632
There.

62
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,640
Good job.

63
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,309
HE WAS COOL LIKE A WOLF

64
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,454
Just sit here.

65
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,482
Why are you so dazed?

66
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,484
What? What do you mean?

67
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,194
"What? What do you mean?"

68
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,989
You've been daydreaming
since you came back from the library.

69
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,031
What happened?

70
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,244
Nothing.

71
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,956
This one?

72
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,667
-No, it has three leaves. Look closely.
-Look at this.

73
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,836
-This one?
-No.

74
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,004
This isn't it either.

75
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,673
Mi-nyeo, what are they doing?

76
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,758
They're looking for four-leaf clovers.

77
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,385
What? Four-leaf clovers?

78
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,680
If you find one
and give it to the person you like,

79
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:53,973
your love will come true.

80
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,184
Do you believe that?

81
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,019
You know Ye-dam in Class Three?

82
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,188
She gave a four-leaf clover
to her crush in church.

83
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,647
They've been dating for nine days.

84
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,066
Seon-yeong in Class Four,
A-yeong in Class Nine,

85
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,736
Hyeon-gi, Re-na, and Min-seok
in Class Two, and many more.

86
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,071
Anyway, if you find a four-leaf clover,

87
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,741
you will start a relationship.

88
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,993
-That's awesome.
-Who'd believe that?

89
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,828
Ha-young, let's go find one.

90
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,871
Find what?

91
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,999
-Jin-hwan, you scared us.
-I'm sorry.

92
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,501
Don't bother us.

93
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,420
I'm a man who doesn't bother people.
I'll go now.

94
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,464
-Bye.
-Let's go.

95
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,758
Sol-i, don't bother Ha-young.

96
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,302
-Did you find one?
-No.

97
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:19,809
Ha--

98
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,620
COSMOS

99
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,438
How can I help you?

100
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,316
Jin-hwan.

101
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:10,985
Yes.

102
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,113
Mr. Lee.

103
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,659
When is your birthday?

104
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,078
July 4th.

105
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,122
Why do you ask?

106
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,221
Hey, Mi-nyeo, wait.

107
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:43,392
What's the zodiac for July 4th?

108
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,978
It's Cancer.

109
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,774
Scorpio.

110
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:50,900
Oh, and…

111
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,985
His is Cancer.

112
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,597
Guys. Ta-da.

113
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,600
Isn't it pretty? I skipped
the whole class looking for this.

114
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,853
I've been looking for it
every break time and lunch hour,

115
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,522
but there were only three-leaf clovers.

116
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,399
I'll give this to Yeon-nam

117
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,193
after class at cram school.

118
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,365
Hey, look. Isn't it pretty?

119
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,909
-It's really pretty.
-It is.

120
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,413
Su-jin, do you think a four-leaf clover
will make your love come true?

121
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,580
What did he just say?

122
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,083
Jin-hwan, are you crazy?

123
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,585
Jin-hwan, why are you overreacting?

124
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,379
Jin-hwan, what's wrong?

125
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,131
Because she's talking nonsense.

126
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:59,009
Su-jin didn't do anything wrong.
Why are you mad at her?

127
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,778
Hey, Jin-hwan.

128
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,867
-Why are you acting like this?
-You knew, didn't you?

129
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,703
No, everyone did, didn't they?

130
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,330
-What are you talking about?
-Ha-young likes Mr. Lee.

131
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,833
You all knew that, didn't you?

132
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,340
You must've thought I was ridiculous.

133
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,802
-Jin-hwan.
-Don't touch me.

134
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,036
ONE WEEK LATER

135
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,913
Jin-hwan must be really sick.

136
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,539
How long has he been absent?

137
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,708
I'm bored because
I can't make fun of Jin-hwan.

138
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,336
Can anyone get a hold of Jin-hwan?

139
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,838
He's not answering my text messages.

140
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,008
I called him, but he didn't answer.

141
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,178
What's going on?

142
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,813
Hui-ji!

143
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,858
Oh Hui-ji, wake up.

144
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,109
Hui-ji!

145
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,779
Hui-ji, wake up. Goodness.

146
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,781
It was my first time seeing someone faint.

147
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,700
-It was really scary.
-What if she doesn't wake up?

148
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,826
Hey.

149
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,411
Be quiet.

150
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,009
Hey, it's total chaos in the staffroom.

151
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,512
Hui-ji's mom is there, throwing a fit.

152
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,888
Come on.

153
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,934
How are you looking after the students?

154
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:16,021
She was fine this morning when she left.
Why did she faint in school?

155
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,191
Ma'am, please calm down and take a seat.

156
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,402
How can I calm down right now?

157
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,988
This school completely ruined my Hui-ji.

158
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,991
Ma'am, no one ruined Hui-ji.
She's just a little sick--

159
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,284
My kid isn't sick.

160
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,120
Ma'am, don't you think
you've been neglecting her too much?

161
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,999
Lately Hui-ji showed signs
of mild depression.

162
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,083
"Depression"?

163
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:40,379
Are you telling me to take her
to a hospital because she's depressed?

164
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,673
-No.
-Are you crazy?

165
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,175
You're treating my child
like a sick person!

166
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,303
Ma'am, he didn't mean it that way.

167
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,013
-Let's wait and see.
-Depression.

168
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,974
It's a common medical illness
students in stress suffer from.

169
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,394
So don't overwhelm her
and please take good care of her.

170
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,980
Are you a doctor? What are you?

171
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,441
You're nothing but a school nurse.

172
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,484
You know nothing about my daughter!

173
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,989
My daughter fainted
because you gave her random medication.

174
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,992
It's my fault I was negligent
in administering medication.

175
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,579
-But what's more important is Hui-ji's--
-Mr. Lee.

176
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,496
-See?
-Stop.

177
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,831
You heard him.

178
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,876
He admitted his fault.

179
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,755
How can I trust a person like this
and send my daughter to school?

180
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,382
I'm going to report this
to the Office of Education.

181
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,884
Office of Education?

182
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,969
Apologize to her, Mr. Lee.

183
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,472
Apologize to her now.

184
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,848
What are you doing?

185
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,101
I'll take full responsibility and resign.

186
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,274
COSMOS
NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE THEORY

187
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,282
Mr. Lee.

188
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,577
Ha-young.

189
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,621
You didn't do anything wrong.

190
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,830
Why do you have to quit?

191
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,624
I did nothing wrong.

192
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,960
Hui-ji came in and stole medicine.

193
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,711
I saw her sneaking the pills.

194
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,172
Don't be mean to her. She's unwell.

195
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,591
Take care of her. You're her friend.

196
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,388
Still, if you have to quit like this,

197
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,847
it's not fair.

198
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,519
Don't worry. I'm quite capable.

199
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,646
Lots of places want me.

200
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:33,033
Heon. You knew that Hui-ji was unwell,
didn't you?

201
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,786
Yes.

202
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,999
I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

203
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,292
It's okay.

204
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,006
Will Jin-hwan will be okay?

205
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,176
Yes.

206
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,845
Don't worry.

207
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,229
-Let's go.
-One.

208
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,398
-Two.
-Hey, did you see?

209
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,567
Hui-ji posted something
on the school bulletin board.

210
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,486
She said she stole the medication,
and Mr. Lee was innocent.

211
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,989
She also wrote she was going abroad
and said goodbye.

212
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,532
-Isn't it crazy?
-For real?

213
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,035
-No way.
-I told you it wasn't true.

214
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,828
-It's the truth.
-Se-hyeong.

215
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,330
Start practicing.

216
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm not lying.

217
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,168
Spin him.

218
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,795
Are you all right?

219
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,297
Why wouldn't I be?

220
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,342
Jin-hwan hasn't called, has he?

221
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,511
I'm sure he isn't calling me
because he's okay.

222
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,599
Gather around.

223
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,310
Hurry up.

224
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,648
We'll start the fitness test.

225
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,233
Come forward.

226
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,360
Are you Number One? Okay.

227
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,630
What?

228
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,840
-Isn't that Jin-hwan?
-Unbelievable.

229
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,112
Look at that punk's hair.

230
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:37,866
Hey! I heard you were in the hospital.
Why are you here?

231
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,454
Why aren't you answering me?
Hey, come here.

232
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,665
-Come over here.
-Sir. Wait.

233
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,250
-Wait.
-What? Let go.

234
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,127
-One, two--
-Three.

235
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,129
-Hey!
-Please wait, sir.

236
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,840
Heon, what are you doing?

237
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,091
Hello.

238
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,218
As you all know,

239
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,137
my name is Jeong Jin-hwan.

240
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,765
Jin-hwan, you're so cool!

241
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,269
-Stop.
-Well.

242
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:09,314
I'm up here today because

243
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,990
I want to ask a girl I like
to officially go out with me.

244
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,284
Jin-hwan, you're the man!

245
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,036
That little…

246
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,248
She is

247
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,375
pretty.

248
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,586
Especially when she smiles.

249
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,172
She has a pretty face,

250
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,841
she's smart,
and she has a great personality.

251
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:40,470
She's a wonderful girl
who's better than me in many ways.

252
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,264
Hey, get down from there!

253
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,016
-Come here.
-Stop him.

254
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:48,478
-What are you doing? Hey!
-Hold his legs.

255
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,605
So far,

256
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,982
I have never told her

257
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,277
how I felt about her sincerely.

258
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:00,449
So she probably thought
I was only kidding.

259
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,492
But just for today,

260
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,746
I want to tell her
from the bottom of my heart.

261
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,173
Ha-young.

262
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,842
I really

263
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,722
like you with all my heart.

264
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,228
Kang Ha-young! I like you!

265
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,233
-He likes her!
-Wow!

266
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,984
-Date him!
-Goodness.

267
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,779
-Give him a hug.
-Go.

268
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,448
-I can't believe this.
-Amazing.

269
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,367
-That's so cool.
-Nice.

270
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,743
He likes her!

271
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,165
"I like you," my foot.
Wait, is she smiling?

272
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,060
Heon is so hot
even when he's reading a book.

273
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,693
DREAMING ATTIC

274
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,107
You're so cool!

275
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,818
I do look cooler when I'm playing sports.

276
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,113
That was close.

277
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,657
Ha-young will be here soon.

278
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,285
You're high school seniors.
Aren't you busy?

279
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,329
You're Jin-hwan's friend, right?

280
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,665
He asked me to tell you
that he was discharged.

281
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,252
He might have to give up swimming.

282
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,797
Do your shoulders hurt a lot?

283
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,342
No, Brother. I'm Marine Boy Woo Dae-sung.

284
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,178
Dae-sung and I decided that
we'll study really hard.

285
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,138
-Sol-i.
-Yes?

286
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,058
Heon, did you know how to lie?

287
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:36,646
