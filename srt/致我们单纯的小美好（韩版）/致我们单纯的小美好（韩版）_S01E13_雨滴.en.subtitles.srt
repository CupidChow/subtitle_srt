1
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,916
Thanks for today.

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,587
I didn't do anything.

3
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,339
Don't say that.

4
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,265
See you tomorrow, with a smile.

5
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,658
I'll get going then.

6
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:30,757
Look, Heon.

7
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,220
I like Sol-i.

8
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,348
So what?

9
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,772
Don't hurt her feelings.

10
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,848
Heon.

11
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,017
Put it down if you're not buying.

12
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,393
I'm going to.

13
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,521
You and Sol-i fought, didn't you?

14
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,650
-We didn't.
-Then why is she like that?

15
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,444
She's not herself today.

16
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,156
Come on. Be honest with me.

17
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,783
Did you like Sol-i, too,
but played hard to get?

18
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,076
Right?

19
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,953
You did. You played hard to get.

20
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,497
-That's not it.
-As if. It's written on your face.

21
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,583
-Stop talking nonsense.
-Fine.

22
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,876
Then…

23
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,714
I'll help you solve the issue
if you buy me this.

24
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,759
Forget it.

25
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,653
What do I have to do?

26
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,735
Brother, is this yours?

27
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:42,824
No.

28
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,623
Oh, I see.

29
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,952
Brother, what are you doing tomorrow?

30
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,455
I'm not sure. Why?

31
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,499
Coach gave me a day off tomorrow,
so let's have some fun.

32
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,836
Sure.

33
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,381
Ms. Moon.

34
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,216
Hey, Hui-ji.

35
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,428
-The homework printouts are over there.
-Okay.

36
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,447
Gosh, thank you so much.

37
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,032
Thanks!

38
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,784
-I wish you luck.
-Good luck.

39
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,412
-Let's go.
-Can you believe it?

40
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,543
Ha-young, Sol-i!

41
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,046
Come on. Have a seat.

42
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,591
-Right here.
-Ha-young! Sol-i!

43
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,011
-Do you want me to read your horoscopes?
-Horoscopes?

44
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,765
Yes, all I need is your zodiac sign
and that of the person you like.

45
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,725
I checked all 12 months

46
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,353
to cover all the ladies I'm involved with,

47
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,689
and you'll be shocked
to see how insightful she is.

48
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,484
Ha-young, what's your sign?

49
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,444
Scorpio.

50
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,655
Scorpio.

51
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,701
Oh, and…

52
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,037
His is Cancer.

53
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,956
Got it.

54
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,335
With both signs, Venus is in Aquarius.

55
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,588
That's why the two of you
are drawn to each other

56
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,633
like the north and south pole of a magnet.

57
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,593
A couple can't have a better reading.

58
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,512
-Really?
-Yes.

59
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,390
Ha-young, see? What did I tell you?

60
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,267
I told you she's accurate!

61
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,853
Come on.

62
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,521
See that bread? Go and pay for it.

63
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,401
Sol-i, I know you're interested too.
Buy me some bread and sit.

64
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,278
I'm good.

65
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,546
My sign is Cancer, and the girl I like…

66
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,966
-She's a Scorpio.
-What?

67
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,593
Quiet!

68
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,179
That's exactly what Ha-young mentioned.

69
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,389
What's going on with them?

70
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,935
Is the result the same
when the signs are reversed too?

71
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,437
Of course.

72
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,316
Ma'am,

73
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,652
drink this. Don't choke on your bread.

74
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,654
I'll go now.

75
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,122
Can you believe all these are ours?

76
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,207
Thanks.

77
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,627
Sol-i, are you sure?
Isn't there a boy you like?

78
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,589
No, there isn't.

79
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,766
Mr. Lee, I need a painkiller.
My head hurts so much.

80
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,519
Didn't you come for some yesterday?

81
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,771
I took all of them. Hurry.

82
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,904
Hui-ji, it's not good
to resort to painkillers.

83
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,405
Did you even sleep?

84
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,616
Lack of sleep can cause headaches too.

85
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,826
I don't care. Just give me a painkiller.

86
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,684
-Hi, Mr. Lee.
-Hi.

87
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:21,852
Heon.

88
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,813
-Aren't you classmates with Hui-ji?
-Yes.

89
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,190
Do you know if there's
anything troubling her?

90
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,569
Well…

91
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,445
No.

92
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,449
She seems to be having a hard time lately,

93
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,577
so look out for her.

94
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,829
Okay.

95
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,467
What should we do tomorrow?

96
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,514
What? Sure.

97
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,102
What are you thinking about so hard?

98
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,896
Nothing.

99
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:10,985
Here.

100
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,987
Drink this and cheer up.

101
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,449
Thanks.

102
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,662
Sol-i, are you blind?

103
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,998
Sorry. Are you all right?

104
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,458
Watch where you're going.

105
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,504
-I will. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
-Is that all you have to say?

106
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,257
Why are you always causing trouble?

107
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,010
Hui-ji, isn't that too harsh?

108
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,511
Stop.

109
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,605
Go in first.

110
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,857
Let's go.

111
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,445
Heon.

112
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,031
What are you doing right now?

113
00:10:59,033 --> 00:10:59,909
Heon.

114
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,954
You're such a jerk.

115
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,448
YUIL HIGH SCHOOL
MID-TERMS, CALCULUS 1

116
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,325
Who's there?

117
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,248
What do you think you're doing, huh?

118
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,209
Who are you?

119
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,423
What on earth? Oh Hui-ji?

120
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,758
What are you doing here?

121
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,761
You…

122
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,098
-Were you--
-No, sir.

123
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,433
You little…

124
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,810
What do you mean, "No"?

125
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,812
How will you explain this, then?

126
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,355
How dare you steal exam papers?

127
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,483
-I--
-Explain yourself right away!

128
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,318
It's not what you think, sir.

129
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,361
Hui-ji, what's wrong?

130
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,324
-What's going on?
-It's your student.

131
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,494
I just caught her
stealing these exam papers.

132
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,453
Sorry?

133
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,080
Ms. Moon, it's not true.

134
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,541
Stop lying. I caught you in the act!

135
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,960
Come clean, right now!

136
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,545
I didn't peek.

137
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,465
Ms. Moon, I'm innocent!

138
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,105
Heon, check this out.

139
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,857
I got a love letter.

140
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,319
A love letter, at your age?

141
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,988
I got a lot in kindergarten too.

142
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,575
I heard you get a lot too. Sol-i told me.

143
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,205
Are you and Sol-i close?

144
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,375
Yes, I met her today as well.
We had a chat.

145
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,544
She's totally my type.

146
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,587
Your type?

147
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,383
My dream is to marry
someone as cute as her.

148
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,719
No, I'll just marry her instead.

149
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,765
-No way.
-Who are you to stop me?

150
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,560
Dating and marrying older women
is the trend these days.

151
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,940
Geon, go back to your room and study.

152
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,736
By the way, why are you so prickly today?

153
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,405
Did you perhaps…

154
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,532
have a fight with Sol-i?

155
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,285
Sol-i seemed gloomy, too.

156
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,123
Heon, the man should always
apologize first when that happens.

157
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,834
It's mostly the guy's fault.

158
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,337
Who taught you that?

159
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,811
Heon, do you know the term
"Pupils exceed their matters"?

160
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,022
I see you learned a lot from me.

161
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,399
I couldn't be prouder.

162
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,151
"Masters," not "matters."

163
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,446
I know. Don't interrupt your master.

164
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,741
Anyway, what's important now is that…

165
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,661
you'll be playing the piano.

166
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,082
And for Sol-i, of all people.

167
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,377
So? When will she be here?

168
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,545
HA-YOUNG

169
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,130
Sol-i, come to the auditorium.

170
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,852
Ha-young?

171
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,876
Look, guys. It's Oh Hui-ji.

172
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,295
She got caught stealing exam papers.

173
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,964
I was never fond of her.

174
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,466
She pretended she was a model student
all this time.

175
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,011
-She makes me sick.
-She's hungry for grades.

176
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,430
She'll trade her conscience
for a good university.

177
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,598
Will she steal the exam papers
at university too?

178
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,684
Hey! Did you guys see it yourselves?

179
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,853
Did you actually see her stealing them?

180
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,813
No, but we know it's true.

181
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,024
I had enough with these annoying rumors.

182
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,276
Hui-ji, let's go home.

183
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,861
Okay.

184
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,409
-See?
-Unbelievable.

185
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,165
Sol--

186
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,668
Hop on.

187
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,754
Where are we going?

188
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,297
You'll see.

189
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,049
Okay.

190
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,186
Have you tried this before?

191
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,313
Then watch.

192
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,357
Loosen the tension in your wrist
and gently throw the ball.

193
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,318
Give it a try.

194
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,570
Gently, shoot.

195
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,323
That's it! Nice job.

196
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,159
Come on. Faster.

197
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,453
You're great at this.

198
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,039
-Seriously.
-This is fun!

199
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,124
-Right?
-It's so fun.

200
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,799
Shoot!

201
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,510
It won't go in.

202
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,515
I scored again. Look. I'm a natural!

203
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,770
HEAD COACH

204
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,773
Dae-sung, I'll wait at the hospital.
Don't be late.

205
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,025
Incredible! Dae-sung, look.

206
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,778
Right. You're doing great. A few more.

207
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,489
Brother, here's the last one.

208
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,325
-All right.
-Good luck.

209
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,879
How was that? Wasn't it fun?

210
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,215
Yes, it blew away all of my stress.

211
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,884
-Me too. Should we get going then?
-Sure.

212
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,518
PHYSIATRIST

213
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,520
He shouldn't train for the time being.

214
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,898
He won't be able to compete
with a shoulder like that.

215
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,360
Doctor, is there really no other way?

216
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,117
-Hey, Dae-sung.
-Where are you?

217
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,494
Did you get home safely?
It's raining outside.

218
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,830
I'm fine. I'm almost home.

219
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,916
I had a lot of fun today.

220
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,251
-Thanks.
-So did I.

221
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,713
-I'll see you at school then.
-Sure. Good night.

222
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,877
Heon, where are you going?

223
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,797
-Why?
-Are you going to see Sol-i?

224
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,548
No.

225
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,387
I'm going to see the dog.

226
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,931
The cute neighborhood dog?

227
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,683
Take me with you. Just a second.

228
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,447
Why doesn't he let me see it?

229
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,344
-It's nothing.
-Just sit back down.

230
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:45,971
I can handle it now.

231
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,640
Heon, can you come with me?

232
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,642
Why are you so dazed?

233
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,228
Sweets are the best cure
when you're depressed.

234
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,772
Because she's talking nonsense.

235
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,482
Will Jin-hwan be all right?

236
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,359
What if she doesn't wake up?

237
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,236
I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

238
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,740
It's okay.

239
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:10,787
