00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:40,832
JULY 2007, SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN

2
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,189
What are you doing next Saturday?

3
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,414
Do you want to hang out? You can't say no!

4
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,786
Sol-i. What are you doing next Saturday?

5
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,123
Do you want to go
to the Dream Concert with me?

6
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:09,003
Sorry. I'm watching
the MUFC match that day

7
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,171
with Heon.

8
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,924
What? Did you get the tickets?

9
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,761
Don't I have plenty of time to buy them?

10
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,138
MUFC isn't a morning soccer club.

11
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,140
The tickets probably sold out already.

12
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:23,518
Sol-i, do you know what team MUFC is?

13
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,938
Yes, it's Park Ji-sung's team.
Heon is a huge fan of MUFC.

14
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,066
This is a rare opportunity.

15
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,277
How tear-jerking.

16
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,697
Even scalping tickets
are really expensive.

17
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,703
Man, it's so clean.

18
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:45,039
Mother.

19
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,877
I finished cleaning.

20
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,628
Will you give me some allowance?

21
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,048
There.

22
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,426
Give me a little more.

23
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,846
I cleaned the living room
and my room really nicely.

24
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,681
How much more do you need?

25
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,143
A hundred thousand won?

26
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,896
You want 100,000 won
for 10 minutes of cleaning?

27
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,439
What a thief.

28
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:15,236
Well, MUFC is coming to Seoul
next Saturday.

29
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,447
I want to see their match.

30
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,699
Park Ji-sung will be playing.

31
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,077
I may not get another chance
to see a match like this.

32
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,830
Just watch it on TV. We have a TV.

33
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,999
Mom.

34
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,844
What? Am I too handsome?

35
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,014
Haven't you looked in the mirror?

36
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,141
Anyway, how much money do you have?

37
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,063
Ha-young, you can't take money
from someone by force publicly.

38
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,439
Just tell me how much you have.

39
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,691
We need to buy Sol-i's birthday gift.

40
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,527
Is it Brother's birthday? When is it?

41
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,820
Next Saturday.

42
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,782
What? Why didn't I know?

43
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:04,702
Maybe she was worried
you'd buy her a building if you knew.

44
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,789
Ha-young, now that Dae-sung knows,

45
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,749
we won't have to buy her a gift.

46
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,875
Come on.

47
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,919
Are we not her friends?

48
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,342
Here. It's all of my pocket money
for this month.

49
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,512
We'll be able to buy a MUFC ticket
with this with your money, right?

50
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,972
"A MUFC ticket"?

51
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,891
Don't worry about it, Dae-sung.
Focus on tomorrow's swim meet.

52
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,937
We'll be there to cheer for you,
so you better place first.

53
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,648
Don't you worry about that.
See you tomorrow.

54
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,984
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

55
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,151
Go for it.

56
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,115
Jin-hwan, you said you have a friend
who's a pro at buying these.

57
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,533
Ask him.

58
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,743
Put this in your pocket.

59
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,161
If you lose it,

60
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,081
I'll kill you.

61
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,584
GYEONGGI NATIONAL SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIPS
HIGH SCHOOL GROUP FINALS

62
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,961
WOO DAE-SUNG, LET'S GO!

63
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,213
If he places first,
he's the best in Korea, right?

64
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,548
Yes. That's right.

65
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,551
Ha-young, I'm already nervous.

66
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,594
I don't think I can watch.

67
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,722
Then go outside and don't bother me.

68
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,308
It's Dae-sung.

69
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:13,313
-Woo Dae-sung!
-Woo Dae-sung!

70
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,856
Ready.

71
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,715
BEST SWIMMER!

72
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,098
You're almost there.

73
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,016
Go, Dae-sung!

74
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,355
Yes!

75
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,028
1: WOO DAE-SUNG

76
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,198
He came first!

77
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,956
Dae-sung's here.

78
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,667
PRIDE OF YUIL
WOO DAE-SUNG, LET'S GO!

79
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,295
Dae-sung, congratulations
on reclaiming the first place.

80
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,838
Thank you.

81
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,257
You failed to place first
in the last national championships,

82
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,301
but you reclaimed the top spot this time.

83
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,888
I want to know how you were able
to overcome the slump and win today.

84
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,723
It's all

85
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,892
thanks to her.

86
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,107
Dae-sung, are you going public
with your girlfriend?

87
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,650
Can you tell us more?

88
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,737
He says it's thanks to Sol-i, Shin Sol-i!

89
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,615
Incredible.
Are you guys going to date each other?

90
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,286
Eat up.

91
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,374
Oh, Dae-sung and Shin Sol-i!

92
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,835
Why are you guys so close?

93
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,712
Are you really dating each other or what?

94
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,465
When did you start dating?
Who made the move first?

95
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,509
When's the official announcement?

96
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,262
I want to know!

97
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,304
-Se-hyeong!
-What?

98
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,390
I want to know.

99
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,724
I'm curious.

100
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,561
Are you okay?

101
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,272
-Se-hyeong, you…
-Sorry.

102
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,149
Heon.

103
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,610
-What?
-Don't wait for me after school.

104
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,112
I have somewhere to go.

105
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,239
We'll have more fun on Saturday, okay?

106
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,742
I told you this was Brother's.

107
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,369
-Sir!
-Welcome.

108
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,458
I'm sorry. I already hired someone.

109
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,251
Did you?

110
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,919
Excuse me, one soju, please.

111
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,546
Okay. Coming right up.

112
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,091
-One soju, please.
-Okay.

113
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,721
Here you go, two bulgogi burger meals.

114
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,556
Thank you. Enjoy.

115
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,058
Hey, Brother.

116
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,394
Wait, Dae-sung?

117
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,900
What have you been doing until now
instead of going home for dinner?

118
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,986
I couldn't get a part-time job,

119
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,654
and I was starving.

120
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,781
Do you work here?

121
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:12,783
I'm so jealous.

122
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,161
-Why do you need a job?
-Oh.

123
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,954
I have something to buy.

124
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,042
By the way, Dae-sung. I have a question.

125
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,377
What is it?

126
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:27,423
What's the secret you wrote down that day?

127
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,262
I…

128
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,431
Well…

129
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,270
Hamburgers!
I think I wrote, "I love hamburgers."

130
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,773
For real? So it's not a lie, is it?

131
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,358
Of course not!

132
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,402
Okay.

133
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,864
Thanks.

134
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:57,995
Heon.

135
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,460
I was going to give it to you on Saturday.

136
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,468
Ta-da! It's a uniform
with Park Ji-sung's autograph.

137
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,179
I wanted to go see
the MUFC match with you,

138
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,098
but I couldn't get a ticket,
so I bought this.

139
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,100
It's okay. You can have it.

140
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,853
Why? You like Park Ji-sung.

141
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,188
I don't need it.

142
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,736
I went through so much to get this.

143
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,990
-I asked Dae-sung, and--
-How much was it?

144
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,410
Fifty thousand won.

145
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,128
There. So stop following me.

146
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:51,382
I won't be there on Saturday either,
so don't wait for me.

147
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,960
Jin-hwan, what are you doing?

148
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,967
Why are you avoiding me?

149
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,054
-I am not.
-Yes, you are.

150
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,013
Look at me.

151
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,389
I am not.

152
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,476
I can't look at you
because you're too dazzling.

153
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,937
Stop joking
and tell me the truth. What is it?

154
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,065
Well…

155
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,525
Actually…

156
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,903
I lost it.

157
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,783
You idiot! How can you lose it?

158
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,909
I'm sorry, Ha-young.

159
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,037
-But technically, it was taken--
-Okay.

160
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,790
Change of plans.

161
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,637
-What's up?
-Cha Heon.

162
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,349
You know Sol-i's trying to get
a ticket to the MUFC match, right?

163
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,394
Why do you think
she's going through all that trouble?

164
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,231
The match is on
the same day as the Dream Concert.

165
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,566
All of Sol-i's favorite singers
will be there.

166
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,196
Hey. You know it's Sol-i's birthday
this Saturday, right?

167
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,746
YUIL HIGH SCHOOL

168
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,130
LET'S MAKE A SCHOOL
WHERE EVERYONE IS HAPPY TOGETHER

169
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,339
Hello.

170
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,924
Do you know where Dae-sung is?

171
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,636
Well…

172
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,514
The next meet is just around the corner.

173
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,350
He's been missing practice
during this critical period.

174
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,728
He hasn't been coming home, either.

175
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,896
-Coach.
-Yes.

176
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,065
Don't be too hard on him.

177
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,360
He's a good kid,
and swimming is everything to him.

178
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:20,322
He never missed practice
even when he hung out with us.

179
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,908
He likes spending time with us,

180
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,077
but he said
he's the happiest when he swims.

181
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,916
I think Dae-sung is amazing.

182
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,836
Okay, payment by card.

183
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,591
-Here's your receipt. Thank you.
-Thank you.

184
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,433
Hello.

185
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,393
What would you--

186
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,400
One bulgogi meal, please.

187
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,239
Payment by card.

188
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,533
Please.

189
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,243
Come home tonight.

190
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,436
Who was that?

191
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,564
-Pardon?
-Who was he?

192
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,608
Well…

193
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,824
My dad.

194
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,514
Jin-hwan.

195
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,058
Well…

196
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,437
The Dream Concert ticket.

197
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,148
Where can I buy it?

198
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,568
HEON

199
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,119
Hello?

200
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,663
What's tomorrow's lunch menu?

201
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,082
-What?
-What's tomorrow's lunch menu?

202
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,753
Chicken curry rice.

203
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,504
Why do you ask?

204
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,424
I was just curious.

205
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,470
-I see.
-Good night.

206
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,513
See you tomorrow.

207
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,574
I'm still mad at him, though.

208
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,121
My daughter.

209
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,290
Do you want to see what I got?

210
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,378
Ta-da. I got two tickets.

211
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,505
Wow. For real?

212
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,091
Why the long face? Is something wrong?

213
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,342
No.

214
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,512
Thanks anyway, Dad.

215
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:18,769
Sol-i.

216
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,437
Yes?

217
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,316
Hi.

218
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,361
Yes. Hi.

219
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,167
Good morning.

220
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:43,961
Oh, good morning.

221
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,839
Did you go home last night?

222
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,800
Yes, thanks to you.

223
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,343
I'm a great friend, aren't I?

224
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,971
Of course. Brother, you're the best.

225
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,557
Do you have plans tomorrow?
Let's hang out.

226
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,643
I…

227
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,855
-Well…
-Sol-i.

228
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,315
Yes?

229
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,028
Got any correction tape?

230
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,448
Yes. I'll check.

231
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,543
Here.

232
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,505
Thanks.

233
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,648
TICKETS

234
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,112
-Hello?
-Where are you?

235
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,114
I'm at the stadium.

236
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,532
What about you?

237
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,619
Where exactly? I don't see you.

238
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,955
I'm at the main entrance. Come here.

239
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,166
The match starts in an hour.

240
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,418
-"The match"?
-Yes. What?

241
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,463
We said we'd watch the MUFC match.

242
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,507
Okay.

243
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,509
I'll be there.

244
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,601
Sol-i.

245
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,561
Heon!

246
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,774
What? These are fake?

247
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,778
How can these be fake?

248
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,824
My dad paid a lot for these tickets.

249
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,119
Look. It doesn't say "Mankheste United."

250
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,913
It says "Mankheste Unit."

251
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,084
But these are the most realistic rip-offs
I saw today.

252
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:48,961
Oh…

253
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,089
Please check them one more time.

254
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,175
-Let's just go.
-How?

255
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:59,012
Dad couldn't have bought fake tickets.

256
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,682
Right. Heon's mom told me

257
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,143
the MUFC tickets cost a lot.

258
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,769
How much were they?

259
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,980
They weren't expensive.

260
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,983
I bought them on the internet.
Do you know how much they were?

261
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,776
Only 30,000 won.

262
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,863
-Goodness.
-Also, it was a two-for-one.

263
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,907
Gi-heon, that was a smart purchase.

264
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,660
Didn't I do a good job?

265
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,829
-Good job.
-Thanks.

266
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,256
Heon.

267
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,509
Can you plug your ears for a minute?

268
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,568
I'm sorry. I was fixing my clothes.

269
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,408
By the way, Heon,

270
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,536
don't you have anything to say to me?

271
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,331
Like what?

272
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,457
Well,

273
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,127
The secret you wrote down.

274
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,297
That's supposed to stay secret.

275
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,050
What did you write?

276
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,384
Please tell me.

277
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,609
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME

278
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,368
I don't want to play this game.

279
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,580
I like Shin Sol-i.

280
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,631
I LIKE SHIN SOL-I

281
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,761
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME

282
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,559
The person I like is here.

283
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,776
-What's wrong?
-What?

284
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,280
Nothing. Never mind.

285
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,573
Let's go.

286
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,491
Okay.

287
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,177
Sol-i.

288
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,971
Yes?

289
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,514
Happy birthday.

290
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,563
Yes. Thanks.

291
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,249
I'm sure this is the place.

292
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,543
Where is it?

293
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,629
What are you looking for?

294
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,215
On the day we fought,

295
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,843
I threw the money on the ground.

296
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,596
Did you take it?

297
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,473
-Of course not.
-Darn it.

298
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,225
I can't find it.

299
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,061
I guess someone took it.

300
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,272
That was days ago. It can't be here.

301
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,150
Right?

302
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,903
Anyway, Heon,
that looks really good on you.

303
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,962
By the way,
Park Ji-sung's back number is 13.

304
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,438
Jeez, I guess I got scammed, too.

305
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,108
Let's go.

306
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,318
Okay.

307
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,508
-What should I do?
-What else? Just go out with him.

308
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,094
I saw the Game of Truth note.

309
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,388
-That was just a joke.
-What?

310
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:52,848
Did you believe that?

311
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,474
We don't go easy on girls.

312
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,017
Hey! Leave her alone.

313
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,187
-I embarrass you, don't I?
-I like the lineup, though.

314
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,398
Heon, can you lend me a hand?

315
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,983
I gave it up for you.

316
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,693
-It's Woo Dae-sung.
-Me?

317
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,570
-Very shocking.
-Where have you been?

318
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,738
Heon, you believe me, right?

319
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:14,619
