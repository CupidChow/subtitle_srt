1
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,913
Any ideas for dinner?

2
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,041
I don't know. What should we have?

3
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,417
Let's go out for dinner.

4
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,005
Dr. Cha, this is for you.

5
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,967
-Thank you.
-I heard things have been rough.

6
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,969
Dr. Park's been worried.

7
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:57,223
People just love you
both here and at the campus.

8
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,644
Honey!

9
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,022
Sol-i's here.

10
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,107
Sol-i waited for so long!

11
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,276
"Coming through."

12
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:16,534
Sol-i missed you so much.
She was dying to see you!

13
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,537
Just how much, you ask?

14
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,831
This much!

15
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,851
Why are you already here?

16
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,645
I said I'd go to you after work.

17
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,940
No reason. I missed you so much.

18
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,400
I doubt that's the case.

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,613
You're always busy,
so I don't mind coming to see you.

20
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,204
Heon.

21
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,415
Can we stay like this for a while?

22
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,334
I need to get recharged.

23
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:18,972
Sol-i.

24
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,099
Yes?

25
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,150
Now that you're here, I don't want to go.

26
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,403
Already?

27
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,410
They're calling me.

28
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,371
I'll get going.

29
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,304
Hurry up.

30
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,660
SEPTEMBER 2016, AUTUMN OF TWENTY-SEVEN

31
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,173
FAVORITES

32
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,591
HONEY

33
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,603
The number you have called is unavailable.
You'll be directed to voicemail.

34
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,520
SOL-I

35
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,606
Jang Yeon-bok, male, 48.

36
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,734
He arrived at the hospital today
at 9:30 a.m.

37
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,945
and received a cardiac angiogram,

38
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,491
but a coronary artery bypass graft
was performed due to his stent stricture.

39
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,159
Dr. Yoo Min-hyeon led the surgery,

40
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,788
and it took 5 hours and 30 minutes,
from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

41
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,999
The surgery was successful,
and the patient regained consciousness.

42
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,709
Extubation followed.

43
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,754
Here. Congratulations
on opening the art studio.

44
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,172
Thanks.

45
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,925
Do you know you're the last one to visit?

46
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,886
I got upset
because I thought you wouldn't come.

47
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,557
I'm sorry.
I've been too busy with job hunting.

48
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,142
So? Is it going well?

49
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,396
Unsuccessful, I guess.

50
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,069
It must be tough. Shall I help?

51
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,738
No, it's okay.

52
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,660
You need connections
to work at art studios these days.

53
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,704
Come and work for me. I'll hire you.

54
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,500
Honestly, it's okay.

55
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,592
-How are you feeling, sir?
-Good.

56
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:05,305
If everything checks out,
you'll go home next week.

57
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,432
Sure. Thank you for everything.

58

MEDICINE
SHIN SOL-I

59
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,692
I sent out job applications
to at least a dozen studios.

60
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:21,487
Why are none of them
asking for an interview?

61
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,203
Could it beâ€¦

62
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:30,872
Please.

63
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,463
YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE INTERNSHIP

64
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,012
Wait. I should call Heon first.

65
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,976
Please pick up.

66
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,105
You were at the top of your class
in medical school

67
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,399
and have been leading
a successful internship.

68
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,234
Thank you.

69
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:05,114
That's why I recommended you
for the training program in the US.

70
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,450
Pardon?

71
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,746
Why did you come? I said I'm okay.

72
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,498
You should have seen a doctor.

73
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,751
Here. have this porridge
and take your medicine.

74
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,128
Thanks, Ha-young. Thanks, Jin-hwan.

75
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,299
Sol-i, your boyfriend's a doctor.
You should call him right now.

76
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,302
-But he's busy.
-That's hardly an excuse.

77
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,222
My heart sinks even when Ha-young sneezes.

78
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,681
What's more important than--

79
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,810
Sol-i, get some rest.

80
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,021
-Okay.
-Anyway, we'll get going.

81
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,273
-Get well soon.
-Good luck on your job interview.

82
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,358
See you.

83
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,197
Ha-young, why are you flushed?

84
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,616
Did you catch a cold from her?

85
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,867
Stop it!

86
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,126
Should we cancel the movie
and rest at home?

87
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,961
I'm fine.

88
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,213
Come here.

89
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,507
I won't let you get sick.

90
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,176
Come on. Will you please stop?

91
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,470
How can I when you're sick?

92
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,101
I already had dinner. What about you?

93
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,352
Heon, are you busy?

94
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,521
I waited to tell you over the phone.

95
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,483
Heon, my In Design resume was accepted.

96
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,234
I have an interview tomorrow!

2016 F/W YOUTH INTERNSHIP 1ST INTERVIEW

101
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,013
RESUME

102
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,019
Ms. Shin, I see you went
to graduate school.

103
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:26,065
Yes, I felt the need
of broader, more structured education,

104
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,817
so I went to graduate school.

105
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,194
"Broader and more structured."

106
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,529
Everyone says that.

107
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,824
-Pardon?
-What do your parents do?

108
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,369
They run a small restaurant.

109
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,079
Their business must be going well.

110
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,373
Pardon?

111
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:46,711
I mean, not all parents can pay tuition
for their children's graduate school.

112
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,548
I just noticed
there's not much on your portfolio,

113
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,966
not even contest results.

114
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,430
Let's just wrap it up. You can leave now.

115
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,059
The interview's over. Next?

116
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,187
I see.

117
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,149
Thank you.

118
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,300
Are you busy today?

119
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,969
One of my teachers can't make it today.

120
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,680
Could you fill in for the day?

121
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,515
I'll pay you generously.

122
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,870
Exhausting, right? I bet you're hungry.

123
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,290
It's my treat for you.

124
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,711
-Thank you.
-How was it like working here?

125
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,296
Was it all right?

126
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,052
I don't think I'm good enough
to teach anyone just yet.

127
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,389
Think again. I'll help you out.

128
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,724
Haven't you heard?

129
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,976
I'm the best mentor you can find.

130
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,981
What are you doing?

131
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,275
Can't you tell?

132
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,388
Dr. Cha will go to the States, won't he?

133
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,390
You'll miss him, won't you?

134
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,184
Ms. Yoon, I told you it's not like that.

135
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,436
I know.

136
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,354
I'll probably miss him more.

137
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,607
Things will be dull around here
without the handsome Dr. Cha.

138
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,903
According to Dr. Heo,
he's leaving next month.

139
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,613
What? That soon?

140
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,657
I'll definitely miss him.

141
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,427
Sol-i, how was your job interview?

142
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,202
Why did you come without telling me?

143
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,596
Let's break up.

144
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:27,932
What?

145
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,021
What are youâ€¦

146
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,691
You're going to the US.

147
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,073
Why didn't you tell me?

148
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,746
I haven't decided yet.

149
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,546
Am I not a factor in that decision?

150
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,217
Sol-i.

151
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,280
What's wrong?

152
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,658
I can't

153
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,203
take it anymore.

154
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,092

00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,277
-First floorâ€¦
-Wait for me here.

157
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,029
I'll be right back.

160
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,853
-And Dr. Heo?
-He's performing an operation.

161
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,229
He's wrapping things up.

162
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,690
-Dr. Cha, V-tach!
-Bring the defibrillator. Hurry.

163
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,317
And the epinephrine.

164
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,447
-A hundred and fifty joules.
-Charged.

165
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,365
Clear.

166
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,161
-Two hundred joules.
-Charged.

167
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,207
Doctor, his blood pressure is dropping.

168
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,959
Full volume. Pump in more blood.

169
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,963
Switch.

170
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,001
Dr. Cha.

171
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,051
Are you Sol-i's boyfriend?

172
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,721
Hello.

173
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,765
What brings you here?

174
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,354
Could youâ€¦

175
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,565
tell Sol-i that I'm here?

176
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,568
Her phone's turned off.

177
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,614
Sol-i packed up and moved out today.

178
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,033
Didn't you know?

179
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,911
A MONTH LATER

180
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,378
SOL-I

181
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:42,848
Sol-i.

182
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,435
I'm leaving today.

183
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,819
Will you

184
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,822
come to see me?

185
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,951
Don't wait for me.

186
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,507
Ladies and gentlemen,
our flight will take off shortly.

187
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,135
Please fasten your seat belts.

188
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:30,163
Ladies and gentlemen, our flight will land
at Incheon International Airport shortly.

189
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,940
-It's been a while.
-It really is you, Heon.

190
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,192
Weren't you going to settle in the States?

191
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,486
I should have said hello sooner.
I'm Woo Dae-sung.

192
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,698
-What brings you here?
-I'll always be here for Sol-i.

193
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,408
Please do your best.

194
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,703
What? That's unlike you
to ask for a favor.

195
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,747
Drink this. I thought you don't drink.

196
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,707
-Thank you.
-Good job.

197
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,834
You're welcome. You asked me a favor.

198
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,378
How do you know each other?

199
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,921
You're Shin Sol-i, right?

200
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,549
-How do you know Dr. Cha?
-Why do you ask?

201
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,260
Sol-i, did you ever regret your decision?

202
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,722
Don't you want to know why I came back?

203
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:34,269
