1
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,077
Are you feeling better now?

2
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:21,873
Thanks.

3
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:26,836
We'll be late.

4
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,421
What?

5
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,183
-Come on.
-What?

6
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,894
Oh, okay.

7
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,065
Should I hold that for you?

8
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,859
-Sure.
-All right.

9
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,166
Good job.

10
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,877
Sol-i, you're running for class president?

11
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,422
But you always copy my homework,
doze off in class,

12
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,216
or doodle when you're less tired--

13
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,926
-Catch!
-I'm just saying.

14
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,720
I'm not saying
there's anything wrong with that.

15
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,265
No one in our class
is class president material.

16
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,308
Woo Dae-sung barely comes to school

17
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,435
and Cha Heon doesn't even know
his classmates' names.

18
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,312
But my Ha-young--

19
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,569
Heon, are you busy?

20
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,405
I finished writing my election speech.

21
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,323
Can you proofread it?

22
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,576
Sure. I'll catch you later.

23
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,493
Okay.

24
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,662
Are you really going to back off?

25
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:46,624
Your beloved Heon and that sly Hui-ji
will be fellow prefects at this rate.

26
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,334
Will you let that happen?

27
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,962
No, right?

28
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,923
"Hello, I'm Shin Sol-i!"

29
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,969
"Hello, I'm Shin Sol-i."

30
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:01,306
"Hello, I am Shin Sol-i."

31
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,768
It's not like they don't know who I am.

32
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,772
Oh, my gosh!

33
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,524
Why are you so down today?

34
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,695
Where's your spirit, Brother? Your voice
used to ring throughout the whole school.

35
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,071
Let me see.

36
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,159
"I, Shin Sol-i, will devote myself

37
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,245
and do everything I can for class 1-7!"

38
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,290
"I, Wang Se-hyeong,

39
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,835
will devote all my energy to my classmates

40
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,756
and do everything I can for class 1-7!"

41
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:39,469
-Wang Se-hyeong!
-Wang Se-hyeong!

42
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,639
-Vote for number three, Wang Se-hyeong!
-Vote for number three, Wang Se-hyeong!

43
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,100
By the way, Se-hyeong,
can I have some more bread?

44
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,729
Don't tell me
you copied Se-hyeong's speech.

45
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,232
Did you have the same tutor then?

46
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,319
I'm doomed for sure.

47
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,038
Rather than using such a cliché,

48
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,582
find what only you can offer.

49
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,794
Maybe I should just withdraw.

50
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,003
Don't worry.

51
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,965
You too have something to offer, Brother.

52
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,174
Which is what?

53
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,051
Your sincerity.

54
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,137
What? My sincerity?

55
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,016
You may be like a punching bag right now,

56
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,477
but you're without doubt
going to do your best.

57
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:30,895
Of course.

58
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,982
That alone makes you
deserving of the title class president.

59
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,277
Is that a compliment?

60
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,741
My Brother.

61
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,327
You have excellent
listening comprehension skills.

62
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,331
Hey, Dae-sung!

63
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,677
Over there!

64
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,262
Or maybe not.

65
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,685
CANDIDATES
OH HUI-JI, SHIN SOL-I, WANG SE-HYEONG

66
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,898
Heon!

67
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,818
-What?
-Who are you going to vote for?

68
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,489
No, don't tell me.

69
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,658
It should be anonymous, so don't.

70
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,909
Okay?

71
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,747
Anyway, I promise to do my best,
so trust me on that.

72
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,251
ELECTION DAY

73
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,966
Ms. Moon and fellow students, hello.

74
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,594
I'm Shin Sol-i.

75
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,930
I'm fully aware that my candidacy

76
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,640
shocked many of you

77
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,644
and that many of you think
I'm not qualified.

78
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,522
I don't get good grades,

79
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,941
nor am I a model student.

80
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,945
Also, I'm not a natural born leader
or particularly humorous.

81
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,533
HELLO, I'M SHIN SOL-I…

82
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,328
YOU CAN DO IT!

83
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,206
You've got this!

84
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,750
Go for it!

85
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,134
I easily make mistakes,

86
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,053
and I make lots of clumsy mistakes.

87
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,014
However, that's why

88
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:34,143
I believe there's room to grow
and improve in the right direction.

89
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:39,982
We'll be spending the most
important days of our lives together.

90
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:44,862
When the year is over,
rather than a clumsy troublemaker,

91
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,864
I'd like to be remembered

92
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,493
as your favorite class president
who helped and spoke up for everyone.

93
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,204
I'll do my best!

94
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:06,968
Here.

95
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,846
Thanks for helping me with my speech.

96
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,805
No, thanks.

97
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,265
Don't refuse. Just take them.

98
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,268
Hui-ji made it for you.
Why let them go to waste?

99
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,313
He accepted it!

100
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,316
Look, it's the vice president.

101
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,860
She got lucky, if you ask me.

102
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,028
Talk about not knowing your place.

103
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:26,988
Stop it.

104
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,906
What? Am I wrong?

105
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:32,994
What about you?

106
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,288
You should know your place.

107
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,790
It's all right.

108
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,756
Tell me why you didn't vote for Sol-i.

109
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,344
She's not it.

110
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,853
TWO HOURS AGO

111
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,106
Hui-ji and Sol-i are at a tie.

112
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,611
Ms. Moon, Heon isn't here.

113
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,827
Heon,

114
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,539
who will you vote for?

115
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,542
Heon, I'm right here.

116
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,794
Don't forget I'm your partner.

117
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,132
Please…

118
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,176
Oh Hui-ji.

119
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,492
Hey, Cha Heon.

120
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,203
-What?
-Why am I not up to the job?

121
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,663
You're not leader material.

122
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,081
And Hui-ji is?

123
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,500
Compared to you, yes.

124
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,671
Hey!

125
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,219
What? You kicked Heon?

126
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,804
You kicked him hard?

127
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,139
Keep it down, will you?

128
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,725
Wow, Sol-i, I'm really impressed.

129
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,227
You taught him a lesson.

130
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,814
Why am I exhilarated
when you're the one who kicked him?

131
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,317
I don't know what to do right now.

132
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,696
Do you think he'll accept my apology?

133
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,447
Heon, wait up!

134
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,741
No way. I just can't believe it.

135
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,159
Sol-i kicked you?

136
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,538
Sol-i, Shin Sol-i!

137
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,340
Sol-i, Shin Sol-i!

138
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,341
What?

139
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,011
-Here you go.
-What's this?

140
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,013
The money for the field day T-shirts.

141
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,140
Hui-ji told me to give it to you.

142
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,474
-Me?
-That's all I know.

143
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,061
She's making you do all the work now.

144
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,481
Ha-young, what do I do?

145
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,941
What else can you do?

146
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,860
It's your job as the vice president.

147
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,112
No, I mean about Heon.

148
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,740
How am I supposed
to ask him to pay the money?

149
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,825
What? Just ask.

150
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,078
Put him in a headlock
and point a gun at him.

151
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,913
"Bang! Pay up."

152
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,667
But he's too tall for me.

153
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,380
Do it when he's seated.
He usually is, anyway.

154
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,802
Okay, one, two, three. One!

155
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,639
-Darn it.
-Hang in there.

156
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,141
You're caving in. Jeez.

157
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,517
Do it!

158
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,397
"Bang! Pay up."

159
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,194
God, that was so cheap.

160
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,487
How about another game?

161
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,989
Hand me my change.

162
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:59,950
Heon,

163
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,788
Ms. Moon said I should ask you
to recommend some English books,

164
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,414
since you've read a lot.

165
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,209
I want to start reading in English.

166
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,211
What books do you recommend?

167
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,382
-I'll write you a list later on.
-Sure.

168
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,115
Are you done collecting the money?

169
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,117
Ms. Moon wants it by this afternoon.

170
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,412
Sure, got it.

171
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,455
-Let's go.
-Okay.

172
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,065
-What is it?
-Where did it go?

173
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,318
-Try to think.
-Okay.

174
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,365
Hand in your Korean language assignment.

175
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,831
Here.

176
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,166
SHIN SOL-I

177
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,792
This is crazy.

178
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,589
I think it's in my Korean language
notebook.

179
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,509
Then get it back

180
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,344
before Hui-ji and Su-jin find out.

181
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,180
But,

182
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,932
that means
I'll have to go to the staff room

183
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,435
and the person who sits next to Mr. Kim…

184
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,730
is Mr. Cho.

185
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,192
I won't be able to retrieve it.

186
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,950
KANG HA-YOUNG
SHIN SOL-I

187
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,844
Yes?

188
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,637
What's wrong? Are you sick?

189
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:08,889
No.

190
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,767
Actually, my stomach hurts.

191
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,020
Really?

192
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,827
Hi, Mr. Lee.

193
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,378
Mr. Lee, my stomach's killing me.

194
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,963
Can I get medicine?

195
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,090
Where does it hurt?

196
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,844
Why don't you show me?

197
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,889
Right.

198
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,395
This would be indigestion.

199
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,816
And this would be enteritis.

200
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,281
Then…

201
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,951
-Do they require different medicine?
-Of course.

202
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,787
The treatment varies
depending on the illness.

203
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,748
So…

204
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,707
And gender too.

205
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,419
Men and women need different medications.

206
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,005
So be more specific.

207
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,262
Then…

208
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,306
consider me a girl.

209
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,780
Thank you!

210
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,865
What do I do?

211
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,828
Here.

212
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,790
Take one.

213
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,588
What?

214
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,924
Take one now.

215
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,110
You lost the money, didn't you?

216
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,529
-No!
-Is that so?

217
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,992
-Forget it, then.
-Heon.

218
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,245
Help me.

219
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,206
-Why should I?
-I'm sorry I kicked you.

220
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,166
I was going to apologize right away.
I mean it.

221
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,293
If you help me,

222
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,046
I'll never forget your kindness.

223
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,466
Where did you lose it?

224
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,721
I put it in the homework notebook
I handed in.

225
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:56,974
Then…

226
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,604
why don't you go kick Mr. Kim
in the shins, too?

227
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,617
I'm doomed!

228
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,378
I'm sorry, but I'm begging you.

229
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,548
Please don't tell
my classmates about this,

230
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,717
especially Oh Hui-ji and Lee Su-jin.

231
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,011
They can't find out about this.

232
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,847
Please, sir.

233
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,973
What are you doing?

234
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,684
Why are you blocking the door?

235
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,110
STAFF ROOM

236
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,955
Heon, how are you feeling today?

237
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,499
I envy him.

238
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,926
Hui-ji, did you collect the money?

239
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,553
Yes, our vice president has it.

240
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,434
Sol-i, what's wrong?

241
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,819
Ms. Moon, the thing is…

242
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,321
I…

243
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,080
CHA HEON

244
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,355
Sol-i?

245
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,820
Ms. Moon, I apologize.

246
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,739
I lost the money I'd collected,

247
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,243
and Heon's just recovered it for me.

248
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,495
I knew she'd cause trouble.

249
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,956
Sol-i, are you kidding me?

250
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,375
I'm sorry, guys.

251
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,171
I guess I shouldn't be the vice president.

252
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,256
Shouldn't she resign?

253
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,716
She messed up big time.

254
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,719
You think so?

255
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,307
Quiet, everyone.

256
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,351
Anyone can make mistakes.

257
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,937
Even I, your teacher, make mistakes.

258
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:53,358
However, it's never easy to admit them.

259
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,863
One has to be brave
to openly admit their mistakes.

260
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,490
That is why I believe

261
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,993
what Sol-i just did is incredible.

262
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,041
It's not like the money's gone,

263
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,210
so isn't it all right?

264
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,464
-Right. Don't you agree?
-The money's all there.

265
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,382
That'll do.

266
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:42,991
Heon!

267
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,451
Here you go.

268
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,100
Hey, what was that?

269
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,435
Nothing, sir.

270
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,776
Get it together, all right?

271
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:22,197
You guys are going to be seniors soon.
Got it?

272
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,702
Yes, sir.

273
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,732
Let's go, Shin Sol-i!

274
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,942
-Shin Sol-i!
-Heon!

275
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,821
-The field day is next week--
-Which has nothing to do with you.

276
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,240
Heon, do you know
why she's practicing so hard?

277
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,076
Mr. Lee, is Ha-young
going to be all right?

278
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,077
I have to go now.

279
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,579
-Is there any way?
-Jump over the gate.

280
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,997
-What are you doing?
-The dean's coming.

281
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,750
How about we meet
at the playground briefly?

282
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,628
-Don't be nervous.
-Heon, will you help me?

283
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,015
