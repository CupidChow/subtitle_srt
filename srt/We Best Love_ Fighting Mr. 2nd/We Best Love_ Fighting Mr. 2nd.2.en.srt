1
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:24,458
One more.

2
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,525
Same?

3
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:39,206
No wonder he never replied.

4
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,890
It's okay. He's drunk.

5
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:58,725
What are you looking at!

6
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,393
Are you an idiot?

7
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,228
Sir.

8
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,671
Are you all right, sir?

9
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,640
Would you like me to call you a cab?

10
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,448
(I'm too timid to)

11
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,985
(face it.)

12
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:29,439
(I'm afraid that my sincerity is a joke to you.)

13
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,559
(We didn't even say goodbye.)

14
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,197
(How come it hurts so much more than I thought?)

15

26
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,849
You said whatever it takes.

27
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:33,954
Then let's do it.

28
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,730
Dare not?

29
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,406
OK.

30
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,795
As long as you can understand

31
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,164
I'm serious,

32
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,204
I can do anything for you.

33
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,126
Shall I help you?

34
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,361
Stop it! Maniac!

35
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,105
Shu Yi.

36
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,375
How did it go in the office with Gao Shi De?

37
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,544
Yeah, how did it go?

38
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,882
Why not just leave it

39
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,684
to me and Bing Wei?

40
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,120
I'm afraid if you keep doing this,

41
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,090
the whole company's gonna know about your old...

42
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:50,890
affair.

43
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,192
I didn't have an affair with him!

44
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,194
I thought you had already decided to move on.

45
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,429
Why are you guys being so coy now?

46
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,732
Do you still have feelings for him?

47
00:04:58,732 --> 00:04:59,899
No!

48
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,234
Are you an expert of love?

49
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,736
Don't act as if you know me well.

50
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:03,803
So annoying!

51
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,205
You, too.

52
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,639
Mind your own business.

53
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,915
Told you.

54
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,251
Don't worry about anyone else.

55
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,088
You consider him as your friend,

56
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,224
but he might not appreciate it.

57
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,894
If you are so kind,

58
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,897
do some charity work.

59
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:32,966
I...

60
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,502
Tell you what.

61
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,672
At least, there's a receipt for your donation.

62
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,306
But now,

63
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,674
you are having egg on your face.

64
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,776
So embarrassed.

65
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,177
You gets nothing from it.

66
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,346
I'm not asking for anything.

67
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,114
At work,

68
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,349
I am the Legal Specialist of the company,

69
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:50,850
and in private,

70
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,318
we are Shu Yi's friends, right?

71
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,954
Even so, you don't need to care too much.

72
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,556
Nosy.

73
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,224
Come on.

74
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,026
Don't say that.

75
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,129
Mind your own business.

76
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,164
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,802
I shouldn't have vented it out on you guys.

78
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,644
It's alright.

79
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,446
I'm glad you feels better now.

80
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,482
It's not alright.

81
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,521
You need to buy us ten meals

82
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,523
in Michelin three-star restaurants.

83
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,336
What are we going to do now?

84
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,572
System security comes first.

85
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,907
That's right.

86
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,409
But the overprotective measures

87
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,744
have caused the system to close.

88
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,846
That's the problem.

89
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:53,913
What could possibly go wrong?

90
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,548
We talked about this last time, okay?

91
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,850
And we did...

92
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,517
Hey.

93
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,184
What...

94
00:06:58,484 --> 00:06:59,252
I'll be right back.

95
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,388
Chief Technical Officer, look at him...

96
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,756
Chief Technical Officer.

97
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,592
Tech...

98
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,299
Good morning.

99
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:14,801
There you are.

100
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:18,872
Are we invisible?

101
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,275
Good morning, guys.

102
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,912
Have you had breakfast?

103
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:26,880
No.

104
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,847
Can you get it for me?

105
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,316
Seriously?

106
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,451
Of course.

107
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,285
Or what?

108
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,520
OK.

109
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:35,855
What would you like to have?

110
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,757
You know my taste.

111
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,092
Just decide for me.

112
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,360
Sure.

113
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,061
Congee.

114
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:42,929
It's good for the stomach.

115
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,898
By the way, Bing Wei.

116
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,132
He can't drink coffee with an empty stomach.

117
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:46,799
Keep an eye on him.

118
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,836
And he asked if he wanted coffee.

119
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,071
What the hell? That's crazy.

120
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,089
What are you looking at?

121
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,825
Don't you need to work?

122
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,334
Bing Wei.

123
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,902
I want to drink coffee.

124
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:23,836
Go get me some.

125
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,012
Shu Yi.

126
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,214
I need to talk to you.

127
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,471
Did you see that?

128
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,105
What did I just see?

129
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,139
Are we doomed?

130
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:00,506
I'll tell you what,

131
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,975
the CEO is already on Cheng Yi Group's side.

132
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:02,642
You know?

133
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,043
That means they will surely fire people.

134
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,345
What am I supposed to tell my wife?

135
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,579
Would I be the first one to go?

136
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,714
How to apply for the unemployment compensation?

137
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,514
Can we apply?

138
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,682
You wish! It isn't that easy.

139
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,384
Do you think it's that easy to get it?

140
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:15,989
What are you looking at?

141
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,156
Don't you have work?

142
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,890
We are not here for the scenery, are we?

143
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,558
Say something.

144
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:57,196
Are you out of your mind?

145
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,167
So just after one night,

146
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,436
you've decided to get back together with him?

147
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,571
And...

148
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,940
Go ahead.

149
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,043
What the hell are you thinking?

150
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,048
You're just my special assistant.

151
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,649
It's not your business.

152
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,651
I know it's not my business.

153
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,119
But you are being too emotional at work.

154
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,221
If anything goes wrong during the transition,

155
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,057
Bing Wei and I will have to
take the responsibility.

156
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,391
We'll be fired.

157
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:27,560
I'll take the responsibility.

158
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,597
How?

159
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,032
You might get fired, too!

160
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,101
Tell me.

161
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,804
What do you want?

162
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,143
Fine.

163
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,445
If you refuse to tell me,

164
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,082
I'll go to Gao Shi De and
tell him you want him back.

165
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,151
I'll dump him
when he thinks we are together again.

166
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,254
I want him to know I've never forgiven him.

167
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,522
It's just a lie.

168
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,826
I want him to feel the pain of being betrayed.

169
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,600
Do you have to go that far?

170
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,271
I know it since I was a kid

171
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,340
that people around me

172
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,908
are trying to impress me...

173
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,779
because of my dad.

174
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:21,347
Not me.

175
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,282
Not me or Bing Wei.

176
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,650
I'm not talking about you guys.

177
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,621
For me,

178
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,056
I can pretend to be someone's buddy.

179
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,758
But it's hard to trust someone

180
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:35,561
with all my heart.

181
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,134
Gao Shi De was the first person.

182
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,875
But he betrayed my trust.

183
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,110
If it were you,

184
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:52,612
would you forgive him?

185
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,213
Forgive?

186
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,654
I'll twist his head.

187
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,424
Both heads,

188
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,060
you know what I mean.

189
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,296
Come in.

190
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,098
Where's my breakfast?

191
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,366
Did you buy it?

192
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,467
It's on the table.

193
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:50,469
Thank you.

194
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,229
Is it good?

195
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:18,497
It's delicious.

196
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,300
I'm glad to hear that.

197
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,076
Shu Yi.

198
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,445
What's the matter?

199
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,664
Nothing.

200
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,332
Rick, I'll leave it to you.

201
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,133
OK.

202
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,241
Gao Shi De.

203
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,545
So are you gonna roll with it?

204
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,884
You eat with him every day,

205
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,186
work with him

206
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,756
and even send him home.

207
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:57,957
He never refused.

208
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,994
He's just trying to get you indulged into it

209
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,597
and break your heart when you are the happiest.

210
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,166
It'd be a clean kill.

211
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:12,905
Thank you.

212
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,110
Don't expect to get back to the old days

213
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,912
by playing along with him.

214
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,120
You ignored him for five years.

215
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,425
The only solution is to let him know

216
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,226
you didn't contact him

217
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,529
not because you dumped him

218
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,831
but because you couldn't.

219
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,640
I have to keep the promise.

220
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,179
What kind of promise is that?

221
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,781
You're not gonna make it.

222
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,251
Who says so?

223
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,160
Of course, I can.

224
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,174
What?

225
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,510
You're so sick.

226
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,179
You said he hated you.

227
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,695
What is "hate"?

228
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,035
It means he still loves me.

229
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,859
Even if it's just a little bit.

230
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,248
Gao Shi De.

231
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,596
Any good midnight snack around here?

232
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:34,840
Pei Shou Yi!

233
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,112
I've finally found you.

234
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,147
You said

235
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,549
I could have a chance if I didn't give up.

236
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,318
I've been looking for you all these years.

237
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:50,789
Long time no see.

238
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,791
How are you?

239
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:54,693
Let me go!

240
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,195
Answer my question first.

241
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:57,796
How are you?

242
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,067
Very good.

243
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:03,902
Let go!

244
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:04,536
No!

245
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,905
You're not a child anymore.

246
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,307
-Don't act like a kid.
-No.

247
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,080
Stop avoiding me.

248
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,416
I've looked for you for 12 years.

249
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:19,818
I didn't ask you to do that.

250
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,989
I chose to leave you 12 years ago.

251
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,125
I'll still do the same

252
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,260
12 years later.

253
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,264
Pei Shou Yi.

254
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,102
I'm not giving up.

255
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,210
Do you hear me?

256
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,614
I'm not giving up.

257
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,892
You guys are really slow.

258
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,794
It's been days, and the contract isn't ready yet.

259
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,697
I need to see
Wei Cheng Industrial's information today.

260
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,031
Get back to the office now.

261
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:06,465
(Today?)

262
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,566
Yes, today.

263
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:08,300
(It's the weekend!)

264
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,535
So what?

265
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,470
Can't you work extra hours after work?

266
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:13,138
I can pay for your overtime.

267
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:15,374
(What about my date?)

268
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,542
Get Zhe Yu there, too.

269
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,477
I'm gonna talk to him about the meeting next week.

270
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,145
Be in the office in 30 minutes.

271
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:20,746
(All right.)

272
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:21,914
OK. Bye.

273
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,454
Gao Shi De.

274
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,058
What are you doing here?

275
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,628
Hi.

276
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,634
I've got work to do.

277
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,471
I got some midnight snacks.

278
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,809
I don't have time right now.

279
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,864
I have to go to work.

280
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,366
You're obviously drunk.

281
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,537
I'm going to work.

282
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,047
I'm leaving.

283
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:33,385
Gao Shi De.

284
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:37,656
What the hell are you doing?

285
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,098
Take a break.

286
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,600
I'm gonna work late.

287
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,102
Let go!

288
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,374
What's wrong with you?

289
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,012
Enough with the drama!

290
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:35,781
Gao Shi De.

291
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,956
I said stop it!

292
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,038
I'm sorry.

293
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:04,977
I...

294
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,481
I shouldn't have gone to the US.

295
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,227
I'm sorry.

296
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,002
Can we start all over again?

297
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,807
Can we start over?

298
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,920
What happened in the US?

299
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,329
Gao Shi De.

300
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,442
What the hell is going on?

301
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:36,401
Why?

302
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,974
Why!

303
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,744
Are you messing with me, Gao Shi De?

304
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,082
You're messing with me.

305
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,431
What do you mean?

306
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,099
You don't know why,

307
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:43,402
do you?

308
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,108
Do you know you're blessed?

309
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,579
Do you know you've always been protected?

310
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,120
What are you doing?

311
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,854
I'm going to work.

312
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,792
I thought you wanted to know.

313
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,190
No feelings anymore?

314
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:56,875
Enough.

315
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:01,379
Gao Shi De.

316
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,714
What?

317
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:06,852
Gao Shi De!

318
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,750
Are you gonna tell me or not?

319
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,131
There are toiletries in the bathroom.

320
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,533
Clean yourself up and get out of here.

321
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,014
I...

322
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,389
Last night, we...

323
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:34,726
Did we...

324
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,065
Don't you remember what happened last night?

325
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,237
Shu Yi!

326
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:48,740
Daddy's home.

327
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,241
I hurried back.

328
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,343
Dad.

329
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,717
Gao Shi De!

330
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,453
What are you doing here?

331
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:04,289
You broke your promise!

332
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,458
What did you do to my son?

333
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,795
Do you two know each other?

334
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,936
No...

335
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:21,873
What promise?

336
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,230
(Next Episode)

337
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,966
(Do you think
you can solve all the problems alone?)

338
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:48,767
Objection.

339
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,136
(Not everything can be undone.)

340
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,738
You are

341
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:54,906
really cute.

342
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,576
Come on.

343
00:32:58,576 --> 00:32:59,411
Are you done?

344
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:00,345
Gao Shi De.

345
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,479
How do you know him?

346
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,347
If it were him,

347
