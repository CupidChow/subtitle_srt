1
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:15,000
(Gao Shi De, you've been really busy.)

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,867
(You never respond to me)

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,500
(immediately after you get my messages.)

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,773
(You don't cherish what you've got, do you?)

5
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,100
(Seriously,)

6
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,540
(Gao Shi De.)

7
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,410
(I kind of miss you.)

8
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,710
(It's been a year and you're still not back.)

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,410
(What's wrong with you?)

10
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,390
(You are so cruel.)

11
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,690
(I haven't received a single message from you
for a whole week.)

12
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,260
(Are you angry because
I read your messages and didn't reply?)

13
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,460
(You can be busy.)

14
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,200
(Why can't I be too busy to reply to your messages?)

15
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,030
(Anyway, I'm going abroad
next week to help my dad with his business.)

16
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,670
(Don't you think about me)

17
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,940
(because I will turn off my phone
and won't reply to you.)

18
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,950
(Hi.)

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,820
Hi, baby!

20
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,820
Do you want some cake?

21
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,960
Sure.

22
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:37,930
Try it.

23
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,460
Is it good?

24
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,170
Try it.

25
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,120
(From now on,)

26
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,320
(we don't have to see each other again.)

27
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,250
(When we meet again, we'll be strangers.)

28
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,890
(When we were young, we were emulous
and had too high self-esteem.)

29
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,460
(We were not mature enough,)

30
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,830
(even the temporary parting)

31
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,458
(would lead to misunderstandings.)

32
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,910
(It can easily make us feel unease.)

33
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:30,233
(Abruti.)

34
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,035
(I'll leave this name to you, dumb ass!)

35
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:35,238
(I'm fine)

36
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:37,407
(without you.)

37
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:42,646
(Profile 1: I'm fine without you, ABRUTI.)

38
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:52,322
(You asked me to have eyes for you only.)

39
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,959
(Now it's my turn to fight back.)

40
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:04,534
(Hua Cing Technology)

41
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,890
(Xiao Lu: Will there be layoffs
after the acquisition?)

42
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,360
(Da Lin: Jobs are hard to find these days)

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,090
(because of the economic downturn.)

44
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,090
(Shan Zhi: Come on,
someone volunteers to quit now.)

45
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,514
(Do us a favor, OK?)

46
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:20,500
(Yi Mian: Gosh. Ask the Chief Technical Officer.)

47
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,670
(Yi Mian: Chief Technical Officer.)

48
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,040
(Please reply.)

49
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,260
We'll have a meeting.

50
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,690
Those who haven't turned in their work
shall be fired!

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,070
Chief Technical Officer.

52
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,010
We are worried about losing jobs
after the acquisition.

53
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,080
Yeah!

54
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,550
Right!

55
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,810
The CEO just parachuted
from the United States last week

56
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,920
to handle the merger and acquisition
on behalf of the chairman.

57
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,850
Who knows how many people he'll fire?

58
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,350
Not even one!

59
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,590
When we signed the acquisition contract,

60
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,460
we made a deal with Cheng Yi Group

61
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,830
that no one would be fired
to protect the employees' rights.

62
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,130
Really?

63
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,600
All right!

64
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,770
Relax

65
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,800
and have some cakes.

66
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,300
Get back to work after the break.

67
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,610
Here.

68
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,370
Awesome.

69
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,440
Everybody, enjoy.

70
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:48,750
Excuse me.

71
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,620
Who are you?

72
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,690
We're from the Cheng Yi Group.

73
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,720
I'm fine.

74
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,190
-Shu Yi.
-I'm fine.

75
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,460
Please.

76
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,700

What the hell do you want?

88
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,830
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,770
Sorry?

90
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,340
For what?

91
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,910
For making you wait for so long.

92
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,810
Who's waiting for you?

93
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,580
Don't you flatter yourself!

94
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,080
I really didn't expect to see you here.

95
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,320
How fast!

96
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,550
Only after five years.

97
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,890
Shu Yi.

98
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,260
Call me Vice President Zhou, please!

99
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,300
I'm here on behalf of Cheng Yi Group

100
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,070
to handle the M&A of Hua Cing Technology.

101
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,300
Please hand over the information we requested

102
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,270
for the transition.

103
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,940
I have my reasons.

104
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,340
You and I...

105
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,480
What?

106
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,390
Don't say anything about old time's sake.

107
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,220
It's all about business.

108
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,290
And

109
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,830
tell your HR

110
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,460
to collect the employee evaluations
for the last three years.

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,030
I'll see who needs to be fired.

112
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,840
It's written in the contract

113
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,520
that you will protect employees' rights.

114
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,850
But there are conditions.

115
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,350
Personnel changes can be made properly

116
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,220
for the development of the company.

117
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:36,750
What's the matter?

118
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,180
What are you looking at?

119
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,520
Don't take your anger on Gao Shi De

120
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,690
out on someone else.

121
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,930
I didn't.

122
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,060
Do you know him?

123
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,060
Who?

124
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,440
You can't do that!

125
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,080
Half of you.

126
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,650
I'll fire half of you.

127
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,520
And you're on the top of the list.

128
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,990
Bing Wei.

129
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,820
Get the car ready.

130
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,730
OK.

131
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,430
I didn't expect Gao Shi De to be the CEO
of Hua Cing Technology.

132
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,660
Are you okay

133
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,130
seeing this bastard again?

134
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,370
I should ask you the same question.

135
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,040
I'm okay.

136
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,840
I was refused by him.

137
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,340
I'm not like someone

138
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,110
who got him

139
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,340
but was disqualified later.

140
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,080
I'm fine!

141
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,150
I couldn't be better.

142
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,050
Really?

143
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,480
If so, you wouldn't tell
in front of everyone

144
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,980
that you would fire half of them.

145
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,790
Those senior guys at the Head Office

146
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,890
are waiting to see how you'll handle the case.

147
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,490
Don't get emotional

148
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,660
or the shareholders won't approve of you.

149
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,890
Then you won't be able to
take your father's position.

150
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,760
I know what I'm doing.

151
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,470
It better be.

152
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,490
He said

153
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,490
he wanted to fire the employees because of you, right?

154
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,390
I won't let it happen.

155
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,830
You two have a grudge.

156
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,700
You have a grudge!

157
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,870
It's personal.

158
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,570
But it's affecting our company.

159
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,040
Your mother sent you back here,

160
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,580
but it doesn't mean you can do whatever you want.

161
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,020
Mama's boy.

162
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,590
Yu Zhen Xuan.

163
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,800
I don't care what you think of me.

164
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,560
But what I do know

165
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,570
is that I developed Project Alpha

166
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,540
and I'm also in charge of the acquisition.

167
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,540
Unfortunately,

168
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,340
this company

169
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,770
belongs to my family.

170
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,440
Oh.

171
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,150
Well, then stop him from downsizing.

172
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,950
I didn't know you care about
the welfare of your employees so much.

173
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
I didn't know

174
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,930
that you know me so well.

175
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,340
Thank you.

176
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,640
It'd be good if someone understands
that cocky Vice President.

177
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,780
Anyway, he'll fire you first.

178
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,600
Shu Yi.

179
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,930
What are you doing here?

180
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,930
Give me ten minutes!

181
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,680
Let's talk.

182
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,510
I've got nothing to say to you except business.

183
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,610
Get out!

184
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,150
So angry?

185
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,790
Did you skip the meal again?

186
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,020
It's none of your business.

187
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,330
What are you doing?

188
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,830
What are you doing in the kitchen?

189
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,100
What now?

190
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,470
Don't touch the fridge!

191
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,550
What do you want from me?

192
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:36,810
What now?

193
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,810
Why don't you say anrthing?

194
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,220
Answer me!

195
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,990
Fried rice,

196
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,820
OK?

197
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,860
We'll talk when you feel better after the meal.

198
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,970
A few chilies.

199
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,640
No, you have a stomach problem.

200
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,140
Just a few.

201
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,380
I said no.

202
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,550
Come on!

203
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,580
Alright, be good.

204
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,880
Why don't you go sit down and wait?

205
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,920
No carrots.

206
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,790
Carrots are good for your eyes.

207
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,890
I don't like it.

208
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,560
Come on, don't be picky.

209
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,060
No chilies, no carrots.

210
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,840
Oops.

211
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,640
I'm not gonna eat it.

212
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,540
Don't act like that.

213
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,080
You need to finish whatever I cook.

214
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,450
Then...

215
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,190
I'll cook for you after you

216
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,620
come back from the US.

217
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,690
Will that be edible?

218
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,630
You have to eat it.

219
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,460
What will you cook then?

220
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,170
Fried rice without carrots.

221
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,140
With all these in it?

222
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,270
Zhou Shu Yi, you gotta be kidding me.

223
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,780
Dinner's ready.

224
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,780
Have some soup first, it's good for your stomach.

225
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,450
Don't take my girlfriend's job.

226
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Girlfriend?

227
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,490
I started dating Li Jia Jing

228
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,490
not long after you left.

229
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,490
The girl Yu Xin introduced to me.

230
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,830
Are you kidding?

231
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,200
Kidding?

232
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,070
Girls are surely better.

233
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,340
They're soft and comfy.

234
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,150
Even the kisses are like...

235
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:30,820
That's enough!

236
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,820
You can be mad at me.

237
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,390
But you don't have to do it this way.

238
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,590
I know I owe you.

239
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,830
I made you wait for five years.

240
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,200
Five years?

241
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,370
What makes you think
that I waited for you?

242
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,500
Things are going really well with her.

243
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,170
I'm gonna introduce her to my dad.

244
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,110
Zhou Shu Yi.

245
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,410
Who do you think you are?

246
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,840
I ain't no bitch.

247
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,350
I won't waste five years on a bastard!

248
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,850
It seems like you and your girlfriend

249
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,590
aren't close.

250
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,790
You forgot her last name is He, not Li.

251
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,400
I'm done with you.

252
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,040
Then I'll go after you again.

253
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,240
I'm not giving up,

254
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,570
no matter how angry you are at me.

255
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,910
Angry?

256
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,450
I'm not.

257
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,950
There's only hatred.

258
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,920
Get out!

259
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,590
Or I'll call the police

260
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,090
and sue you for trespassing.

261
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,340
(I'm to blame.)

262
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,710
(Not the food.)

263
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,510
(At least have some.)

264
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,780
(Take care of yourself, so you can hate me.)

265
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,950
(I'll see you at work tomorrow.)

266
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,790
I've received the files from HR
and the Accounting Department.

267
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,690
What about R&D?

268
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,520
I've turned in all the data of the developed ones.

269
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,130
I want all the data,

270
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,630
including the ones under development.

271
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,530
(Alpha)
Where's your common sense?

272
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,200
I'm not turning it in until it's done.

273
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,440
That's how I do things.

274
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,340
I want up-to-date progress reports.

275
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,510
That's how I do things.

276
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,710
Cocky.

277
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,710
Yu Zhen Xuan.

278
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,680
As the Chief Technical Officer,

279
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,850
it's your responsibility.

280
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,490
Send it to me tomorrow.

281
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,560
You have to do it our way.

282
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,360
Clear?

283
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,670
Bing Wei, go on.

284
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,310
According to the information we get,
it looks like...

285
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,710
What do you dislike

286
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,580
about the company?

287
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,980
No.

288
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,180
You may leave.

289
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,550
Thank you.

290
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,850
Bing Wei.

291
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,820
Get me some water.

292
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,330
It's warm.

293
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,500
Bing Wei...

294
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:37,950
Shu Yi.

295
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,860
The chairman wants to see
Project Alpha's progress.

296
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,590
You should explain to the staff

297
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,290
why you would fire them...

298
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,560
Enough.

299
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,230
We're outsiders to them.

300
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,970
Do you have any problems with that?

301
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,900
Mind your shoelaces.

302
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,740
None of your business.

303
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,780
Oh, my!

304
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,610
Oh my God, the CEO is now an assistant!

305
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,780
Only boys do that for their girlfriends.

306
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,650
Yeah.

307
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,220
There.

308
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,320
Shu Yi.

309
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,560
He wasn't there when Shu Yi needed him.

310
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,160
What the hell does he want?

311
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,630
Do you think he'll do bad things to Shu Yi?

312
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,270
I don't think so.

313
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,810
I can help you with the shoelaces, too.

314
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,680
Good.

315
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,310
There aren't shoelaces of the shoes I'm wearing today.

316
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,080
Well, wear the shoes with shoelaces then.

317
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,110
I'll do it for you tomorrow.

318
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:39,850
I just wanted to...

319
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,090
Are you trying to embarrass me
in front of the employees?

320
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,760
I told you I'd go after you again.

321
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,590
I'm trying.

322
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,670
What can I do to get you back to me?

323
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,670
Just tell me. Whatever it is.

324
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,970
Want me back?

325
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,470
All right.

326
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,510
Let's do it.

327
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,190
You said whatever it takes.

328
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,590
Then let's do it.

329
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,870
Dare not?

330
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,450
OK.

331
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,070
As long as you can understand

332
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,900
that I'm serious,

333
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,310
I can do anything for you.

334
00:26:08,176 --> 00:26:10,500
(Next Episode)
(Don't expect you could make it a real thing)

335
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
(and go back to the old days.)

336
00:26:11,753 --> 00:26:14,156
(I'm gonna dump him
just when he thinks we are back together again.)

337
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:16,558
(I want him to know how it feels to be betrayed.)

338
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,161
I find you at last.

339
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
