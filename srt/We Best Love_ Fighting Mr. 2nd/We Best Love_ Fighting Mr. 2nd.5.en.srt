Hey!

Don't run!

3
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:15,713
Money theft!

00:00:16,713 --> 00:00:17,648
I told you not to run!

6
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:18,448
Don't run!

7
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,425
Hey!

8
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:37,825
Have you seen a kid in uniform?

9
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:15,130
Go away!

10
00:01:26,408 --> 00:01:26,875
What are you doing?

11
00:01:36,952 --> 00:01:38,287
You must be in a lot of pain.

12
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,460
From the second he picked me up,

13
00:01:46,328 --> 00:01:48,563

32
00:03:36,338 --> 00:03:38,073
What are you looking at, boss?

33
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:41,577
Nothing.

34
00:03:42,978 --> 00:03:43,478
Nothing?

35
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:46,315
Okay, I understand.

36
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:49,450
I've been asked to go to the police station.

37
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,652
I'm gonna take care of this.

38
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:58,493
Do you think Yu Zhen Xuan stole it?

39
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:01,197
No.

40
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:04,933
With his abilities,

41
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:07,135
he won't get caught.

42
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:11,873
Multiple IP addresses were traced back to him.

43
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:13,775
It's just so...

44
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:15,377
Carry coals to Newcastle.

45
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:16,745
Take off the pants before farting.

46
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,182
Thank you for

47
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:23,552
the specific and graphic description.

48
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:25,253
What do you think?

49
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:30,258
Although...

50
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:32,593
hacking into our system

51
00:04:33,262 --> 00:04:34,663
can be done remotely,

52
00:04:36,063 --> 00:04:38,033
our security protocols

53
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:40,602
show no sign of being attacked by any virus.

54
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:45,073
The only possibility is

55
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,110
that someone set a back door

56
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,745
on purpose when writing Alpha

57
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:52,915
and stole it that way.

58
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:56,652
So you're saying

59
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:58,653
the thief is in our...

60
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:52,473
Mr. Liu.

61
00:05:53,008 --> 00:05:55,543
Yu Zhen Xuan is just a suspect for now.

62
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:56,612
You're free to go.

63
00:05:57,312 --> 00:05:59,982
But cybercrime

64
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:01,217
is quite complicated.

65
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,952
We're gonna need your further cooperation.

66
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:05,153
No problem.

67
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,855
Here are some documents.

68
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:08,157
I need you to sign these.

69
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:10,025
What's he doing?

70
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:11,827
Sir...

71
00:06:11,827 --> 00:06:12,827
Yu Zhen Xuan.

72
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:13,995
You're free to go.

73
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:15,230
(Criminals custody area)

74
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,665
(Criminals custody area)
This is a police station, not a restaurant!

75
00:06:17,232 --> 00:06:18,100
Mr. Yu.

76
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:19,902
Can you hear me?

77
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:22,203
Please don't trouble us.

78
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:23,705
I'm sorry. I'll take care of it.

79
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:25,240
OK. Thank you.

80
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:31,178
What do you want?

81
00:06:39,153 --> 00:06:40,755
How much longer do you want to stay here?

82
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:43,292
I know everyone is upset

83
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:45,693
as Alpha has been stolen.

84
00:06:47,195 --> 00:06:49,765
But I'll never say dumb things

85
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:51,433
like "What can't defeat us makes us stronger."

86
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:52,500
You just did.

87
00:06:56,338 --> 00:06:58,307
We're not desperate yet.

88
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:00,642
The good news is

89
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:01,910
the stolen part

90
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,345
is just a basic system.

91
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:07,682
The real key core code...

92
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:10,585
is here.

93
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:15,523
I know it's hard to recover all the codes.

94
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:18,593
But I believe

95
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,595
everyone in this room

96
00:07:20,595 --> 00:07:22,197
is good enough.

97
00:07:22,197 --> 00:07:25,267
We can absolutely make it by the due day

98
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:26,668
and go through this ordeal.

99
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,338
We have worked so hard on it

100
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:31,673
and it just got stolen.

101
00:07:31,673 --> 00:07:33,208
I can't let it go like that.

102
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:35,310
Sir,

103
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,912
I'll do whatever you say.

104
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:38,313
Yeah.

105
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,982
Right.

106
00:07:40,748 --> 00:07:41,850
We'll all follow your orders.

107
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:45,253
I'd like to thank you all

108
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:46,622
on behalf of the company.

109
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:49,658
I'll pay double for the overtime.

110
00:07:52,427 --> 00:07:54,295
Additional bonus for

111
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:55,330
each team's progress.

112
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:01,803
You heard him?

113
00:08:01,803 --> 00:08:02,803
There's a bonus!

114
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:04,505
So we're gonna have to work harder

115
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:05,607
to make up for it.

116
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,542
Lin, Shan Zhi, Lu.

117
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:09,210
Get your team reassigned.

118
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,413
We're already a little behind.

119
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:20,655
OK, go tell Joanne.

120
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:21,122
Thank you.

121
00:08:26,562 --> 00:08:27,095
Lu.

122
00:08:27,328 --> 00:08:28,797
Give me the compatibility file.

123
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,402
Yu Chen, did Lin tell you?

124
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:39,173
The numbers are different.

125
00:08:39,975 --> 00:08:40,808
I'll check on it.

126
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:43,712
Okay.

127
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,682
That's what we have done so far for Alpha's repairs.

128
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:50,218
Even though we've been working overtime

129
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:51,620
and we're ahead of schedule,

130
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,255
we can't slack.

131
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:55,323
OK, let's

132
00:08:55,323 --> 00:08:56,458
summarize the situation now

133
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,725
for tomorrow's transition.

134
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,295
Yi Mian's team should be all right, right?

135
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:01,563
Yes, it's fine.

136
00:09:01,997 --> 00:09:03,665
Then the problem is in Lin's group.

137
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,368
Did you write down the problems today?

138
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:07,903
Yeah.

139
00:09:07,903 --> 00:09:08,637
All of them.

140
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:09,838
Here.

141
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:11,005
Let me see.

142
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,242
Late-night snacks!

143
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,810
Thank you.

144
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,612
Eat something first.

145
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:18,180
Bing Wei, what takes you so long?

146
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,313
I almost fell asleep, waiting for you.

147
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:20,182
Remember

148
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:21,717
to tell Shan Zhi tomorrow.

149
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:22,317
Yeah, sure.

150
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:22,952
Those thing we talked about.

151
00:09:23,952 --> 00:09:25,320
This one is for Shu Yi.

152
00:09:26,188 --> 00:09:29,257
Yi Mian, you are always the first
when there is food.

153
00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:30,358
Hungry.

154
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:32,193
Did you write everything down?

155
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:34,128
Do you want some?

156
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:36,163
You have it first.

157
00:09:36,698 --> 00:09:38,233
Let's eat together.

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,902
One minute.

159
00:09:41,937 --> 00:09:43,138
Or should I feed you?

160
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:47,008
Go hide.

161
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,945
Come on, you idiot.

162
00:10:56,878 --> 00:10:59,480
I've managed to explain to the head office.

163
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:02,217
But some directors are still
keeping an eye on Hua Cing.

164
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:05,253
Make some trouble
for the company they're in charge of

165
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:06,922
to distract them.

166
00:11:16,998 --> 00:11:17,498
What?

167
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:18,167
Bing Wei.

168
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Come help me.

169
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:23,105
But I don't know anything about finance.

170
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:24,372
What can I do to help?

171
00:11:31,813 --> 00:11:32,580
Okay.

172
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,482
Let's call it a day.

173
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:34,683
Go home and have some rest.

174
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,418
It's okay. I'm fine.

175
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:38,787
I'm gonna hang in there for a bit.

176
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:40,055
You guys have worked at it for days.

177
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:41,088
Get some rest.

178
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:42,757
This is the part I'm in charge of.

179
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:45,727
All right, well, then, go get them yourself.

180
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:47,495
Go home now.

181
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:48,497
Go.

182
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:40,982
What are you doing back here?

183
00:12:41,383 --> 00:12:42,283
To be your accompany.

184
00:12:45,787 --> 00:12:46,955
How was dinner?

185
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:52,827
Full of food and tricks.

186
00:12:56,932 --> 00:12:58,567
Lost my appetite at the sight of them.

187
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,705
The point of a meal

188
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:05,640
is not the food

189
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:12,347
but the person you're with.

190
00:13:14,482 --> 00:13:16,352
This isn't the last time.

191
00:13:17,552 --> 00:13:19,655
There will be more banquets like this

192
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:21,723
until next year's reelection of board supervisor.

193
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,695
I can help you prepare midnight snacks.

194
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,638
I have to be the chairman of Cheng Yi Group!

195
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:41,310
Not just for my dad,

196
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,912
but also for myself.

197
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:47,382
I know.

198
00:13:48,517 --> 00:13:50,785
You've always wanted to be number one

199
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,555
just to prove you can take over the company.

200
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:55,623
But you ruined it.

201
00:13:57,725 --> 00:13:59,795
But you'll have me as your man.

202
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:02,530
After we transfer everything...

203
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,065
I don't want to hold you up.

204
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,605
You can do whatever you want.

205
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:15,310
Whatever I want?

206
00:14:19,615 --> 00:14:21,148
All I want is to

207
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:24,418
be there for you.

208
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:27,957
No matter how high your position will be,

209
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,225
I'll be there by your side.

210
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,265
I'm fine with that.

211
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,233
But do you have to be this close?

212
00:14:41,002 --> 00:14:42,370
You turned yourself around.

213
00:14:44,807 --> 00:14:45,640
Did I?

214
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:00,922
It's okay.

215
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:07,997
You're putting too much pressure on yourself.

216
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:11,533
You know?

217
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,138
I am here.

218
00:15:18,273 --> 00:15:18,740
OK.

219
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,868
Boss.

220
00:15:47,835 --> 00:15:48,770
We've got so much food here.

221
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,105
Why are you having instant noodles?

222
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,707
I like it.

223
00:16:01,783 --> 00:16:03,752
Boss, that Mr. Yu

224
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:05,087
hasn't come here in days.

225
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:06,053
Yeah.

226
00:16:06,053 --> 00:16:07,355
Is he busy?

227
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:09,390
Why do you care?

228
00:16:11,393 --> 00:16:12,093
Well...

229
00:16:12,093 --> 00:16:13,862
It would be nice to have extra help.

230
00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:15,797
Yeah, and he's so hardworking.

231
00:16:15,797 --> 00:16:17,298
He shares the workload whenever he's here.

232
00:16:23,738 --> 00:16:24,472
Boss.

233
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:26,875
Clean the table when you're done.

234
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:27,910
Make sure you turn off the lights.

235
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:29,510
I'm full. I'll leave it to you.

236
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,443
Welcome home.

237
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:03,378
Shu Yi, you're back.

238
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:08,750
Who stole Alpha?

239
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:17,585
Be careful.

240
00:19:47,308 --> 00:19:48,443
I'm sorry.

241
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:51,213
I broke our agreement

242
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:53,115
and met Shu Yi earlier.

243
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:05,960
These are my corporate records
in the United States.

244
00:20:06,262 --> 00:20:06,962
Real estates.

245
00:20:08,263 --> 00:20:09,097
Personal property.

246
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:11,900
Bank statements.

247
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:14,937
And will.

248
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:18,540
In addition to what's for the legal obligation,

249
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:20,542
the rest will be Shu Yi's.

250
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,815
I know

251
00:20:27,082 --> 00:20:29,017
these are not up to your standards.

252
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:30,918
But they are all I've got.

253
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:35,157
Are those the betrothal presents?

254
00:20:36,992 --> 00:20:37,792
It's fine.

255
00:20:38,627 --> 00:20:40,562
You may consider this my dowry.

256
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:46,635
There's no way you're getting into my family.

257
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,005
It's all right.

258
00:20:51,072 --> 00:20:53,042
I can let Shu Yi get into mine.

259
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:55,777
Both my mom and my step dad

260
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,112
welcome him.

261
00:21:06,153 --> 00:21:07,255
Brat!

262
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,328
Five years ago, I gave in

263
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:15,097
because I didn't want to put Shu Yi in a dilemma.

264
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,933
But I didn't expect it hurt him even more.

265
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,202
This time,

266
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:22,637
I'll face you together with Shu Yi.

267
00:21:25,373 --> 00:21:26,040
You think you can do that?

268
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,742
Yes.

269
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:28,910
Actually...

270
00:21:29,678 --> 00:21:30,578
Uncle.

271
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:32,047
I'm more concerned about you right now

272
00:21:33,748 --> 00:21:35,483
because that means

273
00:21:35,883 --> 00:21:37,252
you'll be on his opposite side.

274
00:21:38,153 --> 00:21:39,420
Shu Yi may,

275
00:21:40,055 --> 00:21:41,257
possibly,

276
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,825
probably

277
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:46,060
hate you.

278
00:21:50,032 --> 00:21:51,400
Are you threatening me?

279
00:21:53,635 --> 00:21:54,603
No.

280
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:56,738
I'm just telling the truth.

281
00:22:00,508 --> 00:22:02,843
You played weak before.

282
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:03,478
Oh.

283
00:22:04,112 --> 00:22:05,313
I didn't.

284
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:07,782
I haven't

285
00:22:07,782 --> 00:22:08,817
asked you about the emails yet.

286
00:22:09,283 --> 00:22:11,587
But if it can make Shu Yi happy,

287
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:14,022
I wouldn't mind playing weak a few more times.

288
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,928
You ungrateful creature!

289
00:22:19,928 --> 00:22:21,062
So you're

290
00:22:22,263 --> 00:22:23,432
admitting it?

291
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:30,838
Dad.

292
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:35,210
Don't call me that!

293
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,612
I'm not admitting anything.

294
00:22:37,045 --> 00:22:38,847
Absolutely not!

295
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,553
I know what happened to Hua Cing Technology.

296
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,588
If it isn't handled properly,

297
00:22:47,188 --> 00:22:50,892
you won't stand any chance with Shu Yi.

298
00:22:54,095 --> 00:22:54,763
Thank you.

299
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,765
I won't let you down.

300
00:23:04,707 --> 00:23:05,973
Shu Yi likes this.

301
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:24,058
I've finished adjusting the table. It's fine.

302
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:24,960
Great.

303
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,960
Where's Lin?

304
00:23:26,262 --> 00:23:27,228
All done.

305
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:28,197
Lu.

306
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:29,263
No problem.

307
00:23:29,263 --> 00:23:30,065
Yi Mian.

308
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:31,300
That's about it. No problem.

309
00:23:33,402 --> 00:23:36,170
I want to thank you all for your support.

310
00:23:36,672 --> 00:23:38,273
We've finally finished Alpha in time,

311
00:23:39,073 --> 00:23:40,775
including the most difficult part,
program integration.

312
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,912
We are the best!

313
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:51,287
The bonus will be paid next month

314
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:53,788
along with your salary.

315
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,525
Thank you for saving Hua Cing Technology.

316
00:24:00,728 --> 00:24:01,897
Cool.

317
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:06,100
Bonus!

318
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:08,037
To celebrate,

319
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:08,903
I'll treat you to lunch!

320
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:10,438
Really?

321
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,940
Go.

322
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,208
Great!

323
00:24:56,318 --> 00:24:57,485
Is it downloaded?

324
00:25:07,095 --> 00:25:08,163
Why are you doing this?

325
00:25:10,198 --> 00:25:11,300
I take you as one of us.

326
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,235
Is it worth it?

327
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:22,577
I really didn't think it would be Lin.

328
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:26,180
Well.

329
00:25:26,915 --> 00:25:28,550
I knew it was her.

330
00:25:29,483 --> 00:25:30,518
Why didn't you tell us then?

331
00:25:30,885 --> 00:25:31,887
Yeah.

332
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:37,125
CEO.

333
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,893
Sorry.

334
00:25:40,062 --> 00:25:41,963
I'm sorry. We didn't know it.

335
00:25:42,363 --> 00:25:43,932
Sorry, it is our fault.

336
00:25:46,502 --> 00:25:48,537
I thought you said no downsizing.

337
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:50,805
Why did she do that?

338
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,942
Maybe somebody paid good money.

339
00:25:54,943 --> 00:25:57,078
Money makes the mare go.

340
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,980
Right.

341
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,185
Wai Wei hasn't brought Yu Zhen Xuan back yet?

342
00:26:05,353 --> 00:26:06,655
Just got off the phone with him.

343
00:26:06,655 --> 00:26:09,490
He said Yu Zhen Xuan didn't want to leave.

344
00:26:12,627 --> 00:26:14,295
Looks like we're gonna have to
call in reinforcements.

345
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:44,325
Yu Zhen Xuan.

346
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,228
The real culprit has been found

347
00:26:46,228 --> 00:26:47,428
yet you're still handcuffing yourself.

348
00:26:47,428 --> 00:26:48,997
It's considered interference
with public function.

349
00:26:48,997 --> 00:26:50,132
Sue me then.

350
00:26:53,168 --> 00:26:54,368
You can't keep doing this.

351
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,705
Are you listening?

352
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,575
Hello.

353
00:26:59,575 --> 00:27:00,342
May I help you?

354
00:27:00,342 --> 00:27:01,410
I'm looking for Yu Zhen Xuan.

355
00:27:01,977 --> 00:27:02,743
Mr. Liu.

356
00:27:02,743 --> 00:27:03,745
(Criminals custody area)
Someone is here for you.

357
00:27:03,745 --> 00:27:07,509
(Criminals custody area)

358
00:27:07,782 --> 00:27:08,683
Please.

359
00:27:08,683 --> 00:27:10,018
Talk some sense into him.

360
00:27:10,018 --> 00:27:11,220
The police station is not a restaurant.

361
00:27:11,453 --> 00:27:13,088
You can't stay as long as you want.

362
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:14,222
I understand.

363
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:14,723
Sorry.

364
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:15,790
Thank you.

365
00:27:34,243 --> 00:27:35,243
(Next episode)

366
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:36,545
My heart is empty.

367
00:27:36,545 --> 00:27:38,113
There's nothing in it.

368
00:27:38,113 --> 00:27:39,882
And nothing will be in there.

369
00:27:41,883 --> 00:27:43,052
Pei Shou Yi.

370
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:44,687
Not even a little bit?

371
00:27:47,555 --> 00:27:48,590
Are you happy now?
