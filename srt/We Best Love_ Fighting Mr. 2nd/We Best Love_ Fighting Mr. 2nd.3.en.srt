1
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,254
Hello.

2
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,555
You finally answered my call.

3
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,556
I'll tell you what.

4
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:24,891
I...

5
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,235
Shu Yi has decided to break up with you.

6
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,237
Don't come looking for him again.

7
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,347
Impossible.

8
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,583
He wouldn't do that.

9
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,151
There must be some misunderstanding.

10
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:56,256
Let me see him.

11
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,724
Just once.

12
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,793
If he hadn't decided to break up,

13
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:02,729
why would he have given me his phone

14
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,531
and got a new phone number?

15
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,837
Give up.

16
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:13,606
That's the end of young people's love game.

17
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,342
There's still a long way to go.

18
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,945
Go to find a girl and live a normal life.

19
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,448
You can disagree.

20
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,785
But you have no right

21
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,288
to judge
whether our relationship is normal or not.

22
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,691
I just like him.

23
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,126
I don't care if he's a boy or girl.

24
00:01:34,193 --> 00:01:36,629
You dare to talk to me like that?

25
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,134
I like Shu Yi.

26
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,602
It's not a game.

27
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,339
I've wanted to stay with him forever

28
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,174
since we got together.

29
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,514
He can leave me.

30
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:55,882
But I won't give up.

31
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,024
Shu Yi is going to take over my company.

32
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,292
Have you considered

33
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,527
how he's going to face his relatives
who are also the shareholders

34
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,129
if he's with you?

35
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:12,231
How can he manage them?

36
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,205
You know how shallow

37
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,640
your "forever" means now?

38
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,010
Young man.

39
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:27,814
I

40
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,549
started from scratch

41
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,017
and got everything.

42
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:35,355
I've seen everything.

43
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,025
Look.

44
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,664
This is my collection.

45
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,566
You wouldn't understand

46
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:50,636
its meaning or price.

47
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:54,574
Simply put.

48
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,612
You and Shu Yi are

49
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:01,447
from different worlds.

50
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,721
How can I

51
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,757
get your approval?

52
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,297
Five years.

53
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,601
I'll give you five years.

54
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,070
In these five years,

55
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,505
don't contact Shu Yi

56
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,740
or anyone close to him.

57
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,977
Get a career and win my approval.

58
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,945
Then I'll stay out of your business.

59
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,482
If Shu Yi has a girlfriend

60
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,684
in these five years,

61
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,454
you have to give him up unconditionally.

62
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,123
And

63
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,625
Shu Yi can't know

64
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,061
about the deal.

65
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,330
Can you do it?

66
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,769
Uncle.

67
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,239
You're just trying to trap me.

68
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,745
Approval is subjective.

69
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,847
You just have to keep saying no,

70
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,649
and I'll never get it.

71
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,187
You aren't qualified to bargain with me.

72
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,622
I know.

73
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,092
So I have to accept it.

74
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,196
Because I know

75
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:25,164
Shu Yi looks up to you.

76
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:28,201
Without your approval,

77
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,136
he won't be happy.

78
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:36,542

This is...

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,241
how it was.

96
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,790
Shu Yi.

97
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,727
Why are you like this?

98
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,064
It's all your fault.

99
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,366
Go.

100
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,235
Or I'll beat you up.

101
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,202
Yeah.

102
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,471
If you don't go back, I'll beat you.

103
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:13,639
I mean, you.

104
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,744
Why would you say that?

105
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,112
I only want what's best for you.

106
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:21,814
Every time you said that,

107
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,616
it ended up hurting me a lot.

108
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,118
When I was ten,

109
00:06:26,118 --> 00:06:27,587
you took me skydiving.

110
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,455
I almost fell into a ravine.

111
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,389
When I was 11,

112
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,425
you told me to go scuba diving and learn to swim.

113
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,926
Luckily, I didn't drown.

114
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:34,794
When I was 12,

115
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,129
you said a man had to climb a mountain.

116
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,664
I almost died up there.

117
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:40,399
When I was 13,

118
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,301
you said I'd get taller if I played basketball.

119
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,603
And I broke my bones.

120
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,109
Do I need to say more?

121
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,715
It's all my fault.

Really.

123
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,319
Shu Yi.

124
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,755
What can I do

125
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,124
to calm you down?

126
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,259
You go back.

127
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,961
I'll be calm.

128
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,464
Really?

129
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,537
Then I'm going.

130
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,809
I'm going.

131
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,879
I'm really going.

132
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,516
Don't try to stop me.

133
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,289
Did you call me?

134
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,045
I'm going.

135
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,379
I'm really going.

136
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:03,215
I'm really leaving.

137
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,734
You go, too.

138
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,537
I don't want to see you right now.

139
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:26,505
Well, Shu Yi.

140
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:27,506
Listen.

141
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:30,076
Do you think I was just hanging out with you,

142
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,377
or we would stay together forever?

143
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,416
Of course, we'd be together forever.

144
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,984
If that's the case,

145
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:41,120
why did you make that deal with my dad?

146
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,029
You think you can solve
all the problems by yourself?

147
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,264
Or you think I'm not serious

148
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:53,799
and I won't stand by you

149
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,134
to face my dad together?

150
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,741
You wanted us to be together forever,

151
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,944
but you didn't believe in my "forever".

152
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:09,949
I'm sorry. Shu Yi.

153
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:10,549
Get out!

154
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,385
If Shu Yi doesn't talk to me anymore,

155
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,654
what should I do?

156
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,491
He might ignore you,

157
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,259
but you're still his father.

158
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,994
You two remain father and son.

159
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:29,962
Unlike me...

160
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:36,168
I didn't know you owned Hua Cing Technology.

161
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,109
I deceived you with the deal,

162
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:45,311
and separated you two.

163
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,079
In the end,

164
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,049
I made you two meet again.

165
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,151
You lied to me?

166
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:55,321
Can't I?

167
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,826
I was waiting for him to graduate,
get married, and give me grandchildren.

168
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,661
But after he graduated,

169
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:04,230
he came to me and told me

170
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,265
he liked a boy, you!

171
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,935
He threatened me and said

172
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:14,840
he'd leave me if I didn't accept it.

173
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,043
You think you can solve
all the problems by yourself?

174
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:20,946
Or you think I'm not serious

175
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,548
and I won't stand by you

176
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:23,916
to face my dad together?

177
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,084
No wonder.

178
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,926
It's not easy to be a dad.

179
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,598
I thought only married daughters
would leave the parents.

180
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,700
But sons are the same.

181
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,471
Why does he even care

182
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,207
about you, who went for blondes in the US?

183
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,143
Blondes?

184
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,284
Why do you think he didn't want you?

185
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,886
You heartless brat.

186
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,721
You went overseas and disappeared.

187
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:04,290
You didn't come back

188
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,759
or talked to him much.

189
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,629
He didn't hear anything from you
for almost six months.

190
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,634
Oh, my poor son.

191
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,304
After he finished
the Substitute Military Service,

192
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,973
he asked for leave to see you
before entering the company.

193
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:23,309
And then he saw

194
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,644
that you were enjoying yourself with a blonde.

195
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,646
He cried so much.

196
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:28,747
Wait a minute. He...

197
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:31,016
Did he go to the US to see me?

198
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,452
What was wrong with my son?

199
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,159
Why did you betray him?

200
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,694
I didn't betray him!

201
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:47,666
Uncle.

202
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,938
Do you approve now or not?

203
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,340
No!

204
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,442
I disapprove!

205
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,146
Only Shu Yi can dump you.

206
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,716
You can't dump him!

207
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,652
It's all your fault.

208
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,556
Your fault!

209
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:21,533
Yeah.

210
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,203
It's all my fault.

211
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,573
Uncle.

212
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,041
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,210
I won't give in again.

214
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:34,513
Excuse me.

215
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:39,718
What?

216
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:43,255
Hey, Gao Shi De!

217
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,391
Make it clear!

218
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,592
What do you mean?

219
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,828
(Why didn't you come to work overtime last night?)

220
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:53,032
(It was just me and Zhe Yu there
working on those contracts.)

221
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,867
(You ruined our date.)

222
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,535
(You'd better have a good explanation.)

223
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,738
I didn't go because I had a stomachache.

224
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,206
Send over the contracts.

225
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,008
(Exaggeration.)

226
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,710
(I sent them. Take a look.)

227
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:06,578
I was just about to check.

228
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,614
(There are a few additional provisions.)

229
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:09,782
(Check them out.)

230
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,284
I'll get back to you.

231
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,553
(Zhe Yu says he needs Monday off
as he didn't get enough sleep.)

232
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,455
Tell him to stop whining.

233
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:18,690
I'll pay you double for your overtime.

234
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,695
To compensate you for your date.

235
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,464
Bye.

236
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,099
(You take care of yourself.)

237
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:27,699
(Bye.)

238
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:15,848
(Shu Yi.)

239
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,282
(I need to talk to you.)

240
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:18,050
Shut up.

241
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:20,986
(Call an ambulance for me.)

242
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,365
I'll take care of it.

243
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,471
Brother.

244
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,606
What is your friend doing here?

245
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,107
Looking for a job?

246
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,309
Ignore him.

247
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:45,811
Do your thing.

248
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:46,845
But there's no...

249
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:47,479
Nothing to do.

250
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:01,059
Troublesome.

251
00:17:58,777 --> 00:17:59,678
Give me the pills.

252
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:04,116
You're free to go.

253
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:09,154
I'll stay and take care of you.

254
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:10,622
Hello.

255
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,157
Bing Wei, listen.

256
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,158
That contract...

257
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:16,862
Give me my phone.

258
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,669
What are you doing, Gao Shi De?

259
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,003
Hey!

260
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:27,539
The patient has to rest.

261
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:35,180
Gao Shi De.

262
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,117
Take a break.

263
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,285
I'm going to cook something.

264
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,453
I don't need your help.

265
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,332
If I came back that year

266
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,968
and didn't meet with your dad,

267
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:58,737
but came straight to you,

268
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,973
would you go with me?

269
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,002
Would you?

270
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:40,912
You once said

271
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,049
that not everything could be undone.

272
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,950
I haven't been a doctor for years.

273
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,785
I can't give good advice.

274
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:21,453
(Right.)

275
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,792
I'm really curious about what you bought.

276
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,163
Chinese yam, lotus root and okra,

277
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,798
cabbage and eggs.

278
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,301
If I put them all together and make congee,

279
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,569
will it help with the stomachache?

280
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:41,473
But he

281
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,074
will kick me out when he's fine.

282
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,811
(I don't want to be here)

283
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,078
(only when he's sick.)

284
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,484
Display affection through the phone.

285
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:54,619
You're good, Gao Shi De.

286
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,192
You really

287
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,795
are cute.

288
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:04,996
Come by when you are free.

289
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:06,298
I will be nice to you.

290
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:08,533
Bye.

291
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,210
Can I help you?

292
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,048
Nothing.

293
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,220
Shu Yi.

294
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:05,557
Get up and eat something.

295
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:06,691
Take your medicine and go back to sleep.

296
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,735
Shu Yi, get up.

297
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,443
My page boy.

298
00:22:25,443 --> 00:22:27,045
Get up.

299
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,926
My page boy.

300
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,228
You're going to be late. Get up.

301
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,598
Today's professor is Yang Yu Teng.

302
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,300
He loves failing students.

303
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,103
Whatever.

304
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:54,573
I need more sleep.

305
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,242
So naughty.

306
00:22:59,077 --> 00:22:59,911
Come on, get up.

307
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,079
I got breakfast.

308
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:03,815
All right.

309
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,487
Get some more sleep.

310
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,324
It's okay to be late.

311
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:26,972
You want to go back to that time.

312
00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:29,007
Right?

313
00:23:59,537 --> 00:24:00,105
Here you go.

314
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,174
Brother.

315
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,277
Your friend is fighting our guests.

316
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,279
What to do?

317
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:10,982
Rick, call the cops.

318
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:11,783
Okay.

319
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,055
What did you just say?

320
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,290
I said the wine was really bad.

321
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,625
You don't have to drink it then.

322
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,860
Okay, don't drink. What do you want?

323
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,561
-Causing trouble here?
-What are you doing?

324
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:24,863
You want to cause trouble?

325
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,874
Come on!

326
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,344
Are you done?

327
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,580
Aren't you going to get lost?

328
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:43,882
Do you want to be beaten?

329
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:44,683
Wait and see!

330
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:55,994
Are you okay?

331
00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:56,895
Six, you go back first.

332
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:58,096
Okay.

333
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:01,700
There's nothing to see. Go back.

334
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,329
I didn't mean to fight.

335
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,632
They said bad things about you.

336
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,400
They said the liquor in this store...

337
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,802
That's their business.

338
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,138
Why do you care what they say?

339
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,607
You're in your 30s.

340
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:18,910
Don't think you're in high school.

341
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,081
No one can say anything bad about you.

342
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:31,422
When will you

343
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:33,925
get away from your attachment to me?

344
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:35,860
I...

345
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,929
It's not attachment.

346
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,031
It is.

347
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:41,833
Or else you wouldn't have often

348
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,968
come to me in the infirmary in high school.

349
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:50,008
I wish I didn't mind your business

350
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,678
when I met you.

351
00:27:01,986 --> 00:27:02,987
Gao Shi De.

352
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,891
How do you know him?

353
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:11,129
If it were him,

354
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,131
you wouldn't feel annoyed, right?

355
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,234
That's enough.

356
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:19,737
You like him.

357
00:27:57,408 --> 00:27:58,743
Because you like him,

358
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,012
no matter how hard I try,

359
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,714
you won't like me, right?

360
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,489
(Next episode)
What is your relationship with Pei Shou Yi?

361
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,758
Is Yu Zhen Xuan a little...

362
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:49,460
Attachment. Paranoia. Asperger syndrome.

363
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,562
Mildly depressed and prone to self-mutilation.

364
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:52,764
Which one do you want to know first?

365
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:53,798
I'm not sick!

366
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,167
Someone hacked the company computer
and stole Alpha.

367
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,730
Found it?

368
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,000
I'll give you one more chance.

369
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,440
The lucky one you mentioned.

370
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,574
Is it still me?
