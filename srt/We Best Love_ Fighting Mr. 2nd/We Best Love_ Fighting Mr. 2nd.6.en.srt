00:00:22,307 --> 00:00:23,075
Go away!

2
00:01:34,714 --> 00:01:35,447
Ouch!

3
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:36,582
Don't move.

4
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:41,587
Don't mind me.

5
00:01:44,457 --> 00:01:45,957
Then get out of my sight!

6
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,307
Your hand...

7
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:03,842
None of your business.

(I can't push him away, nor lie to myself anymore.)

(I should've stayed out of it.)

00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:34,840

How did you get here?

28
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,969
Shi De said

29
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:39,805
the real culprit had been found.

30
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,940
Why not leave?

31
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:43,309
I'm not leaving.

32
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:44,610
I'm gonna stay here.

33
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:47,145
Yu Zhen Xuan.

34
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:49,414
If you don't want me, leave me alone.

35
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,915
You're gonna leave or not?

36
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:53,752
No!

37
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:55,754
Seriously?

38
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:57,589
Guys, calm down.

39
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:58,690
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

40
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:04,497
Uncuff him, please.

41
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:04,897
(Criminals custody area)
OK.

42
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:17,675
Thank you.

43
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:24,750
What?

44
00:04:25,217 --> 00:04:25,950
No.

45
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:28,352
Hey!

46
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:30,355
Hey!

47
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:32,657
Let go!

48
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:37,529
Really?

49
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:39,965
OK.

50
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,667
Okay, I get it.

51
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:43,102
Yes.

52
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,572
Thanks a lot, Bing Wei.

53
00:04:48,307 --> 00:04:50,275
Okay, that's it.

54
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:51,910
OK. Bye-bye.

55
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:53,745
So?

56
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:54,814
Yu Zhen Xuan...

57
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:56,782
Shou Yi carried him away.

58
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:58,250
Good.

59
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,952
The two of them need to talk.

60
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:03,889
Pei Shou Yi's got a problem.

61
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:05,790
He has an affective disorder.

62
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,792
How can they talk?

63
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:07,525
No idea.

64
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:10,195
They both have problems.

65
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:12,799
But it's not like anyone else can help.

66
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,200
Let's

67
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:19,304
just do what we need to do now.

68
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:27,545
What the hell is this?

69
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,047
Rest.

70
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,885
Do you seriously mean this?

71
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:34,219
Yeah.

72
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,554
Can't I?

73
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:37,689
Get up.

74
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:39,224
No.

75
00:05:39,224 --> 00:05:40,492
I've been working late.

76
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:41,894
I lack sleep.

77
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:44,395
And I have to spend the night with someone.

78
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,765
I'm exhausted.

79
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:50,202
Go sleep in the room!

80
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:55,640
I fainted.

81
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:57,977
Little kid.

82
00:06:46,192 --> 00:06:47,192
I'm done.

83
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:50,162
Come here.

84
00:06:58,337 --> 00:06:58,837
Sit down.

85
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,614
Give me your left hand.

86
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,895
I told you in high school

87
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:27,900
that even if you died right in front of me,

88
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:30,469
I wouldn't feel anything.

89
00:07:36,242 --> 00:07:37,475
This isn't about you.

90
00:07:39,344 --> 00:07:40,079
It's me.

91
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:46,885
I have an affective disorder.

92
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:50,955
I don't react to anything

93
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:53,692
emotional.

94
00:07:56,262 --> 00:07:58,564
I can't connect with others emotionally.

95
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,000
Any kind of emotion or feeling

96
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:05,037
is just a name

97
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:06,872
for me.

98
00:08:08,974 --> 00:08:10,542
I'll never feel it.

99
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,310
You're lying.

100
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:14,547
I've seen you smile.

101
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,949
You and that mom's...

102
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,654
You smiled when you were talking to Gao Shi De.

103
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,560
I can react according to their

104
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:31,062
behaviors and words.

105
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,665
So my smile

106
00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:35,134
doesn't mean I'm happy.

107
00:08:36,302 --> 00:08:37,002
My anger

108
00:08:37,002 --> 00:08:38,404
doesn't mean I'm angry.

109
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:41,374
It's just

110
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:43,675
my social skill.

111
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,679
I don't get it.

112
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,819
You spent 12 years looking for me.

113
00:08:54,854 --> 00:08:55,954
From your point of view,

114
00:08:56,655 --> 00:08:58,724
maybe it's 12 years of longing,

115
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:00,425
feelings,

116
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,494
giving,

117
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:04,997
pain,

118
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:06,999
and anxiety.

119
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:11,204
Normal people

120
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:14,272
would feel surprised,

121
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:16,809
moved,

122
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:18,710
and even respond to you.

123
00:09:20,245 --> 00:09:21,414
For me, it's

124
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:25,284
just 12 years.

125
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:29,320
I totally can't understand

126
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,257
what it's like looking for someone

127
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:33,359
for 12 years.

128
00:09:35,594 --> 00:09:37,662
Your feelings on me

129
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:40,365
will be a waste.

130
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:43,969
You'll never get any reply.

131
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:44,670
No.

132
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,442
You can spend another 12 years,

133
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:54,312
but it won't change anything.

134
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:57,415
That's not gonna happen!

135
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:28,614
I...

136
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:33,419
My heart is empty.

137
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,289
There's nothing in it.

138
00:10:39,925 --> 00:10:41,960
And nothing can get in.

139
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:50,069
So I can assume

140
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:53,039
that you're yelling at me only to get rid of me.

141
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:59,277
But you picked me up from the police station.

142
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,882
That means you're worried about me.

143
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:08,987
Shi De asked for my help.

144
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:22,734
So,

145
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:29,875
not even a little bit?

146
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:43,189
Don't waste your time on me.

147
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:45,057
Doesn't worth it.

148
00:11:45,424 --> 00:11:46,559
Not worthwhile.

149
00:11:51,897 --> 00:11:53,299
Just a little bit.

150
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:55,867
I'm fine with that.

151
00:11:56,502 --> 00:11:58,104
I have plenty of time.

I'm going to be his assistant

167
00:13:11,677 --> 00:13:14,279
after the transfer of Hua Cing Technology.

168
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,254
There's no way
I'm letting you be my personal only.

169

At least, I'll make you the CTO.

But then,

171
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:28,260
I can't be around you all the time.

172
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:31,029
Your assistant can.

173
00:13:34,265 --> 00:13:36,169
I'm so relieved to see you guys

174
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:38,437
still being so close.

175
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:41,407
Hi, auntie.

176
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,947
I thought it was a phone call.

177
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:49,414
It's a video call!

178
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:50,749
Stupid.

179
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:54,887
Hi, Yi, long time no see.

180
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:56,789
Are you okay?

181
00:13:57,055 --> 00:13:58,924
Yeah, I'm fine.

182
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:03,029
Are you still mad at me?

183
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:04,997
Please forgive me.

184
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:07,299
I was really

185
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,734
too careless with my body.

186
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:10,135
I didn't even know I was pregnant.

187
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:12,370
When I got off the plane,
I went straight to the hospital.

188
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,672
Everything was a mess.

189
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:14,774
And then the baby came early.

190
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:17,142
And I couldn't take care of the company.

191
00:14:17,142 --> 00:14:19,479
Shi De was there for me.

192
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:21,247
But you were neglected because of this.

193
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:22,580
I'm so sorry.

194
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:23,949
Auntie.

195
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,187
Don't say that.

196
00:14:29,187 --> 00:14:31,524
You and your son's safety and well-being
are the most important.

197
00:14:33,092 --> 00:14:35,294
But I don't think you forgive me for real.

198
00:14:35,294 --> 00:14:36,562
You still have a problem with it.

199
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:37,797
No.

200
00:14:37,797 --> 00:14:38,597
You do.

201
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:40,099
Yes, you do.

202
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,935
Or else, why do you keep calling me auntie?

203
00:14:44,737 --> 00:14:47,072
You should call me mom.

204
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:47,774
Mom?

205
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,809
Yeah.

206
00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:51,344
Yeah.

207
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:52,710
I'd like you to meet Brandon.

208
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,745
Just give me a second.

209
00:14:53,745 --> 00:14:54,714
Just give me a second. I'll get him.

210
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:55,347
Brandon!

211
00:14:56,915 --> 00:14:58,417
Brandon.

212
00:14:58,417 --> 00:14:59,685
We need you.

213
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:00,985
Who's Brandon?

214
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:03,122
My stepfather.

215
00:15:05,357 --> 00:15:07,359
Get ready to meet your parents-in-law online.

216
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:09,762
Oh.

217
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:14,365
What?

218
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:19,137
Isn't that great?

219
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:22,240
Why didn't you tell me in the first place?

220
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,375
So many things happened after you went to the US.

221
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,744
If I had told you,

222
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,147
you wouldn't be mad at me, would you?

223
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:29,949
Of course not.

224
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:33,185
And then the next question is:

225
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,020
"Why didn't I come to you when things were done?"

226
00:15:37,622 --> 00:15:38,657
Sure!

227
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:40,459
You were there for five years.

228
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:41,927
Anyone would...

229
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:45,930
Because of the deal you made with my dad?

230
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:51,904
I know how much you value your father.

231
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:54,440
Just like I value my mother.

232
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:57,609
I don't want you guys fighting over this.

233
00:15:58,277 --> 00:15:59,512
You're gonna be sad.

234
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:01,780
Now I know

235
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:04,215
my dad's stupid.

236
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,985
You can't be picky.

237
00:16:12,124 --> 00:16:13,425
Your dad brought you

238
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:19,072
your favorite breakfast the next day

239
00:16:19,364 --> 00:16:21,267
when we were...in the office.

240
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:23,102
I didn't know that.

241
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,604
You don't?

242
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:31,009
You were too tired.

243
00:16:31,844 --> 00:16:33,279
You slept all the way.

244
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,112
You didn't wake up even
when I brought you to your room.

245
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:37,682
Sorry.

246
00:16:37,682 --> 00:16:38,384
My bad.

247
00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:39,552
I'll work on that.

248
00:16:39,552 --> 00:16:40,219
I won't wear you out.

249
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:41,320
Shut up!

250
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,624
Yummy!

251
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:47,659
Who made that?

252
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:51,830
This weekend,

253
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,599
invite your dad over for dinner.

254
00:16:54,332 --> 00:16:55,000
I'll cook.

255
00:16:56,835 --> 00:16:57,870
As you wish.

256
00:16:58,437 --> 00:16:59,639
But you do the dishes.

257
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:02,140
Like you ever did once.

258
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:04,477
All right.

259
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:05,710
We'll wash it together next time.

260
00:17:07,145 --> 00:17:07,947
What?

261
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:09,247
Shower?

262
00:17:09,749 --> 00:17:10,749
Dishes!

263
00:17:15,254 --> 00:17:16,722
You don't want to take a shower with me?

264
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:24,864
All right.

265
00:17:25,897 --> 00:17:27,099
I won't ask you to do the dishes.

266
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:29,100
But you should eat carrots.

267
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,202
You can't be picky.

268
00:17:32,104 --> 00:17:33,205
I don't want it.

269
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:35,807
Take a bite.

270
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:37,409
Please.

271
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,230
Dad.

272
00:18:00,365 --> 00:18:02,802
I bought your favorite soy milk
and deep-fried dough sticks.

273
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:06,070
It's been a long time since
we last had a meal together.

274
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:11,244
I thought

275
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:13,245
they were your favorite.

276
00:18:13,945 --> 00:18:15,047
Actually,

277
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,949
I knew you love them since I was a kid.

278
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:18,717
So

279
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:22,054
I was just trying to make you happy

280
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,155
by pretending that I liked them.

281
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,794
No.

282
00:18:30,962 --> 00:18:32,030
Deep-fried dough sticks

283
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:37,169
were the food I had with your mom
on our first date.

284
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:40,972
Back then,

285
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:43,209
I came here and work on my own.

286
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:48,580
I was penniless.

287
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,282
I didn't know anybody.

288
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:53,919
Your mom was with me.

289
00:18:55,454 --> 00:18:57,722
But I couldn't take her anywhere.

290
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,699
Despite the hardship,

291
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,969
she was always there for me.

292
00:19:12,337 --> 00:19:13,705
Always.

293
00:19:16,074 --> 00:19:19,177
She always watched over me gently.

294
00:19:23,882 --> 00:19:25,150
Very gently.

295
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:29,622
Dad.

296
00:19:30,855 --> 00:19:32,792
You still love mom until today.

297
00:19:34,494 --> 00:19:37,395
Mama must be so happy to have you.

298
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:47,139
And what about you?

299
00:19:52,177 --> 00:19:53,712
Are you happy now?

300
00:20:03,189 --> 00:20:05,857
I'm not a good father.

301
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,127
But I hope

302
00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:10,862
my son

303
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,299
can be happy.

304
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:30,749
Are you free this weekend?

305
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:35,020
Shi De

306
00:20:35,554 --> 00:20:37,222
wants to cook for you.

307
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:47,565
Can he make sushi?

308
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:51,204
I don't know.

309
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:52,872
He can try.

310
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:57,075
What else do you want to eat?

311
00:20:58,344 --> 00:20:59,612
Anything would do.

312
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:02,214
But still,

313
00:21:04,282 --> 00:21:06,050
I want something nice.

314
00:21:06,952 --> 00:21:07,787
I'll tell him.

315
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:09,622
He's quite a good cook.

316
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,765
You know what to order.

317
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:30,942
Come on.

318
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,610
This is yours.

319
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:35,580
This is my favorite, too.

320
00:21:36,915 --> 00:21:37,615
OK?

321
00:21:37,615 --> 00:21:38,317
Cool.

322
00:21:40,785 --> 00:21:41,587
Come on.

323
00:21:41,587 --> 00:21:42,687

Boss, we're leaving.

00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,855
By the way, I'm taking the day off tomorrow.

366
00:23:57,489 --> 00:23:58,857
Boss, we're leaving.

367
00:23:58,857 --> 00:23:59,625
Boss. Bye-bye.

368
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:00,425
Why do you take the day off?

369
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:01,827
Then I'll take a break the day after that.

370
00:24:01,827 --> 00:24:03,329
No, I said it first.

371
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:47,505
Pei Shou Yi.

372
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,475
Don't be mad.

373
00:24:51,677 --> 00:24:53,479
I'm here to return your things.

374
00:24:55,847 --> 00:24:57,149
I was wondering

375
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,287
whether I could stay by your side

376
00:25:01,687 --> 00:25:03,555
without getting any reply from you

377
00:25:04,957 --> 00:25:06,492
and you don't have to

378
00:25:10,595 --> 00:25:12,497
like me

379
00:25:13,565 --> 00:25:15,334
but then I figured it out.

380
00:25:17,804 --> 00:25:20,005
I shouldn't have caused you so much trouble.

381
00:25:21,907 --> 00:25:23,175
You're right.

382
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,012
It's time for me to grow up.

383
00:25:29,815 --> 00:25:31,417
The things in this box

384
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,852
have been with me for 12 years.

385
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:38,590
They are very precious to me.

386
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,862
Well, they are yours, actually.

387
00:25:47,699 --> 00:25:49,702
Though you probably don't even remember.

388
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,875
That jacket

389
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,677
you put on me when we first met.

390
00:26:00,212 --> 00:26:01,814
And the bandage you gave me

391
00:26:04,617 --> 00:26:06,085
when I got hurt.

392
00:26:13,459 --> 00:26:15,094
The towel you gave me

393
00:26:17,729 --> 00:26:19,130
and the slippers

394
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:22,067
in the health center.

395
00:26:25,804 --> 00:26:27,672
And the toothbrush and toothpaste

396
00:26:30,342 --> 00:26:31,710
you prepared for me

397
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,814
the next morning.

398
00:26:38,217 --> 00:26:39,819
The bowls of my favorite

399
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,690
instant noodles you left for me in the closet.

400
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,439
(Get out when you wake up)
The stickers you left me.

401
00:27:02,107 --> 00:27:03,309
You taught me my homework.

402
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:05,144
All those answers.

403
00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:10,382
And the letter you wrote me

404
00:27:10,382 --> 00:27:12,050
before you left.

405
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,922
And the cup you forgot to take with you.

406
00:27:17,255 --> 00:27:18,690
Pei Shou Yi.

407
00:27:31,237 --> 00:27:33,505
You know, the minute I found that you left suddenly,

408
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:37,977
I started looking for you.

409
00:27:40,445 --> 00:27:42,680
I look at these things every day.

410
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,584
I thought,

411
00:27:48,654 --> 00:27:49,922
maybe,

412
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,159
you would

413
00:27:55,394 --> 00:27:56,562
let me stay with you

414
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:04,069
if I become more mature.

415
00:28:17,115 --> 00:28:18,717
But you don't have to worry.

416
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:28,494
Here's your stuff.

417
00:28:35,434 --> 00:28:37,135
It's time that I let myself go.

418
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:44,677
If there's anything you want to keep,

419
00:28:44,677 --> 00:28:45,777
please keep it.

420
00:28:50,182 --> 00:28:51,717
You can throw them away if you want.

421
00:28:57,422 --> 00:28:58,757
Anyway, Pei Shou Yi,

422
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:01,727
although you probably

423
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:05,164
regret that

424
00:29:05,997 --> 00:29:08,434
you minded my business,

425
00:29:13,939 --> 00:29:15,507
I still want to thank you.

426
00:29:18,344 --> 00:29:19,879
You're the first person who asked me

427
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:22,747
whether I was painful.

428
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:30,422
My world becomes better

429
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,029
than I expected

430
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:41,734
because of you.

431
00:29:49,074 --> 00:29:51,544
How come every time I see you I talk so much?

432
00:30:04,824 --> 00:30:05,890
Pei Shou Yi.

433
00:30:08,627 --> 00:30:09,729
One last thing.

434
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:17,970
Bless you.

435
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,242
I hope you will find the one

436
00:30:26,645 --> 00:30:29,180
whom you want to be there for you.

437
00:30:31,284 --> 00:30:32,017
I wish you happiness.

438
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:24,235
Yu Zhen Xuan.

439
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,709
Shouldn't you be

440
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,282
dealing with these things yourself?

441
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:23,062
Test.

442
00:32:24,095 --> 00:32:24,664
Test.

443
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,167
Hello, Mr. Distinguished Alumni.

444
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:30,535
What's it like to come back and give a speech
at your alma mater?

445
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:33,739
Fantastic!

446
00:32:35,874 --> 00:32:36,775
I won this time.

447
00:32:36,775 --> 00:32:38,710
I come to deliver a speech earlier than you.

448
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:42,514
Get ready to throw in the towel.

449
00:32:44,115 --> 00:32:44,784
Gao Shi De.

450
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:47,219
I will never lose to you again.

451
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,254
We have graduated for long,

452
00:32:49,254 --> 00:32:50,555
you're still thinking about those silly things.

453
00:32:51,724 --> 00:32:54,059
Does it matter who's number one?

454
00:32:54,994 --> 00:32:56,129
I've lost

455
00:32:56,662 --> 00:32:58,464
my whole life to you the moment

456
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,134
I fell for you.

457
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,235
Gao Shi De!

458
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:05,404
Hi, distinguished alumni.

459
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:06,805
What?

460
00:33:07,605 --> 00:33:08,874
It's nice to be back.

461
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:10,742
Let's take a tour around.

462
00:33:11,944 --> 00:33:12,912
Where are you going?

463
00:33:12,912 --> 00:33:13,612
Don't ask.

464
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:28,060
Swimming Pool.

465
00:33:28,894 --> 00:33:29,429
Yeah.

466
00:33:30,229 --> 00:33:31,330
You have a wish here?

467
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:33,032
Of course.

468
00:33:36,202 --> 00:33:36,902
What is it?

469
00:33:39,404 --> 00:33:40,372
You know.

470
00:33:41,005 --> 00:33:42,574
When I was in the swimming team,

471
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:44,810
I wasn't happy at all.

472
00:33:45,444 --> 00:33:46,379
Why?

473
00:33:48,847 --> 00:33:50,482
The meat I wanted to have

474
00:33:50,949 --> 00:33:53,052
was in front of me every day

475
00:33:53,785 --> 00:33:55,120
but I couldn't touch it.

476
00:33:57,322 --> 00:33:58,990
It was really sad.

477
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,867
I was crying alone by the pool.

478
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:08,867
Idiot.

479
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:24,950
Gao Shi De.

480
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,017
What are you doing?

481
00:34:26,852 --> 00:34:27,719
Come on up.

482
00:34:30,322 --> 00:34:30,955
I'm leaving.

483
00:34:34,025 --> 00:34:35,127
I'm having a cramp!

484
00:34:39,097 --> 00:34:40,365
No more lies.

485
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:42,034
Call an ambulance.

486
00:34:42,034 --> 00:34:42,802
Enough.

487
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,339
Shi De.

488
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,407
Gao Shi De!

489
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,919
You got to be kidding me.

490
00:35:24,744 --> 00:35:26,445
Don't tell me this is your wish.

491
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:27,847
One of them.

492
00:35:28,114 --> 00:35:28,947
There are more?

493
00:35:30,382 --> 00:35:31,684
Locker room.

494
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:33,352
Go away.

495
00:35:36,089 --> 00:35:36,589
You.

496
00:35:36,855 --> 00:35:37,757
You're doomed!

497
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:38,424
Come on.

498
00:35:44,797 --> 00:35:46,232
How old are you, man!

499
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:49,569
Vice President Zhou.

500
00:35:51,002 --> 00:35:52,004
Mr. Zhou.

501
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,374
Alright...

502
00:36:02,114 --> 00:36:03,015
This one's ready.

503
00:36:03,015 --> 00:36:03,815
I need ketchup.

504
00:36:03,815 --> 00:36:04,617
And this is ready to serve.

505
00:36:13,192 --> 00:36:13,759
Remember.

506
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:14,860
-Today is a big day.
-I know.

507
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,162
Wait for his hint.

508
00:36:16,795 --> 00:36:18,097
Let's just pretend that we know nothing.

509
00:36:19,064 --> 00:36:19,599
Here they come.

510
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,299
Lu.

511
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:21,065
-There you are!
-Remember!

512
00:36:21,065 --> 00:36:21,567
Wait a minute.

513
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:22,367
Yeah.

514
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:23,602
You came back from visiting?

515
00:36:23,602 --> 00:36:24,402
Yeah.

516
00:36:24,402 --> 00:36:25,037
That's a nice table.

517
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,439
Will you?

518
00:36:27,907 --> 00:36:29,407
Will you?

519
00:36:30,342 --> 00:36:32,210
Will you?

520
00:36:34,547 --> 00:36:35,447
Bing Wei.

521
00:36:36,682 --> 00:36:37,817
Are you ready?

522
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,619
I keep the ring in the car

523
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:41,820
for emergencies.

524
00:36:42,454 --> 00:36:43,289
Do you think Zhe Yu will say yes

525
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:44,724
to my proposal?

526
00:36:45,424 --> 00:36:46,692
Take a deep breath.

527
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:51,564
I'm still so nervous.

528
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,465
Don't be nervous.

529
00:36:54,232 --> 00:36:54,900
Although

530
00:36:55,434 --> 00:36:57,169
it will be a while before you get married,

531
00:36:57,169 --> 00:36:57,904
I'm

532
00:36:58,204 --> 00:36:59,505
sure you can do it.

533
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:00,872
OK.

534
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,042
Please keep this for me.

535
00:37:04,242 --> 00:37:05,277
Wait a minute.

536
00:37:05,277 --> 00:37:07,012
Please don't act like this later.

537
00:37:07,012 --> 00:37:07,880
Be cool.

538
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,414
OK?

539
00:37:08,414 --> 00:37:08,880
OK.

540
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:17,790
I'll bet you a thousand.

541
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,625
Bing Wei is going to ask me to marry him today.

542
00:37:20,092 --> 00:37:21,127
How do you know?

543
00:37:21,594 --> 00:37:24,162
Because last week he left the ring at my house

544
00:37:24,162 --> 00:37:25,130
and I found it.

545
00:37:25,564 --> 00:37:27,065
I put it back in his car.

546
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:28,567
And

547
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:30,269
with his personality,

548
00:37:30,935 --> 00:37:32,470
he can't wait for more than a weak.

549
00:37:32,872 --> 00:37:34,005
And you want to make a bet with me?

550
00:37:35,174 --> 00:37:36,442
Will you say yes?

551
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:37,910
Why not?

552
00:37:38,077 --> 00:37:39,077
Anyway,

553
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:43,349
we're not getting married any soon.

554
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:45,650
Donkey and carrot?

555
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,385
Yeah.

556
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:51,624
Can you get me a lemon?

557
00:37:52,224 --> 00:37:53,459
Sure, just give me a second.

558
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,027
Boss.

559
00:37:56,027 --> 00:37:57,195
Do you have a lemon?

560
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,964
Could you hold on for a second?

561
00:37:58,964 --> 00:37:59,565
Sure.

562
00:37:59,732 --> 00:38:01,300
Zhen Xuan, could you find me a lemon?

563
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:01,834
OK.

564
00:38:12,077 --> 00:38:13,045
Did you find it?

565
00:38:13,045 --> 00:38:14,112
No.

566
00:38:14,514 --> 00:38:15,680
How come?

567
00:38:16,915 --> 00:38:17,515
Oh.

568
00:38:19,485 --> 00:38:20,052
Got it?

569
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,387
You alright?

570
00:38:23,522 --> 00:38:24,155
Lemon.

571
00:38:28,994 --> 00:38:30,129
We'll drink later.

572
00:38:31,564 --> 00:38:32,999
Have some milk, it's good for your stomach.

573
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:35,400
This cup...

574
00:38:36,169 --> 00:38:37,302
It's about to start.

575
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:38,870
It's a big day today.

576
00:38:43,642 --> 00:38:44,175
Be careful.

577
00:38:58,757 --> 00:38:59,992
Everybody...

578
00:39:00,592 --> 00:39:01,360
Please follow me outside.

579
00:39:01,827 --> 00:39:03,462
I have an important announcement to make.

580
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:13,739
Zhe Yu.

581
00:39:14,774 --> 00:39:17,675
I know I always make you angry.

582
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,979
And I'm not smart enough.

583
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,514
But you've been bearing with me.

584
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,852
I like living with you so much.

585
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,755
I hope this goes on forever.

586
00:39:32,124 --> 00:39:33,292
So I'm wondering...

587
00:39:34,259 --> 00:39:34,927
Shi Zhe Yu.

588
00:39:37,964 --> 00:39:39,197
Will you marry me?

589
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:47,572
It's a pretty bad ring.

590
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,774
But I do.

591
00:39:48,774 --> 00:39:51,977
