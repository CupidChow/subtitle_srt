1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:02,930
(Between Shou and Zhen)
What would you like today?

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,105
Whatever.

3
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:05,670
A specialty, maybe.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,370
This is specially made for you.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,020
What's this?

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,200
Tafen.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,718
Tafen?

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,450
Why does it look so weird?

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,580
Try it.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:22,960
What do you think?

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,220
It's heavy.

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,193
It's good though.

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,830
I want the specialty too.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,740
Don't run, you little thief.

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,000
Stop running.

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,780
Go away.

17
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,960
What are you doing?

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,570
It must hurt.

19
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,020
From the second he picked me up,

20
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,010
he was the only one in my world.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,810
Go away.

22
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,210
It hurts.

23
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,485
Don't move.

24
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,220
Leave me alone.

25
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,550
Then get out of my sight.

26
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,300
Your hand.

27
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,010
None of your business.

28
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,520
I should have left him alone.

29
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,260
From the second he looked at me,

30
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,320
I knew that

31
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,270
I was in trouble.

32
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,890
Dry yourself.

33
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:43,159
(Yu Zhen Xuan)

34
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,930
Do you have any food?

35
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,360
Put your legs down first.

36
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,120
X minus H, right.

37
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,350
Then it's Y minus. Right, square root.

38
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,520
Four...

39
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,660
minus three, right.

40
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,630
Can you do this one?

41
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,100
You can, can't you?

42
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,973
OK.

43
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,640
Let's do another one.

44
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,600
This one is similar.

45
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,270
Solve the parabolic equations.

46
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,980
To make X equal 0.

47
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,800
Then X equals 3.

48
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,520
Try to figure out Y and K.

49
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,820
Y and K.

50
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,200
Why am I wrong on this one?

51
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,840
Because there was the word "be",

52
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,170
so it has to a gerund ending with "ing".

53
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:03,960
Hello, headmaster.

54
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,710
Hello, headmaster.

55
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,480
Yu Zhen Xuan, you've made a lot of progress lately.

56
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,480
Keep it up.

57
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,580
Shen Wei Nian, you did so much worse in your study.

58
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,840
Learn from Zhen Xuan. OK?

59
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,391
Got it.

60
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:39,782
(Get lost when you wake up)

61
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,200
I got the result.

62
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,620
Pei Shou Yi.

63
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,440
Pei Shou Yi.

64
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,400
(Kid.)

65
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:25,820
(I'm leaving.)

66
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,280
(So you have no reason to be around me.)

67
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,600
(It's time for you to grow up.)

68
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,320
(See you.)

69
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,400
(Correction.)

70
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,700
(See you never.)

71
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,890
Pei Shou Yi.

72
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,750
Pei Shou Yi.

73
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,640
Don't be mad.

74
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,380
I'm here to return some things to you.

75
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,260
I was thinking last night...

76
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,500
if

77
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,600
I didn't need your response

78
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,720
and I didn't need you to like me,

79
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,860
may I be by your side this way?

80
00:14:07,904 --> 00:14:09,408
But later I figured it out.

81
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,176
I shouldn't have caused so many troubles for you.

82
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,080
You were right.

83
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,100
It's time for me to grow up.

84
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,780
Inside this box

85
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,200
are the things that have been
with me for 12 years.

86
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,710
I'm giving them back to you.

87
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,710
It's time to set myself free.

88
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,260
If there is anything you want to keep,
you can keep it.

89
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,880
You can also throw them away if you want.

90
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,960
Anyway, Pei Shou Yi.

91
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,220
Although you may

92
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,640
feel regret

93
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,760
that you went through all the trouble
to help me back then.

94
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,800
But I'm grateful to you.

95
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,320
You are the first one to ask me

96
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,000
if it hurts.

97
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,480
My world has changed

98
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,440
out of expectation because of you.

99
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,080
It's much better.

100
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,940
Why do I say so much every time I see you?

101
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,160
Pei Shou Yi.

102
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,220
The last words for you.

103
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,480
You have my blessing.

104
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,600
I hope you can find the one

105
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,180
who you like to have.

106
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,500
I hope you will be happy.

107
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,740
Yu Zhen Xuan.

108
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,400
Shouldn't you be the one

109
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,590
to organize the stuff?

110
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:58,230
(Fighting Mr. 2nd)
