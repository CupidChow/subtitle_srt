1
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,387
I've been away from Taiwan, China for almost two years.

2
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:12,953
Zhou Shu Yi.

3
00:00:13,855 --> 00:00:14,790
(I miss you. Where are you?)
You used to read my messages but didn't reply.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,725
Now you don't even read it.

5
00:00:17,658 --> 00:00:20,895
The mails I sent you

6
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,263
never got replied.

7
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,432
I know

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,602
you must be angry.

9
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:32,140
I was supposed to go back in two months.

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,542
It's been two years now

11
00:00:33,842 --> 00:00:34,542
and I'm still here.

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,612
Would you please let me explain?

13
00:00:37,612 --> 00:00:38,313
I'm leaving.

14
00:00:41,182 --> 00:00:42,783
You've got everything?

15
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:44,218
Yeah.

16
00:00:44,618 --> 00:00:47,388
You need to talk to Yi when you get there.

17
00:00:47,388 --> 00:00:48,823
What did you tell him?

18
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:49,892
Or shall I help you?

19
00:00:49,892 --> 00:00:51,427
Tell him that I didn't know I was pregnant

20
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:52,660
and then all of a sudden I was in bad condition.

21
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,828
You were all freaking out.

22
00:00:53,828 --> 00:00:54,997
And the company was messy.

23
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:55,730
You stayed because...

24
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:56,665
Okay... Mom.

25
00:00:58,467 --> 00:00:59,968
You are not to blame

26
00:00:59,968 --> 00:01:01,002
for what has happened.

27
00:01:02,303 --> 00:01:04,940
And you have to take good care of yourself.

28
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,908
You suffered from pregnancy hypertension

29
00:01:06,908 --> 00:01:08,610
and you hasn't fully recovered yet.

30
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,945
When I'm gone,

31
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,513
you need to take care of Oscar.

32
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,880
It's gonna be hard.

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,683
I know you're sweet.

34
00:01:15,183 --> 00:01:17,152
Don't worry about it. It's all right.

35
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:19,955
Brandon and Ashley can help now.

36
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,357
We can't hold you up anymore.

37
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,225
You never did.

38
00:01:23,892 --> 00:01:25,793
All right, tell me if you need anything.

39
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:26,828
I'm gonna help you.

40
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:27,462
OK?

41
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:30,865
Go... Mom owes you.

42
00:01:30,865 --> 00:01:31,900
No.

43
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,168
You never owe me anything.

44
00:01:33,168 --> 00:01:33,635
Bye-bye.

45
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:38,507
(Who's the bravest)

46
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:41,610
(when it comes to love?)

47
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:45,847
(If I knew it too late,)

48
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:48,483
(can we start over again?)

49
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,418
Shu Yi.

50
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:53,922
I took the very first flight back.

51
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:55,123
I'll be there in two days.

52
00:01:56,023 --> 00:01:56,958
At least,

53
00:01:57,692 --> 00:01:58,593
let's meet.

54
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:00,428
Okay?

=Fighting Mr. 2nd=

66
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,120
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,760
I didn't believe your "forever".

68
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,505
It took me ten years

69
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,842
to decide who I want to spend my life with.

70
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,282
Yet you know it long ago.

71
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:07,322
I thought

72
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:12,627
it was the emotions and atmosphere back then

73
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,100
made you say that.

74
00:04:33,948 --> 00:04:35,250
I came back that year

75
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:36,785
and met your dad.

76
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,127
He said a lot of things.

77
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,065
You know, I used to think about

78
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:51,800
your reasons to leave me.

79
00:04:57,372 --> 00:04:59,007
And he got your phone.

80
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:02,510
I thought

81
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,348
it was over.

82
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,528
But I hated to let everything go like that.

83
00:05:24,465 --> 00:05:25,767
You know, actually...

84
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,402
actually, your dad...

85
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:29,203
He's right about everything.

86
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:33,308
I was in such a low self-esteem.

87
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,243
I was afraid you'd leave me.

88
00:05:36,277 --> 00:05:38,313
But I was also afraid that I'd hold you up.

89
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,783
So...

90
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:45,953
So I took your dad's offer.

91
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,225
To prove that I can stand next to you.

92
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:56,130
in five years.

93
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:05,040
It's good.

94
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:10,145
If I fail,

95
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,315
maybe

96
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,520
you'd find someone better for you than me.

97
00:06:21,222 --> 00:06:22,123
What?

98
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,528
It's my call.

99
00:06:28,063 --> 00:06:30,965
Not you, my dad or anybody else.

100
00:06:39,207 --> 00:06:40,108
Shu Yi.

101
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:41,543
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:47,382
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

103
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:09,070
Am I still the lucky one

104
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,772
you talked about?

105
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,842
Am I still the lucky one?

106
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:22,150
That day at the infirmary,

107
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,185
I said the one you liked was a lucky guy.

108
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:27,155
When I was asleep, you said

109
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,957
the lucky one had always been me.

110
00:07:31,893 --> 00:07:33,062
Is it still me?

111
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,398
Reply!

112
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:39,167
Don't you ever take it off.

113
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:41,637
I'm the only one in your future.

114
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:52,347
Yes.

115
00:08:06,795 --> 00:08:08,030
Always have been.

116
00:08:37,425 --> 00:08:38,727
You're crying?

117
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,095
No.

118
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:41,195
No?

119
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,398
You're a pain in the ass!

120
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,223
Why is it like this?

121
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,860
When we were doing this,

122
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,162
there was a bug.

123
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,697
You know what a bug is?

124
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:16,865
I know it.

125
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:17,498
You do?

126
00:09:17,498 --> 00:09:18,600
Yeah.

127
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,968
OK.

128
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:21,803
So there was a bug

129
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:24,807
causing problems with our data collection.

130
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:26,207
And it may seem

131
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:28,777
not that much of a difference

132
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,347
-but for data collection, if there's a 0.02 difference...
-Coffee's here.

133
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:33,848
Thank you.

134
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:35,283
No worries.

135
00:09:37,518 --> 00:09:38,353
What are you talking about?

136
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:40,622
Bug.

137
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:42,190
Worms?

138
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:45,360
Huh?

139
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,227
Why are you looking at me?

140
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:47,262
I just happen to be wearing green.

141
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:51,098
Are they talking about downsizing?

142
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:52,867
Must be!

143
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,237
I mean, look at CEO and Vice President Zhou.

144
00:09:56,237 --> 00:09:59,107
He's trying everything he can.

145
00:09:59,742 --> 00:10:00,742
Chief Technical Officer!

146
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:05,180
Is it good that Hua Cing Technology
is merged just like this?

147
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,615
Are you content that we just

148
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:08,250
give Alpha to others?

149
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,928
About our brand being custom-made,

150
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:21,095
I think there are some pros and cons

151
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:22,730
I need to discuss with you.

152
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,832
Okay, I'll get back to you.

153
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:25,867
Zhen Xuan.

154
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:30,438
Good news.

155
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:32,773
The company's not downsizing.

156
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,110
Really?

157
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,043
Yeah.

158
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:38,680
I did an actuarial check with Vice President Zhou.

159
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,182
All the R&D is up to date,

160
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,452
which increases the overall value of the company.

161
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,455
I'll be honest with you.

162
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:49,157
The layoff

163
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:51,927
was Vice President Zhou's bluff.

164
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,398
So you're just trying to give them some pressure

165
00:10:57,065 --> 00:10:58,133
and improve the progress.

166
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,502
We're testing their abilities, too.

167
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:04,305
But I do need to talk to some of them.

168
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,675
Even though it's all on schedule,

169
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,245
it's still far from

170
00:11:10,245 --> 00:11:11,780
what we expect.

171
00:11:13,582 --> 00:11:15,183
In this critical time,

172
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,352
every single person

173
00:11:17,352 --> 00:11:19,087
-has to perform...
-You know Pei Shou Yi?

174
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,960
What is it with you and Pei Shou Yi?

175
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,793
How do you know each other?

176
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:27,428
Where did you meet?

177
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:29,197
Did Pei Shou Yi ever tell you about me?

178
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:30,598
If you want to know, ask him yourself.

179
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,502
He'll tell you if he wants to.

180
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,905
Does he know about you and the prideful VP?

181
00:11:42,877 --> 00:11:45,447
What the hell is it with you and Pei Shou Yi?

182
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:52,053
Zhen Xuan.

183
00:11:53,188 --> 00:11:54,857
You're a senior at the company.

184
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,925
We do value your talent.

185
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:00,162
I respect you.

186
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:03,132
But that doesn't mean

187
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,800
you can meddle in my personal affairs.

188
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:07,935
Don't forget

189
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:10,572
I'm the CEO.

190
00:12:14,075 --> 00:12:15,177
Remember to read it.

191
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,082
Mama's boy!

192
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:45,073
So you've known Yu Zhen Xuan

193
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:46,708
since he was in high school?

194
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:48,243
Yeah.

195
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:53,682
That's Zhou Shu Yi's.

196
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:56,852
What about mine?

197
00:12:57,585 --> 00:12:58,153
No.

198
00:12:59,153 --> 00:12:59,988
Why?

199
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:04,458
If it wasn't for you,

200
00:13:05,227 --> 00:13:06,428
he wouldn't have found me.

201
00:13:07,295 --> 00:13:08,097
What do you mean?

202
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,132
He followed you to me.

203
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,035
Yu Zhen Xuan followed me?

204
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:14,168
Yeah.

205
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,205
He thought you and Zhou Shu Yi
were having secret trades.

206
00:13:17,772 --> 00:13:19,708
So he had watched you for a while.

207
00:13:21,577 --> 00:13:23,212
I didn't realize

208
00:13:27,315 --> 00:13:28,850
you are so stupid.

209
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,252
You didn't even notice
that you were being followed.

210
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:36,157
No wonder he looks at me like

211
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:37,525
I owe him something.

212
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:41,295
Well...

213
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:42,197
Is Yu Zhen Xuan

214
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,765
a little...

215
00:13:44,465 --> 00:13:45,833
Filial imprinting.

216
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,703
Paranoia. Asperger syndrome.

217
00:13:49,103 --> 00:13:51,407
Mildly depressed and prone to autotomy.

218
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:53,908
Which one do you want to know first?

219
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,010
Forget it.

220
00:13:57,178 --> 00:13:58,413
How do you know so much about him?

221
00:14:00,248 --> 00:14:02,383
I watched him for a year in his senior year.

222
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:07,990
Oh.

223
00:14:08,323 --> 00:14:09,692
So, you

224
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:12,360
quit that high school

225
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,097
because...

226
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:17,598
What would you want to drink?

227
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:24,840
You made up with Gao Shi De?

228
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:26,875
I don't get it.

229
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:28,677
He explained from where he stood.

230
00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:30,945
And you just forgive him?

231
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,947
It's too easy to persuade you.

232
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,753
Don't you remember what he did to you?

233
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:43,392
If it weren't for me and Bing Wei,

234
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,627
you wouldn't make it.

235
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:48,463
And what about your revenge plan?

236
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:49,832
We haven't even helped much,

237
00:14:49,832 --> 00:14:50,865
and you forgive him already?

238
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:53,335
I mean, if Shu Yi has already decided,

239
00:14:53,335 --> 00:14:54,870
we should support him.

240
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,538
Instead of tangling,

241
00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:58,173
it's better to be honest with each other.

242
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,142
The past is the past.

243
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:02,077
That's broad-minded.

244
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,245
You were also like that, right?

245
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:06,948
So you're saying I'm not broad-minded

246
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:07,915
and hold on to petty things?

247
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:09,617
No.

248
00:15:10,585 --> 00:15:11,587
What I'm saying is

249
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:13,422
you know, relationships are personal.

250
00:15:13,888 --> 00:15:15,257
Don't haggle over it.

251
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,493
So now you're saying I always haggle over things?

252
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,200
You're almost out of wine.

253
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,502
I'll get you more.

254
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:31,373
Dummy.

255
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:34,408
Don't torture him.

256
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:36,878
He's been running after you since after college.

257
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:39,447
If you keep testing him,

258
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:41,048
you'll be doomed if he gives up.

259
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,518
It's doomed if I say "yes."

260
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:46,888
Have you heard of the story of "donkey and carrot"?

261
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:49,758
As long as you hang the carrot
in front of the donkey,

262
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:50,925
it'll keep going.

263
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:52,560
So you're a donkey.

264
00:15:53,628 --> 00:15:55,030
I'm the carrot!

265
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,565
Got it?

266
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:57,198
Yes.

267
00:15:57,898 --> 00:15:59,735
A lot of people only want to conquer,

268
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:00,735
but they don't appreciate what they have.

269
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:06,342
Don't make quick judgements.

270
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:11,278
Thank you.

271
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:22,992
That's enough.

272
00:16:27,997 --> 00:16:29,230
Would you like some?

273
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:29,898
Sure.

274
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:40,875
Where are you going?

275
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,843
Get the wine.

276
00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:43,345
We've waited for you for long.

277
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:48,617
Don't you ever disappear again.

278
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,653
Do you have any idea how hard it was for him?

279
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:00,228
What do you mean?

280
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:03,298
You know, back then,

281
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:05,133
you were distracted when you spoke.

282
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,402
And then when he went to the US to look for you,

283
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,337
he saw you holding an American girl.

284
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:13,908
Again?

285
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,443
Which girl was it?

286
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,745
How am I supposed to know? You were holding her!

287
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,513
I didn't do anything like that!

288
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:22,517
No matter how many were there...

289
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,918
I didn't!

290
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,420
Okay, well, leave it.

291
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:28,423
Don't ever break his heart.

292
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:32,927
When Shu Yi came back from the US,

293
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,228
he was devastated.

294
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:36,432
He was in bad shape and went to bar all day.

295
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:37,265
You'd better know!

296
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,767
Since when do you care about me?

297
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,002
That's how his dad found out about you two.

298
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,040
You'll always be a child to me.

299
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,873
You know nothing!

300
00:17:45,873 --> 00:17:47,142
I know everything.

301
00:17:47,142 --> 00:17:48,177
Master.

302
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:49,945
Who the hell is he?

303
00:17:50,378 --> 00:17:51,747
It doesn't matter.

304
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:53,082
Move immediately!

305
00:17:53,082 --> 00:17:53,815
Alright.

306
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:55,283
But I'm gonna live alone.

307
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:55,817
No way.

308
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:56,985
Absolutely not.

309
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,320
Whatever,

310
00:17:59,655 --> 00:18:01,022
I'm gonna live alone!

311
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:05,227
His phone was confiscated.

312
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:06,762
And he had to change the number.

313
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:07,997
His phone was confiscated?

314
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:14,302
He lied to me!

315
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:15,903
Huh?

316
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:17,138
It's nothing.

317
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,642
And then?

318
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:22,943
And then...

319
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:26,147
there was equity dispute inside Cheng Yi Group.

320
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,817
Shu Yi's relatives were at each other's throats.

321
00:18:30,018 --> 00:18:31,320
To stabilize it,

322
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,655
he didn't say anything about you

323
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,558
just to help his dad.

324
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,828
Even though it looked like he was over you,

325
00:18:40,262 --> 00:18:41,830
you had always been in his heart.

326
00:18:42,797 --> 00:18:44,933
That's why he insists on living alone.

327
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,438
He really loves you.

328
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:54,508
One time when Zhe Yu and I went to the bar
to pick him up,

329
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,245
he was crying there alone with a broken phone.

330
00:18:57,245 --> 00:18:58,180
Welcome.

331
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,047
Gentlemen.

332
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:00,082
He cried for you.

333
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:01,048
We're looking for...

334
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,883
Him.

335
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:03,585
He's drunk.

336
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:04,183
Shu Yi.

337
00:19:05,284 --> 00:19:06,052
Shu Yi.

338
00:19:07,055 --> 00:19:07,888
Don't be like this.

339
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,058
-Let's go home.
-Sorry.

340
00:19:11,058 --> 00:19:11,927
He's drunk.

341
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,532
Sir, his...

342
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:17,332
His cell phone.

343
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:28,743
I can assure you.

344
00:19:29,645 --> 00:19:30,945
You can find no one else in the world

345
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,915
who loves you as much as he does.

346
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,258
You want some?

347
00:19:56,472 --> 00:19:57,372
Gao Shi De.

348
00:19:58,373 --> 00:19:59,607
Do you remember this place?

349
00:20:04,512 --> 00:20:05,980
Of course I do.

350
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,682
There was this idiot...

351
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:09,150
That's enough.

352
00:20:21,363 --> 00:20:22,998
Why don't you ask me

353
00:20:22,998 --> 00:20:24,332
why I stopped contacting you?

354
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:27,835
And that American girl
that I don't even know about.

355
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,045
You knew my dad was tricking you

356
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:39,047
and you were stupid enough to agree.

357
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:40,848
You'd rather be mistaken than explain to me.

358
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,352
You have become so stupid for me.

359
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,987
How can I suspect you?

360
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,192
Idiot.

361
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,095
Who's the idiot?

362
00:20:53,095 --> 00:20:54,228
You are.

363
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:58,800
Who was here doing that?

364
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,235
Hey!

365
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:01,068
I'm leaving.

366
00:21:01,737 --> 00:21:02,803
OK, go.

367
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,707
My name is Zhou Shu Yi!

368
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:07,977
I'm a fool.

369
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,278
-I...
-Okay!

370
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:13,115
No more...

371
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:15,683
-I like you, Gao Shi De
-That's enough.

372
00:21:18,053 --> 00:21:19,253
A lot!

373
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:20,188
My favorite.

374
00:21:20,188 --> 00:21:21,923
I don't know who

375
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:23,758
was drunk and came to my house

376
00:21:24,258 --> 00:21:25,627
with some late night snacks.

377
00:21:25,627 --> 00:21:27,862
"I'm not drunk."

378
00:21:27,862 --> 00:21:29,163
You're gonna talk about this, huh?

379
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:29,563
What are you doing?

380
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:30,765
You're gonna talk about this, huh?

381
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:33,402
"I'm not drunk."

382
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:34,770
"Hi, auntie."

383
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,705
"I'm Zhou Shu Yi."

384
00:21:38,907 --> 00:21:39,340
"Hello."

385
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:40,575
"I'm Zhou Shu Yi."

386
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,447
Bro, I'm leaving.

387
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:47,682
Bye.

388
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:14,375
What are you doing here?

389
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,077
For you.

390
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:21,350
Don't mess with Shi De.

391
00:22:24,452 --> 00:22:26,053
Mama's boy told on me?

392
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,122
No.

393
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:29,123
Just in case.

394
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:30,692
And

395
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,295
don't come here tomorrow.

396
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,363
You're not welcomed here.

397
00:22:37,432 --> 00:22:38,400
Why?

398
00:22:43,205 --> 00:22:44,638
I would have left

399
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:46,975
because I didn't want to see you again.

400
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:49,778
You

401
00:22:51,112 --> 00:22:52,147
make me feel so...

402
00:22:57,518 --> 00:22:58,453
annoyed.

403
00:23:06,828 --> 00:23:09,363
This is my friend's psychological clinic.

404
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:10,498
You go find...

405
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:11,400
I'm not sick!

406
00:23:13,402 --> 00:23:14,368
You're not sick?

407
00:23:16,203 --> 00:23:17,738
All these years, you've been looking for me.

408
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,842
You found me and now you keep coming to me

409
00:23:19,842 --> 00:23:20,808
just like before.

410
00:23:22,477 --> 00:23:23,078
Are you going to

411
00:23:23,078 --> 00:23:24,780
find ways to soften me?

412
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,183
It was fine when you were young.

413
00:23:29,383 --> 00:23:30,552
If this goes on,

414
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,122
you're getting close to be crazy.

415
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,962
I'm not crazy!

416
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:42,297
Then don't let me see you again.

417
00:24:30,712 --> 00:24:31,847
It's time for meal.

418
00:24:34,717 --> 00:24:36,385
I just read your report.

419
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:37,885
There are mistakes in page 3 and 5.

420
00:24:38,153 --> 00:24:38,920
Take a look.

421
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,995
Why don't you go eat? We'll do it later?

422
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:48,097
OK. Thank you.

423
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:02,010
My handsomeness dazes you?

424
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:03,478
Yeah.

425
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,047
I'm just kidding.

426
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:06,915
I'm serious.

427
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:09,918
What are you doing?

428
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,088
Dealing with mails from the manufacturers.

429
00:25:18,527 --> 00:25:19,593
Why laughing?

430
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,895
Nothing.

431
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,998
I remember when I asked you to write to me
once a week.

432
00:25:24,532 --> 00:25:25,533
That was stupid.

433
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:26,835
Thank god that you didn't write to me.

434
00:25:27,802 --> 00:25:29,337
I did, OK?

435
00:25:30,005 --> 00:25:31,540
I didn't get any!

436
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,042
Check this out.

437
00:25:39,013 --> 00:25:39,782
It's empty.

438
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:42,817
But I've got them all here.

439
00:25:42,817 --> 00:25:44,385
-Come see them.
-No way.

440
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,522
They were all sent.

441
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,357
You were right!

442
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,897
-Your dad!
-My dad!

443
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:38,347
(Downloading)

444
00:26:47,615 --> 00:26:48,383
Lin.

445
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,552
Can you access the system?

446
00:26:50,552 --> 00:26:52,087
No.

447
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:53,688
Shan Zhi, can you?

448
00:26:53,688 --> 00:26:54,588
No.

449
00:26:54,588 --> 00:26:56,190
It blocks me out all the time.

450
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:57,458
Chief Technical Officer.

451
00:26:58,027 --> 00:26:59,160
Can you access?

452
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,828
Chief Technical Officer!

453
00:27:07,468 --> 00:27:09,738
There was an unusual intrusion
into the server yesterday.

454
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:12,673
Someone hacked into the company computer
and stole Alpha.

455
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:16,210
I've called the police and asked them to process.

456
00:27:16,812 --> 00:27:18,580
We'd find the IP soon.

457
00:27:20,248 --> 00:27:22,017
To avoid any potential trouble,

458
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,118
please don't divulge any information.

459
00:27:24,618 --> 00:27:26,955
We'll send each of you
a confidentiality agreement,

460
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:27,888
and please sign it.

461
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:30,892
Hey!

462
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,360
Yes. I am.

463
00:27:34,663 --> 00:27:35,697
Got it?

464
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:14,870
Someone set a back door

465
00:28:15,103 --> 00:28:16,237
on purpose when programming Alpha.

466
00:28:16,472 --> 00:28:17,672
So you're saying

467
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:19,073
the thief is in our...

This isn't the last time.

470
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:22,877
Five years ago, I gave in.

471
00:28:22,877 --> 00:28:23,778
This time,

472
00:28:24,112 --> 00:28:26,080
I'll face you with Shu Yi.

473
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,250
Mr. Yu hasn't come here in days.

474
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,952
It would be nice to have an extra set of hands.

475
00:28:31,453 --> 00:28:32,253
