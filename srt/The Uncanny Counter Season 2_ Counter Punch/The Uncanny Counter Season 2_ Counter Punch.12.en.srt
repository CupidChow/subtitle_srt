00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,971
THE UNCANNY COUNTER 2

2
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,848
FINAL EPISODE

3
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,391
Mun!

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,686
Mun, you were right.

5
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:03,855
Inside that evil spirit…

6
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,861
Ma Ju-seok is still alive.

7
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,656
Mun, change of plans.

8
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,283
We're not killing him.

9
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,118
We're summoning him.

10
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,664
Everyone,

11
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,666
we have four minutes left.

12
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,881
That's enough, right?

13
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,555
Of course.

14
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,395
It's enough.

15
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,785
Because from the start…

16
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,371
I never once…

17
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,833
gave up on him.

18
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,699
Jeok-bong!

19
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,536
Are you okay?

20
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,206
Take care of Chairman Choi first.

21
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,291
Jang-mul!

22
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,719
Jang-mul!

23
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,189
Mun.

24
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,649
Go into Ma Ju-seok''s mind!

25
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,445
You need to find Ma Ju-seok
in order to summon Hwang Pil-gwang!

26
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,571
I can't!

27
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,866
I need the territory to do that,
but that'll make him stronger.

28
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,409
What are you worried about?

29
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,412
Do you think we can't keep you safe?

30
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,289
You don't trust us?

31
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,091
No, I do trust my family.

32
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,137
We'll try to buy as much time as possible!

33
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,176
You think you can handle it?

34
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,762
Worry about yourself, you evil spirit!

35
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,039
Mr. Ma.

36
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,085
Mr. Ma!

37
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,130
Mr. Ma!

38
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,192
Where did you get the audacity
to come here?

39
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,611
You really believe
that Ma Ju-seok is still alive?

40
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,737
Shut up!

41
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,531
What a shame.

42
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,327
The only thing you will find here
is your own death.

43
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,163
The same goes for your friends.

44
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,424
Ha-na.

45
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,469
Ha-na!

46
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,182
Jeok-bong!

47
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,852
Ha-na!

48
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,566
Ms. Chu!

49
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,027
Are you okay?

50
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,456
Jeok-bong.

51
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:43,874
Jeok-bong.

52
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:55,636
Hey, you coward!
You are no match for us in a fistfight.

53
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,350
You will never lay a finger on Mun,
you bastard.

54
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,187
I'll send you to hell, you asshole.

55
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,947
Yes, smile while you still can.

56
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,784
Because this will be
the last time you smile.

57
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,415
Mun will find Ma Ju-seok soon.

58
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,586
He will succeed.

59
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,173
Of course, he will.

60
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:36,010
He has never let us down.

61
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,682
We'll protect Mun at all costs.

62
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,314
Are you all serious?

63
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:54,820
Bring it on, you bastard. Come on!

64
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,406
All right.

65
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,493
You can die together.

66
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,248
Just like you wish.

67
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,669
We must keep fighting!

68
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,837
We must protect Mun!

69
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,466
Mr. Ma.

70
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,593
Mr. Ma, please!

71
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,720
Mr. Ma!

72
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,086
No!

73
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,047
Mun…

74
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,191
Mun…

75
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,789
Please, Mr. Ma.

76
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,833
Please help me.

77
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,753
I can't do this by myself.

78
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,256
You can't give up.

79
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,466
Please.

80
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,885
Please come out, Mr. Ma!

81
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,436
Mr. Ma.

82
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,675
Damn it.

83
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,344
Hey!

84
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,348
Mr. Ma…

85
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,418
Ma Ju-seok, you bastard!

86
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:33,867
Stop, Ma Ju-seok! Stop it, you bastard!

87
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,661
You…

88
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,163
are…

89
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,416
going with me.

90
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,961
What are you doing?

91
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,460
Ma Ju-seok, you…

92
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,336
Why did you do this?

93
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,255
Hwang Pil-gwang.

94
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,008
You can't die.

95
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,677
I will summon you myself.

96
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:45,856
What did I tell you?

97
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,400
There's no place for you anywhere.

98
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:53,489
I said you didn't belong here.

99
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:57,910
No!

100
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,079
No!

101
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,585
So now, just go

102
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,879
to hell!

103
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,301
We did it.

104
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,932
We did it, Mr. Ma.

105
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,657
Hwang Pil-gwang was summoned.

106
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,618
What?

107
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,246
But the evil spirit's body is still here.

108
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,498
Did he really get summoned?

109
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,458
How?

110
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,339
Mun did it from within.

111
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,098
That's Mun.

112
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:30,771
His specialty's performing miracles
as if they're nothing.

113
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,274
Right.

114
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,652
He would've easily done it.

115
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,031
Does that mean he's back

116
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,076
to being Ma Ju-seok?

117
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,410
He is.

118
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,080
The evil spirit was summoned.

119
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,711
- Let's treat his wounds first.
- Okay.

120
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,804
But why…

121
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,016
Why isn't Mun…

122
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,436
waking up?

123
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,944
Mr. Ma.

124
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,365
Where are you?

125
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,368
Mr. Ma.

126
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,638
What's all this?

127
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,682
My grandma wanted you to have this food.

128
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,809
Tell her I said thank you.

129
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,852
Okay.

130
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,688
BAEKDU DYNASTY APARTMENT COMPLEX

131
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,231
This place looks really nice.

132
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,649
Are you moving here?

133
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,567
Look.

134
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,652
Here.

135
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,447
You have three bedrooms?

136
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:07,951
I couldn't care less about it,
but Min-ji loves it.

137
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:10,954
- Mr. Ma.
- Yes?

138
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,082
You're smiling from ear to ear.

139
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,751
Really?

140
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,269
CERTIFICATE OF MERIT
MA JU-SEOK

141
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,533
Mr. Ma.

142
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:36,373
What are you doing here by yourself?

143
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,753
It's all over now.

144
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,717
You and I pulled it off in the end.

145
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,054
Go.

146
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,516
You don't belong here.

147
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,938
You should come back.
Your mother's waiting.

148
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:00,939
This is our house.

149
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,860
Min-ji and our baby will be here soon.
I'm not leaving.

150
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,611
Don't do this, Mr. Ma.

151
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:11,783
You know that this isn't real.

152
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,161
I don't care.

153
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:19,791
I could be in hell for all I care
as long as I'm with Min-ji and Treasure.

154
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,677
I'm dying.

155
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,347
This place will soon collapse.

156
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,976
So you need to get out of here right now.

157
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,187
No.

158
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,565
I can't do that.

159
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,400
The long battle has finally ended.

160
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,861
So don't do this.

161
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,739
I have…

162
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,159
nothing left.

163
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,999
You have yourself.

164
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,713
I will never give up on you.

165
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,551
You were the one who gave me hope
every time I wanted to give up!

166
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,511
It was you!

167
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,558
Mr. Ma!

168
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,601
Something…

169
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,895
Something's wrong.

170
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,025
Mr. Ma!

171
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,610
But what?

172
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:34,241
You want me to just leave you behind now?

173
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:36,868
No.

174
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,246
I will never give up on you.

175
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,333
I just wanted…

176
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,423
to sit at a table like this,

177
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,927
so I could eat…

178
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:57,555
and laugh with them.

179
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,434
That was all I wanted.

180
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,605
I never asked for more than that.

181
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,069
I guess I was asking for too much.

182
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,029
No.

183
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:14,823
You're wrong.

184
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,367
I give you my word.

185
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,327
Mr. Ma.

186
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,663
You will see…

187
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,292
Ms. Lee again.

188
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,627
I give you my word.

189
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,840
So… let's live.

190
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,883
Let's survive.

191
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,137
I will protect you no matter what.

192
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:41,850
So stay strong… and live.

193
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,145
There's still hope.

194
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,206
- Mun.
- Mun.

195
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,006
Mr. Ma.

196
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,425
Mr. Ma.

197
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,219
Mr. Ma.

198
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,145
Mun.

199
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,522
I think…

200
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,943
I had a very long dream.

201
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,575
Ju-seok.

202
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,036
Ms. Chu.

203
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,456
I wish I could heal your heart as well.

204
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,708
I'm sorry.

205
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,879
I'm afraid I don't have the power
to do that yet.

206
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:02,263
He won't remember anything
from the moment he was possessed.

207
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,683
He'll be very confused
during the interrogation.

208
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:10,480
If the police investigate
all of Hwang Pil-gwang's crimes,

209
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,525
Mr. Ma's crimes could be mitigated.

210
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,152
So, everyone,

211
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,113
let's keep our chins up.

212
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,407
Right.

213
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,617
Let's keep our chins up.

214
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:28,456
We need to send that evil spirit to hell.

215
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,667
Hwang Pil-gwang.

216
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:17,797
You are guilty of taking innocent lives
and wreaking havoc upon this world.

217
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,050
In strict accordance
with the laws of Yung,

218
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:24,345
I shall hand you over
to the judicial authorities as a criminal.

219
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,566
Look at that.

220
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:42,363
I thought this place had nothing.
But I guess anything is possible here.

221
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:46,451
Is this where your power comes from?

222
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,120
This is better than I expected.

223
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,291
The place you should've expected
is hell, not here.

224
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,628
Because you'll be rotting there forever.

225
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:58,880
Forever?

226
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,550
Do you really think so?

227
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:09,808
Doesn't the fact that there's a door
mean that I can always come back?

228
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,854
You can try, but I'll throw you back in.

229
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,773
A reunion?

230
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,360
I'm already getting excited.

231
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,072
You and your kind
can come at me all you want,

232
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,865
but I will always protect…

233
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,996
the people I love and the innocent.

234
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,706
So now,

235
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,376
go rot in hell.

236
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,671
Wi-gen.

237
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,757
Why are all evil spirits so chatty?

238
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,677
Thank you.

239
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,197
Welcome, everyone.

240
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,118
I made a special request to Yung
to prepare my signature noodles.

241
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:22,792
We did talk about visiting Korea
to try your dish.

242
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,837
I hope it tastes the same.

243
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,921
Thank you.

244
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:31,384
Thank you for keeping your word
about saving everyone, Ms. Chu.

245
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,557
Don't you worry about a thing.

246
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:43,980
I will do my best to fill all your shoes.

247
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,440
Are you Mun?

248
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,316
- What?
- No.

249
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,068
You see, I'm…

250
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,071
Mun and I are… How do I put it?

251
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:57,493
We are so close that we even share
a bunk bed together.

252
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,662
His name is Na Jeok-bong.

253
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,498
Mun and Mo-tak couldn't make it
because they were busy.

254
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,668
No wonder.

255
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:12,925
I really wanted to meet them.
Please tell them that we're grateful.

256
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,677
Okay, I will.

257
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,055
All right. Eat up.

258
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,392
Thank you.

259
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,438
It's tasty.

260
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,916
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

261
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,211
Ju-seok.

262
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:51,756
Over there.

263
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,904
Do you want me to uncuff you?

264
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,327
No.

265
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,162
It's okay.

266
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,623
Thank you.

267
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,845
Ju-seok…

268
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,222
My baby…

269
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:16,465
It's such a relief
that we could stop a complete evil spirit.

270
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,594
But more evil spirits will appear.

271
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:25,183
They'll get smarter and bolder
when it comes to taking souls.

272
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:31,939
Yung is impressed
by your uncanny abilities.

273
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,775
You're the first Counter

274
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,029
to summon an evil spirit
using the territory from within its mind.

275
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,866
It'd be nice

276
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:47,163
if you could teach your skills
to the other Counters abroad.

277
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:51,542
Are you asking me to travel abroad?
Just me?

278
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,712
It won't be for too long.

279
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,589
Will you consider it?

280
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,052
Sure.

281
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,554
By the way,

282
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,641
I also have a favor to ask.

283
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,644
A favor?

284
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:13,356
Actually, I made a promise.

285
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,235
I promised Mr. Ma
that he would see Ms. Lee again.

286
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,820
Can he see her
even if it's just for a little while?

287
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,905
Mun.

288
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:25,493
You know we can't do that.

289
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,163
Plus, he collaborated with evil.

290
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,915
It was a glimpse of light

291
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,961
that helped me defeat
Hwang Pil-gwang inside his mind.

292
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:41,384
His light made this miracle happen.
We defeated the evil spirit thanks to him.

293
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,886
And we're all safe and sound now.

294
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,429
Even so…

295
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:50,810
I just want to offer him
a glimpse of light.

296
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,313
So that he'll have the hope to live on.

297
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:02,280
We all know what it feels like
to long for our family.

298
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,533
I'm sure you also know that…

299
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,911
very well.

300
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,667
We all had to say goodbye
to our families too soon.

301
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,472
You're impossible, Mun.

302
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,527
Escaped convict Ma Ju-seok,
was finally arrested early this morning.

303
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,404
Jeok-bong!

304
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,531
Are you seriously not going to help?

305
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,284
Stop talking and help us clean.
We have so much to do.

306
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:52,913
The police will begin an investigation
into Ma Ju-seok's crimes.

307
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,459
His victims, Park and Hwang,
were also involved

308
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,420
in the fraud committed
by Baekdu Planning & Construction.

309
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,463
Do you want some?

310
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,801
No, I shouldn't.

311
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:10,306
I put on a lot of weight
after consuming so much sugar.

312
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:15,811
I need to be as light as a feather
if I want to keep catching evil spirits.

313
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,104
I shouldn't drink that.

314
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,356
This has zero calories.

315
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,608
It tastes nice too.

316
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,819
There's a lot in that vending machine.

317
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:28,282
A civilian played a vital role
in the arrest of Ma Ju-seok,

318
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,659
who acted in revenge for his late wife.

319
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:35,539
Hiding in a distribution center,
Ma ran into a night shift worker.

320
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,917
The worker persuaded him
to turn himself in.

321
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,752
"Worker"? That's what we agreed on?

322
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,880
That's me!

323
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:48,010
I told him he could start anew,

324
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:53,599
and that was when he started bawling.

325
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,227
It was heartbreaking to see him
cry like that.

326
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,479
- Whose idea was that?
- Who do you think?

327
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,816
You should've become a novelist.

328
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:06,487
That kid bluffs twice as much as Mo-tak.

329
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,282
The student has become the master.

330
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,369
It would've been better
if they hadn't blurred out my face.

331
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:16,080
No one can tell that it's me.

332
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,332
You look better blurred out.

333
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,168
JUNGJIN PENITENTIARY

334
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,519
Your mother's been discharged
from the nursing home and I took her home.

335
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,732
She might come to visit you tomorrow,
so make sure you look good for her.

336
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,696
And…

337
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,491
Chairman Choi
wants to find you an attorney.

338
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,660
That's okay.

339
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,790
I need to pay for my sins.

340
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,709
No.

341
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:05,713
That's not what I'm saying.
The attorneys keep calling him.

342
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:10,092
They feel bad for you and want to help.

343
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,929
Apparently, they're all very competent.

344
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:19,435
I'm grateful
that they're willing to help me.

345
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,272
It'll be quite some time…

346
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,193
before you can return home.

347
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:29,987
But still,

348
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:35,409
you won't be lonely
because I'll always be here for you.

349
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,624
Inmate 617, your time is up.

350
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,586
See you again, Mun.

351
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,594
Mr. Ma.

352
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,396
Take care.

353
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,269
This is…

354
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,871
HOUSE OF LITTLE ANGELS

355
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,267
I want to become a baker.

356
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:29,732
I want to become a firefighter,
a police officer, and a teacher.

357
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,318
- You want to become everything.
- Yes, I do.

358
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,288
Ju-seok.

359
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,219
Min-ji.

360
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,006
Min-ji, am I dreaming?

361
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,172
Ju-seok.

362
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,843
It must've been so painful.

363
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,474
No, not at all.

364
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,108
Promise me you'll be strong.

365
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,446
Tell me about all the fun things you did.

366
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,866
Take your time, okay?

367
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,205
I'm so sorry that I couldn't protect you.

368
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,332
No, Ju-seok.

369
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,461
I'll be protecting you from now on.

370
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,755
Whenever you're struggling…

371
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,217
you can think of me.

372
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:06,763
So what did I say to do?

373
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,685
Think of you.

374
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,405
All right.

375
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,534
I thought you were buying us
something special.

376
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,328
Just try it and don't ask me for more.

377
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:14,748
I'm so hungry. This is great.

378
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:17,834
Gosh, I hope this is filling.

379
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,628
It's very filling and tasty.

380
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:20,963
It's good.

381
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,590
This is the perfect meal
before going on a mission.

382
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,927
Why are you feeding us?
Did you do something bad?

383
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,348
No, it's just that
I'm thinking about going on a trip.

384
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:32,975
A trip?

385
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,977
Good thinking.

386
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:39,064
You should take your grandparents
and go somewhere for a few days.

387
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,149
Should I book a place on Jeju Island?

388
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:45,070
No, you see, I'm planning on going alone.

389
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:50,033
I'm not sure, but it may take a few months
to start in Europe and travel the world.

390
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,118
Europe?

391
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,119
A few months?

392
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,203
What do you mean?

393
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,665
A few months? Why would you go away
for that long all by yourself?

394
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,041
And what about our job?

395
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:01,044
I get that you've worked hard lately.

396
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,964
But still, you can't be gone
for that long…

397
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,216
It's not like that. It's actually…

398
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,053
Yung wants me to go overseas.

399
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:11,847
- Overseas?
- What?

400
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:12,806
What?

401
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,766
Overseas?

402
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,228
Are you kidding me right now?

403
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,443
Ha-na.

404
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,781
- Come on, now.
- Don't go, Jeok-bong.

405
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,410
My goodness.

406
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,120
Good luck up there, Yung.

407
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,499
Who was it? Tell us.

408
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:44,004
Who said you could take Mun away from us?

409
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,255
- Who?
- Hey, you come down.

410
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,257
Where am I?

411
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:53,347
- Why are you showing up there?
- Didn't you train him?

412
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,431
Jeok-bong!

413
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,141
Hurry.

414
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,603
Who was it?

415
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:00,937
Who made this decision?

416
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,731
Mom, first calm down.

417
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,858
How can we possibly calm down?

418
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:09,655
You're leaving us here
and sending only Mun overseas.

419
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,200
- I thought--
- I haven't even been to Yeouido yet.

420
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,994
- Is that why you're here?
- Aren't you?

421
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:19,164
- No.
- It's not? I thought the same.

422
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:21,041
- No?
- For crying out loud.

423
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:26,046
He just solved a huge case,
so how could you send him away?

424
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,714
You have no shame.

425
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,759
Exactly. At least not this soon.

426
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,972
Mun was the one
who wanted to leave as soon as possible.

427
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:37,516
It was him?

428
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,309
Yes.

429
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:41,770
It was my wish.

430
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,773
Mun, you just summoned Hwang Pil-gwang.

431
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:45,691
Mr. Ma…

432
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,319
was the kindest man ever.

433
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,490
And he was also
the most powerful evil spirit.

434
00:49:55,117 --> 00:50:01,206
If anyone can become an evil spirit,
I want to save as many people as possible,

435
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,418
so that this incident won't repeat itself.

436
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,421
I want to make that happen.

437
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,299
Right.

438
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,510
Mun is right.

439
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,971
The more evil spirits we catch,

440
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:19,391
the more potential victims we'll save.

441
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,685
- So--
- That's enough.

442
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,396
Don't think about tagging along with him.

443
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,065
We're only sending him.

444
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,650
Why?

445
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,403
Why can't I go? Why?

446
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,612
As for me,

447
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,781
I think I'm eligible to go.

448
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,408
First of all,

449
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:39,161
I have plenty of experience
taking care of Mun--

450
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,581
Dream on, Jeok-bong!

451
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,459
Why? Why must I dream on?

452
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:50,464
You all need to keep this place safe.

453
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,925
I won't be gone for too long.

454
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,388
I'll be back soon.

455
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:00,724
Mun.

456
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,407
Here's your passport.

457
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:22,037
You'll be staying at a six-star hotel
and flying first class.

458
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,790
I know it won't happen,

459
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:28,460
but call me
if you're not happy with something.

460
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,378
I'll send you my plane.

461
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:38,261
You didn't have to do all this for me.
Thank you, sir.

462
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:43,558
You gave me an economy ticket
when I went on a mission five years ago.

463
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,520
This is discrimination.

464
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,897
Good luck.

465
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:54,945
After seeing your troubles, I pulled out
all the stops for Mun this time.

466
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,573
Don't overwork yourself.
Just do your job and come back.

467
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,118
Back up. It's just a trip.

468
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,788
Gosh.

469
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,835
Will you call us every day?

470
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:10,961
Of course.

471
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,048
You'll be in big trouble
if you get hurt while you're away.

472
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:17,926
I'm "The Uncanny Mun."

473
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:20,095
You don't have to worry, Ms. Chu.

474
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,349
Here.

475
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,643
ALLOWANCE FOR MY BROTHER

476
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:32,107
Buy some snacks on the plane.
It's not a lot though.

477
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,066
Sorry.

478
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,780
Hey.

479
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:42,450
It's not a train.
It's a plane and he's in first class.

480
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,785
No need to buy snacks.

481
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:47,873
Cut this nonsense and let's go.
You're going to miss the flight.

482
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,750
Bye.

483
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,635
- I forgot the medicine.
- You startled me.

484
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,596
Mo-tak, let's stop at a pharmacy.

485
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:06,516
It's his first time abroad.
He may need to adjust to the water.

486
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,394
They have plenty
of good medicine there too.

487
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,271
And if he doesn't have time to buy it?

488
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,107
Mun, I don't think she wants you to go.

489
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:18,612
You said you almost needed a diaper
when you went on that business trip.

490
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,281
That's not it. I suddenly got diarrhea.

491
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,782
It's the same thing.

492
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,951
What are you saying? I was in a hurry--

493
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,787
That's what happens when you're in a rush.

494
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,414
- Stop.
- Come on now.

495
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,250
What's wrong?

496
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,381
I smell poop nearby.

497
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:39,966
Poop? An evil spirit?

498
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,761
Come on. It's a prank, right?

499
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:45,305
No, you can tell by his face.
He did smell it.

500
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,057
It's pretty strong.

501
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,642
We need to hurry!

502
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:52,020
What should we do?
We need to take Mun to the airport.

503
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:04,783
Taxi.

504
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:30,725
SIX MONTHS LATER

505
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,016
Hello.

506
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,319
Are you interested in the piano?

507
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,907
I'm running a piano academy nearby.

508
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,159
DO RE MI FA SOL LA TI DO

509
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:31,244
You can come to sign up or just watch.

510
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,998
We hold a small concert there every month.

511
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,752
I see. Thanks.

512
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:41,421
"Do."

513
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:51,056
We can play together
even if you only know one solfège note.

514
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,682
I can show you.

515
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,100
So…

516
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,603
please come.

517
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:00,607
Okay.

518
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,319
I hope to see you again.

519
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:13,078
Mun, I'm doing very well.

520
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,456
As for Mo-tak…

521
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,835
You look very relaxed.

522
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,964
No one would think
you're on a stakeout. Right?

523
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,257
Sorry.

524
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,094
We've been on a stakeout for three days.
I miss my family.

525
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,429
Isn't she cute?

526
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,557
Very handsome.

527
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,351
I told you it's a girl.

528
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:39,646
Handsome doesn't only apply to boys.
Why are you so sensitive?

529
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,564
Also,

530
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,983
you need to pay a fine
for the shotgun wedding.

531
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:44,901
- Sorry?
- Come on.

532
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,862
Your wedding is in five months
but you already have a baby.

533
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,531
Pay me.

534
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,448
Forget it.

535
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,991
Pay me.

536
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:54,744
He's here.

537
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,498
Take care of it yourself.

538
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:03,545
You need to stop pestering me. Darn it.

539
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:07,632
The smell…

540
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,510
The smell just entered the bathhouse.

541
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,137
Dragon tattoo?

542
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,849
What? I don't know about that.
He's wearing glasses.

543
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,187
Where are you going?

544
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:25,400
I have a stomachache.
I need to go to the bathroom.

545
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,401
- Now?
- Bathroom…

546
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:27,485
What about him?

547
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,452
Satisfied?

548
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,579
Go cuff him and wait for me.

549
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,456
I'll be back.

550
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:44,752
Gi-ran, if you don't want me to quit,

551
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,464
you better put an end
to this moonlighting.

552
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,508
- He's still moonlighting and complaining.
- You scumbag!

553
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,137
We could've had just gukbap, not ribs.

554
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,390
You need to eat well to study hard.

555
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:01,186
Getting your GED is harder than you think.

556
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,189
So don't get discouraged even if you fail.

557
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:06,024
I'm going to stop studying for it.

558
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:09,402
Why would you do that?
You've been studying all this time.

559
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,783
Because I don't want to do it anymore.

560
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:19,454
Are you giving up? Didn't you promise me
that you'd do your best?

561
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,123
Why don't you want to do it?

562
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,083
Because I passed.

563
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,794
Still, you should take the test!
Why won't you take…

564
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,424
You passed?

565
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,719
But you said you messed it up.

566
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:37,096
I did, but I still passed.

567
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,099
I told you that I was smart.

568
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,315
GED CERTIFICATE

569
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:51,069
My goodness, Jae-youl.
I can't believe this.

570
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,488
I'm so thankful.

571
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:57,742
Jae-youl, I'm so proud of you!

572
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,452
I'm so proud of you!

573
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:05,875
Hey.

574
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:11,381
Go home safely.
I'll bring some food tomorrow.

575
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,592
Go straight home.

576
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,429
Here you go.

577
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,725
- Bye.
- Hold on.

578
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:26,563
What is this?

579
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,522
Bye!

580
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:28,773
What is this?

581
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,660
I said I got more wrinkles because of him,
and he got me this.

582
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:46,165
My dear Jae-youl
is surprisingly considerate.

583
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,335
It's like getting a facial.

584
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,212
"My dear Jae-youl."

585
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,630
Do you like him that much?

586
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,924
I'm so proud of him.

587
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,804
It's easy to go down the wrong path
but hard to turn around.

588
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,725
It feels like I'm raising a son
all over again.

589
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:08,438
It seems like Ms. Chu got another son.

590
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:12,317
Right, your grandmother
has a new "Darling."

591
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,484
- This way?
- No, that way.

592
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:14,861
Okay. Where?

593
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:18,865
Here? Where?

594
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,368
Ju-seok is going to be sad
when he finds out

595
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,371
that your wife loves Jeok-bong more now.

596
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,749
Of course not.

597
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,419
She still loves Mr. Ma the most.

598
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:33,671
Look.

599
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,840
Look over there.

600
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,302
Hey, come here.

601
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,721
Over here. Hey.

602
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:44,182
- Over there.
- Okay.

603
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,850
Look over there.

604
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,062
Look above that tree.

605
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,521
- That tree?
- Yes.

606
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,152
Min-ji and Mun-yeong

607
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:59,781
are playing up there.

608
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:03,201
How nice.

609
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:09,707
They have big smiles.
They must be having a lot of fun.

610
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,378
You're right.

611
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:18,549
They're having a blast up there.

612
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,849
What about you, Mun? How are you doing?

613
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,687
Everyone misses you a lot.

614
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:34,482
Will you come back soon?

615
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:37,318
RÜDESHEIM AM RHEIN, GERMANY

616
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,504
Would you like a refill?

617
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:59,799
No, thanks.
I just had this instead of coffee.

618
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,260
I didn't know I could get a refill.

619
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:05,263
Well, it's possible
since I'm the owner here.

620
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:06,973
Are you Korean?

621
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,684
Yeah. How did you know?
Do I look like one?

622
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:10,768
Are you traveling?

623
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,147
- Yes.
- Oh, okay.

624
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,232
You should check out the mountains nearby.

625
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,985
I used to go there a lot with my mom
when I was little.

626
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,153
I still love it.

627
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:22,822
With your mom…

628
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:24,532
I see.

629
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,661
Thanks for your recommendation.

630
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,788
I'm So Mun. Nice to meet you.

631
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,584
So Mun?

632
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:36,961
What a nice name.

633
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:39,630
I'm Jade.

634
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:43,301
It's a very precious name
given to me by my loving mother.

635
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,597
Are you resting up well?

636
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:54,395
You helped Counters around the globe
improve very quickly.

637
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,274
Everyone is grateful.

638
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,985
I volunteered to help.

639
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:02,695
Right.

640
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:04,655
I even made a friend.

641
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:06,991
A friend?

642
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:10,453
Close your eyes. Let me show you.

643
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:17,168
You don't need to do that.

644
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,211
Come on.

645
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,184
Now,

646
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,019
open them.

647
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:51,410
Mama.

648
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:12,723
Jade.

649
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:34,120
Mun.

650
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:36,539
Thank you.

651
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:17,663
- The best part of a wedding is?
- The buffet.

652
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,166
The buffet.
What's that meat with the bone called?

653
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,167
- Short ribs.
- Yes!

654
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,503
- That's what I wanted but--
- I even styled my hair today.

655
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:25,671
I was going to sing.

656
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,256
- How did it go again?
- All right.

657
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,758
This is it. Get out.

658
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,885
- Get out!
- Why did it have to be here?

659
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:32,094
Jeez.

660
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,012
END OF THE ROAD

661
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,597
Gosh, my hair.

662
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,557
Jeok-bong, how many different smells?

663
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,018
About three or four.

664
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,145
They're pretty much similar.

665
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,689
I wish we had the territory.

666
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,692
I heard he completed his task,
so why isn't he coming back?

667
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,569
He's been resting for too long.

668
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,530
I'm working like a dog while moonlighting.

669
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,407
Are you seriously jealous?

670
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:56,869
I was worried he'd be sick
since he couldn't even get any rest here.

671
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:01,040
All right. Don't be scared.
I'm the new ace, so trust me and come.

672
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,793
Does he even know what "ace" means?

673
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:05,711
Do you? How do you spell it?

674
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,797
- A.
- Yes.

675
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:08,965
S?

676
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:12,426
Home run.

677
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,767
Who are they?
They don't look like our guys.

678
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:24,480
They're making me feel uncomfortable.

679
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:28,651
Two, four, six, eight.
Hey, you said there were three or four.

680
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:30,528
Did you mean three or four per group?

681
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:32,196
Red, yellow, green, blue.

682
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:33,447
Is this an arts festival?

683
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,908
How many are they?

684
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,954
Just watch out for the one with the knife.
He seems to be the strongest.

685
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:42,957
It's going to be a hassle to summon them.

686
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,669
Let's do this quickly
so that we can go have some noodles.

687
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:47,753
Sounds good.

688
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:57,555
It's okay.

689
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:58,848
All right.

690
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:05,813
My God.

691
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:08,024
Are you putting on a show?

692
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,942
- Gosh.
- That's enough.

693
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:14,030
All right, Jeok-bong the Ace.

694
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,073
I believe in your potential, okay?

695
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:17,908
Let's go.

696
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:20,578
Hey!

697
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:30,713
The territory.

698
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:34,508
Isn't this the territory? I did it.

699
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,761
I just summoned the territory, right?

700
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,054
It wasn't you.

701
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:39,513
What?

702
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,932
How have you all been doing?

703
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:42,850
Mun.

704
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:46,771
- You knew about our dress code?
- This is what I wore at the airport.

705
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:50,733
You look very handsome.
You have the hairstyle of an idol.

706
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:56,822
Welcome back, Mr. Original Ace.
I'll gladly give back the ace position.

707
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,324
- Well done.
- Hey.

708
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,367
You appeared just now on purpose, right?

709
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:03,287
It's because he still thinks
he's the main character here.

710
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:04,955
I'm glad you're here.

711
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,416
All right then.

712
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,044
Shall we begin?

713
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,406
CHU MAE-OK

714
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:45,246
I want to live in a world
without any evil spirits.

715
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:46,831
You scumbag.

716
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,252
Was I not using psychokinesis?

717
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,982
GA MO-TAK

718
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,168
DO HA-NA

719
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,347
And it's moving!

720
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:46,557
To the east!

721
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,985
NA JEOK-BONG

722
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:24,511
SO MUN

723
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:27,181
- Are we done here?
- Nice job, Mr. Ace.

724
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:29,016
Come on. It was nothing.

725
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,518
He's so handsome.

726
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:34,063
