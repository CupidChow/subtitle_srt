1
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,760
That is Miss Pudtarn.

2
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,080
Is she a vendor?

3
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,440
The silver barb is our local fish.

4
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,680
Can't you sell it?

5
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
No.

6
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,000
He has gone mad.

7
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,040
Someone is trying to slander the king.

8
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,160
If I am to become the king of Ayutthaya,

9
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,240
it shall be because I hold both the status

10
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,000
and the legitimate right to do so.

11
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,440
Please accept that

12
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,000
Rid doesn't have feelings for you,

13
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,320
not even in the slightest.

14
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,240
I'm going to Pudtarn's house.

15
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,440
What?

16
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,040
You are a commoner.

17
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,400
I must reiterate this,

18
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,040
for you would not recognize yourself
and understand your place.

19
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,400
Wherever you came from, go back there.

20
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,840
What is this?

21
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,120
You are behaving audaciously.

22
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you hear me?

23
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,880
Eung,

24
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,200
go away.

25
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,400
Leave now.

26
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,400
You as well, Perm.

27
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,120
Do not show your faces here.

28
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,520
Leave here

29
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,720
or I shall evict Gui from my orchard.

30
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,200
You two shall have
no roof over your heads.

31
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,880
I am free.
I am no longer Madam Gui's servant.

32
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
Eung! How audacious of you.

33
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,080
Do you think
there is nothing I can do to you?

34
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,160
Please stop.

35
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,280
Stop flaunting your power.

36
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,160
We're all human.

37
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,200
You are of high status.

38
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,640
Have some compassion
for the less privileged.

39
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,280
Yaem, what shall we do?

40
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,760
I see.

41
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't know.

42
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,360
You wretch. Why did you say, "I see"?

43
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,000
Prik.

44
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,040
Yes, my lady.

45
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,520
Tell this commoner
not to act so brazenly with me again.

46
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,520
Yes, my lady.

47
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,400
Do not

48
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,360
be brazen.

49
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,920
Prik,

50
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,200
why are you whispering?

51
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,720
Do not be so brazen!

52
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,440
Come here.

53
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,080
I shall slap you until I am satisfied!

54
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,320
My lady.

55
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,320
Prik.

56
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,960
I wish you to always be mindful.

57
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
No matter what happens,

58
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,160
always be mindful.

59
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,360
No matter how bad things are,

60
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,200
so long as you are mindful,

61
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,600
you will be able to handle things wisely.

62
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,120
I will leave this place.

63
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,240
I will return to my home,

64
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,920
as you wish.

65
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,960
Atitaya,

66
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,960
it is time.

67
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,800
Let us go, Eung.

68
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
What?

69
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,640
Eung.

70
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,720
Yes, miss?

71
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,799
Do you feel hot? I feel hot.

72
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,360
I feel hot all over my body.

73
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,840
Gosh.

74
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,159
I do not feel hot.

75
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,760
I do not feel hot.

76
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,760
Gosh.

77
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,520
Get me water. I want some water.

78
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,920
-To cool off.
-Yes, miss.

79
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,400
Gosh.

80
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,800
What's going on?

81
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,720
Here is your water.

82
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,280
Eung, I had a very strange dream.

83
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,640
I saw everything that happened today,

84
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,560
particularly when Lady Champa came here.

85
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,120
It makes me uncertain
if it really happened.

86
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,120
Everything was there in my dream,

87
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,320
except

88
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,880
I saw this person.

89
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,800
Miss, it's the golden light.

90
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,760
The golden light.

91
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,800
The golden light
from the baron's residence.

92
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,880
The Krishna Kali Manuscript.

93
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,400
Why?

94
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,920
It is time.

95
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,080
It is time, Eung.

96
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,200
The person in my dream told me that.

97
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,160
Why do I feel hot? My gosh.

98
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,040
I feel hot like I'm on fire.

99
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,040
Miss.

100
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,520
Help me!

101
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,600
Perm!

102
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,440
-Perm!
-What is it, Eung?

103
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,200
Something happened to Miss Pudtarn.

104
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
She says she feels hot.

105
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
She feels hot?

106
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,040
Perm, what shall we do?

107
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,520
What is it, Perm?

108
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,840
Why are you here so early?

109
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,280
Our mistress said to bring the manuscript
or she might die.

110
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,320
Eung!

111
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,040
Eung!

112
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,040
Baron.

113
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,560
-Baron.
-Pudtarn.

114
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,480
Let me touch it.

115
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,840
No.

116
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,320
If you touch it, you could disappear.

117
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,840
If I don't touch it, I might die.

118
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,600
I feel so hot
that I can't bear it anymore.

119
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,160
Please let me touch the manuscript.

120
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,160
Please let me touch the manuscript.

121
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,920
Please.

122
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,000
Baron, let me touch the manuscript.

123
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,200
Let me touch it.

124
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,920
Please.

125
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,880
Pudtarn.

126
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Where are we?

127
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,160
Who are you?

128
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,400
I am the one who created
Krishna Kali Manuscript.

129
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,680
You created the Krishna Kali Manuscript?

130
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,120
Is this heaven?

131
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,440
This is a place
between heaven and the human realm.

132
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,760
Why am I here?

133
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,080
I brought you here.

134
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,720
You brought me here?

135
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,800
How?

136
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,560
Did I die?

137
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,360
Am I a spirit now?

138
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,040
You are still human.

139
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,640
Your soul traveled here.

140
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,880
My soul?

141
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,840
Why can I still feel my body?

142
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,080
Pudtarn,

143
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,120
must you keep asking him?

144
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,760
He is about to tell you.

145
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,960
You remain the same
across every life and every realm.

146
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,320
You are strong, steadfast,

147
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,280
and unwavering,

148
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,840
but you are curious.

149
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,440
You do not let anything
escape your eyes and mind.

150
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,680
Come.

151
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,200
I shall show you

152
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,160
why I brought you here.

153
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,280
Yes, my lord. I am ready to hear it.

154
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,800
Let us step back in time from your era
by a thousand years.

155
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,480
A thousand years?

156
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,120
A thousand years ago, in this city.

157
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,200
In this city, there occurred
an intricate tale woven with love,

158
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,120
hatred,

159
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,560
revenge,

160
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,760
sorrow, and death.

161
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,440
Listen to me.

162
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,600
I shall reveal it to you now.

163
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,920
Princess Atitaya was in love
with a commander named Anilabod.

164
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,960
ANILABOD ATITAYA

165
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,160
For that reason,
she would not marry Tikumbhorn,

166
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,640
the king of another city.

167
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,120
She repeatedly begged Anilabod
to run away with her.

168
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,360
I shall not marry.

169
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,920
That is impossible.

170
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,520
Take me as far away as possible.

171
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,240
That is a dream, not a real possibility.

172
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,840
Dream with me.

173
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,120
Anilabod was unwilling.

174
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,600
He was well aware that the marriage

175
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,800
would make the two cities strong allies,
capable of defending against any attack.

176
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,960
Eventually,

177
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,760
Atitaya married Tikumbhorn Racha.

178
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,040
TIKUMBHORN RACHA

179
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,280
Subsequently, she became pregnant.

180
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,120
Tikumbhorn Racha
brought his former lover Jantravadee

181
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,440
to be an additional consort.

182
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,760
Atitaya became resentful,

183
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,200
to the extent that
she committed grave sins,

184
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,960
and the ramifications of these sins
have reached across many generations.

185
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,120
I did not betray you, Atitaya.

186
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,480
It is you who neglected me.

187
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,040
I married you, did I not?

188
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,600
How should I regard someone
who will never look me in the eye?

189
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,680
Anyone who loves me,

190
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,080
I shall love in return.

191
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,600
Queen Atitaya.

192
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,000
Queen Atitaya.

193
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,160
Queen Atitaya.

194
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,600
Queen Atitaya.

195
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,200
Atitaya unknowingly gave birth
to stillborn twins.

196
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,840
Her two nursemaids, fearing
they would be blamed for their neglect

197
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,840
and the resulting death of the heirs,
devised an evil scheme.

198
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,280
What shall we do?

199
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,120
Both heirs died.

200
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,360
If Tikumbhorn Racha hears of this,
the two of us…

201
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,960
We must find someone to take the blame.

202
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,480
Is that…

203
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,960
You dropped the heirs!

204
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,320
You intentionally killed the heirs!

205
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,120
You lowly maids,
how dare you commit such an evil act?

206
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,240
My queen was wronged first.

207
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,680
We merely responded.

208
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,040
How is this wrong?

209
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,320
Consort Jantravadee killed the heirs!

210
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,520
Jantravadee was accused of the grave crime

211
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,320
of causing the heirs' deaths.

212
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,280
Being vengeful towards
Jantravadee for killing her children,

213
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,880
Queen Atitaya ordered Anilabod
to kill Jantravadee.

214
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,080
Kill them all.

215
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,960
It is a grave sin.

216
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Kill them.

217
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,680
Jantravadee escaped
across the border to her kingdom.

218
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,840
Jantravadee, who had committed a grave sin
by engaging in adultery

219
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,040
and consorting with another's spouse,

220
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,440
decided to take an action
that further extended her path of sin

221
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,080
by ordering her soldiers

222
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,520
to engage in battle
with Anilabod's soldiers.

223
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,760
Fight to the last drop of your blood,
my soldiers.

224
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,320
At this time,

225
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,680
the two kingdoms,
which had long been allies,

226
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,920
experienced their downfall amidst
the deaths of soldiers and villagers.

227
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,720
Thousands, ten-thousands of lives
for but two lives.

228
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,360
Was it worth it?

229
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,160
Have you ever thought with your heart?

230
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,960
No number of deaths

231
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,160
can make up for the lives of my children.

232
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,880
May you find your place
in the realm of hell, Atitaya.

233
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,160
That is why I needed to find a way
to help atone for…

234
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,240
your sins.

235
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,240
Mine?

236
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,600
Yes.

237
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,280
I must help you because you were Atitaya.

238
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,240
I was

239
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,800
Atitaya?

240
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,040
Atitaya, the daughter of King Suriya.

241
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,840
I was King Suriya.

242
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,280
You were my daughter.

243
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,800
I was Atitaya,

244
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,800
your daughter?

245
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,080
Atitaya,

246
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,680
I extend my congratulations…

247
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,400
before I embark on a life in the monkhood.

248
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,480
I, at that time,

249
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,680
decided to renounce everything
in favor of ordination as Atitaya married.

250
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,520
Atitaya,

251
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,360
may you use the Dharma principles
to govern the land peacefully

252
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,920
in my stead.

253
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,000
At a later time, when I learned of Atitaya
committing grievous sins,

254
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,360
I conceived of a spell
to punish the wrongdoers.

255
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,520
At the same time,

256
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,800
this spell was also to allow them
to make amends.

257
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,280
Suffering as a result of the spell

258
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,840
simultaneously helps
to diminish their sins.

259
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,680
And that spell is

260
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,960
the Krishna Kali spell.

261
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,320
What was my punishment?

262
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,840
You went to hell.

263
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,240
That's reasonable.
I committed such terrible sins.

264
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,920
Without going to hell, how could I
ever make amends for these sins?

265
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,280
That life was that life.

266
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,480
This life is this life.

267
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,440
Try to view it as an observer.

268
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,800
The Krishna Kali spell transcends time

269
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,360
but not sins.

270
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,560
Whatever one has done, they must face
the deserving consequences.

271
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,880
Since you know you have done wrong

272
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,760
and feel remorse,

273
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,400
then strive to start anew.

274
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Do not let emotions overcome reason
or awareness of right or wrong.

275
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,880
Now, due to Phra Rueangrit's wish
to help the woman he loves

276
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,200
and the merit Ketsurang
has extended to your spirit,

277
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,360
you have been freed of the hell realm

278
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,160
and reborn into the body of Pudtarn,

279
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,440
whose merit was depleted
over ten years ago

280
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,640
in the time you came from.

281
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,840
Atitaya,

282
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,800
Karaked,

283
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,440
and those two maids are joined in this,

284
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,800
Pin and Yaem.

285
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,960
However many thousands of years it takes,
their duty is to serve you

286
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,400
and Ketsurang

287
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,560
until the fragments
of your mutual sins are resolved.

288
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,800
Why have I become aware of this truth?

289
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,320
Why Ayutthaya?

290
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,400
This lifetime is the last opportunity
for you and Ketsurang

291
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,760
to cleanse the sins you share.

292
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,120
When the power of the Krishna Kali spell

293
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,680
combines with the virtuous power
of Phra Rueangrit,

294
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,280
who is the future incarnation
of Marquess Wisut Sakorn,

295
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,520
this strange phenomenon occurs.

296
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,040
As your father,

297
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,520
l could not ignore it.

298
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,560
I must also face
the consequences of my actions.

299
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,800
So Marquess Wisut Sakorn
and Phra Rueangrit are the same person.

300
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,880
He seems suspicious of me,
but Phra Rueangrit was very kind to me.

301
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,280
When you find out
what you used to do, who you used to be,

302
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,160
it is no fun.

303
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,760
It's a good thing that humans forget
their past lives when they are reborn.

304
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,120
They might forget everything,
but their sins are not erased.

305
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,240
That's true.

306
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,760
What now?

307
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,200
Am I not dead yet?

308
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,640
You're not.

309
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,560
But you must choose

310
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,240
whether to return to your present life

311
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,280
with your aunt

312
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,320
or to Ayutthaya.

313
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,120
Once you choose,

314
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,880
the Krishna Kali Manuscript shall vanish
from the three realms forever

315
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,880
and the temporal path
shall partially restart anew.

316
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,120
Hurry and make up your mind.

317
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,040
I have to choose between my aunt
and the person I love.

318
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,480
That's cruel.

319
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,080
That man

320
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,360
is Anilabod.

321
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
No wonder.

322
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,920
No wonder what?

323
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,080
Is that true?

324
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,680
I cannot lie.

325
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,440
No wonder what?

326
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,720
Pudtarn, no wonder what?

327
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,000
No wonder what?

328
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,000
Well…

329
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,560
No wonder he's always there,
following me around.

330
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,480
Have we loved each other for 1,000 years?

331
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,480
But it's quite upsetting.

332
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,920
If he had chosen to help Atitaya escape,

333
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,160
they could have had a happy ending.

334
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,640
You must hurry and choose where to return.

335
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,240
Is it really that urgent?

336
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,360
In coming to your aid,

337
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,600
I have experienced
a sorrowful premonition.

338
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,880
I must soon pass on to another realm.

339
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,160
After that,

340
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,000
it is up to destiny

341
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,600
whether we shall meet again.

342
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,040
For that reason,
you must hurry and decide.

343
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,480
It is my last intervention
in the passage of time

344
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,440
before I must leave.

345
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,560
Are they dead, Perm?

346
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,080
Eung, do not speak ill.

347
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,760
They are only unconscious.

348
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,080
My gosh!

349
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,480
Pudtarn.

350
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,320
Pudtarn.

351
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,120
Pudtarn, please wake up.

352
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,280
Pudtarn.

353
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,600
Pudtarn.

354
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,040
Have you chosen?

355
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,240
Pudtarn.

356
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,120
Have you made a decision?

357
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,960
I'm worried about my aunt.
She must still be waiting for me.

358
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,240
Is that woman your aunt?

359
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,560
She raised me.

360
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:14,679
If you choose
to remain in the Ayutthaya period,

361
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,800
I shall make everyone in the present time

362
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,199
forget that you grew up there.

363
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,199
They shall only be aware that

364
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,360
the little girl, Pudtarn,
died alongside her father and mother

365
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,520
when she was eight.

366
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,240
MHEE

367
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,520
What is it, Mhee?

368
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,960
Yes, I remember.

369
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,640
Today is the one-year anniversary
of Pudtarn's disappearance.

370
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,000
You're heading to Ayutthaya?

371
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,000
Will it really work?

372
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,920
I'll join you.

373
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,640
What do we need to take
to offer to the land spirits?

374
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,680
Okay, I'll prepare what we need.

375
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,040
Okay, goodbye.

376
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,720
I shall make them believe that

377
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,040
the little girl, Pudtarn,

378
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,200
died when she was eight in a car accident
alongside her father and mother.

379
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,400
What is it, Mhee?

380
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,800
I was just about to call you.

381
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,840
I will join the tour to Ayutthaya
if you're going by boat.

382
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,800
But if you're driving, I won't go.

383
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,080
My sister was in a car accident.

384
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,600
Her entire family passed away.

385
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,480
At that time, my niece was only eight.
She was adorable and she lost her life.

386
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,080
I still haven't come to terms with it.

387
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Goodbye.

388
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,960
Lady Champa,
you are older than I expected.

389
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,160
When will I get to sleep with Dech?

390
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,800
I hate her.

391
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,720
Filthy animal excrement
does not repulse me as much as her body.

392
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,560
No number of deaths

393
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,800
can make up for the lives of my children.

394
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,400
May you find your place
in the realm of hell, Atitaya.

395
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,000
I ask for your forgiveness.

396
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,280
Whatever wrong
I may have done to you in that life,

397
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,040
please forgive me.

398
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,880
I forgive you.

399
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,320
May you be freed
from the bonds of your sins.

400
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,120
You have justly atoned
in the realm of hell.

401
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,240
Goodbye, Your Holiness.

402
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,400
Pudtarn.

403
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,080
Pudtarn.

404
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,120
Rid.

405
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,360
Mother.

406
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,000
Pudtarn must choose whether to return here

407
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,440
or go back to where she came from.

408
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,480
Hold on. Why must she choose?
What happened?

409
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,440
Eung mentioned

410
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,400
that she saw the golden light
from our residence.

411
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,120
After that, you both lost consciousness.

412
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,080
Why is it only you who has woken up?

413
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,800
Why has Pudtarn not woken yet?

414
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,600
Pudtarn and I

415
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,280
drifted as souls

416
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,360
to a place.

417
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,080
We met Master Chi Pa Khao

418
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,400
who instructed Pudtarn to choose

419
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,840
between returning to her original time

420
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,000
or remaining here.

421
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,680
Master Chi Pa Khao said that

422
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,400
he created the Krishna Kali spell
around 1,000 years ago

423
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,440
and that Pudtarn

424
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,120
carries sins linked to the spell,

425
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,600
leading her to travel across time to here.

426
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,880
Pudtarn is breathing normally.

427
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,960
Wait for her to wake up on her own,
as I did that time.

428
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,680
I suspect that

429
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,760
Master Chi Pa Khao that our son met

430
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,520
might be the same one we met.

431
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,640
It is possible.

432
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,280
If she chooses to return to her time,

433
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,840
what will happen to her body?

434
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,160
Will it remain here?

435
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,520
Even if

436
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,560
she does not need me,

437
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,960
I need to be with her.

438
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,920
You came at the right time, In.

439
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,760
Please listen to me.

440
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,720
Tell me what is troubling you.

441
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,840
If I can help you in any way,
I will do so wholeheartedly.

442
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,320
Thank you.

443
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,960
You are always kind.

444
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,880
In.

445
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,880
In!

446
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,800
Prang.

447
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,000
You were so loud that it startled me.

448
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,840
Where did your mind go?
I said your name repeatedly.

449
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,360
It was just around here.

450
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,760
It did not go far.

451
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,120
Did you come to see Rid?

452
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,760
Yes.

453
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,280
My father has some tasks to give to Rid.

454
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,200
He has not come by yet,

455
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,360
so I volunteered to find him.

456
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,120
Is he still home? His boat is here.

457
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,160
Yes.

458
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,560
Rid brought Pudtarn here,

459
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,920
but she was unconscious.

460
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,280
Unconscious?

461
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,640
Yes, unconscious.

462
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,200
Kheow.

463
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,360
Yes, my lady.

464
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,000
Has Pudtarn woken up?

465
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,280
Did you see?

466
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,720
She has not.

467
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,360
The marquess and the lady are waiting.

468
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,400
You may need to wait for Rid

469
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,320
because he will not leave
until Pudtarn wakes up.

470
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,240
Prang.

471
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,440
Yes?

472
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,000
Do you see the trouble that lies ahead?

473
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,760
I do.

474
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,520
It is frightening.

475
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,200
Why is it frightening?

476
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,640
Rid would not dare to defy the king.

477
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,720
That is true.

478
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,560
Neither Rid nor anyone in Ayutthaya
would dare to.

479
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,680
But it is not the case for Pudtarn.

480
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,880
Pudtarn came from elsewhere.

481
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,320
That is true.

482
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,960
Pudtarn is not like us.

483
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,560
I truly would like to know

484
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,880
what she will do.

485
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,360
If I choose to stay in Ayutthaya…

486
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,720
You saw what would become of your aunt.

487
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,040
I showed you the vision.

488
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,040
She shall only be aware
that you died when you were eight.

489
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,640
As for Baron Maharit--

490
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,560
What will happen to him
if I choose to leave?

491
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,240
What will happen to him?

492
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,280
I can't lose her.

493
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,920
Father, Mother,

494
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,160
the first day I saw her,

495
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,240
I felt like something

496
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,560
happened to my heart.

497
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,480
It has always been here.

498
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,760
It has never gone away.

499
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,320
My heart

500
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,640
is entwined with the way she is,

501
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,280
what she does, and what she says.

502
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,960
Now,

503
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,320
I realize

504
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,200
there is a reason behind everything.

505
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,760
My dear Rid.

506
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,840
What is the reason, Rid?

507
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,760
It is…

508
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,080
the love I discarded.

509
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,120
Because

510
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,800
I let go of her hand back then,

511
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,640
it caused me
to lose her in every lifetime.

512
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,680
I only hope that

513
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,120
in…

514
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,920
this lifetime…

515
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,880
In this lifetime,

516
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,600
it…

517
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,200
Do I really have to choose?

518
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,640
Can I not choose?

519
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,240
Will you return to your origin?

520
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,640
I was told to leave.

521
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,560
Those who told you to leave

522
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,840
are not more significant
than the reason you came.

523
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,000
But…

524
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,400
it's between the person I'm indebted to

525
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,840
and the man I love.

526
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,240
Atitaya,

527
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,200
your love holds greater significance
than anything else.

528
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,800
There exists no force more powerful.

529
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,280
Prang,

530
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,600
do not be sad.

531
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,760
I do not know why,

532
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,960
but Father, Mother,

533
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,120
and Rid all seem to be suffering.

534
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,040
I have never seen
Mother and Rid cry before.

535
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,760
You are still very young.

536
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,440
You cannot help them.

537
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,880
Let your father and mother

538
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,720
resolve the cause of Rid's sadness.

539
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,360
But I--

540
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,000
Fathers and mothers

541
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,880
should be the ones
to wipe away their children's tears.

542
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,400
Even if they are crying themselves.

543
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,400
Baron.

544
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,840
Sleepyhead, I am back.

545
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,160
Pudtarn.

546
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,880
Pudtarn, are you awake?

547
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,160
Is this your bedroom?

548
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,280
How did I get here?

549
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,680
Please do not go anywhere again.

550
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,480
Stay here with me.

551
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,000
Please stay here with me.

552
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,320
You're holding me too tight.
I can't breathe.

553
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,000
I haven't gone anywhere.

554
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:05,240
I was afraid you would choose
to return to the other time.

555
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,240
Though your body remained here,

556
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,280
the Krishna Kali Manuscript
has already disappeared.

557
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,240
How did you know I had to choose?

558
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,440
When you

559
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,920
drifted to the place
between heaven and the human realm,

560
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,800
I drifted with you.

561
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,280
That is how I learned
everything you learned.

562
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,720
Really?

563
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,120
Did you come with me?
Why didn't I see you?

564
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,920
I was truly there,

565
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,040
but it was like
I did not exist in that place.

566
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,960
I knew that you had to choose,

567
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,200
but before you could choose,

568
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,360
your father sent me back.

569
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,680
I was so afraid

570
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,920
that you would choose to leave me.

571
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,800
I know now

572
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,120
what I must choose.

573
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,280
I choose to return to Ayutthaya.

574
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,880
Remember that

575
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,520
returning to Ayutthaya
does not guarantee comfort.

576
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,880
Those whom you have wronged in your past

577
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,880
are still waiting to scorn you.

578
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,760
That's fine.

579
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,880
I have caused them so much suffering.

580
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,720
No matter the retribution,
I will accept it

581
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,960
in order to repay those I have wronged.

582
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,120
Good.

583
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,400
You truly are my daughter.

584
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,960
Remember that

585
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,720
everything is just an illusion.

586
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,200
Do not hold onto it too tightly.

587
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,120
One day, if you can
approach life with wisdom,

588
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,680
you will realize that

589
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,360
everything is merely
a perception of the mind,

590
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,840
lacking real substance.

591
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,560
That is all I can help you with.

592
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:08,600
From now on,
as the past sins loosen their grip,

593
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,600
it is up to you to decide how you act,

594
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,480
whether towards the righteous path
or the dark one.

595
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,560
Nothing can dictate your life

596
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,000
except for your own choices and actions.

597
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,960
Until you are truly liberated,

598
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,280
every hatred and every love

599
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,560
shall come back around in due course.

600
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,560
Remember this, my child.

601
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,480
Where else could I go?

602
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,200
It took us 1,000 years to find each other.

603
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,840
My father from 1,000 years ago
wouldn't have allowed me.

604
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,600
Letting go of your hand back then

605
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,560
was a grave mistake,

606
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,040
a sin of cowardice,

607
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,640
and a faltering of my love.

608
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,200
That is why I have suffered

609
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,760
from our long separation
across many lifetimes.

610
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,600
From now on, never leave me again.

611
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,160
Pudtarn,

612
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,960
is there something else on your mind?

613
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,600
Khun Pi,

614
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,320
yesterday, before leaving
for Dusit Temple,

615
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,680
Lady Champa went to see Pudtarn.

616
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,200
Pin and Yaem, whom I asked to follow her,
told me that…

617
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,640
You are a commoner.

618
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,240
I must reiterate this,

619
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,880
for you would not recognize yourself
and understand your place.

620
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,880
Wherever you came from, go back there.

621
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,560
Do not worry about my mother.

622
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,280
Your mind may be at ease, Pudtarn.

623
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,440
Do not be afraid, Rid.

624
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,400
I am right behind you on this.

625
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,640
So are you not on my side, Prang?

626
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,760
What?

627
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,080
Are you two not on the same side?

628
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,440
How could we be?

629
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,120
The king made sure we're not.

630
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,400
It is not just Grandmother.

631
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,720
No, don't look so sad.

632
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,960
Goodness, Pudtarn.

633
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:07,880
It is a considerable problem.
Do you expect Rid to still smile?

634
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,280
Destiny.

635
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,000
In,

636
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,120
I am sorry.

637
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,240
It is not that I have anything
against your sister.

638
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,280
Do not worry about me.

639
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,200
As for Praejeen,
you need not worry either.

640
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,960
Marquess Kosathibodi's son and daughter
will not suffer long.

641
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:48,520
It is well understood that each person

642
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,000
owns their own heart.

643
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,400
What a killer line.

644
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,840
Kill what, Prang?

645
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,760
A killer line.

646
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,440
What is it, Prang?

647
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,840
That is all I know.

648
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,800
But Mother once said that

649
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,040
when someone says
something that is spot-on,

650
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,840
it is called a killer line.

651
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,480
Spot-on?

652
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,440
Yes, spot-on.

653
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,760
What you said is spot-on.

654
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,640
I will never keep up with you.

655
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,880
But…

656
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,840
I would like to try.

657
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,120
I'll try until I can.

658
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,360
The sky is so pretty in Ayutthaya.

659
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,600
Where you used to live,

660
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,960
how was the sky?

661
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,440
Was it not the same as here?

662
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,120
The sky was dirty.

663
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,040
What did you say?

664
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,440
You heard me right. Why do you ask?

665
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,000
I heard, but I cannot believe I heard it.

666
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,440
Believe it. I really did say that.

667
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,560
If you truly said that,

668
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,080
I shall try to forget now

669
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,000
what I heard you say.

670
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,440
Very well. You can forget it now.

671
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,440
How can I forget

672
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,200
those strange words?

673
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,960
That's fine.
You'll forget them when you get old.

674
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,760
There was no intro.

675
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,720
I am overjoyed.

676
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,640
I'm grateful that destiny

677
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,440
sent you to me.

678
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:38,160
Above destiny is the king.

679
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,560
I believe that

680
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,160
destiny is above the king.

681
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,840
In time, we shall see.

682
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,240
And your grandmother too.

683
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,960
She is no big deal.

684
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,000
You know that phrase?

685
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,800
My mother says it often.

686
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,720
She is the one

687
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,080
who often makes everything
seem as if it is no big deal.

688
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,760
My lady.

689
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,960
Slowly, my lady.

690
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,400
Lady Champa,
I have an important matter to discuss.

691
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,120
I have just arrived.

692
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,160
Will you not allow me
some rest first, Karaked?

693
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:19,280
It is important and will not take long.
It will take just a moment.

694
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,000
Very well, speak now.

695
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,120
-Oh, dear!
-Oh, dear!

696
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,000
What is this, Karaked?

697
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,440
Well?

698
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,840
Lady Champa,

699
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,840
you love your son,

700
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,800
that is why you allowed him to marry me.

701
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,560
Isn't that so?

702
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,280
Goodness.

703
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,720
Why ask such a question?

704
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,440
How could it be otherwise?

705
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,360
I love Rid

706
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,080
just as you love your son.

707
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,080
Mother,

708
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,120
I have been happy

709
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,080
ever since the day I married Karaked.

710
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,080
From that day until now,

711
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,840
I have not suffered in the slightest.

712
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:27,279
What do you intend to do
regarding the king then?

713
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,120
I shall bring a woman in as a concubine.

714
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,359
Her name is Pudtarn,

715
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:07,760
a commoner under the authority
of Marquess Wisut Sakorn.

716
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,279
If you don't want to lose me to the king,

717
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:12,080
then you must be brave.

718
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:15,200
Inform him that I'm your girlfriend.

719
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,560
Who will be escorting me again?

720
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,680
Viscount Pipatrachasin.

721
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,359
I will sell every one of you.

722
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,160
Take them to the boat.

723
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,120
-Help!
-Klin!

724
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,520
-Help!
-Klin!

725
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,400
