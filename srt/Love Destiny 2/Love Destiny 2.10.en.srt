1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,280
How could it be gone?

2
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,880
Tell me that you took it!

3
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
I have already sold it.

4
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,280
I will punish her myself.

5
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,840
You deranged woman! You witch!

6
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,680
Please, Grandmother.

7
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,480
Gui, that's enough.

8
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,840
Consider this a punishment

9
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,000
for making me lose the one thing I had
to remember my parents by.

10
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,440
Are you Kam? You were married to Eung.

11
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,400
My grandmother gave Eung to that woman.

12
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,920
She wants her to take a new husband.

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,440
You must nip it in the bud, Kam.

14
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,960
Pudtarn is the key.

15
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,840
It's only because
she resembles Mother that I like her.

16
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,560
No, I do not like her.

17
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,040
What don't you like, Baron?

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,560
Do you have an aunt named Vipavee?

19
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,720
That's right.

20
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,320
We are related.

21
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,920
I feel very lucky to have met you,
as you came here before me.

22
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,120
How have you managed to live here alone,

23
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,840
in this place, among these people?

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
I really respect you for this.

25
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,720
Because I found love.

26
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,840
Love?

27
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
That's right.

28
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,120
It's the only thing that has sustained me
both mentally and physically,

29
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,880
allowing me to live here…

30
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,480
happily.

31
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,800
I have the love of my children

32
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,600
and their father.

33
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,320
That will never happen to me.

34
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,160
I don't believe in love.

35
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,720
Why not?

36
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,760
Have you been disappointed by love before?

37
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,839
My poor Pudtarn.

38
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,080
I have never loved anyone.

39
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,800
I've never thought of doing so either.

40
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,080
Maybe love has left me
disappointed in the past.

41
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,120
Not in this life but in a previous one.

42
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,400
Maybe that's why I'm scared
of being let down by love.

43
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,560
That's why I decided not to fall in love.

44
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,000
Where there is love, there is sadness.

45
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,280
But love is something
that sustains our hearts.

46
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,680
It's true that where there is love,
there is sadness.

47
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,240
But there is also happiness.

48
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,480
Maybe even more so than sadness.

49
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,400
My lady.

50
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,800
My lady.

51
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,360
-My lady.
-Yaem.

52
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,360
What's wrong?
Why are you making such a racket?

53
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,840
My lady.

54
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,040
Yaem.

55
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,960
Lady Praejeen came to see you.

56
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,920
What for?

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,920
She said she has come
to learn how to cook.

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What? Really?

59
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,160
She made the trip in vain then.

60
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,040
It's all right, my lady.

61
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,880
Lord Rid is conversing with her.

62
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,560
It seems he rushed home.

63
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,240
Perhaps they arranged this meeting.

64
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,680
Yaem.

65
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,240
When could they have done that?
Your lord goes to the palace every day.

66
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,280
-Oh, dear.
-Oh, dear.

67
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,400
They could have done it
through her brother, my lady.

68
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,080
Lord In is also
one of His Majesty's royal pages.

69
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,360
That's right, my lady.

70
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,640
Lady Pong seems enamored by you.

71
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,560
She must be dying
to join your two families together.

72
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,040
Hey, I know now
why Baron Maharit rushed home.

73
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,520
He had a visitor.

74
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,160
Her name is Lady Praejeen.

75
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,600
They are going to get married.

76
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,640
How about that? Am I good?

77
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,440
No?

78
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,560
Regarding Lady Praejeen being
Her Ladyship's future daughter-in-law,

79
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,920
everyone knows it, miss.

80
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,360
Really?

81
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,720
Everyone knows that?

82
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,200
Lady Pong has been visiting
Lady Karaked for some time now.

83
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,600
Ever since

84
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,960
Lady Praejeen was still a little girl,
I believe.

85
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,280
Who is Lady Pong?

86
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
The mother of Lady Praejeen, miss.

87
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,920
I see.

88
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,320
No wonder he rushed home.

89
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,920
I will come early tomorrow.

90
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,680
It's such a pity
you were not able to learn anything today.

91
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,080
Yes.

92
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,840
You didn't give us an advance warning,

93
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,600
so your teacher has gone out.

94
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,960
-Prik.
-Yes, my lady.

95
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Your lady, where did she go?

96
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,800
I don't know, my lady.

97
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,200
So why did you make that sound?

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I was thinking, my lady.

99
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,400
About what?

100
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,720
About whether I knew or not, my lady.

101
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,720
He's waiting for you.

102
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,400
Why don't you converse with him?

103
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,720
Yes, Lady Champa.

104
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,360
My lady.

105
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,400
-Why--
-Didn't you see

106
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,960
that Praejeen
was looking in Rid's direction?

107
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,120
She didn't wish to converse with me.

108
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,640
That's why
we should have taught her a lesson.

109
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,880
So she remembers.

110
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,000
She has only just come of age,
but she already acts this way.

111
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,240
What way?

112
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,160
Continue gossiping about her

113
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,920
so your mouth will stop itching.

114
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,200
I'm not gossiping about her, my lady.
I'm telling the truth.

115
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,240
What will you learn with my mother?

116
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,280
I don't know yet.

117
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,400
What? Do you not intend to learn?

118
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,400
I really do.

119
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,200
So why don't you know
what you shall learn then?

120
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,120
I shall let her decide.

121
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,840
But I really do intend to learn, Rid.

122
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,400
I believe you.

123
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,920
You must believe me.

124
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,320
Is that so? Why?

125
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,960
Because I'm not lying.

126
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,760
You really have a way with words.

127
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,080
I enjoy conversing with you.

128
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,680
Thank you.

129
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,400
Listen,

130
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,640
my mother's cuisine

131
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,160
both looks and tastes incredible.

132
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,840
She can teach you.

133
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,520
Cuisine?

134
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,440
That's the style of food,

135
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,280
such as pork barbecue.

136
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,200
I have eaten it often.
We use the grill pan In got from you.

137
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,920
That's it.

138
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,880
Have you ever met Lady Praejeen, Eung?

139
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,560
Have you, Eung?

140
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,440
No, miss.

141
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,000
What about you, Perm?

142
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
I have, miss.

143
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
What is she like?

144
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,800
What do you mean, miss?

145
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,480
Perm, she's asking
if Lady Praejeen is beautiful.

146
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,680
Just answer her.

147
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,160
She asked what she's like,
not whether she's beautiful.

148
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,280
It means the same thing.

149
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,800
Am I right, miss?

150
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,200
That's not true, Eung.

151
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,200
Did you really listen to what she said?

152
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,800
I didn't only listen,
but I also thought about it.

153
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
Hey.

154
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,200
How should I answer her?

155
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,840
Is she beautiful?

156
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,440
She is, miss.

157
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,560
She's beautiful?

158
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,000
How?

159
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,560
He won't be able to describe
Lady Praejeen's beauty, miss.

160
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,960
I bid you goodbye for today.

161
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,920
I shall return in two days
to learn with you.

162
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,760
I shall escort you out.

163
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,160
-Let's go.
-Okay.

164
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,160
Pin, Yaem.

165
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,080
Where has Mother been?

166
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,520
The house…

167
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,200
Madam Gui's residence, my lord.

168
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,600
Where else has she been
besides Gui's residence?

169
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,480
Where?

170
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,080
Her Ladyship told us
not to tell you, my lord.

171
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,320
I know now.

172
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,480
She told you not to tell me that

173
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,080
she went to Pudtarn's house. Am I correct?

174
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,960
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

175
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,160
Khun Pi, have a snack.

176
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,800
Let me feed you.

177
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,080
Mother, Father.

178
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,240
I have something to tell you.

179
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,160
A few days ago,

180
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,800
a strange incident occurred.

181
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,040
I saw a golden light

182
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,560
near the bend in the river
in Gui's orchard,

183
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,280
so I dug up the area
where the light originated

184
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,040
and found a chest containing
the Krishna Kali Manuscript.

185
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,080
And when I touched the manuscript,

186
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,560
the sky darkened
as if the sun had been extinguished.

187
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,360
A few moments later,

188
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,880
when the light returned…

189
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,480
a lady

190
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,640
appeared out of thin air.

191
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,640
Her name is Pudtarn.

192
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,240
Gui said she is related to her.

193
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,480
However,

194
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,280
the important thing I wanted to tell you,

195
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,480
especially you, Mother, is that…

196
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,000
her appearance

197
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,800
and her manner of talking
are very similar to yours, Mother.

198
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,960
What did you say?

199
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,040
She resembles Mother.

200
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,720
But…

201
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,080
her personality

202
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
isn't like that of Mother at all.

203
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,160
In what way, Rid?

204
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,560
She doesn't care about visiting places.

205
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,839
What?

206
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,599
She holds grudges.

207
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,800
She's outspoken.

208
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,720
And she is very fond of money.

209
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,599
That means she's not a good person then.

210
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,280
Not at all, Mother. She is a good person.

211
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,560
She doesn't take advantage of others,

212
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,880
nor does she let anyone
take advantage of her.

213
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,720
She also treats her servants very well.

214
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,880
That sounds like me.

215
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,440
Yes, just like you.

216
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,200
Do you know where Pudtarn came from?

217
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
She said

218
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,640
she was brought here
by the Krishna Kali Manuscript.

219
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,560
That's why she requested I give it to her.

220
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,480
She thinks it could help her return home.

221
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,960
That's right.
Let her try touching the manuscript then.

222
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,320
She must want to go home.

223
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,160
Someone might be waiting for her there.

224
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,880
She only has an aunt.
Her parents are both dead.

225
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,960
You seem to know her well, Rid.

226
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,080
You even know this.
They're not trivial things, son.

227
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,920
She told me about it.

228
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,400
Rid.

229
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,720
The truth is I have met Pudtarn.

230
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,040
What did you say, Mother?

231
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,360
I have met her.
She told me everything you just said.

232
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,600
Really, Mother?

233
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,280
Of course. I wouldn't lie to you.

234
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,280
Why are you only telling us now?

235
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,160
I remember

236
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,120
the sky turned dark in the afternoon
a number of days ago.

237
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
Yes, Father.

238
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,960
I apologize for this.

239
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,320
I wasn't sure how you would react to this.

240
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,040
Bring her here.

241
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,840
I will let your mother question her.

242
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,720
What?

243
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,680
She might have come
from the same place as your mother.

244
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,160
This way, we can assess

245
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,000
whether she's a good or a bad person.

246
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,640
She's a good person.

247
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,280
You only have two eyes.

248
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,680
How are you so sure you are a good judge?

249
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,880
Mother.

250
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,560
Rid, where are you going?

251
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,880
I'm going to…

252
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,640
What's the matter, Mother?

253
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,560
It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

254
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,280
What is that?

255
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,920
What are you talking about?

256
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,480
There is nothing there.

257
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,760
Rid, don't pretend you don't know.

258
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,640
It's in your hands.

259
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,480
Do you think I'm blind?

260
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,120
No, Mother.

261
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,560
I wasn't hiding it from you.

262
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,320
It's her necklace.

263
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,560
Why do you have it?

264
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,960
Well, you see…

265
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,240
This necklace and pendant…

266
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,680
Klin, Gui's granddaughter,
asked me to sell it for her, my lord.

267
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,080
Sell it?

268
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Let me see it.

269
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
How much do you want?

270
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,640
I shall buy it.

271
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,000
For what reason
are you keeping this necklace?

272
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,280
You even bought it.

273
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,960
Because…

274
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,360
I thought
she would certainly be distraught

275
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,160
to have lost a cherished possession.

276
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,160
What's wrong, Karaked?

277
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,840
Our son is totes adorbs.

278
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,400
I can't say I've heard

279
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,440
that phrase before.

280
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,360
I have only been here for 20 years.
There are words I've yet to use.

281
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,960
Okay, so what does it mean?

282
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,280
Totally adorable.

283
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,200
With respect to what?

284
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,160
I have observed that our son
is becoming a man.

285
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,120
He has his eye on a woman now.

286
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,760
It's true.

287
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,720
It isn't funny.

288
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,880
Khun Pi, how can you say it's not funny?
It is pretty funny.

289
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,480
Anyway,

290
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,080
given the strange incident,

291
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,240
why don't you tell people
that Pudtarn is your niece

292
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,400
since you two resemble each other?

293
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,320
People will likely believe it.

294
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,640
Right.

295
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,280
Also, tell my mother the same.

296
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,280
She's old.

297
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,760
It wouldn't be wise
to tell her of such miracles.

298
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,720
Pudtarn!

299
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,760
There's a huge snake.

300
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,200
It's coming, my little lord.

301
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,640
Why are you stopping, my little lord?
It's about to get to us.

302
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,040
Address me properly.

303
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,480
Gosh, I knew it. Baron Rid.

304
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,840
There it is! It's coming!

305
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,360
The snake is there! Go!

306
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,000
Did the snake bite ya?

307
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,880
"Ya"?

308
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,640
Who is that?

309
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,440
Gosh.

310
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,720
Where is the snake?

311
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,040
It's gone.

312
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,320
Why didn't you tell me?

313
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,360
Well, it just left.

314
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,520
What is that sound?

315
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,120
It's your heart.

316
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,080
Why is your heart beating so fast?

317
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,760
It's not.

318
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,440
What do you mean? Isn't it beating fast?

319
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,960
Why can I hear it?

320
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,320
Hey.

321
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,240
Here, take this.

322
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,040
What is it? I don't want it.

323
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,880
As you please.

324
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,360
But you will regret it, I can assure you.

325
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,040
Give it to me.

326
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,040
What did you say?

327
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,280
She really is your niece, Karaked?

328
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,560
Yes. She is my biological niece.

329
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,520
No wonder

330
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,680
Rid said

331
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,040
she looks so similar to you.

332
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,480
Yes, Khun Pi.

333
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,720
By the way…

334
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,720
I think I have answered
all your questions.

335
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,720
I just wanted to ask you…

336
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,520
how she's related to you.

337
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,640
She's the daughter of my younger cousin.

338
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,440
Her parents lived in the city

339
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,560
where I used to live before coming here.

340
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,800
-What city--
-My goodness.

341
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,760
I'm hungry. Pin, Yaem.

342
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,000
Karaked.

343
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,640
Pin and Yaem are upstairs.

344
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,800
Goodness, I'm so hungry.

345
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,360
I'm starving.

346
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,360
One day, I saw Klin

347
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,680
asking Song to sell this necklace for her.

348
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,160
I remembered

349
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,080
that it was your necklace
with that strange pendant,

350
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,040
so I bought it.

351
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,200
Klin told me
she had sold it to a Khmer merchant.

352
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
She lied to me again.

353
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,160
You got it back.

354
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,120
Just let that go.

355
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
All right?

356
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,240
Thank you so much.

357
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,640
I thought I would never see
my parents' faces again.

358
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,480
What?

359
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,200
Your parents' faces?

360
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,360
Didn't you see them?

361
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,600
See what?

362
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,520
Here they are.

363
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,120
My parents.

364
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,360
That's strange.

365
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,760
Can it be opened?

366
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,280
Hey.

367
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,280
Don't cry.

368
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,400
You got your beloved item back.

369
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,640
You should smile.

370
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,680
Okay.

371
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,520
Look.

372
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,760
These are my parents.

373
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,840
Okay.

374
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,160
How do they make these?

375
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,080
The portraits are very realistic.

376
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,360
How did they draw them
on a pendant this small?

377
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,360
It's not a large canvas.

378
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,920
These are called photos.

379
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,600
What you, my little lord…

380
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,680
Gosh.

381
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,680
What you're talking about are drawings.

382
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,600
Don't call me that again.

383
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,800
Okay.

384
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,120
I won't call you

385
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,280
"my little lord" anymore.

386
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,760
What do you say, my little lord?

387
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Here.

388
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,760
Hey.

389
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,720
If you're really mad at me,
you should go that way.

390
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,800
What?

391
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,080
Where are you going, my little lord?
That's the way to my house.

392
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,000
Hey.

393
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,200
My mistress isn't here, my lord.

394
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,080
Where has she gone?

395
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,600
She went to see trees
in Madam Gui's orchard.

396
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,080
Why would she do that?

397
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,960
She wants
to plant some in her garden, my lord.

398
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,360
She's here, my lord.

399
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,520
Gosh, I'm tired.

400
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,520
Look.

401
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,240
Lord Rid got my necklace
back for me, Eung, Perm.

402
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,760
It's so kind of him.

403
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,240
By the way, won't Lady Praejeen
have something to say about this?

404
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,320
Lady Praejeen is as beautiful as porcelain

405
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,160
and is also the daughter of a marquess.

406
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,960
Her manners
are far more refined than yours.

407
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,720
Don't taint her with your words.

408
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,040
You're asking for trouble.

409
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,080
-Please don't, miss.
-Please, miss.

410
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,600
-Please don't.
-Why not? I'm not scared of him.

411
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:17,840
Lady Praejeen may be better than me,
but you don't have to compare her to me.

412
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,320
This is bullying.

413
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,520
Bun what?

414
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,199
Bully.

415
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,120
Bully?

416
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
What is it?

417
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,159
And what does it have to do
with Lady Praejeen?

418
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,719
My gosh.

419
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,480
Lord Rid.

420
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,280
It's now certain
that I will have to wait six months

421
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,760
for the Krishna Kali Manuscript, right?

422
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,239
Are you changing the topic on purpose?

423
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,760
That's right.

424
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,080
That's right.
Wait for another half a year.

425
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,240
Well then, I should get compensation

426
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,880
for the time I have to wait.

427
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,880
It's a waiting fee.

428
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,720
Nonsense.

429
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,600
Hey, wait. I'm really asking for it.

430
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,440
It's not nonsense.

431
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,840
-Go.
-What?

432
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Lord Rid bought this
and gave it back to me.

433
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,800
He didn't say a single word about money.

434
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,560
He really is generous and dependable.

435
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,720
What happened to her, Perm?

436
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Fine, I will call you nicely.

437
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,920
Eung and Perm, come here.

438
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,920
-Yes, miss.
-Yes, miss.

439
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,280
What are you talking about?
You took so long.

440
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,360
See, Eung?

441
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,920
We got scolded because of you.

442
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,960
It was you, Perm.

443
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,160
Do you know, Kam,

444
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,600
that Eung's mistress
wants her to take a new husband?

445
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,640
She is called Pudtarn.

446
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,880
Come here now.

447
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,000
-Yes, miss.
-Yes, miss.

448
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,160
We're here, miss.

449
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Eung, Perm, what should we plant first?

450
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,280
We have edible and inedible plants.

451
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,520
-Let's start with the edible ones.
-Yes, miss.

452
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,200
Thai basil,

453
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,480
holy basil, and neem.

454
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,760
How about lemongrass and makrut lime?

455
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,720
We don't need them, miss.
There is plenty in Madam Gui's orchard.

456
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,240
I can fetch some for you.

457
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,840
Is that all the edibles?

458
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,080
There are peanuts, miss.

459
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,400
Peanuts.

460
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,760
Well then, let's grow peanuts.
I'll plant them.

461
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,520
And Perm,
I need you to plant something here.

462
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,880
Let's go with neem.

463
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,040
Yes, miss.

464
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,320
Hey!

465
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,240
-Kam!
-Hey!

466
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,320
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Hey!

467
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,320
Yes, it's me!

468
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,560
Is this your new mistress?

469
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,560
I'll kill you!

470
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,160
-Stop it, Kam! Stop!
-Hey!

471
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,640
Eung!

472
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,040
Don't do anything to her!

473
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,240
Don't stop me! Are you trying to find
a new husband for my wife?

474
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,640
That's not true, Kam.

475
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,040
Go away! Go!

476
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,320
Are you planning to find a new husband
and leave me? Well?

477
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,000
I don't have a husband!
I have never had one!

478
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,520
Leave us alone! Just get lost!

479
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,280
A thug like you isn't welcome here!

480
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,760
I'm no longer your wife!

481
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,240
What a mouth you have!

482
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,840
With a mouth such as this,
I will expose you to everyone!

483
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,920
Do it! I'm not scared of you!

484
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'll kill you, Kam!

485
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,000
You talk too much, Eung!

486
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,280
Eung.

487
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,040
You!

488
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,360
-Bring it on.
-You want to die, do you?

489
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,800
Miss.

490
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,600
Take this!

491
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,880
Miss.

492
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,040
-Come on.
-Kam, stop it!

493
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,920
-Don't touch my mistress! Go away!
-Eung!

494
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,320
-Miss, let's go!
-Eung!

495
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,760
-Let go!
-Go away, Eung!

496
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,480
-Go away!
-My gosh!

497
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,080
Let's go, miss!

498
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,880
Run away!

499
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,320
Miss.

500
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,960
Kam.

501
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,600
-What are you going to do?
-Go! Leave!

502
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,400
Get inside, miss.

503
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,800
Eung.

504
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,520
-Get inside.
-Come inside with me.

505
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,120
-Eung, come on.
-I have chased him away, miss.

506
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,080
I shall not stay here any longer.

507
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,080
What?

508
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,960
Why?

509
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,600
If I stay here,

510
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,720
that bastard Kam will come back
to trouble you.

511
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,920
You will be in danger.

512
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,480
Is he your husband?

513
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,120
Yes, miss.

514
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,320
But he sold me off.

515
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,480
What? He sold you off?

516
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,880
Yes, miss.

517
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,360
He sold his own wife?

518
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,400
Yes.

519
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,160
He is an alcoholic.

520
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,120
When he couldn't get a drink,
he would beat me up.

521
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,440
Gosh.

522
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,920
Have men been beating their wives
since ancient times?

523
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,640
At first,
he wanted to sell me to a brothel.

524
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,320
Damn, that bastard. He's such an asshole.

525
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,400
So, how did you get away?

526
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,120
I was lucky, miss.

527
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,120
Madam Gui happened to pass by
when he was about to sell me.

528
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,880
She bought me,

529
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,320
so I came to stay with her.

530
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,040
Why didn't you report him to the police?

531
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,120
Are there police here?

532
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,280
We have the Phra Nakornbal officers,

533
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,760
but no one reports their husbands.

534
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,720
Also,

535
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,440
I was his wife

536
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,520
so my life belonged to him.

537
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,320
My parents had already accepted his dowry.

538
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,600
Also,

539
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,000
husbands are allowed to sell their wives.

540
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,840
I'm shocked.

541
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Why didn't you break up with him, Eung?
Why did you let him beat you up?

542
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,960
No one does that, miss.

543
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,640
Our husbands own our lives.

544
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,440
We can't part with them
as that is considered shameful.

545
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,680
Eung,

546
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,000
think about it.

547
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,720
We are women.

548
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,680
We are humans, just like men.

549
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,240
Do you think it is right
to let them beat us?

550
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,160
Do you think it is right
to let them sell us?

551
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,600
Perm, how did you make Kam leave?

552
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,280
I slashed him with his own knife.

553
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,800
Do you think he will come back, Perm?

554
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Certainly.

555
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,360
He has no sense of right and wrong.

556
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,960
Eung,

557
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,080
be careful.

558
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,720
But he'll hurt our mistress, Perm.

559
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,160
Why was he trying to hurt her?

560
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,040
I can't think why.

561
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,480
I'm going to run away from him.

562
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,960
-If not, you will--
-Stop it.

563
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,640
Stop talking right now.
It won't happen again.

564
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,160
But…

565
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,840
we must find a way to protect ourselves.

566
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,240
We have no one to help us.

567
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,560
-How, miss?
-How, miss?

568
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,720
Right.

569
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,360
Let me think for a second.

570
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,600
Pin and Yaem, just leave already.
Come back as soon as you're done.

571
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,240
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

572
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,880
Do you have everything?

573
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,880
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

574
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,720
Lady Karaked is waiting for you,
my ladies.

575
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,480
-What about--
-Don't talk to them.

576
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,200
They are servants.

577
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,840
A European ship docked yesterday,

578
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,320
so my husband asked me
to bring these to you.

579
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,440
They are beautiful and unique.

580
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,200
Oh, dear. You brought so much.

581
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,480
May I not accept all of it?

582
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,360
Please take some back with you.

583
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,840
I could not do that.

584
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,280
My husband would surely scold me
and refuse to talk to me.

585
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,320
We have plenty of rugs here.

586
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,160
It wouldn't hurt to have more.

587
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,840
Cover all your floors with them

588
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,080
so your feet won't feel cold
during winter.

589
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,160
Praejeen, come with me.

590
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,200
I'm going to teach you
how to cook bok noodles.

591
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,960
I heard the word noodles.

592
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,880
But what was the word that came before it?

593
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,280
Bok.

594
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,560
"Bok"?

595
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,440
Yes, bok noodles.

596
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,880
We got these noodle sheets
from a Chinese shop.

597
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,360
They are big sheets.

598
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,600
Cut them into bite-sized pieces.

599
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,400
You eat them with boiled pork, shrimp,

600
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,760
peanuts, bean sprouts, and ginger.

601
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,200
All right, put some in here.

602
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,840
My dear Praejeen,

603
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,760
you had a cooking lesson today.
What did you cook?

604
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,960
Here it is, Father.

605
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,480
This?

606
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,840
What is this, my dear?

607
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,160
It's bok noodles, Father.

608
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,240
No, thank you.
I don't think I would like it.

609
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,720
Have a taste, Khun Pi.

610
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,800
No.

611
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,880
And what is this liquid?

612
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,920
It's the sauce, Father.

613
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,040
Let me show you how to eat it.

614
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,600
We're going to finish this, Khun Pi.

615
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,520
What does the sauce taste like?

616
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,000
It looks strange.

617
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,800
There are crushed peanuts in it.
Why did you add that?

618
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,400
It's sour, sweet, salty,
and spicy, Father.

619
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,120
Lady Karaked said this sauce is…

620
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,320
the bomb.

621
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,840
-"The bomb"?
-It means delicious.

622
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,600
I'm here, Praejeen.

623
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,360
I rushed home to try the food
you made with Lady Karaked.

624
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,400
Where is it?

625
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,960
It's here, In.

626
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,800
Here? Where, Father?

627
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,680
In my stomach.

628
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,200
Father.

629
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,440
In.

630
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,720
I heard His Majesty will transfer Rid
to the treasury. Is that true?

631
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,360
Yes, Father.

632
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,480
I heard His Majesty inform Rid
the other day.

633
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,320
Good.

634
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,360
Good.

635
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,840
Why is it good?

636
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,280
I think His Majesty has great foresight.

637
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,120
Among the four pillars,
which do you think is the most important?

638
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,360
I would have to say

639
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,120
it's the Minister of Treasury.

640
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,120
-Why?
-He controls the money.

641
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,960
That's right.

642
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,640
Furthermore,

643
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,080
His Majesty may be looking far ahead.

644
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,160
Okay.

645
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,760
He may want to dispatch missions
to various places.

646
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,280
Where?

647
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,720
He may send another one to France

648
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,960
or perhaps China.

649
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,720
He is unable to go there himself.

650
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,920
About Rid,

651
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,360
are you certain he's unmarried, In?

652
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,840
Yes, Father.

653
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,240
I have never seen him
lay eyes on any woman.

654
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,760
Good.

655
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,760
Lady Karaked asked us to bring
these pieces of cloth for you.

656
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,920
She also asked us to sew them.

657
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,840
What are you making?

658
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,120
We're done, miss.

659
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,800
Would you like to try them on?

660
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,400
They're probably too big for you.

661
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,360
It's exactly my size.

662
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,080
You two are just amazing.

663
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,560
A G-string?

664
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,640
I want to make bras.

665
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,880
-What is it?
-What is it?

666
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,640
A bra.

667
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,880
Underwear.

668
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,080
-Underwear?
-Underwear?

669
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,160
What is it for?

670
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,680
Is that how you wear it?

671
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,760
That's right.

672
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,640
You use it to hold your breasts like this.

673
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,480
-Hold your breasts?
-Hold your breasts?

674
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,080
Hold your breasts?

675
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,480
This would make a great name.

676
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,320
Breast holders by Pudtarn.

677
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,920
Why must they be held?

678
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,240
If you don't, your breasts will sag.

679
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,240
-What? They sag?
-What? They sag?

680
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,480
That's right.

681
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,680
If you don't wear one, they will sag

682
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,680
and droop down

683
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,000
to your waist one day.

684
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,240
My goodness.

685
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,960
You are embarrassing me, my lady.

686
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,280
Why is it embarrassing? It's only natural.

687
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,120
Think about it.

688
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,360
Our breasts are heavy, but we have to walk

689
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,960
and run here and there.

690
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,800
They feel heavier and heavier

691
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,400
and keep drooping down

692
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,360
until they sag.

693
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,800
-My goodness.
-Even worse,

694
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,040
there's gravity
that pulls them down even more.

695
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:07,240
That's why we need bras to hold them up.

696
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,920
Hold on, my lady.
What are you talking about?

697
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,720
What is gravity?

698
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,200
The Earth's gravity
pulls the breasts down.

699
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,440
What exactly is that,

700
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,760
Lady Karaked?

701
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,840
Khun Pi.

702
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,920
I'm curious about it, just like these two.

703
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,240
What is it?

704
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,200
It's nothing, Khun Pi.

705
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,520
It concerns women.

706
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,240
I wouldn't want to know this

707
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,400
if the woman it concerned weren't…

708
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,880
my wife.

709
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,160
Why are you laughing?

710
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,480
Where are you taking me, Khun Pi?

711
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,320
I haven't finished assigning work
to Pin and Yaem.

712
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,520
I'll definitely have
a breast holder to wear now.

713
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,560
Yes, miss.

714
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,880
Lady Karaked will probably
send those two over soon

715
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,240
to make breast holders for you.

716
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,840
Do you want one, Eung?

717
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,840
Yes, miss.

718
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,880
I don't want mine to sag

719
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,720
or droop.

720
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,520
My gosh.

721
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,160
They would go over my shoulders.

722
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,240
-Eung.
-Yes, miss.

723
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,080
Let's take your measurements.

724
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,960
I will get one with short straps.

725
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,440
Do you understand now what gravity is?

726
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,440
Even with your explanation,

727
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,360
I still don't understand it.

728
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,800
But when you said

729
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,640
it would make…

730
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,240
Having carefully inspected them
a number of times,

731
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,040
I don't see

732
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,480
that yours are like what you said.

733
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,000
Come on, Khun Pi.

734
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:14,440
I wore brassieres for over a decade
before I came here to live with you.

735
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:22,800
But you haven't worn one
for 20 years, since Rid was born.

736
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,880
It's longer than the time you wore them.

737
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,560
Are you saying mine
are still as they were before?

738
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,640
Are you sure?

739
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,720
Let's stop talking about this.

740
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,360
It's not something

741
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,400
we should discuss so openly.

742
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,640
Fine, I won't do it openly.

743
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:44,960
They look the same, right?

744
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,120
What do you say?

745
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,920
It didn't work.

746
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,080
I can't arouse you.

747
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,360
Who said you can't arouse me?

748
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,800
I know.

749
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,720
-Put one more here.
-My lady.

750
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,880
My lady.

751
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,600
My goodness.

752
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,760
What's wrong with you?

753
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,440
Lady Keaw and Lady Prang are here.

754
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,880
What?

755
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,560
Did they come together?

756
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,920
Yes, they are both here, my lady.

757
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,280
Where are they?

758
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,280
Lady Prang.

759
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,160
Lady Keaw.

760
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,960
-I missed you.
-I missed you.

761
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,760
What would you like to eat this evening?

762
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,240
I will have grilled fish.

763
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,160
Bless you, my granddaughters.

764
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:43,200
You were gone for so long this time.

765
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,400
Yes, Grandmother.

766
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,280
-It wasn't long, Grandmother.
-What?

767
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,760
We both just returned home
on the last Buddhist holy day.

768
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,400
The last Buddhist holy day?

769
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,120
Why do I feel it has been so long?

770
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,560
It has been two Buddhist holy days,

771
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,360
not just one, my lady.

772
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,320
That's right, my lady.

773
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,280
It has been almost a month.

774
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,560
She's right.

775
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,680
Okay. If you say so.

776
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,120
I do say so. Because it is so.

777
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,360
Prik.

778
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,520
My goodness.

779
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,000
Oh, dear. You gave me a fright.

780
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,440
You deserved a fright.

781
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,880
Isn't that so?

782
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:39,920
It is so.

783
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,400
Isn't it, Prik?

784
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,800
Oh, dear.

785
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,440
It is so.

786
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,480
I say so, Prik.

787
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,680
Goodness.

788
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,720
They all agreed.

789
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,200
Isn't it so, Prik?

790
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,840
Mother.

791
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,560
No, hold on, Khun Pi.
Don't open the door yet.

792
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,480
Calm down.

793
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,440
Let's go out to see her.

794
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,800
My lady.

795
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,560
It's an inappropriate time.

796
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:49,760
Hold on.

797
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,400
What is it?

798
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:24,120
Why does your loincloth
look like Mother's sbai, Father?

799
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,240
And why does Mother's sbai

800
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,440
-look like--
-Prang.

801
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,200
Khun Pi.

802
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,760
Khun Pi.

803
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,760
Rid is here.

804
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,840
Let's go shopping now.

805
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,760
Today, your sbai looks odd, Mother.

806
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,200
Prang.

807
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,280
Do you know whose residence we're passing?

808
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,880
Gui's residence.

809
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,840
Will you not invite someone
to come along with us?

810
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:54,960
Do you mean Gui?

811
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,320
No, Rid.

812
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,600
Why are you smiling, Chom?

813
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,000
I'm not smiling, my lord.

814
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:20,200
You're clearly smiling, so don't deny it.

815
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,320
You're getting bold, Chom.

816
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,920
You too, Choi.

817
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,480
Don't let me see

818
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,440
you smiling for no reason.

819
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,080
Otherwise,

820
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,560
I will punish each and every one of you.

821
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,320
Return home.

822
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,000
Did you hear what I said?

823
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,680
Why aren't you turning the boat around?

824
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,360
Do it now.

825
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,480
Prang, why are you crying?

826
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:12,880
I wish to go to the market.

827
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,080
My poor sister.

828
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,160
But Rid wishes to return home,

829
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:21,360
so you mustn't weep like this.

830
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,600
Why shouldn't I, Keaw?

831
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,480
Whatever our elder brother wants,

832
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,040
we must go along with him,
since we are his sisters.

833
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,600
It's the done thing.

834
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,960
My goodness.

835
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:41,040
I intended to invite Pudtarn to join us.

836
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,600
I like her.

837
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,120
I wanted to ask her
to browse the clothes with me.

838
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,280
You're right, Prang.

839
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:54,360
Pudtarn doesn't have many clothes.

840
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,840
She told me she only has a few.

841
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,000
Poor her.

842
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,520
In the future,

843
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,280
her clothes may get damaged.

844
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:09,720
She might not have anything to wear
and will have to remain in her house.

845
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,840
-Poor her.
-Poor her.

846
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,720
Pudtarn.

847
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,640
That won't happen,

848
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,320
Keaw, Prang.

849
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,400
-Choi, turn the boat around.
-Choi, turn the boat around.

850
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,400
Which market shall we visit?

851
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,400
You have been
to all the markets in the city.

852
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,800
Why don't you ask someone
who has never been to any?

853
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,320
I see.

854
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,400
Which market
do you wish to visit, Pudtarn?

855
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:00,320
How should I answer that?
I have only been to one market.

856
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,600
I don't know any other markets.

857
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,160
I see.

858
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,120
Prang.

859
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,160
You should ask her

860
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,480
what she intends to buy.

861
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,040
Okay.

862
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,840
You don't have to ask me, Prang.

863
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,080
Why is that?

864
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,720
Let Baron Maharit ask me himself.

865
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,160
I see.

866
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,880
Pudtarn,

867
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,560
what would you like to buy?

868
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,320
What are you scheming today?

869
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,280
I will invite someone here.

870
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,880
I have seen this place before.

871
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,440
So you are Pudtarn.

872
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,840
Chin up.

873
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,399
Let me see your face.

874
01:08:18,439 --> 01:08:20,160
I would like to learn sword fighting.

875
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,640
You are a woman.

876
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:25,880
I cannot think of anyone
who would teach you.

877
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:27,600
Try and think.

878
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,120
I know now.

879
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,359
Capture only Eung.

880
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:32,680
We could take one of them.

881
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,520
All three are pretty.

882
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,240
-My goodness!
-Hey!

883
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,359
Stop right there, you scoundrel!

884
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:25,080
