1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,920
Do you like Ming?

2
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,800
Just pretend you accept them.

3
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,200
Miss Pudtarn will fail.

4
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,880
I truly do not know

5
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,480
why I dislike Pudtarn so.

6
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,720
Unless…

7
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,640
someone performed black magic on me.

8
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,400
Hey.

9
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,120
Miss Klin was acting shamelessly
with the baron.

10
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,120
I saw it.

11
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,480
Do you still want to go to Song Kwae?

12
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,640
Not anymore.

13
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,960
Miss Pudtarn is upstairs
with Lord Rid alone.

14
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,960
This is the first time I have seen
you laugh so wholeheartedly.

15
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,840
Baron.

16
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
Klin.

17
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,520
Have you come to deliver goods?

18
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,640
Yes, my lord.

19
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,000
I have some green papaya as well,
Miss Pudtarn.

20
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,680
You can make som tam.

21
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't want it.
I don't want to eat som tam.

22
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,320
I brought it especially for you.

23
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,760
Why are you being so dismissive?

24
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,600
You did not bring it for me.
This is not my home.

25
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,840
I knew Perm had brought you here.

26
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,079
I honestly brought it for you.

27
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,800
Baron, please believe me.

28
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,120
Pudtarn,

29
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,400
Klin is telling the truth.

30
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,000
-She--
-Believe it if you like, but I don't.

31
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,960
Shameless bitch.

32
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,800
I know I made a big mistake,

33
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,600
but must I die

34
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,520
for Pudtarn to stop being angry with me?

35
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,600
Klin, just be patient.

36
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,480
I have not explained to Pudtarn
that you were subjected to black magic.

37
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,840
That is why
Pudtarn is still angry with you.

38
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,880
Really?

39
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,920
No wonder she had a fierce look
in her eyes when she looked at me.

40
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,760
But I have been quite cruel to her.

41
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
I feel awful.

42
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
Baron,

43
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,320
please help me.

44
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,320
Do not worry.

45
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,920
I shall help sort things out for you.

46
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,680
All eyes were on you at the temple
because of the makeover I gave you.

47
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,400
Did you see?

48
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,120
They must have thought I looked strange.

49
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,720
No one's cheeks were as red as mine.

50
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,560
Pink eyes make me look so unusual.
Do you not see?

51
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,160
No.

52
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,960
Could you not answer more politely?

53
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,000
Whose brusque tone of voice
does yours resemble?

54
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,640
You two, go and bathe.

55
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,000
Kheow, tell Salee to serve our meal.

56
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,040
Yes, my lady.

57
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,360
Khun Pi, are you very hungry?

58
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,600
-Not very.
-Not very.

59
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,040
Who does that sound like, Keaw?

60
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,200
Whose do you mean, Father?

61
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,200
Go now.

62
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,120
What?

63
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
Prik.

64
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,720
Why are you sleeping there?

65
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,680
You too, Boong.

66
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,760
Be nice, Prang.

67
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,600
Boong.

68
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
Boong.

69
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,640
I said Boong nicely.

70
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,080
Why are you sleeping here?

71
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,880
We were watching over Lord Rid,
Lady Prang.

72
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,920
-Why?
-Why?

73
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,520
Did Klin ask you to tell me
that she destroyed my vegetable plot?

74
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,800
She did.

75
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,800
Are you her lawyer or something?

76
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,280
I just think that
if you know what caused Klin to do it,

77
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,200
you might forgive her.

78
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,360
What caused her to do it?

79
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,720
I truly do not know

80
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,600
why I dislike Pudtarn so.

81
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,280
Unless…

82
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,040
someone performed black magic on me.

83
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,840
Do you really believe that?

84
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,720
What?

85
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,159
Why aren't you talking?

86
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,520
Do you really believe
this black magic nonsense?

87
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,040
I did not want to believe it,
but it could be true, as she said.

88
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,440
She had no reason
to destroy your vegetable plot.

89
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,320
No reason?

90
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,800
No reason?

91
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,640
Screw that.

92
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
What did you say?

93
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,280
Do you want a reason? I have plenty.

94
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,840
-She already said it was--
-Black magic.

95
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,800
Please consider forgiving her.

96
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,360
What would I gain from that?
My vegetable plot is completely ruined.

97
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,960
It may help you calm down.

98
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,360
I don't want that.

99
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,320
Do you see how worked up you are?

100
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,760
And what do you gain from doing this?
You're defending her.

101
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,080
I gain nothing.

102
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,680
-But--
-Not even her heart?

103
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,080
I see.

104
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Indeed.

105
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
I may win her heart

106
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,400
by speaking up for her.

107
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,560
And her heart may stop
being agitated for wronging you

108
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,680
without meaning to.

109
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,640
Gosh, I can't listen anymore.

110
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,920
Stop talking!

111
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,480
I am going to Phitsanulok.

112
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,600
Arrange it for me.

113
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,520
I'll put an end to all this nonsense

114
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,160
because I won't be here anymore.

115
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,680
Look at him, Khun Pi.

116
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,120
What is wrong with him?

117
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,040
His mind is elsewhere.

118
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,680
It happens to all of us sometimes.

119
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,120
He is also sad.

120
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,440
I see, he is also sad.

121
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,440
Yes.

122
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,480
If he is sad,

123
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,480
I would be interested to know
what has made him so.

124
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,080
Where are you going?

125
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,600
Well, to ask our son
what is the matter with him.

126
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
Rid.

127
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,200
Has something happened to make you so sad?

128
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,560
Yes, Mother.

129
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,600
Tell your father and me.

130
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,240
I love her.

131
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,400
Pudtarn.

132
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,640
But she does not
feel the same way, Mother.

133
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,320
Her mind is set on returning home.

134
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,720
You must not prevent
Lord Rid and Pudtarn from being together.

135
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,080
You should play along

136
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,000
and insist that you are pleased
and have no objection.

137
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,960
Why must I do so?

138
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,400
I am not pleased.

139
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,040
Well, simply pretend that you are.

140
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,920
Or would you prefer
to fall out with Lord Rid?

141
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,200
You mad woman.

142
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,800
Why would I wish to fall out
with my own grandson?

143
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,840
That is precisely why I suggested
that you play along.

144
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,600
Matters such as these
require intervention from on high.

145
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,280
From on high? Who?

146
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,160
The Queen Mother.

147
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,160
QUEEN MOTHER, KROM PHRA THEPHAMAT

148
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,400
What did you say
you need my help with, Champa?

149
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,040
Your Highness,

150
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,240
may you graciously assist me?

151
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,360
My grandson is of an age to be wed.

152
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,720
I would be grateful if the king
could bestow a wife upon him.

153
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,840
Whom do you have in mind?

154
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,920
Lady Praejeen,

155
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,200
Chinese Marquess Kosathibodi's daughter.

156
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
What?

157
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,760
Why did you not suggest to your son
that he ask the king himself?

158
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,320
If you speak on his behalf,
it will hold more sway.

159
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,160
There is no reason for the king
to have any objection,

160
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,040
with Rid's own grandmother
making the request herself.

161
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,600
My lord, are you not worrying too much?

162
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,840
Choi, if you don't know anything,
then don't say anything.

163
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,320
No one will fault you.

164
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,960
Why are you laughing?

165
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,480
I said nothing
that should amuse you, Choi.

166
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,160
It is amusing, my lord.

167
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,680
You are starting to sound
like Miss Pudtarn.

168
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,320
So what?

169
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,160
It is because I love her.

170
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,560
Why would it be strange for me
to sound like her?

171
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,200
Then why are you worried?

172
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,080
Do you not know why I am worried?

173
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,640
Do you not know what is in my heart?

174
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,800
My lord,

175
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,960
how could I not know
what is in your heart?

176
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,760
Allow me to tell you what is in my heart.

177
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,800
If Pudtarn loves you,
there is nothing to worry about.

178
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,760
She does not give in easily.

179
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,360
Your grandmother will lose.

180
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,960
Trust me.

181
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,440
What are the desserts?

182
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,240
I see, thong yip, thong yod.

183
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,920
Phet and Bhorn, come and try some.

184
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Look, it appears most delicious.

185
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,080
Narenthon,
have you ever tried these desserts?

186
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,520
I have.

187
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,200
Come taste it with me.

188
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,520
Yes, Uncle.

189
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,680
Children, go and eat over there.

190
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,280
-Have you prepared it for them, Pen?
-Yes, Your Highness.

191
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,600
Your Highness, please come this way.

192
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,160
Phet, will you not visit
Buddha's footprint this year?

193
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,880
I shall go next month, Grandmother.

194
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,400
Will you join your brother, Bhorn?

195
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,240
Yes, Your Highness.
I am leading the party.

196
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,200
I would like to join you,

197
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,000
but my body can no longer handle it.

198
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,840
I could never reach the top.

199
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,520
I shall build you a palanquin
and carry you there.

200
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,160
Would that be preferable?

201
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,760
That would be a burden for others.

202
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,880
What do you have planned, Bhorn?

203
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,440
Children, come pay your respects
to your great-grandmother.

204
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,880
I must attend to my duties.

205
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,000
Narenthon, come here.

206
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,320
Would you like to visit Chan Palace?

207
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,240
Yes, Uncle.

208
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,040
May I visit Ayothaya Temple afterwards?

209
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,560
Certainly. Would you like to learn boxing?

210
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,480
I shall find you a teacher.

211
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,960
No, Uncle.

212
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,760
I prefer to visit the temple.

213
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,400
Narenthon,

214
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,080
why would you visit the temple?
You should learn to box.

215
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,240
In case you become king one day.

216
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,560
Phet, will you stay for a while?

217
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,440
I have a matter to discuss with you.

218
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,720
I arranged for your visit today
to discuss this matter with you.

219
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,200
Yes, Grandmother.

220
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,040
It concerns your royal page.

221
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,760
His grandmother, Lady Champa,

222
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,880
asked me to speak to you
regarding a royally-bestowed wife.

223
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,800
Will you bestow a wife upon him?

224
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,600
Is it Rid?

225
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,600
That sounds familiar.

226
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,520
I do not recall clearly,
but it is Lady Champa's grandson.

227
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,720
You must know who it is.

228
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,280
Yes. He is called Rid.

229
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,960
If the woman is the daughter
of Chinese Marquess Kosathibodi,

230
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,200
then her mother is Lady Pong, is she not?

231
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,120
When Lady Pong visits me,
she always brings various items.

232
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,920
I have no use for them.

233
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,160
Such things are unnecessary
for an elderly person.

234
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,480
They clutter up the palace.

235
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,760
Indeed.

236
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,320
It is for Lady Champa's sake.

237
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,800
Her husband was the Horathibodi
during the reign of King Narai.

238
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,400
He was a great asset to the kingdom.

239
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,080
I have no objection.

240
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,600
Their match is undoubtedly a suitable one.

241
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,080
In any case,
please go and tend to your duties.

242
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,960
I shall bid you farewell.

243
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,720
During your rule,

244
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,360
have you encountered
any troubling situations?

245
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,080
Not yet, Grandmother.

246
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,440
Everything is currently
in a state of peace.

247
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,360
What are those?

248
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Your Highness, Lady Pong
has requested an audience.

249
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,760
Mother.

250
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,600
There is no need to worry, Praejeen.

251
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,840
Today, I had a personal audience
with the Queen Mother.

252
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,320
She listened to my request
and spoke to me directly.

253
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,640
What did she say?

254
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,000
The king shall soon issue
a royal proclamation

255
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,360
designating you
as Rid's royally-bestowed wife.

256
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,200
Choi, I shall go on my own.

257
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,200
Oh, dear.

258
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,920
Allow me to paddle for you.

259
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,080
I prefer to do it myself.

260
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,800
-But--
-Why would you go?

261
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,600
You do not miss Pudtarn like I do.

262
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,920
Darn it.

263
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,240
I cannot stay here any longer.

264
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,080
Mother, please try this.

265
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,240
Shrimp paste chili sauce.

266
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,680
It is delicious.

267
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,080
I made everything.

268
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,440
The one I've heard of
is grilled shrimp with that sauce.

269
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,440
What's it called?

270
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,400
What is it? Sea…

271
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,280
Seafood, Mother.

272
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,920
Just smelling the sauce makes me

273
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,320
It's so…

274
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,320
It is super yummy.

275
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,840
Here you are.

276
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,640
Praejeen, my dear,

277
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,400
has Rid shown any interest in you

278
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,080
during your visits to his house?

279
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,440
I do not feel that he has.

280
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,240
He loves and adores Pudtarn, I know that.

281
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,440
But that does not trouble me.

282
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,520
I simply wish to be
the royally-bestowed wife

283
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,080
and the title of lady must be mine.

284
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,400
As for Pudtarn,

285
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,880
she may be his wife
who belongs in the kitchen.

286
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,800
The royal proclamation has been issued.
Can it be changed?

287
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,040
No, it can't.

288
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,960
This is serious.
I thought it was just Lady Champa.

289
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,800
What did you say?

290
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,880
We need to hurry.

291
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,040
Is Rid at home?

292
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,040
Is Rid at home, Choi?

293
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,240
No, my lord.

294
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,920
It is nearly dark.
Where did you allow Rid to go alone?

295
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,160
He would not let me go with him.

296
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,560
Where did he go?

297
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,640
Well? Where did he go?

298
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,920
He did not say.

299
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,720
He paced around, boarded a boat, and left.

300
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,960
Didn't he say anything?

301
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,760
-He did.
-What did he say?

302
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,800
He said,

303
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,400
"I cannot stay here any longer."

304
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,840
My lord.

305
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,520
Do you know?

306
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,280
I do.

307
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,480
Where did he go?

308
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,960
Come here, gecko.

309
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,880
Come here, gecko.

310
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,640
Do it gently, Perm.

311
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,440
-Eung.
-Shush! Go outside.

312
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Miss…

313
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,000
She has not moved.

314
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,440
What?

315
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,960
Make her move then.

316
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,400
I tried.

317
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,960
Miss.

318
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,800
Miss.

319
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,680
Miss.

320
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,680
Miss.

321
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,160
I'm not dead yet. Why are you crying?

322
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,120
Miss!

323
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,160
Whose boat is that?

324
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,080
Why are you crying?

325
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,120
Answer me.

326
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,920
What are you sad about, miss?

327
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,200
You were lying so still
as if you were dead.

328
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,160
Can you even help me if I tell you?

329
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Hey.

330
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,720
Who owns this boat?

331
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,800
Leaving it here quietly,
what do you intend to do?

332
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,440
Hey.

333
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,760
Come out.

334
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,400
Who is it?

335
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,760
It is only me, Perm.

336
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,560
My lord.

337
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,200
I came to see your mistress.

338
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,640
What is she doing?

339
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,040
This is wonderful. You came just in time.

340
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,080
Just in time?

341
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,880
For what?

342
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,160
She is lying motionless
as if she were dead.

343
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,600
I cannot really help.

344
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,000
It is a bit too much for my brain.

345
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,920
But I do want to help.

346
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,760
Can you really help?

347
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,280
I'll use what I have.

348
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,880
And what is that?

349
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,920
Your brain?

350
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,440
Yes, miss.

351
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,840
With what my brain can handle.

352
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,280
It might not be much,
but I shall give it my all.

353
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,280
At least it's something.

354
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,080
You said she was lying
as if she were dead.

355
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,440
Then who is laughing?

356
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,000
I said as if she were dead.

357
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,880
She is not actually dead.

358
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,400
Would you like a good kick?

359
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,040
That would not be good.

360
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
It would.

361
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,800
I need your help.

362
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,960
It is not hard.

363
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,800
You only need to say a few words.

364
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,720
Honestly, it might be best if I died.

365
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,200
Miss, speaking ill will bring it to pass.

366
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Is that true?

367
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,880
If I speak ill, will I actually die?

368
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,400
It is true.

369
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,880
Do not speak of dying.

370
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,200
It is a bad omen.

371
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,600
It would be good
if I actually died as I spoke of it.

372
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,840
Miss, why do you wish to die?

373
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,720
Do you not worry about
those you would leave behind?

374
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,400
Are you not concerned about me,
just those I would leave behind?

375
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,480
Yes, miss.

376
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,520
Those left behind would be sad.

377
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,240
They would get over it in no time.

378
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,680
For someone, it would not be so easy.

379
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,240
Someone?

380
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,360
Who?

381
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,040
Baron Maharit.

382
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,560
Are you sure?

383
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,320
Yes, miss.

384
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,560
Miss, there's a boat at the dock.
I don't know whose it is.

385
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,800
We don't need to worry whose boat it is.
They will come back for it.

386
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,040
If they leave it overnight
and don't come back for it,

387
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,640
we can swipe it.

388
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,360
Swipe?

389
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,200
Keep, we can keep it.

390
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,440
What?

391
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,040
Where is it? I don't see any boat.

392
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,320
Where is the boat, Perm?

393
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,680
Well, it…

394
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,320
It was here just now.

395
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,480
Was it?

396
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,840
That means they have gone, right?

397
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,680
What? They left.

398
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,840
Where are they?

399
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
What?

400
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,239
I see, Perm.
I knew he was acting suspiciously.

401
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,800
So who's here? Show yourself.

402
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,760
Don't play around like this.

403
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,920
Come on,
I've actually been thinking about you.

404
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,719
Are you really not coming out?

405
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,360
Why are you here?

406
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,720
A face-up moon.

407
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,800
A full moon.

408
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,040
It is face-up.

409
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,520
And when it isn't face-up?

410
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,240
-It is face-down.
-Face-down?

411
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,240
A face-down moon?

412
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,880
Face-down is the opposite of face-up?

413
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,520
Shall we

414
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,880
go for a paddle in the boat?

415
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,000
Shall we go?

416
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,280
No.

417
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,840
All right?

418
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,400
No.

419
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,560
No.

420
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,080
You've thought of me, have you?

421
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,480
Yes.

422
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,840
We share the same sentiment.

423
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,760
I have thought of you as well.

424
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,520
But I think our sentiments are different.
They are not the same.

425
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,520
That is fine.

426
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,960
As long as you thought of me.

427
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,800
I thought of you,
hoping you will do as I wish.

428
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,160
So that we won't think
of each other anymore.

429
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,960
Why do you talk in a way
that is so hard to understand?

430
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,640
I do not understand what you mean.

431
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,080
Take me to Phitsanulok.
Then I'll tell you.

432
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,360
Don't worry about that.
I intend to take you there.

433
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,400
What?

434
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,640
Does that mean
you've been planning to get rid of me?

435
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,080
What did you say?

436
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,920
Don't even try.

437
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,320
Try what?

438
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,280
Don't feign…

439
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,520
Feign…

440
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,000
Feign what?

441
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,000
Feign ignorance?

442
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,800
That's right. Don't feign ignorance
and act like you don't understand.

443
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,640
Pudtarn, that is not my nature.

444
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,640
I say what I think.

445
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,240
But you, you think one thing
and say another.

446
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,200
-That's not true.
-It is true. That is how you are.

447
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,920
No, I say what I think.

448
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,920
No, I say what I think.

449
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,080
I do.

450
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,720
I do.

451
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,040
I do.

452
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
Fine.

453
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,880
You may say what is on your mind,

454
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,800
but your mind always changes.

455
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,680
You are fickle.

456
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,680
One day, you are one way.
The next day, you are different.

457
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,520
It's called being volatile.

458
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,240
Indeed.

459
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,440
Volatile.

460
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,120
You are volatile.

461
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,200
Hey, hold on, you're criticizing me.

462
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,600
Indeed, I am criticizing you.

463
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,080
Wait.

464
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,280
How about this, Baron?

465
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,280
Let me ask you this.

466
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,920
If you just wanted to argue,

467
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,480
why go to the trouble
of coming out to the middle of the canal?

468
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,440
It was no trouble at all.

469
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,760
That's not what I meant.

470
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,600
Why not argue on the land?
Why come and do it in the water?

471
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,160
We are in a boat, not the water.

472
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,960
Gosh!

473
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,800
Pudtarn.

474
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,000
Are you angry?

475
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,000
I am.

476
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,200
You are?

477
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,280
About what?

478
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,280
Do not be angry.

479
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,720
You are frowning.
It diminishes your beauty.

480
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,600
You are a truly beautiful woman.

481
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,560
Everything about you is exquisite.

482
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,880
Your face, your lips, your cheeks,
your eyebrows, and your jaw are beautiful.

483
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,160
Your hair is also beautiful.

484
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,240
Your figure, arms, and legs are beautiful.

485
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,320
If you spoke beautifully as well,

486
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,840
you would be the most beautiful woman
in Phra Nakorn.

487
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,120
I don't care if anyone hates me.

488
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,560
I am the way I am.

489
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,800
If someone wants to love me,

490
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,920
they must accept me as I am.

491
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,360
That is me.

492
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,280
I love you as you are.

493
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,560
Do you still wish to go to Song Kwae?

494
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,080
Yes, I do.

495
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,160
You are determined to return to your home.

496
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,720
Do the people here
not give you a reason to stay?

497
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,440
What?

498
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,920
What is that sound?

499
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,000
Thump, thump.

500
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,920
It is my heart beating.

501
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,320
What? Your heart?

502
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,840
Is it racing again?

503
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,360
Yes. It's racing.

504
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,400
What happened this time?

505
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,120
It is because you are holding my hand.

506
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,800
I am waiting for your answer, Pudtarn.

507
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,200
Listen to me carefully.

508
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,080
I think

509
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,160
there is something

510
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,000
that brought me here.

511
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,920
And if

512
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,800
I must leave,

513
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,000
that same thing

514
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,600
will be the reason I go.

515
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,760
What is that something?

516
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,440
Do you know what destiny is?

517
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,840
Destiny?

518
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,440
I believe I have heard
my mother mention it.

519
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,600
That's what it is.

520
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,400
What does it mean?

521
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,840
You can ask Auntie Ketsu--

522
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,120
I mean, Auntie Karaked.

523
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,560
I am asking you.

524
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,880
Why should I go and ask my mother
if you know?

525
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,720
And you must know.

526
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,120
Why not just tell me?

527
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,800
Why tarry?

528
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,000
Tarry?

529
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,680
Never mind.

530
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,760
Here's the thing.

531
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,840
Destiny means fate

532
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,320
or fortune.

533
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,920
Mother once said that

534
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,680
she was predestined to come here.

535
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,120
I understand now.

536
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,320
Do you believe
you were predestined to come here?

537
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,920
Yes.

538
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,480
And?

539
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,840
If I must leave,

540
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,040
it's because I am predestined to.

541
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,960
The same way I came.

542
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,120
Can I…

543
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,320
prevent you from going?

544
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,800
Pudtarn.

545
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,440
I'm afraid you can't.

546
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,560
Why is that?

547
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,600
Those who believe in destiny

548
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,840
believe nothing can prevent it.

549
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,080
Everything happens as it is predestined.

550
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,520
Baron.

551
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,760
I know that as well.

552
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,880
Cry if you need to.

553
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,280
I do not want to cry.

554
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,120
As a man,

555
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,040
you are not supposed
to let anyone see you cry.

556
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,720
It undermines your masculinity.

557
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,640
No, it doesn't.

558
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,640
Men and women are equally human.
We all have hearts.

559
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,360
We laugh the same way.

560
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,920
Why can't we cry the same way?

561
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,040
Cry if you need to.

562
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,000
Baron,

563
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
we will go to Phitsanulok together.

564
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,120
If it ends things between us,

565
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,760
then that's how it should be.

566
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,200
It is our destiny.

567
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,040
We must accept it.

568
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,200
Otherwise, things will always
be like this.

569
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,600
Like what?

570
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,680
So long as there is the possibility,
I'll keep wanting to go to Phitsanulok.

571
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,920
Over and over.

572
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,760
If I go this time

573
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,840
and touch the manuscript,

574
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,520
and it's quiet, nothing happens,

575
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,200
then I'll know
that I have to stay here until I die.

576
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,120
Then I won't want to go
to Phitsanulok anymore.

577
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,840
But if you touch the manuscript,
and you disappear…

578
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,280
It will be because of…

579
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,600
Destiny.

580
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,920
Good night.

581
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,600
Rid.

582
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,640
Yes, Father.

583
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,760
Are you hungry?

584
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,680
I am not.

585
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,840
You went to see Pudtarn, did you not?

586
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,560
Yes, Mother.

587
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,600
You will be fine.

588
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,440
Do not be sad.

589
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,240
There are many women

590
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,440
who will recognize your value.

591
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,760
Do not concern yourself over this woman.

592
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,960
That's true.
There's nothing for you to fear.

593
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,280
I will help you.

594
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,760
Do you see we are concerned about you?

595
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,440
In any case, you shall have a wife soon

596
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,600
-because--
-Whomever you love,

597
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,760
you will end up with that woman.

598
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,640
Do not give up.

599
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,520
What?

600
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,120
Karaked, why did you say that?

601
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,160
No reason. I just wanted to.

602
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,920
And I meant what I said.

603
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,200
Why? Do you have a problem with that?

604
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,040
Rid,

605
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,440
the king has bestowed Praejeen

606
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,240
upon you.

607
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,480
The royal proclamation has been issued.

608
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,080
Don't marry her if you don't love her.

609
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,560
Karaked.

610
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,560
You don't love her, do you?

611
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,800
No, Mother.

612
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:11,880
But…

613
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:12,800
Precisely.

614
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,040
Who would defy a royal proclamation?

615
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,360
I would.

616
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,320
Fight it.

617
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,880
By the way,
has Pudtarn returned your love?

618
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,960
She has reciprocated my affection.

619
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,880
She told me earlier.

620
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,280
Karaked,

621
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,000
we could lose our heads.

622
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,600
Listen.

623
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,360
Back then, when you were in love with me--

624
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,680
I am still in love with you.

625
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,400
All right, now.

626
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,720
Now, you are head over heels
in love with me…

627
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,160
Head over heels?

628
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,400
It is up here. My head is still up here.

629
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,160
Gosh, that's why I said it was back then.

630
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,800
Back then, when you were head over heels
in love with me,

631
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,120
if Lady Champa had tried
to stop you from marrying me

632
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,240
and asked the king to bestow you a wife,

633
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,920
would you have accepted that?

634
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,080
No, I wouldn't.

635
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,120
Exactly, and that's the end of it.

636
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,840
Khun Pi.

637
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,600
Khun Pi.

638
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:20,280
You said that you love me
as much as you did 20 years ago.

639
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,520
Is that true?

640
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,160
Yes.

641
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,600
Think before you answer.

642
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,920
You are taking too long.

643
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,520
I shall answer you now.

644
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,280
Khun Pi.

645
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,600
Khun Pi.

646
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,120
Mother,

647
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,240
what are your thoughts?

648
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,160
Regarding Rid and Pudtarn, Dech?

649
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,760
Yes.

650
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,280
I actually intended

651
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:39,840
to set aside my initial doubts
and accept that the choice of Rid's wife

652
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,520
should be up to him.

653
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,880
Is that true, Lady Champa?

654
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,920
Do you consider my words
to be untrustworthy?

655
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,480
I simply did not expect that you would--

656
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,080
I am old. I have retired.

657
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:11,880
From now on, when people are in love,
I shall not try to prevent it.

658
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,600
Lady Champa,

659
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:20,680
is there any way for Rid
to avoid marrying Praejeen?

660
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,360
If there is any possible way, I shall try.

661
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,000
I feel uneasy.

662
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,800
For lying?

663
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,240
There is no reason for you to feel uneasy.

664
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,680
People lie all the time.

665
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,240
Goodness, you are allowed to.

666
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,800
You have good intentions.

667
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,400
Prik, are you pushing it too far?

668
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,160
Indeed.

669
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,800
Are you pushing it too far?

670
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,600
Moreover, I do not trust Karaked.

671
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,000
She is likely to try to help Rid.

672
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,680
This might put everyone in great trouble.

673
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,080
A royal proclamation cannot be defied.

674
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:22,280
My daughter-in-law is unlike anyone else.

675
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,320
Do you not agree?

676
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,720
Yes, ma'am.

677
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,760
We could all lose our heads.

678
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,840
She is fully behind Pudtarn on this.

679
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,920
Well, that is her own relative.

680
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,640
You are already beautiful.

681
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,440
Is this okay? Do my lips look too glossy?

682
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,280
Too shiny?

683
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,160
Too red?

684
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,840
Oh no, they do not.

685
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,440
They look just right.

686
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,000
Let's go. I'm hungry.

687
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,880
Miss,

688
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,960
why must you go to Song Kwae?

689
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,000
I told you.

690
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,920
I will try touching
the Krishna Kali Manuscript

691
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,480
to see if it will take me home.

692
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,120
If you remain here,

693
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,600
I shall devote myself
to serving you until I die.

694
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,960
Please do not leave, miss.

695
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,640
I need to finish this.

696
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,640
What will Baron Maharit do?

697
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,000
I doubt this is good.

698
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,040
Why?

699
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:37,920
The baron appears anxious.
He likely has not slept all night.

700
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,320
I went to the dock at dawn.

701
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,720
I saw him sitting there, looking tense.

702
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,640
They seemed in love last night.

703
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,920
I think it's fine.

704
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,440
It's not.

705
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,000
I am sure of it.

706
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,200
A royal proclamation has been issued

707
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,720
for me to marry Praejeen.

708
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,880
Did you hear me?

709
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,800
Will you not say anything?

710
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,320
Will you marry her?

711
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,800
I must.

712
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,360
What will you do?

713
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,640
She is to be a royally-bestowed wife.

714
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,160
If I agree to be your wife,

715
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,680
what kind of wife would I be?

716
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,360
My father and mother

717
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,360
would come to formally
ask you to be my wife.

718
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,880
You would be called the klang muang wife.

719
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,120
What?

720
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,040
The klang muang wife?

721
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,880
It doesn't sound nice.

722
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:29,960
Not nice?

723
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,000
How so?

724
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:37,040
Klang muang is always associated
with something negative like…

725
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,120
What was it again?

726
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,640
I have heard it.

727
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,040
I remember.

728
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,880
Klang muang women
are immoral women, aren't they?

729
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,600
I do not know.

730
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,720
But a klang muang wife
is the primary wife.

731
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:58,880
The primary wife
to be followed by dozens of minor wives?

732
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,160
-Yes.
-Yes? How could you even say that?

733
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,640
You just came straight out with it.

734
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,800
I would not stand for it.

735
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,280
You would not stand for it?

736
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,040
No, I would not.

737
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,520
I'm not from here.

738
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,000
Where I'm from,
no one would accept it so easily.

739
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:14,800
Good.

740
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,680
How is it good?

741
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,440
I would not stand for it either.

742
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,040
Ming, what is it you wish
to discuss with me?

743
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,760
Well…

744
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,560
The matter at hand is this, Your Majesty.

745
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,120
Ming…

746
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,520
Whom does this matter concern, Ming?

747
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,280
It concerns…

748
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,200
It concerns me, Your Majesty.

749
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,040
Very well. Go on then.

750
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:30,800
Well…

751
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,600
Ming is afraid that…

752
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,240
Are you afraid of facing my punishment?

753
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,400
If you do not speak for yourself,
you shall face royal punishment.

754
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,840
I would like to request
a royally-bestowed wife.

755
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,400
Just one?

756
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,640
Yes, Your Majesty. Only one.

757
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,680
Very well.

758
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,040
Whom do you have in mind?

759
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,200
You know her, Your Majesty.

760
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:20,960
Is that so?

761
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,800
-I know her?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

762
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:24,880
Who is she?

763
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,400
You have known her since she was a child.

764
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,120
Is that right?

765
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,680
Excellent.

766
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:33,800
Who is she?

767
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,480
You know her brother as well.

768
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,560
Right.

769
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,520
That is even better.

770
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,880
Who is she?

771
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,440
Her brother used to serve as a royal page.

772
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,640
What else?

773
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,840
But as of now, her brother

774
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:01,000
has been assigned to duties elsewhere.

775
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,000
What else?

776
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,240
-She is a good person.
-What else?

777
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,000
She is of an age to find a suitable match,

778
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,360
-Your Majesty.
-What else?

779
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,480
You also know her father and mother.

780
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,680
Anything else?

781
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,800
If you would graciously bestow her,
I shall finally have a wife,

782
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,480
-Your Majesty.
-Very well!

783
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,240
I offer my congratulations.

784
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:26,200
Will you not inquire about who she is?

785
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,640
I would rather not. I do not want to know.

786
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,280
As I leave here,
the first person I come across,

787
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,120
I shall bestow them upon you.

788
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,240
Follow him, you fool!

789
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:46,840
Your Majesty.

790
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,240
It is Keaw, Rid's sister, Your Majesty.

791
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,680
Khun Pi,

792
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,240
has a royal proclamation been issued
to bestow Keaw upon Ming?

793
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,360
Yes.

794
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,560
Really?

795
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,560
Wait and see.
Keaw will never stand for it.

796
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:57,920
Khun Pi, both of our children
are in the same situation.

797
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,280
What is going on?

798
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,120
Will you accept it?

799
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,240
Will you give Keaw away to Ming?

800
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:17,640
You may accept it if you wish,
but I will never stand for it.

801
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,160
And I will not allow Keaw to stand for it.

802
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,840
It's all because of the king.

803
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,960
He doesn't own anyone's life.

804
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,680
Why would he order
anyone to be husband and wife?

805
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:38,000
If they want to be,
let them say so themselves.

806
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,160
You are confusing me.

807
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,720
If they want to be what?

808
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:48,040
My gosh, Khun Pi, be husband and wife.

809
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:18,600
No one can defy a royal command.

810
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,680
No one has ever tried before.

811
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,560
-Ming.
-Be careful, Prang!

812
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:27,359
But I don't want an arranged marriage.

813
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:30,920
I don't know anymore
if you want to marry him or not.

814
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,760
Who would do such a thing?

815
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,960
But it goes against our principles.

816
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,399
I don't understand the women
in my family at all.

817
01:09:37,479 --> 01:09:39,840
You have the same absurd ideas.

818
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,640
If Keaw truly loves Ming,
he needn't do anything.

819
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,680
Love will do the job.

820
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,720
I came to tell you
to prepare for the journey to Song Kwae.

821
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,000
