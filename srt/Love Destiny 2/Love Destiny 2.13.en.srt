1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,720
You have dark rings around your eyes.

2
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,720
Did you not sleep last night?

3
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,080
I am a little unwell, Your Majesty.

4
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,120
-You must throw her out.
-Throw me out?

5
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,400
Shut it, you commoner.

6
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,800
A commoner like me can't talk,

7
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,680
but a commoner like you can.

8
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,960
Please try this. It's good.

9
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,240
It's no ordinary rice with omelet.

10
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,000
Open up.

11
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,000
The Lantern Festival is in a few days.

12
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,520
Would you like to go? I can take you.

13
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,080
No, thank you.

14
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,600
I don't like going out.
I prefer lazing around.

15
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,720
As you please.

16
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,200
What brings you back, Baron In?

17
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,240
Are you leaving, Rid?

18
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
-No.
-Yes.

19
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,120
What? Aren't you leaving yet?

20
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,400
In, why did you come back again?

21
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,720
Did you know I was here earlier?

22
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,400
How could I not know?

23
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,720
You came here on the king's order.

24
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,560
I heard it.

25
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,880
That is true.

26
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,160
Baron In, how may I help you?

27
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,480
Tomorrow,

28
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,000
I would like to hire you
to fry me a few fish.

29
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,240
I shall present them
to my father and mother.

30
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,680
Certainly.

31
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,080
But if you want them to taste really good,
I need to use pork lard.

32
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,520
It's a bit pricey.

33
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,160
I shall give you the money now.

34
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,160
One baht should be enough.

35
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,160
You may save the change

36
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,440
for my next meal if that is all right.

37
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Certainly.

38
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,720
I shall do my best.

39
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,400
It's quite a profit.

40
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,440
And me?

41
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,480
Would you like some as well, Baron Rid?

42
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,400
I'll make it for you free of charge.

43
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,640
In exchange for teaching me
sword fighting.

44
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,200
It is only that I did not have the chance
to try any before.

45
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,400
I see.

46
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,360
Will you not charge me?

47
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,520
The money would be nice,
but one must be generous.

48
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,560
I like money very much,

49
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,560
but I like to earn it honestly,

50
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,040
using my own effort.

51
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,160
I don't exploit others
or let myself be exploited.

52
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,560
If you teach me sword fighting,

53
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,200
I will cook for you in return.

54
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,840
That's the best arrangement.

55
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,880
You speak in circles.
It is most incomprehensible.

56
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,640
You can't blame it on the speaker alone
if you can't comprehend.

57
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,880
I must take my leave for today, Pudtarn.

58
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,440
Will you leave with me, Rid?

59
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
I shall pick up Praejeen,

60
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,720
my sister, from your home.

61
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,400
She has likely finished
her cookery lesson with Lady Karaked.

62
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,120
You can go ahead.

63
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,920
I still have some matters
to discuss with Pudtarn.

64
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,560
What matters?

65
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,840
Well…

66
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,560
I no longer wish to know.

67
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,760
Yes, do it like that.

68
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,840
Keaw,

69
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,360
do you see it as I see?

70
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,960
Yes.

71
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,520
How so?

72
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,680
That our brother is in love.

73
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,880
I was not speaking of Rid.

74
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,480
Of whom were you speaking?

75
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,600
Of Ming.

76
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,000
Ming?

77
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,240
What did Ming do?

78
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,800
When we met him at the market,

79
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,600
the way he looked at you

80
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,520
was rather strange, was it not?

81
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,600
Yes.

82
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,480
Very strange.

83
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,440
Do you agree?

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I do.

85
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,800
Do you know why?

86
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,320
I do not.

87
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,400
But I do.

88
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,960
You said you know why.
Why are you not saying anything?

89
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,120
It is because Ming is in love.

90
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,560
Is that true?

91
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,280
Keaw, don't even think about it.

92
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,560
What?

93
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,600
To pretend you do not know.

94
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,840
You know it in your heart.

95
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,080
Come now, Prang.

96
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,280
I must maintain my composure

97
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,280
and be like…

98
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,520
What is it that Mother says?

99
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,280
The ladies of Si Ayutthaya.

100
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,320
Precisely.

101
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,840
Now we will prepare a dressing
called tamarind sauce.

102
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,800
Add tamarind juice.

103
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,360
Up to half of the pot.

104
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,600
Followed by sugar.

105
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,880
Keep stirring

106
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,039
until the liquid thickens.

107
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,000
In Song Kwae,

108
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,360
is this a common dish, my lady?

109
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,120
What dish, Praejeen?

110
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,600
Fried shrimp…

111
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,080
-With tamarind sauce.
-With…

112
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,680
Yes.

113
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,280
Fried shrimp with tamarind sauce.

114
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,600
I have never heard of it.

115
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,320
It is delicious.

116
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,680
In Song Kwae…

117
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,160
Yes, it is quite a common dish in my city.

118
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,000
It is also sold at restaurants.

119
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,360
Now, Praejeen,

120
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,640
pour it over the hot shrimp.

121
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,120
The sauce is also hot.

122
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,400
When you pour it,
it will create an appetizing sound.

123
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,360
Pour slowly.

124
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,360
Yes, my lady.

125
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,400
S…

126
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,480
Sort…

127
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,880
Sauce.

128
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,520
Yes, my lady.

129
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,880
Does it mean liquid, my lady?

130
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,520
You catch on quickly, Praejeen.

131
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,800
That is correct.

132
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,960
Sauce means liquid.

133
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,960
Does Baron Rid like it, my lady?

134
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,520
Pin and Yaem,

135
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,120
does Rid like
fried shrimp with tamarind sauce?

136
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,680
-He does not.
-He does not.

137
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,880
My lady,

138
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,920
please pour more.

139
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,560
That is not enough.

140
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,040
May I go to see Prang and Keaw?

141
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,320
She is so obvious.

142
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,720
Indeed.

143
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,320
Pay her no mind.

144
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,200
She is still young.

145
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,280
She has not yet learned
to hide her emotions.

146
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,200
By the way, in Song Kwae,

147
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,120
do they truly prepare
fried shrimp like this?

148
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,160
Yes.

149
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,840
Yes?

150
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,320
I have never tried it.

151
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,840
Just because you have never tried it,
that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

152
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,880
I have never tried it either.

153
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,840
That's more proof that it exists.

154
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,760
It exists.

155
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,040
But since when?

156
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,640
Have they not finished
their cooking lesson?

157
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,440
My lady,

158
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,280
how could they have finished?

159
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,840
Lady Praejeen has never shown
much interest in learning.

160
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,400
She is never very attentive.

161
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,920
When she arrives, she keeps glancing

162
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,560
left and right, searching for…

163
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,600
What is the matter, my lady?

164
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,880
Do you know?

165
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,080
I do not know.

166
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,200
I only asked you one question

167
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,080
and your response was as long

168
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,440
as the path from our house to the dock.

169
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,240
Nearly long enough to get on a boat.

170
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,200
-Chuang.
-Stop, Prik.

171
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,920
Do not blame Chuang.

172
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,240
I see it as worse than Chuang does.

173
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,720
What do you see?

174
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,280
I see Prik

175
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,680
getting on the boat

176
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,760
and paddling all the way
to the Chao Phraya River.

177
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,400
Goodness, my lady.

178
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,240
I do not have the strength
to paddle a boat.

179
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,520
Even if I did,

180
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,640
I would not make it
to the Chao Phraya River.

181
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,840
I would only reach
the mouth of Kleab Canal.

182
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,760
Do you see it the way I do, Chuang?

183
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,000
-Yes, I do.
-How so?

184
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,240
Prik is old and she talks too much.

185
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,000
My lady,

186
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,640
what are your plans regarding Lord Rid

187
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,760
and his frequent visits to Pudtarn?

188
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,120
I am not concerned.

189
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,440
Even if Rid takes Pudtarn as a wife,

190
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,160
I shall continue to await
Rid's royally-bestowed wife.

191
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,080
My lady,

192
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,360
do you hope for that to be Lady Praejeen?

193
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,960
Is that so?

194
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Praejeen.

195
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,360
I shall return home.

196
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,880
Have you not prepared a meal today?

197
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,080
I am not in the mood to learn,
as it is not a dish that Rid likes.

198
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,840
I shall be going.

199
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,760
What are your thoughts, my lady?

200
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,200
-What are my thoughts?
-Yes, my lady.

201
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,520
I am left speechless.

202
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,640
Do you not see?

203
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,800
I do.

204
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,280
Keaw, I would like to visit Pudtarn.

205
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,400
I would also like to visit her.

206
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,240
Pudtarn is preparing cosmetics for us.

207
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,280
Indeed. I would like to see the eyeshadow.

208
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,920
I would like to apply it to my eyes.

209
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,960
I shall be the prettiest teenager
in Ayutthaya.

210
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,600
You heard that from Pudtarn,
did you not, Prang?

211
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,960
Whose boat is that?

212
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,680
That is In.

213
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,800
Seeing both of you together is a blessing.

214
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,480
How is this a blessing, In?

215
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,360
If this is a blessing,
you should come every day for a blessing.

216
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,640
I shall be waiting.

217
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,160
Prang,

218
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,680
you are being spunky.

219
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,440
"Spunky"?

220
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,760
What does it mean?

221
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,880
It is from my mother's
Song Kwae language, In.

222
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,280
It means edgy.

223
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,560
"Edgy"?

224
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,080
-It means that--
-In.

225
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
I wish to return home now.

226
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,680
Wait, Praejeen.

227
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,160
Hold on for a moment.

228
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,080
I wish to return home now.

229
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,840
If you would like to stay,
you are welcome to.

230
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,320
I shall ask these two to paddle.

231
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,480
Praejeen,

232
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,720
mind your manners.

233
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,800
I have no desire for any of that.

234
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,360
Lady Karaked had me prepare a dish
that Lord Rid does not like.

235
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,320
I never expected

236
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,960
that she would mistreat me like this.

237
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,240
But you must bid farewell--

238
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,320
To…

239
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,760
In, it doesn't bother us.

240
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,280
Praejeen is still young.

241
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,920
Do not think too much about it.

242
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,440
Are you truly not angry with my sister?

243
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,080
Not in the least.

244
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,000
Do not worry about it.

245
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,360
Do what you think is best.

246
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,680
Please hurry, In.

247
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,480
Praejeen is in the boat.

248
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,920
Thank you to you both,

249
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,040
especially you, Prang.

250
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,760
Baron Chunphubet

251
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,880
was looking at you so strangely.

252
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,880
Of course, it is because I am pretty.

253
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,160
Why wouldn't he look at me?

254
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,080
And am I not pretty?

255
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,640
I wonder.

256
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,560
In's eyes did not light up.

257
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,880
You are doing it wrong, Prang.

258
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,120
How so?

259
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,600
-Here…
-You must make it tight like this.

260
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,640
Look at how I am doing it.

261
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,080
You must

262
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,560
bunch them together like this.

263
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,760
Speak of the devil.

264
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,240
Earl Srisornrarak is the only one
whose eyes light up when he sees you.

265
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,880
Prang, do not speak thoughtlessly.

266
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,960
If someone should hear--

267
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,640
I am not speaking thoughtlessly.

268
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Your dear Ming is right there.

269
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,880
Wait, do not turn around yet.

270
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
It would be best to pretend not to see.

271
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,520
Or would it be best to see?

272
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,640
My goodness.
He really is here, as you said.

273
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,120
What shall I do?

274
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,960
Perhaps he is here
to catch a glimpse of me.

275
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,080
That is not true.

276
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,000
Keaw.

277
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,320
Prang, stop this improper
and unbearable behavior.

278
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,720
Let us go upstairs. Now.

279
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,840
Wait.

280
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,440
Will you not greet him?

281
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,960
No.

282
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,680
Absolutely not.

283
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,640
You are being improper, my lady.

284
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,960
Look.

285
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,360
He is gazing at her so tenderly.

286
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,440
Please come upstairs.

287
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,640
Whatever you're angry about,
maybe it's better to share it.

288
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,200
You've been sitting there
like a stone lion for a while.

289
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,920
Has something come over you?

290
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,040
You told Baron Chunphubet that
you had something to discuss with me.

291
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,360
What is it?

292
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,040
In is the son of Kosathibodi.

293
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,200
He sailed to China once.

294
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,400
He has a bright future.

295
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,680
If you intend to return to your home,

296
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,640
you should not be
extending invitations to him.

297
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,120
Extending invitations?

298
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,920
What do you mean?

299
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
If he visits you often,

300
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,680
you two might become close.

301
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,400
When the time comes for you to leave,
In would suffer greatly.

302
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,040
Gosh, you're getting
a bit ahead of yourself.

303
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,560
Look,

304
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,560
he only asked to buy fried fish,
not my heart.

305
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,080
To tell you the truth,
you may fry fish for him

306
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,840
or use fried fish to lure him in.
That has nothing to do with me.

307
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,400
However, I see that you shall be
staying here for several months,

308
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,200
so I would like to warn you.

309
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,840
I shall be going.

310
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,440
That was pretty harsh.

311
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,200
Where are you hurrying off to?
Are you going to see Lady Praejeen?

312
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,040
Lady Praejeen holds
a much higher status than you.

313
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,800
You must not speak of her like this.

314
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,920
This is the second time you told me
not to speak of Lady Praejeen.

315
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,720
Why? Am I too lowly to speak of her?

316
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,680
Is Ayutthaya

317
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,960
so discriminatory that
some citizens can't mention others?

318
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,840
Okay, I won't mention her anymore.

319
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,360
And you, you're from the nobility too.

320
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,280
In the future, don't talk to me

321
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,640
or my common air will be blown onto you.

322
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,000
I do not understand if you are angry,

323
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,600
upset,

324
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,880
or pleased.

325
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,280
Pleased?

326
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,800
Glad?

327
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,200
You're putting me down.
I would be crazy to be glad.

328
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,200
You are not crazy yet.
You still make sense.

329
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,480
Go away. You're not making sense.

330
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,160
Do not forget

331
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,880
what I warned you about Baron Chunphubet.

332
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,600
I've already forgotten.
What did you warn me about?

333
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,040
What would've happened
if I hadn't caught you?

334
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,800
Do not let go.

335
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,680
Can I let go now?

336
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,480
So fragrant.

337
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,320
Hey. Don't you dare.

338
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
That's called sexual harassment.

339
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,760
Harassment?

340
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,440
I have not harassed you.

341
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,680
You did just now.

342
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,280
That was harassment.

343
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,680
I only said that you are fragrant.

344
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,320
How was that harassment?

345
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,840
I smelled a pleasant scent.

346
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,120
I only spoke the truth.

347
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,440
Your scent

348
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,360
is refreshingly pleasant.

349
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,200
Do you not believe me?

350
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,960
I do.

351
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,640
I have to.

352
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,200
Why wouldn't I believe it?

353
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,960
I do not actually have any matters

354
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,200
to discuss with you.

355
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,600
I just did not want to leave with In.

356
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,360
I was still angry.

357
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,600
What?

358
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,360
I thought you don't lie.

359
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,040
I would not say I lied.

360
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,680
What would you say then?

361
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,880
Only that I did not tell the truth.

362
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,160
What?

363
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,120
What an unpleasant sight.

364
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,600
The necklace.

365
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,240
Did you sell my necklace?

366
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,040
-Yes.
-To whom?

367
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,360
To…

368
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,720
A Khmer merchant?

369
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,640
I sold it to--

370
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,200
Has my necklace traveled far?

371
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
You did not sell it
to someone local, did you?

372
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,320
No.

373
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,440
Good.

374
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,880
I hope it travels far.

375
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,320
I have no desire to see it again.

376
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,960
I do not wish to see
anyone wearing it here.

377
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,400
Song, you liar.

378
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,280
You bastard.

379
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,080
When I find you, I shall kill you.

380
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,520
Klin!

381
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
Klin.

382
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,920
Hello, Baron Maharit.

383
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,560
Where have you been?

384
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,120
And where are you going?

385
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,120
Why are you in such a hurry?

386
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,320
I am going to the market.

387
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,640
Klin.

388
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,600
Klin.

389
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,160
Yes, my lord.

390
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,760
My lord,

391
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,520
might I ride with you?

392
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,840
I am in a hurry.

393
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,320
Where are you hurrying off to, Klin?

394
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,920
I am hurrying off to…

395
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,200
I do not know yet where I am going.

396
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,120
I must go look for someone.

397
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,200
I must find him first.

398
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,360
What if you cannot find him?

399
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,320
I must find him.

400
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,640
I am asking you,

401
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,320
what if you don't find him?

402
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,640
I must find him.

403
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,680
I must find him

404
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,680
and make sure he dies.

405
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,080
If you are not willing
to let me ride with you,

406
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,480
then do not waste time talking to me.

407
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,080
I shall be going.

408
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,520
My lord, do you not know I am in a hurry?

409
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,400
If you will ride at this speed,
allow me to get off and walk.

410
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,120
I shall arrive sooner.

411
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,480
I apologize. Are you all right?

412
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,280
Do not ask me. Please just go.

413
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,080
My lord!

414
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
My lord!

415
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,840
My lord!

416
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,520
My lord!

417
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,120
Please stop!

418
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,560
My lord, I am not in that much of a hurry.

419
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,840
Which is it precisely? You said you were.

420
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,400
I am, but only moderately.

421
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,760
Not so hurried as to risk
falling off the horse to my death.

422
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,960
I did not know

423
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,160
that our conceptions of urgency
would differ so greatly.

424
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,600
Thank you, my lord. I shall be going then.

425
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,480
My lord,

426
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,600
goodbye.

427
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,880
Nual.

428
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,280
Nual.

429
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,920
Come paddle for me.

430
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,240
Nual, hurry.

431
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,960
Yes, miss.

432
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,640
Nual,

433
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,360
-paddle faster.
-Yes, miss.

434
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,320
-Quickly!
-I'm going as quickly as I can.

435
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,880
Are you certain, Song?

436
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,680
Did you truly sell it to a Khmer merchant?

437
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,480
Yes.

438
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,120
Did I do well?

439
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,400
If I did,

440
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,880
I should be rewarded.

441
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,719
Song, you bastard.

442
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,360
-I said paddle quickly!
-Yes, miss.

443
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,639
-You paddle on that side.
-Yes, miss.

444
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,400
-I shall paddle on this side.
-Yes, miss.

445
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,639
Miss.

446
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,239
What are you looking at?

447
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,920
Hurry!

448
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,760
-Nual.
-Yes, miss?

449
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,480
You paddle on this side now. I am tired.

450
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,159
Yes, miss!

451
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,600
Paddle quickly!

452
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,560
Yes, miss! I am paddling quickly!

453
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,520
I am going as quickly as I can!

454
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,520
Have you seen Song?

455
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,440
I have not.

456
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,520
Has anyone seen Song?

457
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,640
I have not.

458
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,760
-Has anyone seen Song anywhere?
-I have not.

459
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,920
Has anyone seen Song?

460
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,960
Has anyone seen Song anywhere?

461
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,400
Have you seen Song?

462
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,920
Song.

463
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,600
You are dead!

464
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,920
Where are you going?

465
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,600
Come here!

466
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,720
-Come here!
-Klin!

467
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,640
-Come here!
-Klin!

468
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,400
Klin!

469
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,760
Klin!

470
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,800
-Come here!
-Klin!

471
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,200
-Gosh!
-Take this!

472
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,640
-I'll kill you.
-Klin!

473
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,240
Wait, Klin.

474
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,320
See what is happening here, good people.

475
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,560
You are acting as if you are in heat.

476
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,000
In heat?

477
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,920
Are you calling me an elephant, Song?

478
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,720
Do you see me as an animal?

479
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,080
I do not.

480
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,240
I have no intention of offending you.

481
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,640
You are pretty from head to toe.

482
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,480
How could I say
you are like an elephant or a horse?

483
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,560
Am I truly pretty, Song?

484
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,600
Yes.

485
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,800
You are the prettiest in Ayutthaya.

486
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,680
Unmatched by anyone.

487
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,040
I…

488
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,920
-I--
-What?

489
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,040
I am loyal to you.

490
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,040
Do not dare to say you are loyal to me.

491
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,640
If you are truly loyal to me,

492
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,440
tell me now to whom you sold the necklace.

493
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,800
It was not a Khmer merchant, was it?

494
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,440
If you do not tell the truth,
I shall kill you.

495
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,040
Why am I pressing you for an answer?

496
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,920
I saw that the necklace
has been returned to its owner.

497
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,320
Tell me right now.

498
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,560
Who bought it and returned it to Pudtarn?

499
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,400
If I tell you the truth,
please do not hurt me.

500
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,000
All right. I shall be gentle.

501
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,840
Even so, your strength could end me.

502
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,240
Enough smooth talk. Tell me now.

503
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,960
-You must promise me first.
-Song!

504
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,120
Tell me now!

505
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,280
-Klin, I am hurt!
-Come here!

506
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,080
-Help me!
-Hey.

507
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,440
Don't mind me.

508
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,440
I have no trouble with you.

509
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
My trouble is only with him.

510
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Come, Song!

511
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,120
-Come quickly!
-My shirt.

512
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,440
-Klin.
-Come!

513
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,000
-Out of my way! Come here!
-Klin.

514
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Klin.

515
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,960
Klin.

516
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,920
Put your hands down.

517
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,400
People might see.

518
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,920
Klin, forgive me. I have done wrong.

519
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,040
Do not talk. I know you have done wrong.

520
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,560
Just tell me
to whom you sold the necklace.

521
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,040
Baron Maharit.

522
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,080
That explains it.

523
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,720
Explains what?

524
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,040
You do not need to know my business.

525
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,720
You are a wretch.

526
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,960
Why did you not do as you said?

527
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,200
Song, you wretch. Why did you trick me?

528
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,320
Because…

529
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,440
-Well…
-Because what?

530
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,200
Tell me now.

531
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,640
If you don't,

532
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,200
I shall never see you again.

533
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,040
Stay out of my sight.

534
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,680
I do not wish to see such trash as you.

535
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,080
Klin, are you saying I am trash?

536
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,760
Yes, you are trash.

537
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,240
Just because I sold
that necklace to Baron Rid,

538
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,880
I have become trash?

539
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,160
Yes!

540
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,160
It was because Baron Rid saw.

541
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,720
-He saw you hand it to me.
-What?

542
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,560
He came to me to inquire about it.

543
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,080
Would you rather I lied to him?

544
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,040
Song, you wretch!

545
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,560
Are you a woman?

546
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,640
Why did you not tell me the truth?

547
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,880
This is why!
It is because I fear being killed!

548
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,160
-Take this!
-Gosh!

549
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,760
Klin!

550
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,680
Klin, forgive me.

551
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,160
I am truly loyal to you.
I am willing to do anything.

552
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,160
From now on, should you desire anything,

553
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,280
I shall not refuse you.

554
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,880
Good.

555
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,440
Remember what you said.

556
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,760
Another thing, do not think to court me.

557
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,360
Someone like you

558
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,680
will never even see my thighs,
just so you know.

559
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,040
Klin, I must…

560
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
What are you looking at?

561
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,680
Where did you let my granddaughter go?
Why did you not follow her?

562
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Please, ma'am.
She did not tell me where she was going.

563
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,320
You are her personal servant.

564
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,800
You must watch over her.
I have already told you so.

565
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
But…

566
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,400
Wait, Klin.

567
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,640
Where have you been?

568
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,600
The market.

569
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,520
Why did you go there?

570
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,800
It is my business.

571
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,200
Pardon me?

572
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,440
Do you not agree?

573
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,280
I don't meddle in your business.

574
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,760
When you think of or visit someone,

575
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,280
offering things to them,

576
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,920
have I ever stood in your way?

577
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,160
Never.

578
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,920
Klin, you…

579
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,920
You become more venomous
with each passing day.

580
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,960
Im,

581
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,320
she never tried to prevent me
from giving things to Pudtarn?

582
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,240
Is that right?

583
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,280
No, ma'am.

584
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,000
Im,

585
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,840
come here.

586
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,840
What may I do for you, miss?

587
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,280
Why must you ask? I told you to come,
so just come to me.

588
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,320
Why would you ask?

589
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,400
-Well…
-Well?

590
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,800
Well what?

591
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,760
Well what?

592
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,360
Why are you not talking?

593
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,560
-Klin.
-Im,

594
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,040
are you trying to talk back at me?

595
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,400
Klin!

596
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,600
It is none of your business!

597
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,520
You little brat. How dare you!

598
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,760
Grandmother.

599
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,640
From now on, I shall not meddle
in your business, I swear!

600
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,240
You shall not meddle
in my business either!

601
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,800
Even if I'm upset or in trouble,
just stay out of it.

602
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,240
No matter what, I am your grandmother.

603
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,040
I never overlook your joy and suffering.

604
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,840
If you do not tell me, how would I know?

605
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,920
You do not need to know.

606
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,840
Just know about those you care about.

607
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,000
Im.

608
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,040
Yes, ma'am.

609
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,280
Im.

610
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,840
If you do not come in,
never let me see your face again.

611
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,480
Yes, miss.

612
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,880
Miss.

613
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,640
Klin.

614
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,040
You were never like this.

615
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,960
In, act naturally,
or you will spoil everything.

616
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

617
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,280
Hey.

618
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,520
Yes, my lord.

619
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,560
No.

620
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,720
Well?

621
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,280
Say it once more.

622
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,320
Yes.

623
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,320
That is correct.

624
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,440
Come here.

625
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,960
-Take this.
-My goodness!

626
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,080
No!

627
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,000
Do not run!

628
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,920
Hey.

629
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,040
Hey, do not run!

630
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,760
Please!

631
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,320
Take this!

632
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,400
Mun is outnumbered.

633
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,240
He attacked me.

634
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,720
Hold on.

635
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,440
Slow down.

636
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,160
Gentlemen,

637
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,680
listen to me first.

638
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,440
Say what you need to say.

639
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,800
Mun has harmed his wife cruelly.

640
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,000
So what?

641
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,240
That is right.

642
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,840
That is my wife.

643
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,240
Why should me hitting my wife
bother anyone?

644
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,720
It bothers me.

645
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,760
It does not bother anyone.

646
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,520
But you are a man.

647
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,000
Is it right to harm
a woman who is your wife

648
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,440
or one who is not your wife?

649
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,440
Young man, have you lost your senses?

650
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,880
If a man hits his wife,

651
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,480
who would see it as wrong?

652
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,760
She is a wife.

653
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,840
She is supposed to be struck
by her husband.

654
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,120
If not, she would be a husband instead.

655
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,280
You speak without reason.

656
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,480
It is most grating to my ears.

657
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,080
For a husband and a wife

658
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,040
are both humans.

659
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,920
One should not harm the other.

660
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,800
What if your wife were to strike you
on the head with a pestle?

661
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,720
Would you stand for it?

662
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,760
You say some strange things.

663
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,400
How could I ever stand

664
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,640
for being struck with a pestle?

665
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,200
Why bother reasoning with him?

666
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,600
No!

667
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,720
You see?

668
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,320
You would not accept it, would you?

669
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,440
If that is the case,

670
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,480
why do you believe that your wife should?

671
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,640
Why must you keep talking?

672
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,200
A wife is expected to accept it.
It is customary.

673
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,920
Also, the law says she must accept it.

674
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,720
That is right. Who made these laws?

675
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,080
It's that lot in the palace.

676
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,280
All the noblemen and royalty.

677
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,840
What about the Tiger King?

678
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,360
He was as ruthless as a tiger.

679
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,360
He would strike and kick women.
Who knows how many he killed?

680
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,760
As for his son, the present king,
I've never heard anything about him.

681
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,080
My father had many women
who became his concubines.

682
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,640
He loved and cared for many of them.

683
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,520
But I have never heard of him

684
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,720
being so cruel as to kill
the women who served him.

685
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,200
Why do some people say so?

686
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,040
He was a king,

687
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,360
the leader,

688
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,920
the caretaker
of all the subjects in Ayutthaya.

689
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,840
How could he be so cruel as to take
a person's life as if they were an animal?

690
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,560
A person

691
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,480
who assumes the position
of the ruler of a kingdom

692
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,720
must be aware

693
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,280
that he receives love

694
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,360
and loyalty from the people.

695
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,360
As a human being,

696
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,160
who would consider betraying
the people who are loyal to you?

697
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,880
Why listen to his senseless words,
Your Majesty?

698
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,880
The people respect and honor you.

699
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,280
Some do not deserve your attention,
Your Majesty.

700
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,480
I truly want to slash his mouth
with my own hand.

701
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,720
Gossip is like water.

702
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,920
It cannot cut you,
just as a knife cannot cut a stone.

703
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,240
You came up with those words so quickly.

704
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,640
Shall I appoint you as a scribe, Rid?

705
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,160
No, Your Majesty.

706
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:24,280
My mother told me this
when I began my duty.

707
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,080
She said that the author

708
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,400
is regarded as the preeminent poet
in her city, Your Majesty.

709
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,360
Is that so?

710
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,160
Good.

711
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,640
The words are simple,

712
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,760
but they convey a profound message.

713
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,400
That is true, Your Majesty.

714
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,440
The words are simple
and require no interpretation.

715
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,800
There is one thing I fear.

716
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,240
If more and more people speak of it,

717
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,440
these stories

718
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,600
will spread and become widely remembered.

719
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,280
And in time,

720
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,640
they will be written down,

721
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,320
and people will accept them as the truth.

722
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,440
History.

723
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,640
What did you say, Rid?

724
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,720
My mother calls it history, Your Majesty.

725
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,560
It refers to written words.

726
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,040
That sounds rather strange.

727
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,960
What does Lady Karaked

728
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,760
call it?

729
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,560
History, Your Majesty.

730
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,040
Is it accurate, this history of yours?

731
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,040
Some of it is accurate and some not,
Your Majesty.

732
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,520
That is what my mother says.

733
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,360
History, you say?

734
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,040
I simply hope

735
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,120
that those who learn of things
from history

736
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,360
do not believe all of it.

737
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,480
Oh, my.

738
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,960
How is it, Perm? Is it good?

739
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,240
It is good, miss.

740
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,880
Perm, you are top-notch.

741
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,920
Really, miss?

742
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,200
Top of what?

743
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,920
Like this.

744
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,400
I see.

745
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,080
What do the servants
at the marquess's residence call this?

746
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,200
Hit the like button.

747
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,080
-Hit the like button.
-Hit the like button.

748
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,560
-Yes.
-Yes, miss.

749
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,680
Hit the like button.

750
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,800
Here, it's nice and dry.

751
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,240
Is that a heart shape?

752
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,400
Yes, a person's heart is shaped like this.

753
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,280
That is quite strange.

754
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,920
What color do you prefer?
I'll apply it for you.

755
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,720
This one is red

756
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,760
from sappanwood and nutmeg.

757
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,280
And this one is blue

758
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,760
from butterfly pea.

759
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,680
And this one is yellow-orange

760
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,520
from night-blooming jasmine.

761
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,080
These are so pretty, right, Eung?

762
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,560
Yes, miss.

763
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,520
If we could get civet oil,

764
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,080
we could make perfumed powder.

765
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,720
No, I don't want to use
too many ingredients for facial products.

766
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,040
If it spoils their faces,

767
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,720
instead of making a name for ourselves,
we might ruin our name.

768
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,280
Besides, I haven't studied this formally.

769
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,920
I don't know what ingredients to use
or how much of each to use.

770
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,840
Why don't you learn from Lady Karaked?

771
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,800
Both Lady Keaw and Lady Prang

772
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,160
have studied in the palace.

773
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,720
Perhaps they could teach you.

774
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,200
Interesting.

775
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,480
But let's leave that for later.

776
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,400
This should be enough for now.

777
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,520
I'll let Keaw and Prang try it first.

778
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,200
That way, I will have influencers
to help sell my products.

779
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,920
We should really make sure
the palace ladies get to see.

780
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,800
If they're interested,
they can place an order.

781
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,040
Then we'll make it for them.

782
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,520
When I'm not here anymore,
you can handle it yourself.

783
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,800
This way, you can make a lot of money.
It's great.

784
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,000
Doesn't that sound great, Eung?

785
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,320
Not at all.

786
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,160
Can't you stay here, miss?

787
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,960
Why must you go back?

788
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,600
You said

789
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,680
you are an orphan,

790
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,280
did you not?

791
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,280
I can't stay.

792
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,960
I still crave ice, bingsu,

793
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,600
and a few sips of refreshing fizzy soda.

794
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,080
Not to mention ice cream,

795
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,640
pancakes, and pizza.

796
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,560
My mouth is watering
just talking about it.

797
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,320
You seem to only miss food.

798
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,320
Well, one must live to eat.

799
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,640
Come to think of it, I feel like
I'm about to die of starvation.

800
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,240
Maybe I committed a lot of sins
in my past life,

801
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,960
and I became a hungry ghost.

802
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,760
That's why I enjoy eating in this life.

803
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,960
What was that about starving?

804
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,960
Miss says she is not staying.
She is going back.

805
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,080
She would like to eat food
back at her home.

806
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,720
Eung, this is considered gossiping.

807
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,240
Yes, miss.

808
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,360
Are you here alone, Baron?

809
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,760
Didn't you say…

810
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,960
What?

811
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,960
Who did you fight with?

812
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,920
You're a mess.

813
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,320
Yes.

814
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,120
Who did you all get into a fight with?

815
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,520
Be quiet. Do not talk about this anymore.

816
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,360
Do not talk back.

817
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,360
Yes, my lord.

818
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,560
Please have a seat.

819
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,360
I'll go and prepare your food.

820
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,000
Thank you, Pudtarn,
for being so accommodating.

821
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,440
Do you understand

822
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:24,520
my need to forfend my identity so closely?

823
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,720
Forfend…

824
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,840
Forfend, keep it concealed.

825
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,920
I see.

826
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,840
Yes, my lord. I understand.

827
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,920
Good.

828
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,640
Will my men and I have the chance

829
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,200
to enjoy a meal here again today?

830
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,160
Of course, my lord.

831
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,640
Thank you.

832
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,920
I shall prepare you the meal now.

833
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,320
You must eat it hot
or it won't be delicious.

834
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,840
I am most fond of her, Rid,

835
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,920
this relative of yours.

836
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,360
-Does it smell good?
-Yes.

837
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,720
Coconut shoot stir-fry with river shrimp.

838
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,840
Boiled vegetables topped with coconut milk
served with shrimp paste chili sauce.

839
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,960
Fish soup with taro, my lord.

840
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,360
And the last dish

841
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,040
is fried silver barb, my lord.

842
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,320
Did you grow the vegetables yourself?

843
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:25,200
Eggplants, bottle gourds,
winged beans, sponge gourds.

844
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,840
Did you grow them?

845
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,920
I picked them in Gui's orchard.

846
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,120
My vegetables are not fully grown yet.

847
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,360
You are growing your own vegetables?

848
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,440
Yes, my lord.

849
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,400
Would you like to see?

850
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,440
Please enjoy your meal.

851
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,320
Why are you smiling?

852
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,680
Let us share.

853
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,120
Is it good?

854
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,160
The vegetables are growing nicely.

855
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,480
I've got to hand it to you both.

856
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,960
-Hand it to us?
-Hand it to us?

857
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,080
That's right.

858
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,640
It means that I hand you
this work to do together.

859
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,040
Wait, maybe it doesn't.

860
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,760
What?

861
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,680
I've been living here
for less than a month, right?

862
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,560
Have I already forgotten
how to speak Thai?

863
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,480
They're feasting on it.

864
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,640
Perm, serve them the other fried fish
we prepared.

865
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,600
Yes, miss.

866
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,800
Too bad we won't get to eat any, Eung.

867
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,400
There is one more.

868
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,960
Come, Perm.

869
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,600
Pudtarn Restaurant.

870
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,200
Pudtarn,

871
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,240
your cooking is as good
as that of Lady Karaked.

872
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,040
That is…

873
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,680
an esteemed honor.

874
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,080
Wait.

875
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,080
Did you forget?

876
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,040
Oh dear, I forgot.

877
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,520
I have never done this before.
It is like I am acting in a drama.

878
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,840
What nonsense.

879
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,640
Regarding the silver barbs,

880
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,440
by the middle of the year,

881
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,240
I'm going to pass a law

882
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:39,320
prohibiting the catching and eating
of silver barbs for three months.

883
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,000
Silver barbs lay eggs a few days
before the rainy season begins.

884
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,480
That shall allow for a plentiful supply
of fish throughout the year.

885
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,120
What are your thoughts?

886
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,600
Why do you all seem doubtful?

887
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,360
I have already informed you.

888
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

889
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,800
What will be the punishment
for breaking this law?

890
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,160
I was thinking about one tamlueng.
What do you think?

891
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,240
That is just four baht.

892
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,120
I think five tamlueng would be better.

893
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,520
If the punishment isn't severe enough,

894
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,160
people may be tempted to break the law.

895
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,640
With a punishment as severe as 20 baht,

896
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,640
I think it would give people the chills.

897
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,240
-The chills?
-The chills?

898
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,560
It means that

899
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:35,240
they would be too afraid to dare try it.

900
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,840
She did not come from Ayutthaya.

901
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,280
That is why she speaks
in a peculiar manner.

902
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,520
I see.

903
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,080
Good.

904
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,040
Five tamlueng.

905
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,240
That is what it shall be.

906
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,320
That's the plan.

907
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,120
Pudtarn.

908
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,920
Now.

909
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,000
This is for the food.

910
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,600
We enjoyed it greatly.

911
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,800
Perhaps

912
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,880
I could send someone to learn from you.

913
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,120
Learn from me?

914
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,680
Yes.

915
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,680
Do not worry about your efforts
going unrewarded.

916
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,280
I shall pay you for your teaching.

917
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,280
No. I would be more than happy to teach.

918
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,960
You are so kind to me, Lord Phet.

919
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,920
I shall not take your money.

920
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,240
Do not feel obligated to please me.

921
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,080
If not,
how will you support your livelihood?

922
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,640
Rid told me

923
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,600
that you are an orphan.

924
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,600
You have come here to live on your own,

925
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:21,160
given that you are a distant relative
of Lady Karaked. Isn't that right?

926
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,200
It is late morning.

927
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,120
We must hurry and take our leave.

928
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,880
Do not forget.

929
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,000
When the law is enforced
in the middle of the year,

930
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,880
do not violate it yourself.

931
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,840
Otherwise,

932
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,040
I would become quite rich.

933
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,560
That's true.

934
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,400
In that case,

935
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,000
would it be better
to make the fine two fueang instead?

936
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,240
It is too late.

937
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,960
Five tamlueng.

938
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,680
That is my final decision.

939
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,560
So you may experience

940
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,640
the chills.

941
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:05,760
Yes, my lord.

942
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,840
Rid.

943
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,960
Yes, my lord.

944
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,480
You may return home.

945
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,279
You need not go back and forth.

946
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:18,160
Yes, my lord.

947
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,279
I shall be going.

948
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,640
Yes, my lord.

949
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,040
What?

950
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,800
What's wrong?

951
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,319
What?

952
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,760
At your age,

953
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,359
you should get married.

954
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,279
When selecting a spouse,

955
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,200
he must be of a similar status to you.

956
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,240
Do not get ideas above your station.

957
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:37,640
I shall have Rid pick you up
on the day of the ceremony.

958
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,160
What ceremony?

959
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,399
The Chong Prieng Ceremony.

960
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,200
Go spy on them on the day of the ceremony.

961
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,840
What are you planning to do?

962
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:48,240
-You are growing so nicely.
-Whatever she loves, I will destroy it.

963
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,560
What's the big deal about me
going to the Chong Prieng Ceremony?

964
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,399
I did not know

965
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,600
a person could change her mind
so easily in a day.

966
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,520
I have disturbed you.

967
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,360
Please forgive me.

968
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,200
