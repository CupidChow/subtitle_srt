1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,720
Did the person you asked to get the book
from your brother catch up with him?

2
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
Order an express rider
to go after Baron Ruang's convoy.

3
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,400
Did you just make the order?
You're trying to trap me here, aren't you?

4
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,080
-George.
-George.

5
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,520
Prince Dum, Your Majesty.

6
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,880
George!

7
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,320
Dum, you and I are no longer family.

8
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,680
Uncle Dum is our relative.

9
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Punish him

10
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,720
for trespassing in a prohibited area
and being defiant,

11
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,600
Your Majesty.

12
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
You're just the worst!

13
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,080
It hurts there.

14
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,720
It hurts there too.

15
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,880
It hurts so much.

16
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,680
Please stay still, miss.
You'll never heal otherwise.

17
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,600
It really hurts.

18
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,600
What is this medicine, Eung? It's no good.

19
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,440
It is a compress.
It contains many medicinal herbs.

20
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,640
What's in it, Eung?

21
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,360
Wait.

22
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,880
There's galangal,

23
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,640
lemongrass,

24
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,880
camphor, makrut lime…

25
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,120
What else?

26
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,120
Turmeric.

27
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,400
Who made it?

28
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,800
I did, miss.

29
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,960
Put rice in it next time.

30
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,600
Rice?

31
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,400
No one puts rice in a compress.

32
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,480
You know nothing, Eung.

33
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,560
The oil in rice is good for the skin,

34
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,960
and it helps with blood circulation.

35
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,280
Do you intend to stay here long, miss?

36
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,120
Why do you ask how long I will stay here?

37
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,720
So I can continue living with you.

38
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,560
If I'm not here, you can live with Gui.

39
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,000
If I were to live with Madam Gui,
I would be afraid of Miss Klin.

40
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,120
Why would you be afraid of her?

41
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,000
She is unpleasant to live with.

42
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,640
How so?

43
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,640
She does not see servants as humans.

44
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,360
How does she see you?

45
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,680
Something other than human.

46
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,160
She may scold, curse,

47
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,040
slap, strike, bash, elbow, or kick us

48
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,040
when it suits her mood.

49
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,880
Why do you put up with it? Fight back.

50
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,360
I am a servant, so I must put up with it.

51
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,920
If I fought back…

52
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,400
I would only end up hurting myself.

53
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,440
Emotional pain is bad enough.

54
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,880
If I were to invite physical pain too…

55
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,720
What?

56
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,040
I would be as foolish as a donkey.

57
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,080
I'm better now.

58
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,760
Eung, come on.

59
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,960
Perm, let's go.

60
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,080
You can dig now.

61
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,880
And use the soil to make…

62
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,960
What do you call it
when you raise the ground higher?

63
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,240
-A berm?
-A berm.

64
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,720
And we'll weave the bamboo

65
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,720
that we have and make…

66
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,160
a square pen.

67
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,840
We'll put it over the berm.
It'll look great.

68
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,640
How high should it be?

69
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,680
About shin high.

70
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,920
And at the top, we'll build a chicken coop

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,800
so the chicken droppings
fall into the fishpond.

72
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,880
Eung can help you.

73
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,080
I'm going to visit Gui.

74
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,280
Please let Eung accompany you.

75
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,200
It is almost dusk.

76
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,040
It shall be dark when you return.

77
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,960
Thank you, Perm.

78
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,120
Let's go, Eung.

79
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,560
How did you come by it?

80
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,440
So quickly as well.

81
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,960
I sold food, Madam Gui.

82
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,880
I brought the money
to buy back my necklace.

83
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,960
You have quite the skill for cooking.

84
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,600
You have earned the money
to buy the necklace back.

85
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,680
I underestimated you.

86
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,000
-Aun.
-Yes, ma'am.

87
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,920
Is your vegetable plot
growing well, Pudtarn?

88
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,240
I haven't bought any seeds yet,

89
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,360
so I made and applied fertilizer
to the soil first.

90
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,120
Have Perm and Eung take you to buy some
at Bang Kacha Whirlpool Market.

91
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,240
There shall be a variety
for you to choose from.

92
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,480
Aun.

93
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,160
What is the matter?

94
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,760
Ma'am,

95
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,640
I looked everywhere,
but it is nowhere to be found.

96
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,280
What did you say?

97
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,000
How could it not be there?

98
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,560
I do not know.

99
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,880
I did not take it, ma'am. I swear.

100
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,920
I know you would not do such a thing.
I shall find it myself.

101
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,440
What are you doing here, Klin?

102
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,000
What are you pacing around for?

103
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,360
Nothing, Grandma.

104
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,160
Okay.

105
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,840
Give me the keys.

106
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,080
It is not here.

107
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,680
How could it be gone?

108
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,600
Klin,

109
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,520
only you would dare do such a thing.

110
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,640
After all,

111
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,760
you're always
stirring up trouble with Pudtarn.

112
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Was it you who took it?

113
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,640
Grandma, do not blame me.

114
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,560
Did anyone see me

115
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,880
messing with your coffer?

116
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,080
Just because this deranged woman
has turned up,

117
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,360
will you blame everything on me?

118
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,800
Do not try to shift the blame.

119
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,000
If it was not you, then who was it?

120
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,560
In the past,

121
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,240
we have never had problems of this nature.

122
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,680
You are not a bad person.

123
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,240
But why is it that
since Pudtarn has come to live here,

124
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,880
you have behaved
as though she is an enemy?

125
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,640
What is the matter with you?

126
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,320
Where is my kind-hearted granddaughter?

127
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,480
You're right.

128
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,520
I despise that woman.

129
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,080
I despise her to the bone.

130
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,680
She insulted me.

131
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,000
She was going to slap me

132
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,080
when I only took her vegetables,
as you told me.

133
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,160
Since she threatened me first,

134
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,880
should I not

135
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
retaliate in kind?

136
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,440
I am your own granddaughter.

137
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,960
She is a stranger.

138
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,920
Why do you always side with her?

139
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,560
Tell me that you took it!

140
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,840
-Yes, I took it.
-Where is it?

141
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
I have already sold it.

142
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,440
You have already sold Pudtarn's necklace?

143
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,800
Why are you making such a fuss over it?

144
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,160
I can pay her for it.

145
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,360
-Klin!
-Stop!

146
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,320
You deserve a slap!

147
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,560
Please!

148
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,680
Do you realize now
that I am your granddaughter?

149
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,400
Not her!

150
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,360
Do you see how deranged she is?
She is deranged!

151
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,920
Shut up, Klin!

152
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,240
Please compose yourself, Pudtarn.

153
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,520
Do not slap her and tarnish yourself.

154
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,000
This could lead to charges
being brought against you.

155
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,160
I merely ask that
you do not report this to the authorities.

156
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,600
Whomever she sold it to,

157
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,800
I shall buy it back and return it to you.

158
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,560
However much it costs me,

159
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,560
I shall find it and return it to you.

160
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,120
What about her?

161
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,480
She did such a horrible thing.
Shouldn't she be charged?

162
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,480
Grandma!

163
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,080
Pudtarn!

164
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,280
I beg you!

165
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,120
Pudtarn, I beg you.

166
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,440
For her wrongdoing,

167
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,600
I will punish her myself.

168
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,000
Someone, find me a rope

169
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,440
and a rattan stick!

170
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,040
Tie her to the beam here!

171
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,320
I shall flog her myself.

172
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,520
Go.

173
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,080
Pudtarn,

174
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,200
you will never get your necklace back,
let me tell you.

175
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,360
To whom did you sell it?

176
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,440
Why?

177
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,280
Will you buy it back?

178
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,640
You'll have to find the Khmer merchant.

179
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,440
It's probably in Battambang by now.

180
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,720
Klin!

181
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,640
Pudtarn,

182
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,320
you are a bringer of misfortune.

183
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,920
You deranged woman!

184
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,600
You witch!

185
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Please, Grandmother.

186
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,480
I can no longer bear it.

187
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,800
Please do not flog me.

188
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,920
You have committed such a vile act,

189
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,360
Klin.

190
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,280
I shall never do it again, Grandma.

191
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,920
I shall never do it again.

192
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,240
Please do not flog me, Grandma.

193
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,240
I shall never do it again, Grandma.

194
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,680
I shall never do it again.

195
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,440
Please, Grandma.

196
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,400
Gui, that's enough.

197
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,760
Pudtarn.

198
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,920
I'm furious with Klin,

199
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,560
but you should not resort to violence.

200
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,000
Let's just say I'm willing to forget this.

201
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,040
As for my necklace,
if I don't get it back,

202
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,440
I'll consider it as the price
of your kindness.

203
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,640
Wait.

204
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,120
Pudtarn,

205
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,760
I am truly grateful.

206
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,080
I haven't forgiven Klin,
who has been cruel to me.

207
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,600
I will not forgive her so easily.

208
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,360
But I recognize your kindness
and your decency.

209
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,760
I know you punished Klin
out of love for her.

210
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,440
You just want her to do what is right.

211
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,920
I only gave in due to your kindness.

212
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,960
Consider this a punishment

213
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,960
for making me lose the one thing I had
to remember my parents by.

214
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,760
I know you are an orphan like me,

215
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,800
but you should know

216
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,080
how fortunate you are
to have a grandmother like Madam Gui.

217
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,760
Klin,

218
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,520
did you hear that?

219
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,119
Klin.

220
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,920
Im.

221
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,400
Yes, ma'am.

222
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,160
Untie her.

223
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,760
She's satisfied now!

224
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,319
My back is soaked with blood
from being flogged.

225
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,400
If she were truly a good person,

226
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,840
she would have said it
before I got flogged!

227
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,920
Miss.

228
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,720
Miss.

229
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,000
Miss.

230
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,040
Miss.

231
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,040
Miss.

232
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,000
Miss,

233
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,760
in any case, it is only an object.

234
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,920
When you are wealthy in the future,

235
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,240
you may buy as many necklaces
and lockets as you wish.

236
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,400
If you fret over it too much,
you could take ill.

237
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,320
Eung.

238
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,160
Can I hug you?

239
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh, dear.

240
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,600
Don't be startled.

241
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,040
Where I'm from,

242
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,400
people hug each other
when they want to show their love.

243
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,120
Get up.

244
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,160
Do you love me, miss?

245
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,560
Yes. I wouldn't hug you otherwise.

246
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,040
And what should I do?

247
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,800
Hug me back.

248
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,920
I cannot.

249
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,400
I do not dare to.

250
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,200
It's fine.

251
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,400
You will learn how.

252
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,280
Come on, let's go home.

253
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,720
Let's go.

254
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,680
Our home

255
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,520
Is happiness

256
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,200
Damn you, Pudtarn.

257
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,280
What would you do to her?

258
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,080
Grandma.

259
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,840
Yes, it is me.

260
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,720
As I suspected,
you still bear a grudge against Pudtarn.

261
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,840
Did you not hear

262
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,480
that she was willing to forgive?

263
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,000
She has not forgiven me.

264
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
-She has.
-She has forgiven you.

265
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,360
She has forgiven you.

266
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,160
I have not done anything wrong.
Why would she need to forgive me?

267
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,200
Im,

268
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,240
have you brought medicine?

269
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,440
Yes, ma'am.

270
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,680
Apply it to her wounds.

271
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,720
Did you not hear what she said?

272
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,120
She said she was willing to forgive.
But she did not forgive me.

273
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,880
She forgave you
as she feels indebted to you.

274
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,200
Since she has not forgiven me,

275
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,680
I shall continue to bear
a grudge against her.

276
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,840
No!

277
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,440
No!

278
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,640
Klin, come back here.

279
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,400
That child…

280
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,160
She is not a wicked person.

281
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,960
Am I right, Im?

282
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,040
Yes, ma'am.

283
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,680
What wicked spirit has possessed her?

284
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,560
Prince Dum was executed.

285
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,800
What became of Princess Kaew, Dech?

286
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,480
I heard that today,

287
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,360
the royal guards seized their possessions.

288
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,840
Goodness, how unfortunate.

289
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,840
Fortune plays no part in it, my lady.

290
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,040
A person who commits treason
deserves such an end.

291
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,240
How do you know he committed treason?

292
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,160
Everyone is talking about it.

293
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,920
You can ask Chuang.

294
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,680
Where?

295
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,440
Chuang is right here.

296
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,000
No!

297
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,000
I asked about where you heard it.

298
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,800
Are you pretending to be foolish?

299
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,640
Dear me.

300
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,680
Well, Chuang?

301
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,960
Well…

302
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
People are talking about it everywhere.

303
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,560
People passing by on boats

304
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,840
are even talking about it, my lady.

305
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,000
What is the story, Dech?

306
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,560
The prince held rather grand ambitions.

307
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,240
Gosh, he was overly ambitious, it seems.

308
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,600
Did he wish to become king, my lord?

309
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,080
He held a grand ambition.

310
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,200
He must have wished
for any grand position.

311
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,840
-What?
-I don't know.

312
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,400
What are you so confused about?

313
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,040
Do you not understand?

314
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,200
No.

315
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,040
I do not understand.

316
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,840
Is that okay?

317
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,440
Of course it is.

318
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,440
It is your fault
for speaking incoherently.

319
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,640
I only wish to know one thing.

320
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,000
You all muddied the water.

321
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Dech, will you speak more clearly?

322
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,120
And all of you, pay close attention.
Do not argue anymore.

323
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,800
It is wearing upon me.

324
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,400
Go on, Dech.

325
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,480
Yes, Mother.

326
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,880
The king had long suspected

327
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,480
that Prince Dum bore him ill will.

328
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,400
He had known for some time

329
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,800
that the prince was displeased
with his ascension to the throne.

330
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,080
Instead, Prince Dum desired

331
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,800
Crown Prince Bhorn to succeed the throne,

332
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,160
as before his death,
his father, the Tiger King,

333
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,600
had named him as his heir.

334
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,040
When he said before
that Prince Dum had a grand ambition,

335
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,480
he meant that Prince Dum wished to be
the father-in-law of a king.

336
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,720
Well, is it true that his father,
the Tiger King,

337
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,240
intended Crown Prince Bhorn
to inherit the throne?

338
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,080
Yes, Mother.

339
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,800
However, Crown Prince Bhorn

340
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,640
did not accept it.

341
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,080
He handed it to the king.

342
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,080
He handed it to him?
How did he do so, Dech?

343
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,840
The king's brother

344
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,360
offered the throne back
in the presence of all the attendees.

345
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,560
That explains it.

346
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,400
Prince Dum probably thought his son-in-law
had been denied what was his.

347
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,240
That was likely the case.

348
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,520
He was overly ambitious.

349
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,440
I have no desire to be king.

350
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,280
Whatever action Uncle Dum took,
I had no part in it,

351
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,800
nor did I have any knowledge of it.

352
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,240
May it be understood.

353
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,800
Khun Pi.

354
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,920
Yes?

355
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,240
How many wives did Prince Dum…

356
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,120
I mean, how many concubines did he have?

357
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,440
He had many.

358
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,480
Why do you ask?

359
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:16,360
I am only curious as to what they will do
now that their pillar has been toppled.

360
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,600
Those who have grown children
shall reside with them.

361
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,080
Those that do not
shall return to their parents.

362
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,120
And those with small children?

363
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,200
They must care for them on their own

364
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,400
because all their possessions
have been seized.

365
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,720
What if they have no one,
no father, mother, or children?

366
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,880
They shall live on their own.

367
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,280
Oh, my.

368
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,480
How would they make a living?

369
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,240
No one shall go hungry in Ayutthaya.

370
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,800
The existence of almshouses for the poor
is kindly ensured by the king.

371
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,120
-Khun Pi.
-Yes?

372
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,240
Men have many wives.
Will there be enough women?

373
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,120
Why do you ask such a question?

374
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,080
I do not understand.

375
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,360
Well, since Viscount Pan has 22 wives,

376
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,880
that means 21 men
won't be able to find a wife.

377
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,520
I have never seen a man
who does not have a wife.

378
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,360
Every man has a wife.

379
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,240
How could that be?
There are equal numbers of men and women.

380
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,880
If one man has many wives,

381
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,120
that means some men
would not be able to find a wife.

382
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,200
I have never seen a man without a wife.

383
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,200
Every man has a wife.

384
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,800
Is that right?

385
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,000
Does that mean
there are more women than men?

386
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,000
That is the case.

387
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,720
There are more women than men.

388
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,400
That is not true.

389
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,080
There are equal numbers of men and women.
It is the natural law.

390
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,920
What law?

391
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,840
It is…

392
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,480
It is science.

393
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,520
Men and women are born in equal numbers.

394
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,280
Science.

395
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,240
Is it similar to history?

396
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,360
Oh dear, this is getting difficult.

397
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,200
I guess I should stop now.

398
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,920
Right, I got it.

399
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,280
Some men have only one wife,

400
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,960
like someone around here.

401
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,720
What are you looking at? Turn around.

402
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,200
You make no sense sometimes.

403
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,960
I won't talk then.

404
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,240
I'll just act.

405
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,720
Does that make sense?

406
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,920
It is starting to.

407
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,920
No, Khun Pi.

408
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,120
Khun Pi, wait.

409
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,840
Now, do not resist.

410
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,240
-Do not resist.
-Khun Pi.

411
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,760
Khun Pi, there are many people outside.

412
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,080
Khun Pi, no.

413
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,440
Khun Pi, there are people outside.

414
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,200
Khun Pi, no.

415
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,520
Come.

416
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,720
-Hey. Leave.
-Leave.

417
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,400
Leave.

418
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,480
Khun Pi.

419
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,840
Yaem.

420
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,080
-Come.
-All right.

421
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,639
Let me lean on your chest. I'm tired.

422
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,920
You're just the worst!

423
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,040
Khun Pi, no.

424
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,320
Khun Pi, not now.

425
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,040
Khun Pi.

426
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,040
There are people outside.

427
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,640
Choi.

428
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,120
What are you looking at?

429
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,600
The marquess and the lady

430
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,480
-must be--
-Choi!

431
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,680
Do you not think what you are saying
is a bit presumptuous?

432
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,360
Khun Pi.

433
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,480
Many people are outside.

434
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,520
Stay here.

435
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,520
I know

436
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,680
where you are headed.

437
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,720
Then you may follow.

438
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,840
Why are you building this, Perm?

439
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,000
You can sleep in front of my house.

440
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,800
That is not good.

441
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,320
Should a man and a woman live together,
it would surely spark much gossip.

442
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,720
Your name would be sullied.

443
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,640
He has slept there for many nights.
No one has said anything.

444
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,040
The first few days were fine,
as there was nowhere else.

445
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,920
But as some time has now passed,

446
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,880
it is only proper
that he has his own place.

447
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,120
And you are not married, miss.

448
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,800
It would not present well.

449
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,920
Gosh.

450
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,360
When can I go to the market
to buy vegetable seeds?

451
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,120
Let us wait for…

452
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,240
Perm to finish preparing his house.

453
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,000
Then let's find something fun to do.

454
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,680
Let's go, Eung.

455
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,160
Will ants be drawn to our faces?

456
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,760
No, they won't.

457
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,040
How long until this is finished, miss?

458
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,480
No talking or it will mess up our faces.

459
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,320
Let me ask you something.

460
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,560
Why did you say "prepare" the house?

461
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,680
Why not "construct" or "build"?

462
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,440
Why do you say "prepare"?
Like you "prepare" food or something.

463
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,320
You said no talking.

464
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,840
I'll stop.

465
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,080
Eung, do you think
that high-and-mighty Maharit

466
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,280
will come here again?

467
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,320
Certainly.

468
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
What did you say?

469
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,840
I said, certainly.

470
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,800
What? Why did you scream?
What's the matter?

471
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,800
Your…

472
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,600
Miss told me
to mix egg whites with white clay

473
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,880
and apply it on our faces.

474
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,760
Why?

475
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,360
To make our faces firm, free of blemishes,

476
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,040
clear of freckles, bright, and smooth
like the face of a newborn.

477
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,160
Eung, what are you saying?

478
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,280
Miss said so, Choi.

479
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,960
Don't argue. I'll go wash my face first.

480
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,360
Come on, Eung, let's wash our faces.

481
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,720
Wait for me.

482
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,840
My lord.

483
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,520
What are you doing?

484
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,520
Truly as bright and smooth
as a newborn, Choi.

485
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,520
It is true.

486
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,160
As for Eung,

487
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,000
she looks like
she was born some years ago.

488
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,680
Choi,

489
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,080
some days would suffice.

490
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,160
I shall bring you water.

491
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,040
Baron Rid,

492
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,160
what's the matter?

493
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,200
Nothing. Nothing is the matter.

494
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,040
I am perfectly well.

495
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,960
Why are you here today?
You were angry with me the other day.

496
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,280
I have come to tell you that

497
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,400
in order to make amends
for not bringing you the book,

498
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,320
I shall ensure you do not suffer

499
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,080
and that you have
peace of mind living here.

500
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,960
If you register as a commoner
under my father's authority,

501
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,960
no one shall harass you again.

502
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,640
Fine. I don't seem to have a choice.

503
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,600
Okay.

504
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,640
Perm is rather skilled
at assembling houses.

505
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,720
Baron,

506
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,440
shall we return…

507
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,320
Goodbye then.

508
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,360
Where are you going?

509
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,600
I'm going to the market
to buy vegetable seeds and white clay.

510
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,800
Let's go, Eung.
Tell Perm to paddle the boat for us.

511
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,440
What about the water?

512
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,000
The baron won't drink it. He's leaving.

513
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,160
Look.

514
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,600
You are new here. You do not know the way.

515
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,320
If I accompany you,
I can help you if you have any inquiries.

516
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,600
That's fine. We can go on our own.
I don't want to bother you.

517
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,800
Eung, you still haven't gone to get Perm.

518
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,360
Yes, miss.

519
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,280
Get the money from the house for me too.

520
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,920
Yes, miss.

521
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,400
My master

522
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,520
is the son of Marquess Wisut Sakorn.

523
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,440
He oversees the docks and rafts
throughout Ayutthaya.

524
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,880
If we join you, we could help you

525
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,800
gather all that you need
better than if you go alone.

526
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,880
You can come if you want.

527
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,200
But I didn't ask you, all right?

528
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,520
Choi.

529
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,280
I am not laughing.
It's not funny, I just don't…

530
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,880
-know your intentions.
-Careful.

531
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,480
I see,
it's Damnoen Saduak Floating Market.

532
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,640
Yes, it is a floating market.

533
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,160
What did you call it just now?

534
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,000
Damnoen Saduak.

535
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,240
What is it?

536
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,960
It's the name of the floating market.

537
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,840
Hey, Choi,

538
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,240
did you know that?

539
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,600
I did not.

540
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,480
I decided to give it a name.

541
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,640
Isn't it a fitting name?

542
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,600
You see, my father

543
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,920
was in a boat near here that capsized,
and he nearly died.

544
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,240
Why didn't he die?

545
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,200
It's a serious question.

546
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,120
My mother saved him.

547
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,560
When my father was given the task
of overseeing the houseboat area,

548
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:12,800
he decided to build a floating market
that is safe and secure.

549
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,280
It's fine, Eung.

550
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,040
It is hot.

551
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,880
It is hot, my lord.

552
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,440
It is fine, Choi.

553
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,920
Legume seeds.

554
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,160
-What beans are these?
-Black beans, ma'am.

555
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,560
I'll take black beans,

556
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,920
peanuts, soybeans…

557
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,480
And what are those?

558
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,040
Marigold seeds, miss.

559
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,640
I'll take those too.
They should grow beautifully.

560
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,880
Thank you.

561
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,040
Thank you, sir.

562
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,560
Neem with grilled shrimp will be great.

563
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,120
Get galangal root
and ginger root too, Eung.

564
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,520
Holy basil, even the red variety.

565
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,880
It looks great.

566
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,960
These too.

567
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,840
Sappanwood.

568
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,240
Will you take it, ma'am?

569
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,320
Yes, we can make powder with it.

570
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,600
How so?

571
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,840
It's red.

572
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,120
You mix it to make
a pressed or loose powder.

573
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,360
Eung, this too. Safflower.

574
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,680
Six fueang, ma'am.

575
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,520
Here you are.

576
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,960
White clay. This is good.

577
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,880
-How…
-How so?

578
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,360
You can mix it with egg white

579
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,360
and apply it to your face
like we did earlier.

580
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,280
It is not good to buy too much.
It might spoil if you store it.

581
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,360
And we could not possibly carry it all.

582
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,920
Then we should get just enough.

583
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,960
Darn it, paddle faster!

584
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,720
Where are you hurrying to, miss?

585
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,080
Do not ask, just paddle.

586
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,840
Do you not understand?

587
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,360
She does. How could she not?

588
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,880
Your command was loud, much like thunder.

589
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,120
Do not complain, Im. Paddle quickly.

590
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,520
Yes, miss. Hurry up.

591
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,200
Quickly.

592
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,200
Miss.

593
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,920
-Darn it.
-Quickly.

594
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,560
Help her.

595
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,720
I am hurt, can you not see?

596
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,080
Yes, miss. Hurry now.

597
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,120
Goodness.

598
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,920
-Faster.
-This is the fastest I can do, miss.

599
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,720
Where are we hurrying to?

600
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,040
And limestone powder, ma'am?

601
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,800
Good. This is a good quality ingredient.

602
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,600
Now we can open a cosmetic factory.

603
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,600
-What is this?
-White beeswax.

604
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,760
I'll take it.

605
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,000
I also saw turmeric and plai branches.

606
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,400
Perm, buy them for me.

607
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,400
Get many branches.

608
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,440
Why are you buying so much?

609
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,280
Darn it.

610
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,040
Where is he?

611
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,200
Who, miss?

612
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,480
Stay out of this.

613
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,560
Wait over there. Do not follow me.

614
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,440
Madam Gui told me
to accompany you in case there--

615
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,520
Go.

616
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,320
Yes, miss.

617
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,040
Have you seen Song?

618
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,000
I saw him over there.

619
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,840
Pudtarn.

620
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,080
She coerced him into coming to the market.

621
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,760
You cunning woman.

622
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,600
Darn it!

623
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,760
-Would you like it?
-Yes.

624
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,960
Give me money.

625
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,120
Why did you strike me?

626
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,480
Are you Kam?

627
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,520
Yes.

628
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,960
You were married to Eung.

629
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,600
Ayutthaya is quite a haven for shoppers.

630
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,080
I see markets everywhere.

631
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,360
You are right.

632
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,280
Ayutthaya

633
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,920
has many markets.

634
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,240
What are you looking for?

635
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,480
I can take you to the best places.

636
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,120
-Clothes.
-I see.

637
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,240
At Chong Kud Gate,

638
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,240
there is a ferry dock

639
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,640
for crossing to
Phra Chao Nang Choeng Temple

640
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,720
in Tha Sai district.

641
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,320
What temple again?

642
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,960
Phra Chao Nang Choeng Temple.

643
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,040
Right, I got it.

644
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,560
It's Phanan Choeng Temple.

645
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,440
What did you say?

646
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,920
Did you hear?

647
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,280
I did not.

648
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,080
That's because I didn't say anything.

649
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,000
In Tha Sai district,

650
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,960
there are all sorts of sompak garments.

651
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,920
Cha Krai Yai district
has a woven fabric market.

652
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,720
My two sisters
often go there to make purchases.

653
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,080
When people of noble birth
come to make a purchase,

654
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,480
the merchants are delighted,

655
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,720
as they rarely haggle.

656
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,200
This is especially true of my two sisters.

657
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,760
Where is the thrill in that?

658
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,720
What?

659
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,400
You don't know anything.

660
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,320
When you go shopping,
and you haggle the price down,

661
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,520
it's such a thrill.

662
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,360
How else would shopping be fun?

663
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,680
Are you confused?

664
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,120
"Thrill"

665
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,880
means enjoyment.

666
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,240
So "such a thrill" means

667
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,400
most enjoyable.

668
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,920
Nailed it.

669
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,040
And will you go…

670
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,960
Perm, get a move on!

671
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,720
Bah! How dare you be rude?

672
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,480
Do you not remember
what our mistress said?

673
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,240
She told you to be polite to me.

674
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,200
She did not say to do so at the market.

675
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,640
You dummy.

676
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,640
"Dummy."

677
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,520
You…

678
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,600
You brat.

679
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,240
Yes! Oh, dear.

680
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,720
I'll take the grilled ones. Three of them.

681
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,000
Certainly. Three of these?

682
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,760
How much for three of these?

683
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,760
Six bia.

684
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,760
Each one costs two bia.

685
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,240
I'm buying three.
Won't you give me a discount?

686
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,520
Here.

687
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,720
Thank you.

688
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,080
For people of noble birth and wealth,

689
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,400
bargaining can damage
their image and reputation.

690
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,400
It's so hard to live in this place.

691
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,440
But there is something
people with plenty of wealth

692
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,080
do not have to waste time haggling over.

693
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,560
You don't understand.

694
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,840
Then forget it, my lord.

695
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,320
What's the matter?

696
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,120
Nothing is the matter.

697
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,080
Is that true?

698
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,360
Why would you think
I would say something that was not true?

699
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,320
Your face says otherwise.

700
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,480
Why did you buy this many items?

701
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,520
Yes, right.

702
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,680
"Yes, right"?

703
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,160
What does it mean?

704
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,680
It does not mean anything.
I'm just changing the subject.

705
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,680
Changing from what subject?

706
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,280
And changing to what subject?

707
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,280
Oh, my.

708
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,800
Where do I go from here?

709
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,680
Where would you like to go?

710
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,480
If you tell me, I can take you.

711
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,920
I would like to go home.

712
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,480
I see.

713
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,680
There's no need to worry.
This course shall take us home.

714
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,120
Indeed.

715
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,480
Thank you indeed.

716
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,200
Say what you want to say, Baron.

717
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,720
She would like to say something,
but she will not say it.

718
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,240
You want to tell me I'm pretty, right?

719
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,760
It's only because
she resembles Mother that I like her.

720
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,560
No, I do not like her.

721
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,960
What don't you like, Baron?

722
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,600
Choi, Kaew.

723
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,640
I wish to return home today, not tomorrow.

724
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,480
Of course today, young lord.

725
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,120
Paddle faster. Why so sluggish?

726
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,920
I am paddling as--

727
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,120
Do not talk back.

728
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,480
We are paddling as we usually do, my lord.

729
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,800
Are you challenging me, Kaew?

730
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,160
You are looking at me
with amusement again.

731
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,200
Of course. I'm amused.

732
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,320
And I'm curious too.

733
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,000
Why are you curious?

734
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:04,000
I'm curious as to why you are so upset,

735
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,240
my little lord.

736
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,160
You are laughing at me
as if I were a jester again.

737
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:18,120
Choi, Kaew, paddle even harder.

738
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,120
I would like to be home now.

739
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,120
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

740
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,040
Perm,

741
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,720
the baron's boat is getting away from us.

742
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,640
Do you know, Kam,

743
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,960
that Eung's mistress
wants her to take a new husband?

744
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,360
But I sold Eung to Madam Gui.

745
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,440
What mistress?

746
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,600
My grandmother gave Eung to that woman.

747
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,120
She is called Pudtarn.

748
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,440
She is most wicked.

749
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,160
If you stand idly by,
you will lose your wife.

750
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,600
I'm telling you out of kindness.

751
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,000
You must nip it in the bud, Kam.

752
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,280
Pudtarn is the key.

753
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,160
Aren't you coming up, my little lord?

754
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,480
What? I'm asking nicely.

755
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,480
Kaew, why are you lingering?

756
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,840
Yes, my lord.

757
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,880
Will you not walk home, my lord?

758
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,240
-No!
-Oh, dear.

759
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:04,240
You prefer to return home this way.
It is quicker than by boat.

760
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,480
Who says?

761
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,800
-Well?
-Kaew.

762
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,000
-Who says?
-The baron.

763
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,360
The baron…

764
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,200
Hurry now. I am in a hurry.

765
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,680
Where to?

766
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,720
Must I tell you everything?

767
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,840
Very well, my lord.

768
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,000
Oh, dear.

769
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,000
-Quickly!
-Yes, my lord!

770
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,120
Gosh.

771
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,200
Where is he rushing off to?

772
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,840
The baron is one of the king's
trusted royal pages.

773
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,360
He may be needed at the palace.

774
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,680
Why would he go there now?
It's getting late.

775
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:00,400
I heard him say that he was hurrying home.

776
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,760
Then I suppose someone
is waiting for him at home.

777
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,720
Lady Karaked.

778
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,160
My lady, hello.

779
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,200
I'm so happy.

780
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,400
I have missed you.

781
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:50,200
I have missed you too.
But I could not come any sooner.

782
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,520
Have you been busy?

783
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:59,720
A dear friend of my son, Rid,
suddenly passed away recently.

784
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,000
I had to console his mother.

785
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,320
Have you ever heard
the name Thao Thong Kip Ma?

786
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,760
Thao Thong Kip Ma?

787
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,000
Thao Thong Kip Ma?

788
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,960
The one who made the desserts?

789
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,760
That's right.

790
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,280
Does she live here?

791
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,000
In real life?

792
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,520
Is that true?

793
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,440
What, Eung? Why are you pulling me?
Something might come off.

794
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,200
Please sit.

795
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,120
Why should I sit? I'm not tired.

796
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,680
This does not present well. Please sit.

797
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,880
If anyone saw, they would gossip.

798
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,840
It is fine, Eung.

799
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,560
I do not mind.

800
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,440
Come with me.

801
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,880
I need to ask you something.

802
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:47,880
Yes, my lady.

803
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,000
What do you need to ask me?

804
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:02,160
I would like to ask you this
because you look like me.

805
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,400
You came from the same place as I did.

806
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,080
And we were there during the same period.

807
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,640
We might be related.

808
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,720
What are the names
of your parents, if I may ask?

809
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,760
My mother's name was Vipawan.

810
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,040
My father's name was Chaimitr.

811
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,320
Both of them have passed away.

812
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,160
Do you have an aunt named Vipavee?

813
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,640
That's right.

814
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,920
We are related.

815
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,560
Do you know Grandma Sipang?

816
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,640
Yes.

817
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,760
She has ordained as a nun at a temple.

818
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,840
And your great-grandmother, Nual?

819
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,160
Who does she live with?
Is she also at the temple?

820
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,840
Great-grandmother Nual passed away.

821
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,560
I should have known.

822
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,360
My grandmother was very old when I left.

823
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,600
Your…

824
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,760
Sipang

825
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,320
is my mother.

826
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,640
You are…

827
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,200
My name is Ketsurang.

828
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,800
That was my name
before I entered Karaked's body.

829
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,680
I knew that
my grandma had a daughter named Ketsurang,

830
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,560
who died in a car accident.

831
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,240
I was very young at the time.

832
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,520
We are related.

833
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:25,280
I am a cousin of Vipavee
and your mother, Vipawan.

834
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,760
Has Grandma Sipang been well?

835
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,160
Have you seen her at all?

836
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,480
She was well.

837
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:38,000
Aunt Vipavee took me to visit her
only a day before I got transported here.

838
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,320
What temple does she live at?

839
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,160
It's on the outskirts of town.

840
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,560
Phra Rueangrit is also there.

841
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,440
He'll likely remain ordained for life.

842
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,920
I'm sorry, Tarn.

843
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:11,920
I miss my mother.

844
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,960
Auntie, I understand.

845
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,440
Please sit down.

846
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,200
Are you feeling better?

847
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,480
Yes, thank you so much.

848
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:58,400
Pudtarn,

849
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,280
if you have any trouble here,

850
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,720
please don't hesitate to tell me.

851
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,560
Thank you.

852
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,520
That includes money trouble.

853
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,760
And you can keep it.
You don't need to pay it back.

854
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,600
I still have enough.

855
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:22,320
But if I run short, I will come to you.

856
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,000
Auntie.

857
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,320
I don't know why
the two of us have ended up here.

858
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,600
I don't know how to say this, but…

859
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:51,440
I feel very lucky to have met you,
as you came here before me.

860
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,920
How have you managed to live here alone,

861
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,640
in this place, among these people?

862
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,600
I really respect you for this.

863
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,320
Because I found love.

864
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,040
Love?

865
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,040
That's right.

866
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,680
I remembered that it was your necklace
with that strange pendant,

867
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,040
so I bought it.

868
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,600
Our son is becoming a man.

869
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,880
Our son is totes adorbs.

870
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:52,479
I want to make bras.

871
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,000
-What is it?
-What is it?

872
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,880
You use it to hold your breasts like this.

873
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,040
-Hold your breasts?
-Hold your breasts?

874
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,960
Breast holders by Pudtarn.

875
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,479
Are you certain he's unmarried, In?

876
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,720
I have never seen him
lay eyes on any woman.

877
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,479
Lady Praejeen came to see you.

878
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,960
She must be dying
to join your two families together.

879
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,120
-Kam!
-Hey!

880
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,720
Is this your new mistress?

881
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,080
I'll kill you!

882
01:09:55,680 --> 01:10:00,680
