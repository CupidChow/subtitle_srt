1
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,920
Let me touch the manuscript.

2
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,960
You must choose
whether to return to your present life

3
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,640
or to Ayutthaya.

4
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,080
I know now what I must choose.

5
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,720
Goodbye, Your Holiness.

6
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,640
Please do not go anywhere again.

7
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,080
Stay here with me.

8
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,160
I'm grateful that destiny

9
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,600
sent you to me.

10
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,080
Above destiny is the king.

11
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,000
Eung, do you believe in past life enemies?

12
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,400
I do. Everyone has them.

13
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,880
Right?

14
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,800
I have many.

15
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,640
Lady Champa is definitely one of them.

16
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,920
Another one must be Klin.

17
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,440
Klin hates me
because she's my past life enemy.

18
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,800
I must have wronged her in a past life.

19
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,280
You don't hate me,
meaning you're not my past life enemy.

20
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,240
I think that
everything I do and everything I am

21
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,520
has a reason behind it.

22
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,440
However, our souls are blind to it

23
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,720
and we don't always understand this,

24
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,160
so we think life is unfair.

25
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,680
Everything has a reason behind it.

26
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,760
Absolutely, miss.

27
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,640
My dear customers,

28
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,640
we have a special dish to offer you today.

29
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,760
What is it?

30
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,600
It's spicy and sour soup, ma'am.

31
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,040
Do you want some?

32
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,880
Look.

33
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,920
-Hey, why did I get less than her?
-Right.

34
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,600
I gave you both the same, ma'am.

35
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,000
It's not the same. I can't accept this.

36
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,760
It's only a little less, ma'am.

37
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,720
No, it's a lot.

38
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,840
How on earth did you serve it?

39
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,320
Just like this.
Don't eat it if you don't want to.

40
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,280
Damn customers.

41
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,520
-Hey, why did you say that,
-Hey.

42
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,840
you damn vendor?

43
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,560
My life is so hard,

44
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,120
but you've got it so easy.

45
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,400
You owe me.

46
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,280
Remember, the customer is always right.

47
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,560
-What?
-What?

48
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,040
The customer is always right.
We provide a service, right?

49
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,720
-Yes.
-Yes.

50
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,440
Well, service…

51
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,080
What is it?

52
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,600
Selling food is a kind of service.
Do you understand?

53
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,560
-Yes.
-Yes.

54
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,240
Do you want good sales?
Do you want to sell it all?

55
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,080
Don't argue with them.

56
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,280
They are always right. Do you understand?

57
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,320
-Yes.
-Yes.

58
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,960
-But now, I'm bursting.
-Here is a piece of cloth.

59
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,920
Here you go.

60
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,040
Gosh.

61
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,520
Eung,

62
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,120
you won't get away from me.

63
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,520
Eung.

64
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,200
Kam.

65
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,200
Yes.

66
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,480
It's me.

67
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,360
What are you going to do to me?

68
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,640
Do it now.

69
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
I came here alone.

70
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,200
I shall die alone because I'm here alone.

71
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,160
My goodness.

72
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,120
Do you think you can deceive me?

73
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,320
I saw everything.
You came with that bitch.

74
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,440
I'm going to deal with both of you.

75
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,080
-Pun, Jieak!
-Let go!

76
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,520
-Come here.
-Let go of me.

77
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,720
Stop!

78
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,400
Here you are.

79
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,760
Pun, take her with us.

80
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,320
Come on.

81
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Let go!

82
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,080
-Hey.
-Miss!

83
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,800
Miss, please don't do it!

84
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,960
Move, Perm.

85
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,640
Pun, Jieak, get them.

86
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,200
Hey!

87
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,880
-Take this!
-Hey!

88
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,840
Don't touch Perm!

89
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,520
-Let go of me! Let go!
-Perm!

90
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,560
Let go of me!

91
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,000
I said let go!

92
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,680
-Eung!
-Eung.

93
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,600
Let go of me. Eung. Let go!

94
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,040
-Perm!
-Perm!

95
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,840
Perm!

96
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,760
Miss.

97
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,440
If you think you can take me,
then come here.

98
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,760
Please be careful, miss.

99
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,720
Miss!

100
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,840
Hey!

101
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,200
What's going on over there? Well?

102
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,640
Klin, run!

103
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,040
Pudtarn.

104
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,720
Forget about me! Run!

105
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,720
Pun,

106
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,840
take Miss Klin too.

107
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,080
Yes, sir.

108
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,400
What's this about? Back off!

109
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,360
My gosh! What should I do?

110
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,600
Hey, Eung!

111
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,480
-Miss. Eung.
-Kam!

112
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,640
Let go!

113
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,400
-Goodness!
-Miss!

114
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
My goodness!

115
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,040
Perm.

116
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,560
Let go of me.

117
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,760
Kam!

118
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,240
Do you dare?

119
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,400
Eung.

120
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,760
Eung.

121
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,880
I give in to you now, Kam.
Please don't harm my mistress.

122
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,480
I will do anything.

123
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,040
You can sell me off if you like.

124
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,800
I'm free now. I no longer have a master.

125
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,560
If you take me,

126
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,320
you won't get punished.

127
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,400
Please let Miss Pudtarn and Miss Klin go.

128
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,600
No, Eung. Don't give in to him.

129
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,520
Come here.

130
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,440
Do you think I will let you all go?

131
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,480
I will sell every one of you.

132
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,960
Pun, Jieak, take them to the boat.

133
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,360
Those two as well.

134
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,760
Yes, Kam.

135
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,920
-Let's go.
-Yes, Kam.

136
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,680
-No!
-I have nothing to do with this!

137
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,400
I'm not involved in this.

138
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,800
Im, run!

139
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,160
Take this.

140
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,320
Kam, don't do it.

141
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,400
Do you want to die?

142
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,120
Go on.

143
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,880
Go on.

144
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,600
Go on.

145
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,600
Kam, where are you taking me?

146
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,440
I'm going to sell you.

147
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,200
What do you want?

148
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,840
My bracelet,

149
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,880
my ring, my belt.

150
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
You can have them.

151
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,080
Please let me go.

152
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,640
I will get more if I sell you.

153
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,440
No one will buy me.

154
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,440
Just sell her.

155
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,840
I'm going to sell all of you.

156
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,960
You will get caught.

157
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,400
You won't get away.

158
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,600
Wait and see.

159
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,680
Let's go.

160
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,520
What?

161
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,800
What?

162
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,720
Go.

163
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,880
-Klin.
-What?

164
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
-Hey.
-My gosh! Don't!

165
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,200
-What are you doing?
-I can't swim!

166
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,960
-Hey!
-My gosh!

167
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,600
What are you doing? Don't!

168
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,040
Don't do it! Hey!

169
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,760
Help me!

170
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,560
Help…

171
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,160
-Eung!
-Miss!

172
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,160
-Miss!
-Eung!

173
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,880
Miss Pudtarn is over there, Eung!

174
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,880
Help!

175
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,760
-Miss!
-Miss!

176
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,160
-Miss!
-Help!

177
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,080
Help!

178
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,760
-Hey, run! Come on!
-Come on!

179
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,280
Please help Miss Klin!

180
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,880
Help!

181
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,480
Let's go, Daeng.

182
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
Yes, my lady.

183
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,880
Pin, you go.

184
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,280
She is here.

185
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,360
Daeng is here for my life!

186
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,560
-Miss.
-Miss.

187
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,640
-Perm, help them!
-Miss!

188
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Miss!

189
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,200
Perm, go help her!

190
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,680
-Miss!
-Miss!

191
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,000
-Perm!
-Miss!

192
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,920
Goodness, miss!

193
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,040
Miss!

194
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,600
-Miss!
-Miss!

195
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,120
-Grab my arm!
-Miss!

196
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,360
-Miss!
-Miss!

197
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,560
-Miss!
-Miss Klin!

198
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,400
-Miss!
-Miss!

199
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
Miss!

200
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Miss.

201
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm sorry,

202
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,720
Daeng.

203
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,880
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,160
No.

205
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,720
I should apologize to you.

206
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,600
I'm sorry for saying mean things to you.

207
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,600
I'm the one who must apologize.

208
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,840
I was blind.

209
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,280
I never regarded you as a good person.

210
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,800
Thank you for saving my life.

211
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,120
If it weren't for you,
I would have drowned here.

212
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,320
Thank you.

213
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,760
-Hey!
-Oh, lord.

214
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,520
On your knees!

215
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,480
On your knees!

216
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,080
On your knees! Now!

217
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,640
Come on, Choi.

218
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
My lord!

219
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,920
-Pudtarn.
-You scared me.

220
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,080
How are you?

221
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,760
You are not hurt, are you?

222
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,119
No, but my arms and wrists
are a little sore

223
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,920
because I had to break free from a rope.

224
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,040
The patrolmen

225
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,880
have caught the men who kidnapped you.

226
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,599
This includes Kam, Eung's husband.

227
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,680
I don't want him to be my husband anymore.

228
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,240
Please help me, my lord.

229
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,080
I will inform
the divorce court about this,

230
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,720
so he will no longer
have any right over me.

231
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,040
Are you serious about this, Eung?

232
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,040
Yes, my lord.

233
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,640
Are you following your mistress's example?

234
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,040
Your mistress
loves to think she is independent.

235
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,280
Come on.

236
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,080
Don't say that.

237
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,280
Sure.

238
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
I will ask them to draft divorce papers

239
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,000
and send them to the court for you.

240
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
As for Kam,

241
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,400
I will have him imprisoned for life

242
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,760
so he can't hurt anyone else.

243
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,920
That's great, my lord.

244
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,560
Eung, aren't you scared?

245
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,880
Scared of what?

246
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,520
People will gossip about you,
saying you are a widow

247
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,200
who will become like a wilted flower

248
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,920
and your life will be a failure.

249
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,040
Do you need to take this to court?

250
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,640
It will be scandalous.

251
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,600
Choi,

252
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,160
Miss Pudtarn taught me that

253
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,600
if you love yourself properly,

254
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,640
you don't need to worry about failing.

255
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,160
We were given this life,

256
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,200
so we must live it to the fullest

257
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,320
and avoid what makes you sad.

258
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,080
But if you do face hardship,
you should fix it and be happy again.

259
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,280
This way, you won't regret
not living your best life when you die.

260
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,480
Perm,

261
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,680
it's already scandalous.

262
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,800
Let it be as scandalous as it can.

263
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Gosh, Eung.

264
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,680
I'm so proud of you, girl.

265
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,560
Thank you.

266
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,480
Klin.

267
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,240
What's wrong, dear?

268
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,680
Did someone do something to you?

269
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,240
Or did you trouble someone…

270
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,880
again?

271
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
Or…

272
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,640
Grandma.

273
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,720
Grandma.

274
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,160
Klin, why are you crying?

275
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,160
What's wrong?

276
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,440
Grandma.

277
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,520
I have done terrible things.

278
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,360
I have done wrong.

279
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,480
I'm a wicked person.

280
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,320
I have let you down.

281
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,640
I'm truly evil.

282
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,680
I'm mean.

283
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,680
I'm cruel.

284
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,920
I'm foul-mouthed.

285
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,160
I have caused her so much trouble.

286
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,520
Who?

287
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,520
Pudtarn.

288
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,800
It's Pudtarn, Grandma.

289
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,080
She saved my life…

290
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,440
even though I've always been mean to her.

291
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,480
That's because she's a child of angels.

292
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,320
That's right, Grandma.

293
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,480
She's a child of angels.

294
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,320
Do you really mean it?

295
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,240
Do you accept it now?

296
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,440
I mean it, Grandma.

297
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,800
I believe it.

298
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,720
I won't be hostile to her anymore.

299
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,560
Grandma.

300
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,120
Grandma.

301
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm sorry, Grandma.

302
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,480
I'm sorry.

303
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,160
Klin.

304
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,680
I finally have the old you back.

305
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,800
What's wrong, Choi?

306
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,840
I'm happy to see how strong the love
between you and Miss Pudtarn is.

307
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,120
Your eyes say otherwise.

308
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,880
Just say what you want to say.

309
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,200
I want to know

310
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,640
how you will deal with the royal command.

311
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
I was afraid you had forgotten about it.

312
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,680
Baron,

313
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,400
what are you going to do
about the royal command?

314
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,120
I'm not going to do anything.

315
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,720
What? Why not?

316
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,760
And what about
the king taking me as a concubine?

317
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,520
I won't do anything.

318
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,000
It's the job of…

319
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,360
destiny.

320
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,040
Let destiny do it.

321
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,840
Des…

322
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,640
It's destiny.

323
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,280
Don't you understand?

324
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,080
Take a guess.

325
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,680
I did.

326
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
So what is it?

327
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,800
It's des…

328
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,960
My lady, what are you going to do?

329
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,840
My goodness, Prik.

330
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,040
Don't meddle in this.

331
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,600
I'll never listen to you again.

332
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,280
It's not about that, my lady.

333
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,360
-I feel really sorry for you about this.
-That's enough, Prik.

334
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,040
Well…

335
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,360
It's turned out for the best.

336
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,080
Please don't worry about this, my lady.

337
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,760
I have done so many things to her.

338
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,840
But she deserved it, didn't she?

339
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,400
Yes, my lady.

340
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,840
Yes, my lady.

341
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,760
She is a commoner,

342
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,320
so you are not wrong to disapprove of her.

343
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,280
She's right, my lady.

344
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,520
She will become my daughter-in-law.

345
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
I wish they would do this after I am gone.

346
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,080
Come on, my lady.

347
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,280
Lord Rid also has a royally-bestowed wife,

348
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,440
so this isn't up to Miss Pudtarn.

349
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,920
It's up to the king.

350
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,720
I have two important matters
to discuss today.

351
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,800
I shall have Wat Maheyong renovated.

352
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,480
It is a large temple

353
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,160
built almost 300 years ago
during the reign of King Samphraya,

354
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,400
but it has become quite dilapidated.

355
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,200
Once the ships I have ordered to be built
for our overseas trade

356
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,040
are complete,

357
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,480
I intend to have them anchored
at the temple.

358
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,160
Here you go.

359
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,160
Rid.

360
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,240
I want you to supervise the renovation.

361
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,520
How long do you think it will take?

362
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,360
I will have to inspect it first,
Your Majesty.

363
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,840
But if I had to estimate…

364
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,800
I visited this temple on New Year's Day,

365
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,120
and judging from its condition,

366
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,000
I think it would take
a minimum of three years, Your Majesty.

367
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,600
Thongkam,

368
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,520
you help him.

369
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,160
Do you think it could be done
in less than three years?

370
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,760
I pass it regularly.

371
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,400
I don't think it could be done sooner.

372
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,440
It is dilapidated
and is practically abandoned.

373
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,720
Can't you use more workers?

374
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,520
That doesn't mean it would be faster,
Your Majesty.

375
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,800
In fact, that would make things slower.

376
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,680
All right,

377
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,760
three years it is.

378
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,640
Rid, tell Marquess Kosathibodi

379
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,880
to allocate a budget for this.

380
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

381
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,480
Let's move on.

382
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,840
Marquess Wang.

383
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

384
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,240
It is almost time
to bestow new peerages, is it not?

385
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

386
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,200
Rid.

387
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,280
What's wrong?

388
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,520
I have been elevated

389
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,840
to Viscount Pipatrachasin.

390
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,920
Elevated?

391
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,040
You look more like
you have been stripped of your title.

392
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,800
Will there be a ceremony?

393
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,680
The king said

394
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,800
the scheduling of the ceremony

395
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,280
is up to Marquess Wang.

396
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,160
Rid,

397
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,560
has something happened about Pudtarn?

398
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,720
Marquess Wang.

399
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,920
I shall bring a woman in as a concubine.

400
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

401
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,200
Send someone to escort her,
arrange her anointing ceremony,

402
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,360
and prepare her a residence.

403
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,520
Who is it, Your Majesty?

404
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
Her name is Pudtarn.

405
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,600
She lives in Gui's orchard by Kleab Canal.

406
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,760
She is a commoner under the authority
of Marquess Wisut Sakorn.

407
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,240
He made the command today.

408
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,120
I'm going to tell Pudtarn.

409
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,280
Tell her what?

410
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,000
Tell her…

411
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,080
Well, what I have told you.

412
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,920
You can cross that bridge
when you come to it.

413
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,280
Think about this.

414
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:46,160
Pudtarn should have been with you
for the past thousand years,

415
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,920
but you were kept apart.

416
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,560
Mother,

417
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,520
why are you rubbing salt in my wound?

418
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,240
I'm saying it
because I have come to my own conclusion

419
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,440
that the Krishna Kali Manuscript

420
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,480
brought me here

421
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,240
to meet your father.

422
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,880
The Krishna Kali Manuscript can't have
brought Pudtarn all the way here

423
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,360
merely to grow vegetables, fry fish,

424
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,960
and make Chinese vegetable stew
to sell at the market,

425
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,000
my dear son.

426
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,640
Mother, do you believe

427
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,200
in destiny?

428
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,400
Rid, let me tell you something.

429
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,800
What you and Pudtarn have

430
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,440
goes beyond destiny.

431
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,960
Do you have that much faith

432
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,200
in destiny?

433
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,800
No, I don't.

434
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,240
What?

435
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,840
So why did you say that
and raise our son's hopes?

436
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
The person who can fulfill his hopes

437
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,520
is you, Khun Pi.

438
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,600
Me?

439
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,720
You can read our son's fortune,
then we will know.

440
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,280
Come now, Karaked.

441
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,920
You have misunderstood this terribly.

442
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,360
I read Rid's fortune
to see when he would get married.

443
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,840
But as for who his wife will be,

444
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,280
I cannot foretell that.

445
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,840
Khun Pi,

446
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,000
about the king

447
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,360
taking Pudtarn as his concubine,

448
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,280
Rid told me that

449
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,480
it has come true.

450
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,560
He told Rid that…

451
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,400
Rid.

452
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

453
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,120
Tell your mother

454
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,280
that I wish to have Pudtarn.

455
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,760
The reason being,
Karaked is Pudtarn's relative.

456
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

457
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,800
That is what Rid told me.

458
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,240
Imagine how he must have felt.

459
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,280
No one can disobey a royal command, right?

460
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,160
-That's right.
-That's right.

461
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,360
Listen.

462
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,000
I will be the first person to disobey him.

463
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,199
-Please don't.
-Please don't.

464
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,639
Miss, you could be executed.

465
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,480
Please don't do this.

466
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,360
If you do, Baron Maharit will have
as many wives as he pleases.

467
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,480
Yes, miss.

468
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,960
Eung and Perm!

469
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,760
Good lord.

470
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,800
You two have a nerve.

471
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,480
Go.

472
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,280
Come on.

473
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,040
If you don't want to lose me to the king,

474
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,520
then you must be brave.

475
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Be brave?

476
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,040
How?

477
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,240
Just tell him.

478
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,080
Inform him.

479
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,080
That's it.

480
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,920
Inform him that I'm your girlfriend.

481
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,320
-Girlfriend?
-Yes, girlfriend.

482
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,560
Has your mother never used that word?

483
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,880
Your girlfriend is your beloved.

484
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,880
You love me

485
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,440
and I love you so much too.

486
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,200
I love you so terribly,

487
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,360
my dear Pudtarn.

488
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,280
Then can you be brave?

489
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,800
It's not about being brave.

490
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,240
Then what is it about?

491
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,160
It's about

492
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,560
what is appropriate.

493
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,560
You should leave.

494
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,720
Pudtarn.

495
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,000
Please don't do this.

496
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,600
Should I let you do this to me?

497
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,040
No matter how long it has been,
you are the one who let me go.

498
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,240
Will we have a life

499
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,160
where you won't let go of me?

500
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,440
Will we have a life

501
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,960
where we are separated by death

502
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,080
rather than your decision?

503
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,120
Someone from the palace
will come for you in two days.

504
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,320
Viscount Pipatrachasin will escort you
to Banyong Rattanat Throne Hall,

505
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,280
where you will offer yourself
to His Majesty.

506
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,800
Viscount…

507
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,760
Why are you responsible for the escort?

508
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,360
You don't work in the palace anymore.

509
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,160
If not, it would have to be you, Mother.

510
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,440
A royal boat is waiting at the pier.

511
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,200
Who will be escorting me again?

512
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,320
Viscount Pipatrachasin.

513
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,720
Viscount…

514
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,840
Pipatrachasin.

515
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,560
There he is.

516
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,880
My lady.

517
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,640
Is there no way out?

518
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,320
What can we do?

519
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,880
Come on, my lady.

520
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,320
Don't you feel sorry for Lord Rid?

521
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,880
Gosh, I feel it more than you.

522
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,960
Why are you doing nothing, then?

523
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,960
What do you want me to do?

524
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,600
Well, why don't you ask His Lordship
to raise an objection with the king?

525
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,960
You go and tell him, Yaem.

526
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,840
Do it.

527
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,040
You go too, Pin. Go ahead.

528
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,720
Let's go.

529
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,560
Be careful, my lady.

530
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,600
Oh, dear.

531
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,200
What's wrong? You both look strange.

532
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,400
Hey, Dech.

533
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,600
Is your son not working today?

534
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,840
He is, Mother.

535
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,560
Is he?

536
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,960
I saw Choi sitting alone at the entrance.

537
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,600
Rid…

538
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,480
is executing a royal command.

539
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,440
I see.

540
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,960
Who paddled the boat for him?

541
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,520
Today,

542
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,480
our servants don't need
to take care of that.

543
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,520
So how did Rid go?

544
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,520
A royal convoy to escort a concubine-to-be

545
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,080
will collect him at Gui's orchard.

546
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,920
I see.

547
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,040
Klin.

548
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,120
Is it Klin?

549
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,160
Oh, my.

550
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,400
How fortunate she is.

551
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,600
It's not Klin, Mother.

552
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,840
Don't tell me it's Pudtarn.

553
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,360
-Yes, it's Pudtarn.
-Yes, it's Pudtarn.

554
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,120
I don't believe you.

555
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,800
It's true, Lady Champa.

556
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,120
My lady.

557
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,440
Take it easy.

558
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,960
My lady.

559
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,360
This is what we can't deny.

560
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,400
You can compete against anything,

561
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,240
but not fortune.

562
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,080
My lady.

563
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,800
Chuang, fetch the smelling salts.

564
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,480
I'm also about to faint.

565
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,320
Chuang, go and get them.

566
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,720
I'm all right.

567
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,560
I just didn't expect this.

568
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,720
I know, my lady.

569
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,560
She's offering herself to the king.
I can't believe it either.

570
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,680
You have to believe it now, Prik.

571
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,920
As Her Ladyship said,
we can't compete with fortune.

572
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,280
Will she mock me?

573
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,720
There's no need to fear, my lady.

574
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,080
You won't see her do that.

575
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,760
Why won't she see?

576
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,560
She will be doing it in the palace.

577
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,360
Sit comfortably.

578
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,480
Look at that pond, Pudtarn.

579
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,640
It contains the largest stock
of silver barb.

580
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,920
I see, Your Majesty.

581
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,160
In the future, when I catch some,

582
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,040
you shall cook them for me.

583
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,280
Think about

584
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,640
ways to prepare them besides frying.

585
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

586
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,120
Rid.

587
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,600
Escort Pudtarn
to Banyong Rattanat Throne Hall.

588
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,680
I will be there soon.

589
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

590
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,480
Have you prepared the formalities,
Khun Tao?

591
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,600
Yes, Your Majesty. Everything is ready.

592
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,920
Very well.

593
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,080
I'm so pleased with her.

594
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,960
Do you know that?

595
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,960
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

596
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,080
I have never met
anyone like her in Ayutthaya.

597
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,720
Have you?

598
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,560
Never, Your Majesty.

599
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,800
She is bold and spirited.

600
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,840
She's also a fantastic cook, Your Majesty.

601
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,160
I'm unable to tell

602
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,800
which reason contributes more

603
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,440
to my fondness for her.

604
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,920
Let's just say both.

605
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,440
I feel so sorry for Rid.

606
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,440
He's had his heart broken just like that.

607
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,280
Just like that?

608
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,320
Has he said anything at all, Prang?

609
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,240
Well, no.

610
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,960
If I were heartbroken,
I would absolutely do something.

611
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:53,040
But whatever happens,
Rid must marry Praejeen.

612
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,640
He can't do anything,
no matter how heartbroken he is.

613
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,560
Don't be so sure until they are married.

614
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:08,120
I won't end up miserable

615
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,320
like Rid, will I?

616
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,680
If I had to marry someone
I had no feelings for,

617
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,920
I would never do it.

618
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,520
Were you asking me?

619
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,960
Yes, I asked you.

620
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,080
What you asked me…

621
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,160
Can I answer that?

622
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,920
Of course,

623
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,680
I won't be miserable at all

624
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,520
if…

625
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,480
If?

626
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,400
If what?

627
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,840
If just one person
understands my feelings,

628
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,760
then no one else would matter.

629
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,720
In.

630
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,320
That person…

631
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,840
is me, right?

632
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,280
I had a feeling you knew

633
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,760
and you truly did.

634
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,000
Come on, In.

635
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,200
If I didn't know this,
then I would be pulling a cart.

636
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,720
Because I would be as dumb as an ox.

637
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:36,560
Prang, where did you get this from?

638
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,560
It's not polite at all.

639
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,640
Pudtarn.

640
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,080
I heard her say it before.

641
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,400
Let's just say
you're now aware of my feelings.

642
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,240
Am I right?

643
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,800
You have told me, haven't you, In?

644
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,560
Well…

645
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,440
I have.

646
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,120
In that case, of course I'm aware of them.

647
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,720
So Pudtarn must be with the king by now.

648
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,360
I am sure you are aware

649
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,160
of your duties.

650
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,080
Khun Tao told me about ten times,
Your Majesty.

651
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,520
Your Majesty.

652
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,560
Leave us.

653
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,400
You must wait for me to tell you to stand.

654
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,080
But I have already stood up.

655
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:13,920
It's all right.

656
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,920
You have my permission.

657
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,000
Well then, could I ask you one more thing?

658
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,240
Please allow me to use
the common language, Your Majesty.

659
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,640
I don't know the royal language.

660
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,360
You're speaking it now.

661
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,280
I only know two words, Your Majesty.

662
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,800
I learned them from folk plays.

663
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,440
All right.

664
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,960
Fine.

665
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,960
You have my permission.

666
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,840
Do you have anything to tell me

667
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,080
before I…

668
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,640
Do you?

669
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,160
I do, Your Majesty.

670
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,080
It's something very important.

671
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,400
I'm unwilling to be…

672
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,000
My wife?

673
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,000
There is another word for it.

674
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,960
What is it again?

675
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,440
Concubine.

676
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

677
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,120
Concubine.

678
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,920
It's all right.

679
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,040
You don't have to be willing.

680
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,680
No, Your Majesty.
We both must agree to this.

681
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,000
Has no one ever told you

682
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,520
there is not a single person

683
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,640
who is unwilling to be my wife?

684
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,240
There is, Your Majesty.

685
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,960
At least, there is one person.

686
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,000
All right.

687
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,040
Tell me, then,

688
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,360
why both of us must agree to this

689
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,520
when one of us is the king

690
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,960
of Ayutthaya.

691
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,680
What's more,
very few women in this kingdom

692
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,000
are as fortunate as you.

693
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,800
When a couple starts a life together,

694
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,120
they should base it on love

695
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,080
in order to live happily.

696
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,520
Without love,
we will never be happy, Your Majesty.

697
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,880
That's not true.

698
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,040
With you as my wife, I will be happy.

699
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,040
But I'm not willing to do this
because I don't love you,

700
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,840
so I will not be happy.

701
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,800
You will love me eventually.

702
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,760
Are you not concerned
about my feelings, Your Majesty?

703
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,600
I told you, anyone would be happy
to live a life such as this.

704
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,280
How could you be unhappy?

705
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:09,560
Not only would I be unhappy,
but you would too.

706
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,040
Please believe me.

707
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,600
It's always enjoyable talking to you.

708
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,680
Just as I enjoy eating your food,
which is always to my liking.

709
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,120
All right,

710
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,200
tell me how I would be unhappy.

711
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,400
I don't love you.

712
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,560
-Could you have a con…
-Concubine.

713
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,000
…who doesn't love you?

714
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,480
Yes.

715
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,360
No, you couldn't

716
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,400
because I won't give you my consent.

717
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,440
Consent for what?

718
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,360
I won't consent

719
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,400
to being your concubine.

720
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,120
All right, I understand.

721
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,240
But can you be clear,

722
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,440
if you won't give me your consent,

723
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,680
what will you do?

724
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,800
I shall resist you.

725
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,480
I won't let you.

726
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,640
Would you fight me?

727
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

728
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,400
Fight me?

729
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

730
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,360
And you would use force.

731
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,680
I won't use force.

732
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,440
Don't worry.

733
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,640
That's impossible
because I will resist you.

734
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,440
I will fight.

735
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,840
Yes.

736
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:43,960
That's true.

737
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,720
That's why I said
we must both agree to it.

738
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,520
Otherwise, it would be what we call…

739
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,880
assault or rape, Your Majesty.

740
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,520
Are you saying I will assault

741
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,920
or rape you?

742
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,440
Well, I wouldn't consent to it.

743
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:14,560
You might be fined, Your Majesty.

744
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,320
Are you aware of what you're saying?

745
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,320
Your head could roll if someone hears you.
I'm warning you.

746
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,840
You might also be whipped.

747
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,040
You have lost your mind.

748
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,200
Perhaps you're dreaming.

749
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,880
But I have no husband,

750
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,680
so the punishment may be less severe

751
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,000
than if…

752
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,440
All right.

753
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,800
That's enough.

754
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:53,480
I understand now
that you won't be my wife.

755
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,440
Do you not want to be my concubine?

756
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,080
No, Your Majesty.

757
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,040
Look,

758
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,280
you would get to live a good life here.

759
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,840
It's better than
that tumbledown house of yours.

760
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,040
Why do you say that?

761
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,120
It's not yet a year old.

762
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,840
It is my heaven.

763
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,200
I like living in that house.

764
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,360
It's as small as a rat hole.

765
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,120
What's to like about living there?

766
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,240
Because living there,

767
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,440
I am comfortable and happy

768
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,920
and have no problems.

769
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,760
Most importantly,

770
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,920
I fell in love there.

771
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,000
Didn't you say you were single?

772
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,400
I don't have a husband,

773
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,080
but I have a boyfriend.

774
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:03,560
A boyfriend?

775
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,280
What is that?

776
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,840
It means a beloved, Your Majesty.

777
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,560
What language is this?

778
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,560
All right.

779
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,720
You love him, but he is not your husband.

780
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,200
Who is he?

781
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,760
I don't know

782
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,280
what his title is, Your Majesty.

783
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,920
I see.

784
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,720
Is he an official?

785
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,800
This man who is your…

786
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,800
boyfriend.

787
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,280
So how could you not know his title?

788
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,440
I have heard it only once.

789
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,920
I can't remember it, Your Majesty.

790
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,160
Which department does he work in?

791
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,920
The Ministry of Treasury, Your Majesty.

792
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,120
That's the same ministry as Rid,
your relative.

793
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

794
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,200
The same ministry.

795
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,280
Rid.

796
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,880
Is it him?

797
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

798
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,400
-Your--
-Hold on.

799
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,040
Stop talking.

800
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,160
-Well--
-Stop.

801
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,120
Say no more.

802
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,440
Otherwise, I'll have you executed.

803
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,040
My lord.

804
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,680
Do I still have hope, Choi?

805
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,560
I'm afraid

806
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:38,680
not, my lord.

807
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,439
My dear lord.

808
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:48,200
I feel terribly sorry for you.

809
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,439
But please let her go.

810
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,840
Do I have a choice?

811
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,760
You don't have to tell me.

812
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:04,279
I won't be stubborn, Choi.

813
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,240
It's just that

814
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,800
I feel

815
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,000
completely empty.

816
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,160
I feel as if I am dead.

817
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,479
Please don't say that, my lord.

818
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:20,720
It's bad luck.

819
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,479
It would be better
if that bad luck came to pass.

820
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,600
My lord.

821
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,560
I told you not to say it.

822
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:34,600
Why can't I say it
when it's what I'm thinking?

823
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,520
Choi--

824
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,880
His Majesty requests
your presence immediately.

825
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,160
Pudtarn.

826
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,000
Get up.

827
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,160
I truly love you.

828
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,920
I have no doubt about that.

829
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,840
I just have doubts about myself.

830
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,520
If you're going to tell me

831
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,560
that Rid does not love me

832
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,360
and that I should call off the marriage,

833
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,920
do not bother telling me.

834
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,280
I will not agree to it.

835
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,920
I will tell your father

836
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,840
to arrange the wedding within the year.

837
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,040
Do you have any reservations,
Lady Karaked?

838
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,080
If we can procure enough rice
to sell to them,

839
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,240
the Emperor will waive the taxes on it.

840
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,600
Keep your voice down.

841
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:40,400
Regarding the Emperor's tax exemption,
do not let anyone know.

842
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:21,120
