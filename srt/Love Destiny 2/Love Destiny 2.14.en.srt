1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,200
Even if Rid takes Pudtarn as a wife,

2
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,400
I shall continue to await
Rid's royally-bestowed wife.

3
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,240
Seeing both of you together is a blessing.

4
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,640
If this is a blessing,
you should come every day for a blessing.

5
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,880
I shall be waiting.

6
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,960
Your dear Ming is right there.

7
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,000
The necklace.

8
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,400
It was because Baron Rid saw.

9
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,840
-He saw you hand it to me.
-What?

10
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,440
-Take this.
-Hey.

11
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,960
Who did you fight with?

12
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,640
Please enjoy your meal.

13
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,320
This is for the food.

14
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,720
We enjoyed it greatly.

15
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,920
Perhaps I could send someone
to learn from you.

16
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,040
The basics you need to know
are the five main moves.

17
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,520
Guard.

18
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,880
Slash.

19
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,160
Strike.

20
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,560
Thrust from the left.

21
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,240
Thrust from the right.

22
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,440
Don't grip it tightly.

23
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,520
-Okay.
-Like this.

24
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,960
Proceed from the beginning.

25
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,519
This sword style I'm teaching you

26
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,600
is a single sword fighting style.

27
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,440
Everyone, be it soldiers or commoners,

28
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,400
learns and practices this style.

29
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,160
It is practiced in most sword schools.

30
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,920
That is enough for today.

31
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,640
Your limbs are already giving out
and getting tangled up.

32
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,400
On the day of the Lantern Festival,

33
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,200
I shall pick you up in the evening.

34
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,520
Make sure you are ready,
so we can attend the festival together.

35
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,600
Where will it be held? Is it far?

36
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,720
This event is called
the Chong Prieng Ceremony.

37
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,880
It is held at Wat Phutthai Sawan.

38
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,480
We go there to pay respect
to our ancestors who built the city.

39
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,680
In the evening, His Majesty,

40
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,880
his first and second consorts,

41
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,680
concubines, ladies-in-waiting,

42
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,600
and the members of the royal family

43
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,880
will preside over
the ancestral sacrifice ceremony.

44
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
However,

45
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,040
commoners must avert their eyes.

46
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,440
They must not look up.

47
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,640
Curtains will also block
their sight of His Majesty.

48
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
Hey.

49
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,000
This event is so much fun.

50
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,640
Why are we not allowed
to look at His Majesty?

51
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
What is the reason?

52
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,880
I don't know.

53
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,800
What?

54
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,120
Well, it's a tradition.

55
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,240
And why is there such a tradition?

56
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,960
I don't know.

57
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,280
No one has ever questioned it.

58
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,920
I shall come for you
in the evening, all right?

59
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,600
I'm not going.

60
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,280
I don't want to go.

61
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,360
Why will you not go?

62
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,760
Not go?

63
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,320
Not go where?

64
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,840
The Chong Prieng Ceremony.

65
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,200
I said I don't want to go.

66
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,080
Why not?

67
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,240
I don't need a reason.

68
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,080
-You do.
-No, I don't.

69
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,440
Yes, you do.

70
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,680
For heaven's sake, I have no reason.
It was just my automatic response.

71
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't want to go, so I won't go.

72
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,320
Don't you understand?

73
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,240
"Auto" what?

74
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,000
Automatic.

75
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,120
What?

76
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,160
He's weird, isn't he?

77
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,160
Why won't you go, miss?

78
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,200
Not you as well.

79
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,200
Well, I don't want to go.
Didn't you hear me?

80
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,680
I don't want to go.
It's a waste of my time.

81
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,320
What would you rather do?

82
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,280
Sleep.

83
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,200
You don't need to worry about that.

84
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,840
You sleep the whole day anyway.

85
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,080
So?

86
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,200
What?

87
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,679
What?

88
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,039
What's wrong?

89
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,640
I…

90
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,160
Tell me what's wrong.

91
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,760
Please don't make that face.

92
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,160
I don't have any.

93
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,280
Eung, you have one, right?

94
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,560
Have what, miss?

95
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,800
A sanitary towel.

96
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,000
A sanitary towel?

97
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,600
Yes.

98
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,880
Hurry up!

99
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,280
Yes, I'm getting it now.

100
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,920
A towel, miss.

101
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,400
No.

102
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,960
A sanitary towel.

103
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,240
-Perm. Sanitary towel.
-What towel?

104
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,720
Sanitary towel.

105
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,040
-What's that, Eung?
-Oh, dear.

106
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,360
My goodness.

107
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,800
-Towel…
-Stop!

108
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,560
What's wrong, Eung?

109
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,080
What's wrong with mine?
Why don't you use it?

110
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,440
I don't want to use it because it's rough.

111
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,360
Imagine using coconut husk.

112
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,560
I have a headache just thinking about it.

113
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,720
Why, miss?

114
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,240
We have used it for hundreds of years.

115
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,680
You've been here less than a month.

116
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,840
How can you say you won't use it?

117
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,280
Why can't I? I'm saying it right now.

118
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,640
-Perm, can you go faster?
-Yes, miss.

119
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,880
Miss, let's go back.

120
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,920
Stop it.

121
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,200
Miss.

122
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,960
Eung.

123
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,360
Be careful, miss.

124
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,400
Did it just come?

125
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,680
Yes, it came this afternoon.

126
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,280
I have made a usable one.

127
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,920
Look.

128
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,480
Here you go.

129
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,840
Thank you, Auntie.

130
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
I'll give you ten of them.

131
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,960
I have made many.

132
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,120
You can change it
as many times as you need.

133
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,160
Thank you.

134
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,640
An innovation in personal hygiene.
This is awesome, Auntie.

135
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,400
Go change it now.

136
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,840
Okay.

137
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,720
Here you go.

138
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,560
Goodness.

139
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,320
Keaw, put some on me.

140
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,160
This is for you, Keaw.

141
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,720
This one

142
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
is for you, Prang.

143
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,120
Thank you.

144
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,360
Thank you.

145
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,880
These are samples.

146
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,200
Why don't you try them?

147
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,920
I chose the colors to match your skin.

148
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,160
-Do you want to try it?
-Yes.

149
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,560
What are you doing, ladies?

150
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,440
Come, let me do it for you.

151
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,040
Makeup brushes?

152
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,800
How did you bring them there?

153
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,000
-Here you go, miss.
-Thank you.

154
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,560
What is that, miss?

155
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,200
Money from my era.

156
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,800
Alcohol spray.

157
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,520
Hello, is anyone there?

158
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,000
Say something.

159
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,680
Hello.

160
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
They were in my bag.

161
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,480
Who wants to go first?

162
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,040
Me.

163
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,840
I have made loose powder sunscreen,

164
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,000
blusher, and eye shadow
for the girls to try.

165
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,360
My perfumed powder
makes you feel refreshed

166
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
and gives a smooth finish.

167
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,040
It protects your skin from the sun
to prevent blemishes.

168
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,000
When you visit the royal palace,

169
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,680
you can give some
to the ladies-in-waiting, Prang.

170
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,800
If they want more, I can make it for them.

171
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,400
It's not expensive, just 50 bia per bunch.

172
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,360
The loose powder is 100 bia each.

173
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,360
It's easy to use. Just hang them up
and take one piece at a time as needed.

174
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Mix it with nutmeg oil,
which is lightly scented,

175
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,840
long-lasting, and toxin-free.

176
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,840
And this item is a must.

177
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,080
With your pink eyelids and cheeks,

178
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,560
your lips can't be pale.

179
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,960
I have mixed freshly made lip wax
with nutmeg oil and powdered mace.

180
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,760
It gives your lips a light tint

181
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,160
and is prettier than using carmine,
which is too dark.

182
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,640
You look so pretty, Prang.

183
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,320
Do I look pretty, Mother?

184
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,040
What about me?

185
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,320
What about me, Tarn?

186
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,520
I'll do yours too, Auntie.

187
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,520
What are you all doing?

188
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,200
Take it.

189
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,920
What is wrong, Choi?

190
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,880
I am out of breath, my lord.

191
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,800
Don't stop breathing.

192
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,680
My lord.

193
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,000
Why did you say that? It was your doing.

194
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,720
Mine? What did I do?

195
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,360
Well, my lord,

196
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,800
you had me paddle the boat
all the way there

197
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,600
and then all the way back here.

198
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,040
Then you had me paddle
past your residence to there

199
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,360
and then back here.

200
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,920
After all that, I am exhausted, my lord.

201
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,040
That is your problem,

202
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,120
not mine.

203
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,240
Hey.

204
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,000
Eung and Perm.

205
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Wait.

206
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,440
Has something happened to Pudtarn?

207
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,440
No, my lord.

208
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,320
So why are you two sitting here?

209
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,400
We accompanied her here, my lord.

210
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,520
Eung, why is your mistress here?

211
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,160
Did she come to see me?

212
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,560
No, my lord.

213
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,319
So why did she come here?

214
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,560
I asked you a question.

215
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,440
Do you want to get beaten, Eung?

216
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,839
I heard

217
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,680
Miss Pudtarn came to request

218
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,640
a sanitary towel
from Lady Karaked, my lord.

219
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,880
A sanitary towel? What is it for?

220
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,760
Could it be that your mistress is…

221
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,680
She is…

222
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,320
She is menstruating, my lord.

223
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,920
But I have no idea
how a sanitary towel helps.

224
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,080
She refused to use my pad, my lord.

225
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,760
Aren't you going inside, my lord?

226
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,000
No.

227
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,160
Why, my lord?

228
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,600
I'm not going.

229
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,360
Why are you asking?

230
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,560
I'm curious, my lord.

231
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,720
Klin.

232
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,240
I came here to deliver goods
to your kitchen, my lord.

233
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,760
My grandmother sent me.

234
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,720
Pudtarn did this, Grandmother.

235
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Look, Grandmother.

236
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,720
Do I look pretty?

237
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,040
Look at my cheeks.

238
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,760
And also look at my eyes.

239
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,080
It's beautiful

240
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,640
and creative.

241
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,120
Grandmother.

242
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,120
The lip color is pretty.

243
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,400
Grandmother,

244
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,720
I'm also pretty

245
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,520
and I'm also your granddaughter.

246
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,080
Pudtarn.

247
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,720
At your age, you should get married.

248
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,320
It's a pity you have waited this long.

249
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,040
When selecting a spouse,

250
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,240
besides considering a man's age,

251
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,960
you must also be sure that
he is of a similar status to you.

252
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,040
Do not get ideas above your station,
as you will only get hurt.

253
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,440
You're a woman, so you must be careful.

254
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,680
Do you understand?

255
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,560
Tarn,

256
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,920
join us for the meal.

257
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,600
I can't.

258
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,600
I need to go, Auntie.

259
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,160
Is that so?

260
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,200
Why are you in such a hurry?

261
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,120
Karaked.

262
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,760
You should ask Dech

263
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,880
to look for an official

264
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,720
or a civil servant for Pudtarn.

265
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,080
With her age,

266
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,560
she could be left unclaimed.

267
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,240
Chuang.

268
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,640
Yes, my lady.

269
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,840
Have you prepared my things?

270
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,440
I shall visit Wat Dusidaram today.

271
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,960
Yes, my lady.

272
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,680
What is wrong with you, Prik?

273
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,640
Well? You are making strange faces.

274
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,840
I'm scared of…

275
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,760
What?

276
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,280
Who are you scared of?

277
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,560
Pudtarn?

278
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,600
Yes, my lady.

279
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,320
Why so?

280
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,360
-She looks like…
-My goodness.

281
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,240
She looks like
the old Lady Karaked, my lady.

282
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,200
Yes, my lady.

283
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,280
When she was near me, I felt hot all over.

284
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,120
You are sick.

285
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,000
That's not it, my lady.

286
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,120
Right now,

287
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,600
my body is as cold as ice.

288
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,720
Exactly.

289
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,040
You are sick.

290
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,920
You are getting hot and cold flushes.

291
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,480
My lady, why don't you believe me?

292
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,080
I won't.

293
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,000
You are not in your right mind.

294
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,360
You get worse as you age.

295
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,000
So why did you believe me

296
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,600
when I told you about Lord Rid

297
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,040
having an eye for Miss Pudtarn?

298
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Well, that is believable.

299
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,080
So how is this not believable, my lady?

300
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,520
How?

301
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,800
Yes, my lady.

302
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,360
Chuang, tell her.
I do not wish to talk anymore.

303
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,080
She's right, my lady.
I also feel the same.

304
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,800
So what do you both think about this?

305
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,040
I don't know, my lady.

306
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,960
Tarn.

307
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Yes.

308
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,840
On the day of the Chong Prieng Ceremony,
why don't you attend with these two?

309
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,800
-Please come, Pudtarn. It's fun.
-Please come, Pudtarn. It's fun.

310
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,320
Please go.

311
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,040
Okay.

312
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,040
Do you know

313
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,760
what happened, Perm?

314
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,200
He's angry with Miss Pudtarn.

315
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,880
That's what Eung said.

316
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,720
What's he angry about?

317
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,360
Miss Pudtarn would not go
to the Chong Prieng Ceremony with him.

318
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,560
Good lord.

319
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,480
That's so trivial.

320
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,680
You're right.

321
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,520
I know now.

322
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,840
Miss Pudtarn turned His Lordship down,
so he's inviting Miss Klin.

323
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,360
Perm, stay out of it.

324
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,400
What?

325
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,320
Well, they're talking over there.

326
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,640
Was your father an ambassador, my lord?

327
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,880
Yes, that's right.

328
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,240
It was when he was young,
before he was married.

329
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,160
What are the duties of an ambassador?

330
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,040
They establish a relationship
between two nations.

331
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,520
They also exchange cordiality and gifts.

332
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,760
He was stationed…

333
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,720
in…

334
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,000
I used to know this.

335
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,400
It was France.

336
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,800
That's right, France.

337
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,320
Is it far away?

338
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,520
I do not know.

339
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,120
What? I didn't go there with him.

340
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,720
You're right.

341
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,520
But didn't the marquess tell you about it?

342
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,240
He merely told me that
it took them many months to reach there.

343
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,480
What? Many months?

344
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,440
So what did they eat?

345
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,120
What did they eat?

346
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
Food, of course.

347
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,400
Where did they get it from?

348
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,640
Listen, Klin.

349
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,920
Why are you asking this?

350
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,040
They took food with them.

351
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,880
Otherwise, they would
have starved to death.

352
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,920
I didn't mean
to say anything unpleasant, my lord.

353
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,280
My lord,

354
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,440
please forgive me.

355
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,640
It's all right.

356
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,080
Calm down.

357
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,360
There's no need for that.

358
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,840
Rid.

359
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,280
Yes, Mother.

360
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,680
Klin, are you here to deliver the goods?

361
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,760
Yes, my lady.

362
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,840
Grandmother sent
some green papayas for you

363
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,040
because you said
you wanted to make papaya salad.

364
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,320
Papaya salad.

365
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,880
That's great.

366
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,200
Gui's papayas make good papaya salad
as they are crispy.

367
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,720
Keaw, can you give me a piece of cloth?

368
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,920
What do you need it for?

369
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,800
To wipe my saliva.

370
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,120
I'm drooling.

371
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,240
I knew this would be your reaction, Prang.

372
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,480
Look at Eung and Perm.

373
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,240
They are also drooling.

374
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,680
Prang, do not point at them in that way.

375
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,440
They are older than you.

376
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,080
Yes, Mother.

377
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,200
There's one more person
who is drooling like you, Prang.

378
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,360
Who is it?

379
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,800
I have never seen
green papayas here, Auntie.

380
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,600
Gui has many papaya trees in her orchard.
Why don't you ask Klin for some?

381
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,040
Klin, can you give some to Pudtarn?

382
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,320
We have no more left, my lady.

383
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,000
We really have no more left, my lady.

384
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,720
We picked them all for you.

385
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,920
It's all right, Auntie.

386
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,200
I can buy some at the market.

387
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,560
There are only ripe ones there, Pudtarn.

388
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,280
Really? Why is that, Keaw?

389
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,640
I don't know.

390
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,080
People don't eat green papaya.

391
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,200
I will make papaya salad in a few days.
Why don't you come and have it here?

392
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,920
I will also teach Praejeen how to make it.

393
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,960
And you, Klin.

394
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,800
If you'd like, you can also join us.

395
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,800
No, thank you.

396
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,800
I bid you goodbye, my lady.

397
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,360
My lord.

398
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,240
I would like to converse with you again.

399
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,360
I wish to learn more about ambassadors.

400
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,880
Of course, Klin.

401
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,360
I would be happy to tell you more.

402
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,120
Thank you, my lord.

403
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,040
Hurry up and take these to the kitchen.

404
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
You should go home, Pudtarn.

405
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,000
I shall have Rid pick you up
on the day of the ceremony.

406
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,360
What ceremony?

407
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,400
The Chong Prieng Ceremony.

408
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,280
Rid, escort her there.

409
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,000
She's family,

410
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,520
so she should go there with us.

411
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,400
Grandmother told me
an angel had entrusted that woman to her.

412
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,800
But I heard them say

413
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,720
that she's a distant relative
of Lady Karaked.

414
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,400
Someone must be lying.

415
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,880
Miss Pudtarn looks so much
like Lady Karaked.

416
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,480
I think it's true that they are related.

417
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,120
But she's such a lowlife
that they wouldn't let her stay with them.

418
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,080
I knew it.

419
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,560
She isn't a child of angels like
she fooled my grandmother into thinking.

420
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,440
Im.

421
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,320
Go spy on them on the day of the ceremony

422
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,320
and notify me
once they have boarded their boat.

423
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,440
Miss, what are you planning to do?

424
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,200
Will you not attend?

425
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,120
I heard there will be
a grand shadow play on that day.

426
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,280
They also say they will perform
Ramayana the whole night.

427
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,160
I will definitely be there.

428
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,680
Keep an eye on them
and inform me at the temple.

429
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,240
I will definitely be there.

430
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,640
I want to see how wide her smile is.

431
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,920
Are you going to bathe, miss?

432
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,800
It's almost dark.

433
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,040
Let me get some water
so you can bathe downstairs.

434
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,240
I'm going to the dock.

435
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,320
I hate her so much.

436
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,640
If it weren't for her,
Grandmother wouldn't have beaten me.

437
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,680
But if you hadn't sold her necklace,

438
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,200
things wouldn't have turned out
that way, miss.

439
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,440
But you saw how she challenged me.

440
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,760
She wanted to slap me.

441
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,840
Do you expect me to do nothing?

442
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,680
Now that she has her necklace back,

443
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,960
doesn't this mean
I was beaten for nothing?

444
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,120
Miss Klin, you never used to be this way.

445
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,280
Why is it that when it comes
to Miss Pudtarn,

446
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,800
you always become
so aggrieved and vengeful?

447
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,560
You're right.

448
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,640
I don't understand either

449
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,480
why I hate her so much.

450
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,360
But you have seen
how unyielding she is with me.

451
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,160
Miss, on the day Madam Gui beat you,

452
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,720
Miss Pudtarn was the one
who asked her to stop.

453
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,280
She's also an orphan like you.

454
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,360
Don't you sympathize with her?

455
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,280
Whose servant are you exactly?

456
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,680
Or do you think you're my mother
to be lecturing me like this?

457
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,840
-Well, Im?
-I don't think that way.

458
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,280
-I'm not--
-Well then, be quiet and do what I say.

459
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Yes, miss.

460
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,040
Aren't you going to bathe?

461
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,480
Of course I am.

462
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,400
That's enough, Perm.

463
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,800
I haven't watered everything yet.

464
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,840
It's already dark. It's fine.

465
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,520
Eung.

466
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,520
Yes, miss?

467
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,920
Lady Champa said something to me today.
I don't like what she said.

468
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,840
I don't like it. What she said was weird.

469
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,400
I'm thinking
about whether I should tell you.

470
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,720
Please do, miss.
Otherwise, you will not be able to sleep.

471
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,120
Lady Champa said this to me.

472
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,400
When selecting a spouse,

473
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,760
besides considering a man's age,

474
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,560
you must also be sure that
he is of a similar status to you.

475
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,520
Do not get ideas above your station,
as you will only get hurt.

476
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,440
You're a woman, so you must be careful.

477
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,840
Do you understand?

478
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,040
Why did you listen to her?

479
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,040
Well, she was talking to me.
I'm not deaf or anything.

480
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,280
Well then, let it go in one ear
and out the other.

481
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,800
I can't do that.

482
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,880
When it went in my left ear,
it wouldn't leave, so it's in here.

483
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,720
Stop looking confused.

484
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,040
Help me think.

485
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,880
Help you think?

486
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,760
What did she mean when she said
not to get ideas beyond my station?

487
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,640
Did she mean to tell me
not to get ideas about her grandson

488
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,800
because I'm of a lower social status?

489
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,800
I'm afraid so, miss.

490
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,000
She was clearly trying to belittle me.

491
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,600
She's acting as if she's so powerful,
being a lady and all.

492
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,320
Is it undignified to be associated
with a commoner like me?

493
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,800
As if I want to associate with her.

494
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,200
I knew his grandmother was something.

495
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,160
But she is right, miss.

496
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,000
How? Tell me.

497
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,480
Lord Rid is His Majesty's royal page

498
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,800
and will be someone
of high prestige and rank in the future.

499
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,880
He will be made an earl
and then a marquess.

500
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,120
You're a commoner.
You are not worthy of him, miss.

501
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,080
In the future,

502
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,600
His Majesty will bestow him a wife.

503
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,080
So what? Let him do that.
But why did she have to say that to me?

504
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,120
I'm not thinking of making her grandson…

505
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,200
that or anything.

506
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,840
But she can't stop you

507
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,080
from taking the baron as your husband.

508
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,280
His Lordship can take any woman
he has an eye for

509
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,880
because men are allowed to have
as many wives as they want.

510
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,200
I know that,
but I can't let her insult me.

511
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,960
She can't say I don't know my place.

512
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,960
I can never accept that.
Do you understand?

513
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,200
We are all human beings
regardless of our status,

514
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,320
so she can't look down on me like this.

515
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,160
I'm getting worked up talking about this.
I'm blowing up.

516
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,640
I'm exploding. Do you understand?

517
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,360
So, is the royally-bestowed wife
someone bestowed by His Majesty?

518
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,600
Yes, miss.

519
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,920
By the way,

520
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,240
what do you think of the baron?

521
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,200
Well, he's nice.

522
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,920
He's kind.

523
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,120
He gave me back my necklace
without asking for money.

524
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,720
Do you think he likes me

525
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,560
since he often comes by?

526
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,560
Or does he merely think I'm strange
and he wants to find out about me?

527
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,040
His Lordship has an eye for you. I'm sure.

528
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,920
Sure?

529
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,320
I'm sure.

530
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,520
I think so too.

531
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,120
He's good-looking, so I'm fine with him.

532
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,280
But you could only be
his second wife, miss.

533
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,280
If the first wife is good,

534
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,720
then that would be great,

535
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,520
but would you be able to tolerate her

536
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,560
if she was evil?

537
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,240
Eung.

538
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,000
Give me another hug.

539
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,640
Eung, listen to me.

540
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,200
Right now, I'm waiting for one thing.

541
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,680
The Krishna Kali Manuscript.

542
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,120
If I can go home,
everything here will have been a dream.

543
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,320
But if I can't,

544
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,360
I will never allow myself to be sad.

545
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,320
For me,

546
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,440
love isn't important.

547
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,320
Making a living is more important.

548
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,480
If I cannot be his only wife,

549
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,760
then I will stay unmarried until I die.

550
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,400
Or if I get a husband
and he has an affair,

551
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,680
I will leave him.

552
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,480
And I will become
the most beautiful widow in Ayutthaya.

553
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,160
Pass me the scissors.

554
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,560
It's all done.

555
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,240
What is this called, miss?

556
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,720
An apron.

557
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,760
Let's go to bed. I'm sleepy.

558
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,200
Yes, miss.

559
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,560
Why do I have to be as beautiful,

560
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,120
smart, and quick-witted as I am?

561
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,520
Why hasn't Perm caught Mr. Gecko?

562
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,800
Even though I have now accepted him,
I still don't like his noise.

563
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,800
I'm still scared of his noise.
Do you understand, Perm?

564
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,480
What are you looking at, Eung?

565
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,280
Who did you tell him to catch again?

566
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,880
Mr. Gecko.

567
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,280
Please don't go back, miss.

568
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,880
Please stay here.

569
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,360
Perm.

570
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,720
-Come here.
-What is it, Eung?

571
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,320
Miss Pudtarn wants you

572
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,440
to catch Mr. Gecko
and release him elsewhere.

573
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,720
Mr.…

574
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,400
-Mr. Gecko?
-Yes.

575
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,600
Why does she call it that?

576
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,400
Why not? Can't I give him a name?

577
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,840
We are both animals.

578
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,960
-Animals?
-Animals?

579
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,400
That's right.

580
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,360
Mr. Dog, Miss Cat,

581
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,720
Uncle Tiger, Cousin Fish.

582
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,280
I can call them that.

583
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,120
-Perm.
-Yes, miss?

584
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,720
Set up Mr. Pan.

585
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,440
Yes, miss.

586
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,040
Add Mr. Oil.

587
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,400
Mrs. Morning Glory.

588
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,000
Mrs. Morning Glory.

589
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,960
-My goodness!
-Fire! It's burning!

590
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,440
Get the water.

591
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,200
Here you go. Come on.

592
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,320
-Come on.
-Splash it.

593
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,720
-Do it.
-Stop right there!

594
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,040
It's not on fire.

595
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,120
Here you go, Eung.

596
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,280
Put Mrs. Morning Glory on the table.

597
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,240
After that, wash Mr. Pan

598
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,520
and then come and eat.

599
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,600
Don't forget to get your rice.

600
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,280
Eung, it's His Lordship.

601
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,520
Why is His Lordship here so early, Choi?

602
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,960
Why don't you ask him yourself?

603
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,120
If I were bold enough to ask him,
I wouldn't be asking you.

604
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,480
You're right.

605
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,480
My lord comes here so often.

606
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,840
Do you think
your mistress can escape his grasp?

607
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,960
Just wait and see.

608
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:55,160
Choi, if you don't know my mistress,
then you'd better not say anything.

609
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,880
What are my lord
and your mistress discussing?

610
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,960
I didn't hear a word.

611
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,320
Heavens!

612
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,800
Why didn't you eavesdrop on them a little?

613
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,960
I did.

614
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,800
-What? And?
-And?

615
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,720
I didn't hear a word because…

616
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,840
they were not talking.

617
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,080
They were just sitting there.

618
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,520
Baron,

619
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,280
are you going to just sit here
and not say a word?

620
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,000
Well then, I will go inside now.
Don't accuse me of abandoning my guest.

621
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,600
I'm going.

622
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,040
Hold on.

623
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,040
I knew it.

624
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,080
It always happens.

625
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,000
What does?

626
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,440
In dramas.

627
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,760
When a girl is about to leave,
the guy always says, "Hold on,"

628
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,320
or grabs her arm.

629
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,600
You're making no sense again.

630
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,400
All right, "Hold on,"

631
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,160
and then what?

632
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,160
Why did you change your mind
about the ceremony?

633
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,680
-Is that it?
-Yes.

634
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,760
You wanted to ask me that?

635
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,920
That's right.

636
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,320
Well, Auntie invited me.

637
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,240
But I invited you first.
Why did you refuse?

638
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,680
Well, I couldn't refuse her.

639
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,720
But you can refuse me?

640
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,240
Whether I can or not doesn't matter.

641
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,040
I did not catch that. Say it again.

642
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,920
I won't repeat it. My throat hurts.

643
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,200
Does your throat still hurt?

644
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,880
It has been so long.

645
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,880
I wanted to take you to get treatment.
Why wouldn't you come?

646
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,720
Well?

647
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,160
Gui.

648
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,160
She's very good at treating it.

649
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,400
Come with me now.

650
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,800
Let's go.

651
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,800
What's wrong with you, Pudtarn?

652
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,080
Just tell me.

653
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,560
I'm very worried about you.

654
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,440
Given that you are new here

655
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,640
and are not accustomed
to the climate of Ayutthaya,

656
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,360
you may fall ill easily.

657
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,440
-That's why I--
-My gosh.

658
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,000
Pudtarn.

659
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,440
What's wrong with you?

660
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,080
Baron.

661
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,640
-Just now, you--
-What is this?

662
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,680
-I'm worried about you.
-Lord Rid.

663
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,400
Pudtarn.

664
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,600
Miss!

665
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,200
Are you okay?

666
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,360
Let me.

667
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,200
Baron.

668
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,560
I'll be frank. What's the big deal
about me going to the Chong…

669
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,000
The Chong…

670
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,240
Prieng.

671
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,040
Yes, Prieng.

672
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,440
The Chong Prieng Ceremony.

673
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,480
At first, I didn't want to go,
so I said I wasn't going.

674
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,480
When Auntie invited me,
I felt like going, so I'm going.

675
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,200
Why? Can't I do that?

676
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,160
Why did you have to come
and ask me this so early?

677
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,320
I…

678
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,760
just…

679
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,640
wanted to know.

680
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,640
I didn't know

681
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,000
a person could change her mind
so easily in a day.

682
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,680
I have disturbed you.

683
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,640
Please forgive me.

684
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,040
Lord Rid.

685
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,080
She has no one else.

686
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,400
She only has you.

687
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,440
Please don't fret.

688
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,800
She won't go anywhere.

689
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,240
I still have so much to learn, Choi.

690
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,720
It is fine, my lord.

691
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,280
I will have to ask Father
for advice, won't I?

692
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,960
You'd be better off asking Her Ladyship.

693
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,160
You're right.

694
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,360
I shall ask Mother for advice.

695
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,960
Are you sure Klin isn't around here, Nual?

696
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,040
Yes, ma'am.

697
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,400
And is she not in her room?

698
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,520
No, ma'am.

699
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,880
The Chong Prieng Ceremony is tomorrow.

700
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,520
Klin will be there.

701
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,320
I need you to follow her.

702
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,320
Keep a close eye on her.

703
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:08,440
I think my granddaughter
is acting strangely.

704
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,280
Could it be that she's meeting Song?

705
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,600
If that's the case,
then follow her closely.

706
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,520
Don't let Song be alone
with my granddaughter.

707
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,560
Song is good in most respects,

708
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,960
except that he has
too many wives and children.

709
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,440
If my granddaughter ends up as his wife,

710
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,440
she will be in a lot of trouble.

711
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:35,200
Also, ask Pudtarn
if she plans to attend the ceremony.

712
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,120
I can send more male servants
with her if she wants to.

713
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,400
I heard

714
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,240
someone from the marquess's residence
will come and get Miss Pudtarn.

715
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,760
Is that so?

716
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,240
This girl is also worrisome.

717
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,360
She keeps getting involved
with His Lordship's family.

718
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,880
She said she is a distant relative
of Lady Karaked.

719
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,040
Even though they look similar,
I don't believe this.

720
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,520
I know very well
that she is not one of us.

721
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,440
How could she be related to Her Ladyship?

722
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,480
I think Lady Karaked
is merely showing her kindness.

723
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,600
But don't be too concerned about this.

724
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,200
Keep an eye on my granddaughter closely.

725
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,400
Klin is becoming
more and more unreasonable,

726
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,640
letting her emotions
get the better of her.

727
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:32,280
Does she know that Pudtarn is going
with His Lordship's family?

728
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,480
Yes, ma'am.

729
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,120
Im told me

730
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,040
that she heard Her Ladyship
invite Miss Pudtarn.

731
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,720
She knows?

732
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:49,560
Make sure Klin doesn't run
into His Lordship's family.

733
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,480
What are you worried about, ma'am?

734
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,080
What am I worried about?

735
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,720
I don't know what the future holds,

736
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,800
but prevention is better than cure.

737
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,720
Klin despises Pudtarn.

738
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:15,720
I don't know why His Lordship's family
didn't invite Klin to go with them,

739
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:21,040
but I fear this will anger her
and she will take it out on Pudtarn.

740
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:52,080
I fear this will anger her
and she will take it out on Pudtarn.

741
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,000
Miss.

742
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,520
For the Chong Prieng Ceremony,
which panung would you like to wear?

743
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,720
I have prepared many for you.

744
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,160
Miss.

745
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,120
Im.

746
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,960
Yes, miss?

747
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,560
Miss, why are you crying?

748
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,200
What did Madam scold you about?

749
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,960
It would have been better
had she scolded me.

750
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,240
How, miss?

751
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,440
It's better than her hating me

752
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,800
and loving her instead.

753
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,640
Even though I told her

754
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,480
that Pudtarn wasn't a daughter of angels,

755
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,400
she would not believe me.

756
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,880
She loves Pudtarn

757
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,240
even more than me, her own granddaughter.

758
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,320
What spell did she cast on Grandmother?

759
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,640
She cast a spell?

760
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,240
Is that true, miss?

761
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,120
Are you sure about this?

762
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,520
Set up the net. I want to sleep.

763
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,720
Yes, miss.

764
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,920
Would you like me
to sleep here with you tonight?

765
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,760
Grandmother thinks
I'm going to hurt that woman…

766
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,280
because I'm angry
that Lady Karaked only invited her,

767
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,960
not me.

768
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,960
I won't do anything to her.

769
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,480
Why would I expose myself?

770
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,840
If you won't hurt her, then who will?

771
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,360
Whatever she loves,

772
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,200
I will destroy it.

773
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,440
Klin.

774
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,480
-Where are you going?
-Around here.

775
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,760
Where? Be specific.

776
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,560
Why do you want to know?
You don't care about me anymore.

777
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,960
-Don't--
-There you go again.

778
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,320
You're getting on my nerves.

779
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,560
Just go wherever you want.

780
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,920
I don't care anymore.

781
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,280
Great.

782
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,680
Yes, that's great
because I won't have to worry any longer.

783
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,480
Go wherever the hell you want.

784
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,360
I just hope it's not hell.

785
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,400
Go wherever the hell you want.

786
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,680
I just hope it's not hell.

787
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,520
Pudtarn.

788
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,920
You evil witch.

789
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,640
Whatever you love, I will destroy it.

790
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,320
Im,

791
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:14,000
I have a hunch
something serious will happen.

792
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,920
Are you talking about Miss Klin?

793
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,520
That's right.

794
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,840
Marquess Wisut Sakorn's family

795
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,360
didn't invite her
to the Chong Prieng Ceremony, did they?

796
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,320
You know this.

797
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,400
Goodness, ma'am.

798
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,520
Miss Klin doesn't worry
about such trivial matters.

799
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,760
Is that so?

800
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,520
Well then,

801
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,720
why do I get the feeling
something serious is going to occur?

802
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,120
I don't see there is anything
you should worry about.

803
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,200
For heaven's sake, Im.

804
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,960
I'm worried, so let me be.

805
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,200
You're not worried
because she isn't your granddaughter.

806
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,520
Go.

807
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,080
Get out of my sight.

808
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,200
Go.

809
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,440
You're so clueless.

810
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,160
Hey, why are you still here?

811
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,640
Miss Klin won't do anything
at the Chong Prieng Ceremony, ma'am.

812
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,800
Please believe me.

813
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,760
It would cause too much of a big fuss.
She won't do anything.

814
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,320
I guess you're right.

815
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,600
Klin only involves herself
with trivial matters

816
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,560
and insignificant affairs.

817
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,040
Isn't that right, Im?

818
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,520
You are her servant, so you should know.

819
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,960
Yes, ma'am. Please don't worry.

820
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:44,440
Miss Klin just wants to enjoy the event.

821
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,480
The vegetables are so beautiful.

822
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,080
My gosh.

823
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,400
You are growing so nicely, my babies.

824
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:36,840
Keep growing
all the way to the top, all right?

825
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,720
Perm, have you ever heard

826
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,640
that singing to vegetables
makes them grow faster?

827
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,360
Grow quickly, my dear

828
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,880
Get all the way to the top

829
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,640
Get up to here, my dear

830
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,760
Ma, me, mi, mo, mu

831
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,240
Ta-dah

832
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:01,120
Ma, me, mi, mo, mu

833
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,880
Ta-dah

834
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,560
The event is held at Wat Phutthai Sawan,

835
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:42,000
which is an ancient temple built
in the era of our first king,

836
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,640
King U-thong,

837
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,640
who established Ayutthaya
almost 400 years ago.

838
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,200
The intention of the Chong Prieng,

839
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,360
Lowering Lanterns Onto the Water Ceremony,

840
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,920
is to ask forgiveness
from the water and the land,

841
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,240
as well as from former kings.

842
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,640
It's held when the water level
is high in the rivers

843
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,240
in the 12th lunar month of every year.

844
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,960
So it's the Loy Krathong festival.

845
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,840
Let's float a krathong

846
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,280
After floating your krathong, I--

847
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,920
There is no krathong floating.

848
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,480
Choi, Chom.

849
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,200
Watch your backs.

850
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,360
There are many people here.
We might get separated.

851
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,360
-My goodness!
-Keaw.

852
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,360
I'm sorry.

853
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,480
It's okay.

854
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,360
Be careful when you walk

855
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,760
or you will trip and hurt yourself.

856
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,480
In that case,
why don't you take care of her

857
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,680
so she won't fall?

858
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,360
Prang.

859
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,480
My lady.

860
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,640
Kheow, why are you pulling me?

861
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,200
You're too close.

862
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,200
Is that so?

863
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,520
-You're right.
-Yes, my lady.

864
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,040
They will light the lanterns soon, Prang.

865
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,280
I want to see that.

866
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,240
Will I see from here, In?

867
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,280
Look.
They release the lanterns into the sky.

868
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,880
We shall all be able to see them.

869
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,280
You're right.

870
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,600
Why did you ask,

871
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,120
Kheow?

872
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,320
Yes, my lady. Why did I ask that?

873
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,600
You didn't have to agree.

874
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,600
His Majesty has arrived.

875
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:26,279
What?

876
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,560
Don't you have to escort Your Majesty?

877
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,520
His Majesty.

878
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:33,960
Yes, that.

879
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,399
His Majesty has allowed us
to enjoy the festival.

880
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,880
Except for Thongkam.

881
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:44,319
Just him alone?

882
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,000
Is that enough?

883
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,240
What are you asking?

884
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,040
How can one royal page be enough
to escort His Majesty?

885
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,120
There are also other royal pages.

886
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:04,520
You harlot.

887
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:47,680
What are you doing?

888
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,640
The baron had me bring dessert ingredients
to prepare for you, miss.

889
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,480
Love that is sweet and rejuvenating.

890
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,160
Eung.

891
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,400
This belongs to Miss Klin.

892
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,280
Klin, you bitch. You're dead!

893
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:11,000
Only once you and Praejeen are married
will I accept it.

894
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,920
As for Pudtarn, she is a commoner.

895
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,440
Find her a commoner.

896
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,280
They shall be a suitable match.

897
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,880
Can you promise me
you will stand up to your mother?

898
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:03,000
