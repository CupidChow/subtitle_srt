1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,240
She looks just like her.

2
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,440
Pudtarn looks just like Ketsurang
when she was little.

3
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,480
Your spirit must have been confused,

4
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,280
trying to find its way
for thousands of years.

5
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,400
No!

6
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,960
You're utterly heartless.

7
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,560
You don't care about anyone.

8
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
You don't love anyone.

9
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,680
Will something terrible happen to me?

10
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,160
What you're going to encounter

11
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,920
is something you can't avoid.

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,240
Be mindful.

13
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,280
Consider your actions carefully.

14
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,640
Arrange them side by side
and fill the space.

15
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,320
Hey, guys! Come and take a look at this.
I found something.

16
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,280
What did you find?

17
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
I have no idea, Tarn.

18
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,320
-Be careful. Jeez.
-Hey. Here it is!

19
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,320
Let's move it up here first.

20
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,040
Sure, Tarn.

21
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,080
Is it treasure?

22
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,800
We're going to be rich.

23
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,120
It must be valuable.

24
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
-It's a big chest too.
-How lucky.

25
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,400
Hey!

26
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,600
RID

27
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,240
Dear me!

28
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,080
-Oh, dear.
-Hey.

29
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,360
Master Rid.

30
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,080
Hey!

31
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,360
It looks dead.

32
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,280
It is.

33
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,720
I shall not ask the cause of its death.

34
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,240
I'll let Prang ask you herself.

35
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,240
If Prang finds out…

36
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,920
Prang leaves the palace today.

37
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,120
Come on, Choi.

38
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,360
Where are we going, my lord?

39
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,120
Bring Ginger as well, quickly.

40
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,160
Bring Ginger as well.

41
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,200
Choi, paddle faster.

42
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,360
Yes, my lord.

43
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,320
-You too, Chom.
-Yes, my lord.

44
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,040
-Even faster.
-Yes, my lord.

45
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,480
This one looks just like it.

46
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,600
Right?

47
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,560
For sure, my lord.

48
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,600
For sure, my lord.

49
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,000
What is it, Choi?

50
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,760
My lord.

51
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,720
My lord.

52
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,320
Curse it!

53
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,600
The current is too strong. I can't manage.

54
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,200
I'll get off at Gui's orchard

55
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,440
and run home.

56
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,600
Prang will be here soon.

57
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,440
Yes, my lord.

58
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
Khun Pi.

59
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,320
What is the matter?

60
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,920
There's some kind of light

61
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,200
shining upon the stream in Gui's orchard.

62
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
I don't see anything.

63
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,680
Come.

64
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,120
The chicken, my lord.

65
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,520
All right.

66
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,640
Chom, take the chicken.

67
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,960
Place it in the coop. Run there.

68
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,720
-Paddling is impossible.
-Yes, my lord.

69
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,200
-Come, Choi.
-Yes, my lord.

70
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,920
Shall we go and look?

71
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,440
Well…

72
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,920
Lady Karaked.

73
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,880
Your children are grown up now.

74
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,360
It would be wise to curb your curiosity.

75
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,200
Choi, it's over there.

76
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,919
The light is there.

77
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,600
-Choi.
-Yes, my lord.

78
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,280
Go find a hoe and a shovel.

79
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,800
Gui must have some around here.

80
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,400
Yes, my lord.

81
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,560
I'll get another hoe.

82
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,760
Don't bother, Choi. I can do it myself.

83
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:22,560
KLIN

84
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Grandma.

85
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,880
Grandma.

86
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,400
GUI

87
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,840
Grandma!

88
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,480
Curse you, Klin!

89
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,520
Your shouting gave me a fright.

90
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,160
If you scare me to death
with your screaming,

91
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll return as a ghost to haunt you.

92
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,760
Come see this.

93
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,240
Hurry now.

94
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,360
What?

95
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,440
Over there.

96
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,360
I shall entrust a person to your care.

97
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,760
My own kin.

98
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,880
And I shall bestow upon you
enough wealth and possessions

99
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,240
to see you through

100
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,200
this life and the next.

101
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,120
Come on, Klin.

102
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,520
Where are we going?

103
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,040
-Grandma.
-Come on!

104
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,400
Hurry!

105
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,760
Be careful, Grandma.

106
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,760
Grandma.

107
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,720
Quickly.

108
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,760
What?

109
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,040
The book.

110
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,040
The Krishna Kali Manuscript.

111
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,760
Tarn, don't go yet.

112
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,520
Please open it.
I want to know what's written inside.

113
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,760
Oh, no!

114
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,640
Are you some kind of ghost?

115
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,320
I just got kicked in the guts.

116
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,320
I'm soaked like a dog.

117
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,120
How could he kick me?

118
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,960
I'll have Mhee fire him.

119
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,280
It's a good thing I'm tougher
than a ten-wheeler

120
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,680
or I might not still be here.

121
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,160
I shall entrust my kin to you.

122
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,040
Yes, indeed.

123
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,880
She is here.

124
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,400
She is here.

125
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,160
Gui, do you know her?

126
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,000
I do not, my lord.

127
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,840
-What?
-But

128
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,880
she has been entrusted to me.

129
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,760
Very well.

130
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,560
It appears she is with Gui, my lord.

131
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,520
Who are you people?
You're all dressed strangely.

132
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,720
You have weird hairstyles.

133
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,400
Are they ghosts?

134
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,119
Why do you speak in that peculiar manner?

135
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,880
Where did you come from?

136
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,359
Your clothing is equally peculiar.

137
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,119
Which province are you from?

138
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,240
How did you just appear?
It's like you burrowed through the earth.

139
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,920
Well?

140
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,800
What the hell is going on?

141
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,960
Goodness.

142
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,320
Where are the workers?

143
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,920
Where am I?
Where is the traditional Thai house?

144
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,880
What the hell is going on?

145
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,040
What?

146
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,960
Well…

147
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,720
Keaw and Prang have likely arrived.

148
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,480
Choi, let's hurry home now.

149
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,280
Wait, where are you going?

150
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,480
What are you doing?

151
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,280
You're a woman and you're touching a man.
Have you no shame?

152
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,280
Let go of me.

153
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,520
Hey, wait.

154
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,040
You can't go. You can't take that.

155
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,280
Give the book back to me.

156
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,720
I'll give it to the Fine Arts Department.

157
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Gosh.

158
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,000
Gui.

159
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,240
Is she insane?

160
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Dear me, very well.

161
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,720
I apologize

162
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,080
for giving you a forceful kick
out of fright.

163
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,280
Should you fall ill due to my kick,

164
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,640
Gui, you may inform me at my residence.

165
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,960
The residence of Marquess Wisut Sakorn.

166
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,000
I have provided you with some money.
You may use it to buy medicine.

167
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,360
Money…

168
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,720
Is this money?

169
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,760
Wait, the book.

170
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,400
Hey. What?

171
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,880
This book

172
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,480
has been in my family for generations.

173
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,160
It has nothing to do with you.

174
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,360
If you had not attempted
to steal it from me,

175
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,720
I would not have resorted
to kicking you and hurting you.

176
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,120
You have veiled your face so thoroughly
that I can barely see it.

177
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,400
It was fortunate
that I did not strike you with a hoe.

178
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,040
What language is this?

179
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,440
This is the Krishna Kali Manuscript.

180
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,320
Are you even aware of it?

181
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,880
The Krishna Kali Manuscript.

182
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,520
Oh, dear.

183
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,120
What?

184
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,240
Why?

185
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,120
Why?

186
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,040
Choi,

187
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,680
doesn't she look like her?

188
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,760
Very much so.

189
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,440
Who is she?

190
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,640
Well, we must leave now.

191
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,400
We shall return
to seek answers another day.

192
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,280
Gui, attend to your dependent.

193
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,160
She is burning with fever.

194
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,920
I must return to my residence.

195
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,880
My two siblings are returning today.

196
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,880
I have been absent for too long.

197
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,440
My mother must be waiting.

198
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,360
Yes, my lord.

199
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,440
I entrust her to you, Gui.

200
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,280
I shall return to inquire about her.

201
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,720
Should she become ill
and you need my assistance,

202
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,280
you may inform me at my residence.

203
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,880
Yes, my lord.

204
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,800
Klin.

205
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,280
Klin.

206
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,480
What, Grandma?

207
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,000
Come here.

208
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,040
Come see her face.

209
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,760
Why…

210
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,680
Why

211
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,120
does she look like her, Grandma?

212
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,160
But

213
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,240
the angel has entrusted her to me.

214
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,400
I must accept her.

215
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,440
Goodness, Grandma.

216
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,720
Don't patronize me, Klin.

217
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,400
I am the only one who knows.

218
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,600
She is dressed most strangely.

219
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,240
She could be

220
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,440
a forest spirit in disguise.

221
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,480
I think you should leave her here.

222
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,160
Do not bring her home.

223
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,320
She is not a forest ghost.

224
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,800
Why does she look

225
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,360
so similar to Lady Karaked then?

226
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,320
And she just appeared,

227
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,000
as if from thin air.

228
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,360
A forest ghost could have taken this form.

229
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,800
Did you not see it?
The baron appeared uneasy too.

230
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,200
I have a bad feeling

231
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,160
that she will bring misfortune
to our home.

232
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,640
Are you jealous of her, Klin?

233
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,000
Grandma.

234
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,240
Why would I be jealous?

235
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,360
It is not in my nature, as you know.

236
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,600
But I dislike her.

237
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,280
Did you not see
the look in her eyes earlier?

238
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,760
She's probably more wicked
than you can imagine.

239
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,080
She shall bring trouble
and distress to us.

240
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,960
Do not speak rubbish.

241
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,240
She is not awake yet.

242
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,920
We do not know yet

243
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,960
what her manner is like.

244
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,520
You need to trust me, Grandma.

245
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,800
Hold your tongue, Klin.

246
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,160
I am the owner of our residence.

247
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,960
I shall allow her to stay with us.

248
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,800
You would allow her to stay
at our residence?

249
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,840
Grandma, what has come over you?

250
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,560
Servants!

251
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,600
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

252
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,280
Come here and help me.

253
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,960
-Grandma.
-Come quickly.

254
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,440
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,360
Carry her back to my residence. Be gentle.

256
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,800
Stop at once.

257
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,560
Believe me, Grandma.

258
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,720
Do not bring her back. She is a ghost.

259
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,880
I told you she is not a ghost!

260
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,080
She is…

261
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,440
She is an angel.

262
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,920
What?

263
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,960
Khun Pi.

264
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,480
Karaked.

265
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,320
Refrain from doing that in the future.

266
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,800
Do you want it now or in the future?

267
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,480
Very well.

268
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,040
When do I want it?

269
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,160
So?

270
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,800
Anytime is fine.

271
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Well?

272
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,560
My goodness.

273
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,840
You're getting good.

274
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
What is the matter?

275
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,080
I want to go and see
the golden light in Gui's orchard.

276
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,200
It must be a magical light.

277
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,360
If we were to dig it up,

278
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,080
we might find old treasures
from the reign of King U-thong.

279
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,280
From the founding period of Ayutthaya.

280
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,680
Even something from the eras King Trailok
or King Naresuan would be fine.

281
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,960
I really want to see.

282
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,480
That is absurd.

283
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,200
There is nothing there.

284
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,600
Listen.

285
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,760
Today, Ruang

286
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,280
will return from Song Kwae.

287
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,880
Keaw and Prang
will also return from the palace.

288
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,760
What have you prepared for their meal?

289
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
Oh, dear.

290
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,560
What were Dech and Karaked yelling about?

291
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,880
I could hear them from my chamber.

292
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,120
I heard Lady Karaked

293
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,080
speak of a golden light
near the stream in Gui's orchard.

294
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,600
I did not see any light, my lady.

295
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,040
What golden light?

296
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,360
She is probably just
playing games with her children.

297
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,720
Her children have come of age,

298
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,200
yet her curiosity is unrelenting.

299
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,040
And her way
of raising children is peculiar.

300
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,840
Always laughing and giggling
as though they were close friends.

301
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,480
No one else does such things.

302
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,760
What are you looking at, Prik?

303
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
You expressed yourself
fervently today, my lady.

304
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,120
It's a rare occurrence.

305
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,840
Okay?

306
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,800
Well? Okay?

307
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,040
-Okay, my lady.
-Okay, my lady.

308
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,400
Now,

309
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,240
I wonder where Dech is.

310
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,760
Karaked.

311
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,240
Return to me, my beloved Karaked.

312
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,200
Do not lie still like this.

313
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,040
I am in anguish.

314
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,600
Return to me, my dear.

315
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,680
Stay close to me.

316
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,600
Please do not leave me again.

317
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,840
I did not wish to leave,

318
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,800
but when I touched that book,

319
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,120
a sharp pain shot up to my head.

320
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,360
The world turned dark.
I could not see anything.

321
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,560
I shall destroy the scripture.

322
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,840
Please allow me, Father.

323
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,840
There's some kind of light
shining upon the stream in Gui's orchard.

324
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,040
My beloved Karaked.

325
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,440
Don't let it happen again.

326
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
No, stay put.

327
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,480
-Salee.
-Yes, my lady.

328
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,440
What are you preparing
for the young ones today?

329
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,160
The young lady would like
to have grilled shrimp.

330
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,520
How do you know?

331
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,760
Right. They have not arrived yet.

332
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,880
Indeed, how do I know?

333
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,320
The young lady requested it
the last time she returned.

334
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,520
Salee.

335
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,000
Stop it.

336
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,400
-Hurrah!
-Hurrah!

337
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,800
Put them in there.

338
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,200
Let us prepare fish tom yum as well
so they can slurp the hot broth.

339
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,640
-What are you preparing, Salee?
-What are you preparing, Salee?

340
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,120
Giant gourami.

341
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,320
-We understand.
-We understand.

342
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,680
Okay.

343
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,160
Oh, dear.

344
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,560
It's only a bit of a splatter.

345
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,440
What's all the fuss?

346
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,840
Good, keep grinding it.

347
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,240
Do it gently, Boong.

348
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,320
Boong.

349
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,480
Where is the palm sugar?
Fetch some for me.

350
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,720
I am preparing
the three-flavored sauce for the fish.

351
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,600
Here you are.

352
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,280
Yaem.

353
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,440
I shall do it.

354
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,760
-I shall do it.
-I shall do it.

355
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,240
-I shall do it.
-Let me.

356
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,040
Dear me!

357
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,600
Yaem.

358
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,440
It is my job.

359
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,840
Goodness.

360
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,760
Do not pour the sauce
on the fish yet, Salee.

361
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,080
Do it just before you serve it.

362
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,360
-You always say that, my lady.
-You always say that, my lady.

363
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,040
Please help me.

364
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,480
I am lost.

365
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,200
I shall entrust a person to your care.

366
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,920
Who is it?

367
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,920
It is a woman.

368
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,200
My own kin.

369
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,600
And I shall bestow upon you
enough wealth and possessions

370
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,120
to see you through

371
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,719
this life and the next.

372
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,159
Wealth?

373
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,800
If you are willing to take care of her,

374
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,760
then accept this necklace.

375
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,320
I shall not force you.

376
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
You may accept

377
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,360
or refuse it.

378
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,880
You're a woman and you're touching a man.
Have you no shame?

379
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,920
Let go of me.

380
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,720
This is the Krishna Kali Manuscript.

381
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,160
Are you even aware of it?

382
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,000
The Krishna Kali Manuscript.

383
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,280
-Goodness!
-Goodness!

384
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,920
Goodness!

385
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,360
What the hell?

386
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,680
Is she awake, Grandma?

387
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,440
Grandma, are you hurt?

388
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,680
Well…

389
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,520
My dear.

390
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,760
-My dear.
-Who are you talking to?

391
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,720
Gosh.

392
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,400
She is talking to you. What's with her?

393
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,720
You are deranged.

394
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,360
Don't stare at me.

395
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,400
I'm staring because I don't know
where I am or what's going on.

396
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,600
Who are you?

397
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,680
And why am I dressed like this?

398
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,040
Where are my clothes?
Why did you change my clothes?

399
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,200
Where was that man from before?

400
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,840
Did he take the book?

401
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,960
You ask too many questions.

402
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,720
Which one should we answer first?

403
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,240
She speaks
in a very different manner from us.

404
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,520
Trust me, Grandma. Send her away.

405
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,400
I suspect she is deranged.

406
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,160
Grandma.

407
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,840
She is staring at me

408
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,840
as if she desires to hurt me.

409
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,960
I'd do the same

410
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,440
if I were called deranged for no reason.

411
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,080
Is it not the truth, Grandma?

412
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,320
Have some sympathy.

413
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,200
My dear.

414
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,520
This is Ayutthaya.

415
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,600
What heavenly spirit are you?

416
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,200
From which realm have you traveled here?

417
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,720
Why did you descend to the human realm?

418
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,920
If this is Ayutthaya,

419
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,560
then my work site is here.

420
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,080
Where did the workers from the orchard go?

421
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,160
This is my grandmother's residence.

422
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,160
Your workers are not here.

423
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,640
All the servants belong to my grandmother.

424
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
Please don't.

425
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,760
Don't say anything. I need a minute.

426
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,120
Of course.

427
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,960
You must be hungry.

428
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,600
Eung.

429
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,720
Yes, ma'am.

430
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,760
Bring her something to eat.

431
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,360
What does she eat?

432
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,160
Listen, Eung,
just bring whatever there is.

433
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,600
Does she eat like a servant?

434
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,800
Goodness, Eung, stop dillydallying.

435
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,920
Bring whatever there is.

436
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,080
There is grilled fish.

437
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,400
I'm hungry.
I'll just have something to eat.

438
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,320
Is that it?

439
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,760
It looks more like a spirit offering.

440
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,400
It could be an offering.

441
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,640
A human offering.

442
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,560
-What's your name?
-I'm Eung.

443
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,560
I'm hungry.

444
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,360
Is there a spoon?

445
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,000
A spoon?

446
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,440
To eat with.

447
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,160
I understand.

448
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,920
I must ask Madam Gui
whether you may use it.

449
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,800
Why can't I use it?

450
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,000
How am I supposed to eat without a spoon?

451
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,560
Why do you have to ask? What for?

452
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,280
Only the masters may use spoons to eat.

453
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,800
I shall go and ask.

454
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,080
Wait, no.

455
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,960
Am I supposed to use my hand?

456
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,480
That's right.

457
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,640
That's easy.

458
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,680
Please wash your hands first.

459
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,720
Good.

460
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,040
Wait.

461
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,840
Salee.

462
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,720
Let's whip up an omelet.

463
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,960
This isn't enough.

464
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,480
Yes, my lady.

465
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,160
RUANG

466
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,760
KEAW

467
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,160
PRANG

468
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,960
Try and grab my blouse, Keaw.

469
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,800
Goodness, Prang. That hurts.

470
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,080
-Dear me.
-What is this?

471
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,000
Rid.

472
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,000
Try holding my arm.

473
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,800
Oh, my! Prang.

474
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,360
It hurts.

475
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,960
Ruang.

476
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,320
You're hurting me.

477
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,680
Oh, dear.

478
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,480
-Goodness.
-Let me teach you.

479
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,800
When you are held, twist like this.

480
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,520
I see.

481
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,880
Come here.

482
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,880
Yes?

483
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,640
The king frequents your princess's palace,

484
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,920
does he not?

485
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,640
You are the king's confidant.

486
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,400
How could you not know of this matter?

487
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,640
Very well.

488
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,920
Ruang.

489
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,160
Why do you look at me that way?

490
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,360
Oh, my.

491
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,360
You're all here.

492
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,040
Ruang, Rid, Keaw, Prang.

493
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,320
Good.

494
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,080
Salee, what is there to eat today?

495
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,400
All of your favorites, my lady.

496
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,520
We have very big grilled shrimp

497
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,560
and three-flavored giant gourami as well.

498
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,760
Dear me.

499
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,640
Even now, I find it hard to accept this.

500
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,840
You address the servants
as if they were family.

501
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,960
Why are you not eating?

502
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,720
You have held it
in your hand for some time.

503
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,800
I can't eat.

504
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,920
But you said you were hungry.

505
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,920
I'm hungry, but I can't eat.

506
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,840
What would you like me to do?

507
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,000
Nothing.

508
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,000
Will you answer a question?

509
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,680
I shall not.

510
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,280
Why not? I won't ask you anything hard.

511
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,720
It's a simple question.

512
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,080
-The thing is--
-No.

513
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,360
I shall not listen.

514
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,440
Come on, Eung.

515
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,840
What are you afraid of?
I haven't asked anything yet.

516
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,840
Please do not ask.

517
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,040
I cannot possibly answer.

518
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,640
You should ask Madam Gui or Miss Klin.

519
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,560
Why?

520
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,120
Tell me why.

521
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,560
Because…

522
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,240
I am a servant.

523
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,760
I cannot have an opinion.

524
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,280
Don't be afraid.

525
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,520
I won't do anything to you.

526
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,760
Your tom yum is super yummy, Mother.

527
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,640
Prang.

528
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,560
Your speech is peculiar once more.

529
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,360
It is truly fabulous, Grandmother.

530
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,440
As for the grilled shrimp
with the spicy dipping sauce,

531
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,360
I requested the palace kitchen
to prepare it as part of a royal meal.

532
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,440
The princess devoured every last bit.

533
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,640
That brought the courtiers to tears.

534
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,520
That's two thumbs up for you, Mother.

535
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,240
Salee.

536
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,440
Thumbs up.

537
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,320
Her Highness finished it all.

538
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,720
She enjoys grilled shrimp, much like you.

539
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,400
Prik,

540
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,320
take it away.

541
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,960
Are you sure you've had enough, my lady?

542
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,200
You deserve a good beating.

543
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,600
Yes, my lady.

544
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,880
Your three-flavored fish

545
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,000
is unmatched in both
Phra Nakorn and Song Kwae, Mother.

546
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,600
Mother once prepared it for the king.

547
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,480
He devoured every last bit as well.

548
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,360
Dear me, I feel faint.

549
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,280
-Prik.
-Yes, my lady.

550
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,920
I am full.

551
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,680
What peculiar words you all speak.

552
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,720
Eung, please leave.

553
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,960
Will you really not eat?

554
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,480
I told you I can't.

555
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,120
If you do not eat today,

556
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,800
you will be even more hungry tomorrow.
You must eat.

557
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,840
I'll eat then.

558
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,400
Eung.

559
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,320
This is Ayutthaya, right?

560
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,120
That's right.

561
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,000
Ayutthaya.

562
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,840
Ayutthaya

563
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,440
is where I work.

564
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,920
Who are these people?

565
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,920
Where did the workers go?

566
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,520
Have you finished your meal?

567
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,240
Not yet.

568
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,320
She seems to be dawdling over it.

569
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,320
That is fine.
You have traveled far from your home.

570
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,720
You cannot possibly eat.

571
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,760
I haven't come far.

572
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,480
I live in Ayutthaya too.

573
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,400
Where?

574
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,480
Why bother questioning her further?

575
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,360
She should return to where she stays.

576
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,640
Hey. I said

577
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,400
he has entrusted her to me.

578
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,000
Where do you stay?

579
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,680
I live in…

580
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,360
What district is it?

581
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,320
It's around Wat Chaiwatthanaram.

582
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,960
Curse it, you are lying!

583
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,040
That is around here.

584
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,160
Wat Chaiwatthanaram is near here?

585
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,600
Are we near Kleab Canal?

586
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,000
Yes.

587
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,400
Kleab Canal passes through our orchard.

588
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,520
That means I got

589
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,720
blown by the wind.

590
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,560
No.

591
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,160
I was in the hole the workers dug

592
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,080
in the garden of Arun's house.

593
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,440
Why can't I see the house?

594
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,720
Could you tell me

595
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,560
what year

596
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,600
it is?

597
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,920
What year is this, Klin?

598
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,720
Is it the year of the rooster?

599
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,120
Or the year of the dog?

600
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,400
No, I mean the year
in terms of the Buddhist Era, BE.

601
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,040
What year is it?

602
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,880
BE?

603
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,160
I do not know.

604
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,160
I only know CE.

605
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,480
It's Chula Sakarat Era 1070.

606
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,960
Goodness!

607
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,040
Goodness!

608
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,040
Goodness!

609
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,280
What is the matter?

610
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,360
She is behaving like a madwoman.

611
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,600
What year did you say it is again?

612
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,720
Madwoman, she already said

613
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,760
it is CE. 1070.

614
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,160
CE.

615
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,320
They used that in the past.

616
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,640
What is the king's name?

617
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,280
Now you're asking that.

618
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,040
Klin, silence.

619
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,720
Crown Prince Phet is the new king.
He has recently ascended the throne.

620
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,000
His father, the Tiger King, has passed.

621
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,040
Did your angel kin not inform you?

622
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,840
Tiger King?

623
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,440
The Tiger Monarch?

624
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,960
Like in the story of Phan Thai Norasing.

625
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,600
Right?

626
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,360
Phan Thai what?

627
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,760
Phan Thai Norasing.

628
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,720
He was beheaded
for damaging the royal barge.

629
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,000
Phan Thai Norasing?

630
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,040
Have any of you heard of him?

631
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,800
No.

632
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,240
He was beheaded by the Tiger Monarch.

633
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,920
You are deranged.

634
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,200
You speak of such grave matters.

635
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,400
I have never heard such a peculiar tale.

636
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,400
Even though the Tiger King has passed,

637
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,520
he could still put you in prison.

638
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,120
Didn't it happen?

639
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,080
Did the Tiger Monarch dig a canal?

640
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,760
Dig a canal?

641
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,680
Yes, he did.

642
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,960
Isn't that so, everyone?

643
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,640
-He dug Khok Kham Canal, ma'am.
-He dug Khok Kham Canal, ma'am.

644
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,400
The Tiger Monarch.

645
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,840
Madwoman.

646
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,640
You speak improperly.

647
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,000
It is "Tiger King."

648
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,880
I was talking to myself.
Keep your nose out of it.

649
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,320
Grandma, why would you engage with her?

650
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,560
Klin.

651
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,360
-Stop it.
-Why, Grandma?

652
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,760
Am I not correct?

653
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,080
She continues to speak such nonsense.

654
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,520
I said stop talking immediately.

655
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,600
I shall not. You partake in her madness.

656
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,600
Her crazy ramblings will be the end of us.

657
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,800
She's cursed.

658
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,160
If you believe her and not me,
you shall see.

659
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,480
She is an angel, a heavenly being.

660
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,960
He entrusted her to my care.
I must look after her.

661
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,880
Do not oppose me.

662
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,120
I shall not listen.

663
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,880
You have become mad.

664
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:01,120
What angel? What heavenly being?
You have become mad!

665
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,640
Stop it now, Klin!

666
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,320
No! Why will you not listen to me?

667
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,000
Then you may leave!

668
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,480
You don't need to stay here!

669
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,160
Curse it!

670
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,280
Klin.

671
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,560
Come here.

672
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,680
No.

673
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,160
I have something you must see.

674
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,680
You may return to your meal.

675
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,400
Eung.

676
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,160
Bring the food.

677
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,120
You may eat in the kitchen house.

678
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,240
Yes, ma'am.

679
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,960
Please come.

680
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,200
Klin.

681
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,000
Come here.

682
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,000
Klin.

683
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,040
What is it?

684
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,400
Her kin gave it to me last night.

685
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:27,920
Her kin

686
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,480
is an angel.

687
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,280
It is just a small ruby.

688
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,680
See the texture and the cut of the ruby.

689
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,840
No one in Phra Nakorn
could produce it this way.

690
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,640
Even so,

691
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,560
there are countless rubies like this one.

692
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,720
It merely has not yet
been refined and ground.

693
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,160
It is of very little value.

694
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,320
Goodness me.

695
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,200
How can objects from heaven
and those on earth

696
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,600
be compared?

697
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,800
I am too exhausted to speak to you.

698
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,760
Come.

699
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,440
Have some water.

700
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,960
All right, Tarn. Here goes nothing.

701
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,240
What is your name?

702
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,600
I am called Gui.

703
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,800
This is my granddaughter.

704
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,240
She is called Klin.

705
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,440
My nickname is Pudtarn.

706
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,240
Nickname?

707
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,200
What is that?

708
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,120
It's what people call me.

709
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,200
Why "nickname"?

710
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,040
Why refer to yourself that way?

711
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:51,720
Well…

712
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,760
-Eung?
-My name.

713
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,520
My name, right?

714
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,840
If you are not an angel,

715
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,520
where do you come from?

716
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,080
Why is your speech so peculiar?

717
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,560
I'm… Well…

718
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,000
I am

719
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,440
from Krung Thep.

720
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,920
The full name is

721
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,760
Krung Thep Mahanakhon Amon Rattanakosin

722
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,800
Mahinthara Ayuthaya Mahadilok Phop

723
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,640
Noppharat Ratchathani Burirom

724
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,320
Udomratchaniwet Mahasathan

725
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,040
Amon Piman Awatan Sathit

726
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,240
Sakkathattiya Witsanukam Prasit.

727
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,680
Do you want to try me, Klin?

728
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,880
You can remember such a long name.

729
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,080
You are quite extraordinarily clever.

730
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,960
There is a short name for it.

731
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,800
Krung Thep.

732
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,360
Krung Thep?

733
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,600
That is similar to Ayutthaya.

734
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,680
The full name of Ayutthaya is

735
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,640
Krung Thep Dvaravati Si Ayutthaya.

736
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,440
City of Angels.

737
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,960
I suspected as much.

738
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,520
She comes from Tavatimsa Heaven.

739
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,040
My dream was real.

740
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,280
All of you.

741
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:23,440
The angel has sent his kin to me.

742
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,560
Heavens.

743
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:31,280
You have taken the form of a real human.

744
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:32,960
I am human.

745
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,600
For heaven's sake.

746
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,760
Wherever you came from,
quickly return there.

747
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,600
-Hey.
-Listen, Klin.

748
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,400
I said her angel kin

749
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,440
came to me in a dream
to entrust her into my care.

750
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,240
Why would you doubt me?

751
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,720
He shall grant us
plenty of wealth and possessions.

752
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,280
We shall lack nothing in this life.

753
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,600
Do you truly believe that?

754
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,960
How does one gain wealth without working?

755
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,920
He shall bless our orchard

756
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,160
to flourish and produce fruit,
unceasingly, you fool.

757
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,680
You continue to disrespect him.

758
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,200
I shall strike you with this bowl.

759
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,160
Grandma!

760
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,200
Eung.

761
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,240
-Eung!
-Yes, ma'am.

762
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,320
Go and find Klin.

763
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,720
Call her to eat.

764
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,880
Go quietly.

765
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,080
Do not make a fuss.

766
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,160
What do you want, Eung?

767
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,760
Your grandmother sent me.

768
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,880
Why?

769
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,920
To call you to eat.

770
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,320
Then why are you just sitting there?

771
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,480
She said to go quietly.

772
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,400
My grandmother said to call me to eat.

773
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,800
Why did you not do so?

774
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,520
I did, just now.

775
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,800
What is the matter, ma'am?

776
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,160
Leave now.

777
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,560
I may lose my temper and hit you.

778
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,760
I also have hands.

779
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,560
What did you say, Eung?

780
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,400
I said nothing.

781
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,320
I am a servant. What could I say?

782
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,200
Leave my sight.

783
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,360
Go and be with your angel.
Do not let me see your face anymore.

784
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,240
Do not forget to eat, ma'am.

785
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,200
Eung!

786
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:17,359
Prang, you are doing great.
Ruang, don't give up.

787
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:18,920
Who are you cheering for, Keaw?

788
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,760
Do you intend to stay here
or in a separate house?

789
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,920
I want to stay here.

790
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,680
I'll make sure you want to leave.

791
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,800
I don't want anything to happen to Mother.

792
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,600
Take the manuscript chest to Song Kwae.

793
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,319
I need to find that book.

794
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,160
I didn't lose my book.

795
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,600
You took it!

796
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:41,040
About our encounter with that lady,

797
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,439
I forbid anyone
from telling Father and Mother.

798
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,319
The baron would not know.

799
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:47,520
Just tell Her Ladyship.

800
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,279
How am I going to survive in this place?

801
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:32,479
