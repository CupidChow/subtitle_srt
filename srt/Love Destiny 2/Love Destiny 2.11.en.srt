1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,600
She really is your niece, Karaked?

2
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,200
Yes. She is my biological niece.

3
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,760
I remembered that it was your necklace
with that strange pendant.

4
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,760
Thank you so much.

5
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,520
I thought I would never see
my parents' faces again.

6
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,120
Is this your new mistress?

7
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,080
I'll kill you!

8
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,720
-Do you think he will come back, Perm?
-Certainly.

9
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,600
Why was he trying to hurt her?

10
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,360
I can't think why.

11
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,200
We must find a way to protect ourselves.

12
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,960
Lady Praejeen came to see you.

13
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,440
She must be dying
to join your two families together.

14
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,760
Do you know whose residence we're passing?

15
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,000
Gui's residence.

16
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,640
Will you not invite someone
to come along with us?

17
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
Which market shall we visit?

18
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,200
Let Baron Maharit ask me himself.

19
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,160
What would you like to buy?

20
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,280
It's the same market we came to last time.

21
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,920
That's right.

22
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,480
But I told you I wanted a notebook
and a pencil.

23
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,920
Only you wanted to buy those.
I can take you to buy them next time.

24
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,800
Why did you ask me then?

25
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,000
So you could answer.

26
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,800
I did not ask so I could take you.

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,320
Why do you seem so curious?

28
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,280
Do you really not know why I'm curious?

29
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,000
I get it now. Were you teasing me?

30
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,360
I thought
you might want to buy some garments.

31
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,320
I asked you expecting that answer.

32
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,440
Had that been your answer,

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,960
you would have been pleased.

34
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,440
You wanted to please me?

35
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
That is the case.

36
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,000
Then why didn't you take me
to where they sell notebooks to please me?

37
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,840
Well, Prang and Keaw
would not like to buy those.

38
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,560
My sisters both wish to buy clothes.

39
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,120
I understand now.

40
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,320
And why did you think
I would like to buy clothes?

41
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,200
Because…

42
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,320
Keaw and Prang told me that

43
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,360
you don't have many clothes,

44
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,320
and one day you might…

45
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,080
Might what?

46
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,960
You might end up wearing no clothes.

47
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,640
I see.

48
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,160
Do you think
I would go around in the nude?

49
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,920
What?

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,640
Are you afraid that
someone might hear me say--

51
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,840
Hey!

52
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,400
I did not intend to offend you.

53
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,400
No, it's fine. I was just startled.

54
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,960
And it hurt because you pressed so hard.

55
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,720
Gosh, do I have a fat lip?

56
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Next time, just tell me.
You don't have to hurt me.

57
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,480
It was not my intention to hurt you.

58
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,640
What?

59
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,440
Look. Why am I hurt then?

60
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,320
I apologize.

61
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,280
Fine.

62
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,040
Apology accepted, if you didn't mean it.

63
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,480
What?

64
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,760
Where did everyone go?

65
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,080
Never mind.

66
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,160
Would you like to see the Drum Tower?

67
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,320
I shall take you.

68
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,680
The Drum Tower?

69
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,760
I don't know what it is,
but I would like to see it.

70
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,560
Here is the Drum Tower.

71
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,240
There are three stories.
There's a drum on each story.

72
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,440
Why are there three stories?

73
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,840
Is it used to tell the time?

74
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,240
Do they bang the drums?

75
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,680
There are three drums.

76
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,320
Each story serves a distinct purpose.

77
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,320
The uppermost is known as Phra Maharuek.

78
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,040
It is struck to signal
the approach of invading enemies.

79
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,960
Phra Nakornbal Department officials

80
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,440
take turns standing guard
and keeping watch over the tower.

81
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,000
The high tower allows them
to see a great way into the distance.

82
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,680
Should there be
hostile forces approaching,

83
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,040
this view allows for early sighting
before their arrival.

84
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,680
The large drumhead

85
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,320
echoes loudly across great distances.

86
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,480
As for the middle story,

87
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,400
it is known as Phra Maharangap-phloeng.

88
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,880
-If--
-Right, Gui told me that

89
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,280
the stalls in the houseboat area
often catch fire.

90
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,480
If there's a fire,
would you hear the drums here?

91
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,320
But how would you even know

92
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,360
which drum means what
since they all sound the same?

93
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,200
You always interrupt me.

94
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,320
I had not finished talking
when you interrupted me.

95
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,160
You may ask someone else
to explain it to you.

96
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,200
You're sulking now.
Why do you get upset so easily?

97
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,880
Don't sulk. I apologize.

98
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,600
From now on, I will listen quietly.

99
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,400
Please continue.

100
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,040
The middle story
is called Phra Maharangap-phloeng.

101
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,720
In case of fire outside the city walls,
the drum is struck three times.

102
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
If the fire is within the city walls,

103
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,160
it is struck continuously
until the fire is extinguished.

104
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,600
As for the last story,

105
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,160
the bottommost is the grand drum

106
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,880
called Phra Thiwaratri.

107
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,760
It is struck at midday
to announce the assembly

108
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,080
and at dusk when the sun sets.

109
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,840
The Phra Nakornbal Department
is in charge of guarding the drums.

110
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,000
Did you laugh at me?

111
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,840
You would be insane not to be startled
by such a loud drum sound.

112
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,880
Insane?

113
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,960
Why insane?

114
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,600
What is the matter?

115
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,919
What is the matter?

116
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,559
Keaw and Prang are here.

117
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,640
Rid,

118
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,840
there are some beautiful
panung over there.

119
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,600
I would like to buy one for Mother.

120
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,120
There are all sorts of food too.

121
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,760
Shall we buy some for Grandmother, Rid?

122
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,520
Mother's food is so much better.
Do not buy any here.

123
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,160
By the way,
I must attend to some bookkeeping.

124
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,160
Please wait for me here.

125
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,720
Chom and Kaew,

126
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,120
stay here with the ladies.

127
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,320
-Where is Puak?
-He is watching the boat.

128
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,560
Watch the three ladies closely.

129
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,880
I shall be back soon.

130
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,040
If I am not back before sunset,

131
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,800
wait for me at the dock.

132
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,320
Choi, come with me.

133
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,360
Let us go.

134
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,960
Where did you say they were?

135
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,440
That way.

136
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,760
Here it is, Pudtarn.

137
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,880
I would like to buy this for Mother.

138
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,720
It's pretty.

139
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,440
Wearing it with a sbai in the color
of a monk's robe would be very pretty.

140
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,560
But this is green, Pudtarn.

141
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
Wearing it with an orange sbai

142
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,280
would make one look like
a crow holding a chili.

143
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,280
No, it wouldn't.

144
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,800
That would be a black panung
with a red sbai, Keaw.

145
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,400
Indeed. You were wrong.

146
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,880
A green panung

147
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,000
with an orange sbai would be the best.

148
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,240
But it must be a dull orange color,

149
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,920
not bright orange.

150
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,360
And this one?

151
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,600
What color sbai would go
with a bark-colored panung?

152
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Banana leaf green.

153
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,120
-Or a deep red.
-Yes.

154
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,680
Wearing panung and sbai like we do
is not very edgy, is it?

155
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,320
Not edgy at all.

156
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,680
Listen, Keaw and Prang,

157
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,560
I'm going to make blush

158
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,920
and eyeshadow.

159
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,480
They are…

160
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,200
I know what eyeshadow is.

161
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,560
Mother said you apply it to your eyes.

162
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,440
Really? Do you know it?

163
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,560
Yes.

164
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,520
Once I've made it, I'll give you some.

165
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,200
I can assure you that you will look
so stunning that you will turn heads.

166
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,520
I shall give some
to the ladies in the palace.

167
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,760
If they like it,
everyone in the palace shall look pretty.

168
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,560
Once I've made it,
please help me set a price.

169
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,280
Will you sell it, Pudtarn?

170
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,160
Of course. I have to sell it, Keaw.
We all need to make a living.

171
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,560
I've invested money
in buying the ingredients.

172
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,960
There's also the cost of labor.

173
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,400
If I give it away,
I would lose all my money.

174
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,840
"Ingredients"?

175
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,080
What are those?

176
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,480
They are…

177
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,600
They're the things I use

178
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
to make my products.

179
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,400
Do you cook them?

180
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,120
Keaw, do not ask so many questions.

181
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,680
It will only cause more confusion.

182
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,080
Pudtarn mentioned investing,
so I would like to know

183
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,600
-if--
-Keaw.

184
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,240
Regarding selling it,

185
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,120
I believe it is only fair.

186
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,640
Would you prefer that
Pudtarn gave it away instead?

187
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,000
How would Pudtarn afford to eat?

188
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,280
You are welcome to eat with me.

189
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,960
I shall remain at home for a while.

190
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,200
Grandmother requested permission
for me to return.

191
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,080
Mother is the best cook.

192
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,960
I would love to try some.

193
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,880
But I can cook as well.
I'm a good cook too.

194
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,800
Please cook for us sometimes.

195
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,680
I am curious how your cooking
compares to my mother's.

196
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,520
Shall I take this one?

197
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,800
I would like to buy it for Grandmother.

198
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,120
Certainly.

199
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,880
Capture only Eung.

200
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,680
Leave those three women alone.

201
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,160
We could take one of them.

202
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,960
All three are pretty.

203
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,600
I would like to look
at the garments at this stall.

204
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,000
Goodness.

205
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,120
They are pretty.

206
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,680
Would you like to buy one, Pudtarn?

207
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,280
Please come and wait
at the dock, my ladies.

208
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,960
We should go. Rid told us to.

209
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,920
Almost everyone has left.

210
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,480
-Eung!
-Kam.

211
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,640
Yes.

212
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,640
-It is me.
-What else do you want from me?

213
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,760
I want you.

214
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,160
I am not going!

215
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
Do not come near me! Stay away from me!

216
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,920
You have some nerves showing up.
Didn't you learn your lesson?

217
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Back away, miss.

218
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,160
No. Will you do this
in front of all these people?

219
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,280
Keaw, Prang, are there police here?

220
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,960
Pudtarn.

221
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,400
Chom.

222
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,480
Mun, help me out.

223
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,120
Is Eung not his wife?

224
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,480
Not anymore.

225
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,960
-Let go of her!
-Let go of her!

226
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,640
Let go of her now!

227
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,120
-Let go of her!
-My goodness!

228
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,400
Hey!

229
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,640
Stop right there, you scoundrel!

230
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,800
Get her!

231
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,920
Be careful, my lady!

232
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,560
Prang.

233
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,360
You are dead, Kam.

234
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,360
How dare you touch Pudtarn!

235
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,320
What is happening,

236
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,680
Keaw, Prang?

237
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,120
Ming.

238
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,640
Keaw.

239
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,080
Yes, Ming.

240
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,400
Pudtarn.

241
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,680
Yes, my lord.

242
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,640
Why are you all gathered here?

243
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,720
What happened?

244
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,160
Did Rid accompany you?

245
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,839
He did,
but he left to attend to some business.

246
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,480
Who are these men?

247
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,880
Tie them up. Do not let them get away.

248
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,200
Keaw.

249
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,880
Why are you crying?

250
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,320
I have done something shameful.

251
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,920
What have you done?

252
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I rolled up my panung

253
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,920
and exposed my thighs.

254
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,520
If Grandmother were to hear of this,

255
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,600
I would be scolded

256
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,840
and forbidden from leaving the house.

257
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,520
Goodness, Keaw.

258
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,320
I'm sure no one saw it.

259
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,720
But I know it in my heart.

260
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,320
If I close my eyes,

261
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,960
I can still see my legs clearly.

262
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,960
Rid,

263
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,680
there you are.

264
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,640
What happened?

265
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,120
Ming, you are here as well.

266
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,680
I happened to be passing
and I witnessed the commotion.

267
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,240
It must not have been serious.

268
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,560
You are smiling.

269
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,680
It was not serious.

270
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,960
You may ask Pudtarn.

271
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,720
You've been gone a long time,

272
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,280
leaving vulnerable women
defenseless against harassment.

273
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,640
Do not listen to Pudtarn.

274
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,200
Defenseless?

275
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,920
Look.

276
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,640
The harassers sit there,
battered and beaten.

277
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,600
Who did that?

278
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,400
Those three were battered

279
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,960
by these three ladies here.

280
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,640
I see.

281
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,040
I am not surprised, Ming.

282
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,520
My two sisters

283
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,440
learned jujitsu from my mother.

284
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,840
And the other one…

285
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,240
I know some Aikido.

286
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,640
-Aikido?
-Aikido?

287
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,240
Aikido is a martial art.

288
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,960
It originated in Japan.

289
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,240
It's derived from ancient practices.

290
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,480
It aims to harmonize life's forces.

291
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,200
The core principle is self-defense

292
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,720
while minimizing injuries to opponents.

293
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,760
He only got hurt

294
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,600
because I lost control for a bit.

295
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,280
-For a bit?
-For a bit?

296
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,000
Yes, just for a bit.

297
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,560
That's why he only got a broken arm.

298
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,000
Ming,

299
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,000
join us for dinner at our residence.

300
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,200
It is already evening.

301
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,760
I would be delighted.

302
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,160
I always look forward to tasting
the meals at your house.

303
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,600
You always look forward
to coming to our house, don't you, Ming?

304
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,800
That's right, Prang.

305
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,480
Always and forever.

306
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,000
Rid,

307
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,200
I just remembered that
I have some important business.

308
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,360
I cannot join you for a meal.

309
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,400
What?

310
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,720
Did that not seem strange?

311
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,160
Keaw and Prang, what could be the reason?

312
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,600
You must know.

313
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,800
I do not know.

314
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,440
Keaw?

315
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,840
How would I know?

316
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,600
Pudtarn?

317
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,120
Please take me home first.

318
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,800
Will you not join us for a meal?

319
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,000
-No.
-Why not?

320
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,560
I'll tell you why.

321
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,360
I'm just not going.

322
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,240
Do as you please.

323
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,440
Hello.

324
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,040
Keaw, Prang.

325
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,440
What is the matter with your brother?

326
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,760
Choi,

327
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,120
why are you smiling?

328
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,200
I am not.

329
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,480
Is your smile intended to mock me?

330
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,640
I am not smiling.
I am about to cry, young lord.

331
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,480
Do not call me "young lord."

332
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Oh, dear.

333
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,160
I have called you that since your birth.

334
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,280
How else will I address you, young lord?

335
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,880
I told you not to. Do you not understand?

336
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,600
You may go.

337
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,040
I said, you may go.

338
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,040
-Choi.
-Yes, my lady.

339
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,400
What is the matter with your master?

340
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,560
He has never been this way,
so I do not know.

341
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,640
Why are you two laughing?

342
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,240
It is as I told you, Mother.

343
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,320
Yes, for sure, Mother.

344
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,320
What is the matter, Karaked?

345
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,400
It is our son.

346
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,800
What is the matter with him?

347
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,880
It's nothing. He will get over it.

348
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,280
Is that true?

349
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,520
How do you know?

350
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,080
Who am I?

351
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,760
Who?

352
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,240
I'm your wife,

353
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,240
who is both pretty and clever,
and also a schemer.

354
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,000
And your husband loves you dearly.

355
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,600
Exactly right.

356
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,160
Well,

357
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,800
who precisely said those words?

358
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,760
-His name is--
-Yes.

359
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,240
I remember.

360
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,760
His name is a good one.

361
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,560
He must be clever due to his name.

362
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,800
Karaked.

363
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,000
It would not look proper if anyone saw.

364
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,000
A wife tweaking her husband's nose.

365
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,200
Women in Ayutthaya do not do such things.

366
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,440
Who will see us?

367
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,720
Come here.

368
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,880
I see you.

369
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,240
-Prik.
-Prik.

370
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,080
Yes, my lord and lady?

371
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,640
Have you been there long?

372
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,960
What did you hear?

373
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,360
I heard it all. I was here before you.

374
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,760
Where were you? Why did I not see you?

375
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,080
I was sitting right here.

376
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,160
You did not see me because you were
preoccupied with Lord Rid.

377
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,440
My goodness,

378
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,120
he is a man now.

379
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,640
He must feel lonely sometimes
because he does not have a wife.

380
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,440
It must be so.

381
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,520
It shall be fine.

382
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,280
When his father was older than Rid is now,
he did not have a wife either.

383
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,160
He was fine.

384
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,800
What are you scheming today, you schemer?

385
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,800
I will invite someone here.

386
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,840
Who?

387
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,080
I don't have to go
if I don't want to, do I?

388
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
It's nothing to get so angry about.

389
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,240
Right, Eung?

390
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,720
You look strange, Perm.

391
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,080
What is it?

392
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,360
It is me, Pin.

393
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,920
And me, Yaem.

394
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,520
What brings you two here, Pin and Yaem?

395
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,080
Keaw, what did you do to cause Ming
to leave so abruptly?

396
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,920
I did nothing.

397
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Do not lie, Keaw.

398
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:16,040
He was initially overjoyed
to join us for dinner.

399
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,080
But when he looked at you,

400
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,280
his smile faded.

401
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,360
I merely frowned at him.

402
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,080
Really?

403
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,840
Why? You like him, do you not?

404
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,960
I do,

405
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,720
but why would I let him
know too soon, Prang?

406
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,120
I am confused.

407
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,880
Tell me why.

408
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,480
So he must fight for me,
my beloved sister, Prang.

409
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,440
Remember that.

410
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,640
It's fine.

411
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,720
I told you I could come another day.

412
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,080
Lady Karaked said to bring you today.

413
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,280
But I must prepare food for Eung and Perm.

414
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,480
Do they not have hands?

415
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,120
Please come.

416
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,360
This house…

417
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,760
seems familiar.

418
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,240
What is the matter?

419
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,440
Does your head hurt?

420
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,360
I think…

421
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,040
I have seen…

422
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,160
this place before.

423
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,400
This "place"?

424
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,000
Do you mean this "house," miss?

425
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,800
It looks familiar,

426
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,560
like I have seen it before.

427
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,520
Have you seen it before?

428
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,160
Where have you seen it?

429
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,200
There you are, Pudtarn.

430
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,760
Come in.

431
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,440
So you are

432
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,880
Pudtarn.

433
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,800
Since that day,

434
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,960
it has been a month
and she's nowhere to be found.

435
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,280
I'm so worried.

436
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,000
Your Holiness,
do you believe that Pudtarn disappeared?

437
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,199
You have to believe it
whether you want to or not.

438
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,920
Everyone saw the same thing.

439
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,639
There was a bright light,
like someone shining a spotlight.

440
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,000
When the light disappeared,
so did Pudtarn.

441
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,600
She couldn't have gone anywhere.

442
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,760
It was an open area
with no alleys or paths leading anywhere.

443
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:37,159
Vipavee, you should ask him first.

444
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,760
I'm sorry.

445
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,040
I'm too impatient.

446
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,239
I really don't know
what happened to Pudtarn.

447
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,960
And do you believe
that Pudtarn has disappeared?

448
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,440
I already told you,
I have no idea what to think.

449
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,639
So you think it could be true?

450
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,800
Auntie,

451
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,440
I admit that the relationship
between me and Pudtarn wasn't good.

452
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,760
But…

453
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,160
she's my only niece

454
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,920
and I'm her only aunt.

455
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,160
We only have each other, no one else.

456
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,440
Pudtarn has disappeared.

457
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,160
I don't even know what to say.

458
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,520
I'm doing fine myself.

459
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,280
I still live in the same place.

460
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,480
I have the same house, the same friends.

461
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,400
I just feel lonely sometimes.

462
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,640
I think about Pudtarn.

463
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,960
I have no idea where she is.

464
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,040
She may be even lonelier
and sadder than I am.

465
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,160
More importantly,

466
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,240
I don't know
if she's in danger or if she's safe.

467
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,200
I'm so worried about Pudtarn.

468
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,880
You don't know, so don't assume.

469
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,440
I don't want to assume,
but I don't know what else to think.

470
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,000
That's correct.

471
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,320
Sister Sipang is correct.

472
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,200
You don't know,

473
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,000
so don't assume.

474
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,920
Yes, Your Holiness.

475
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,080
If you can imagine a bad situation,

476
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,440
you can also imagine a good situation,
isn't that right?

477
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,760
Vipavee.

478
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,000
Yes, Your Holiness.

479
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,520
I will try to be positive.

480
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,560
Do that if you can.

481
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,080
Pudtarn is where she belongs.

482
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,720
She's not in any danger.

483
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,680
Where is Mother?

484
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,880
She is nearly here.

485
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,800
The stream running through Gui's orchard
is in an isolated area.

486
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,000
You must be careful.

487
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
Yes, my lord.

488
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,240
If you face any trouble, report it here.

489
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,600
I shall help you as best I can.

490
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,920
Yes, my lord.

491
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,440
Karaked,

492
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,120
accompany Pudtarn
to pay her respects to Mother.

493
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,120
I shall be in the study for a while.

494
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,440
The king has inquired
about the location of a raft I built.

495
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,720
But it was a long time ago.
I shall need to look into it for a while.

496
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,960
Call for me when the meal is served.

497
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,880
Certainly.

498
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,680
Pudtarn,

499
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,440
pay your respects.

500
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,680
Chin up. Let me see your face.

501
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,480
Your eyes appear rather stern.

502
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,320
You have a mole beneath your eye.
They say it is not a good sign.

503
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,520
Though the mole may appear charming,

504
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,200
you may find yourself
shedding tears often,

505
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,720
as it is believed that
the mole is there to catch them.

506
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,520
Should I remove it?

507
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,920
Goodness.

508
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,320
That would leave you
with an unpleasant scar.

509
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,760
Would you like that?

510
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,480
I just don't want to cry.

511
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,120
What is the matter, Prik?

512
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,360
I do not know how to speak of this.

513
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,360
-Chuang.
-Yes, my lady.

514
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,240
Tell Salee to bring my meal to my room.

515
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,560
Let the young ones enjoy themselves.

516
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,280
Yes, my lady.

517
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,360
Will you bathe now, my lady?

518
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,560
Yes.

519
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,840
Join us for dinner, Pudtarn.

520
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,080
Can I help with the cooking?

521
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,000
You shouldn't.
The cooks here are quite peculiar.

522
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,560
Please come and wait over here.

523
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,600
What is on your mind, Prik?

524
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,880
You were looking daggers at her.

525
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,880
My lady, I do not know how to speak of it.

526
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,160
What is it?

527
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,440
She resembles…

528
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,760
She resembles…

529
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,480
Karaked.

530
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,440
Indeed.

531
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,760
That one, the old Lady Karaked.

532
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,600
Goodness, Prik!

533
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,680
The hostile look in her eyes
is strikingly similar!

534
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,280
You saw it yourself.

535
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,720
Chuang, did you see what I saw?

536
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,000
Of course I did, Prik.

537
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,040
My word.

538
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,680
I saw it as well, my lady.

539
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,600
What misfortune may befall
my residence once again?

540
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,880
My lady,
how is she related to Lady Karaked?

541
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,920
Where did she come from?

542
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,280
She must come from Song Kwae,
must she not?

543
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,320
Wait here, Tarn.

544
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,960
Pin and Yaem, please stay with her.

545
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,200
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

546
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,800
Pudtarn.

547
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,360
You did not tell us you were coming.
I am so pleased.

548
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,960
Who did you come with, Pudtarn?

549
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,760
Pin and Yaem invited me to have a meal.

550
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,120
Mother's cooking is the most delicious.

551
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,960
The meal is here.

552
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,680
Pin, Yaem, what do we have to eat today?

553
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,560
See for yourself.

554
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,120
We have grilled shrimp again.

555
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,280
And chicken pad kaprao with fried egg.

556
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,640
Rid is particularly fond of it.

557
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,360
Lady Karaked has called for you.
The meal is ready.

558
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,960
I am not eating.

559
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,840
There is chicken pad kaprao
with fried egg, your favorite dish.

560
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,000
Lady Karaked made it herself.

561
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,720
The egg is fluffy, just the way you like.

562
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,760
I said I am not eating.

563
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,160
Would you like a smack on the head?

564
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,760
Pin, is the grilled shrimp ready?

565
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,440
I am removing the shells
as quickly as I can.

566
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,120
Hurry, Yaem. Lady Prang is hungry.

567
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,160
Do you not see that I am working
as quickly as I can?

568
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,560
Do it yourself then.

569
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,560
Pudtarn, have some seafood sauce.

570
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,720
It's so good. It's hella yummy.

571
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,640
Don't people usually say,
"Crazy yummy," Tarn?

572
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,720
In the north, people might say
it's "plenty yummy."

573
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,240
"Plenty yummy."

574
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,160
How plenty?

575
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,400
"Crazy yummy" is better. It sounds perky.

576
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,040
I like it.

577
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,680
"Mighty yummy" is also said
by people in the south.

578
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,200
People in the south don't say "yummy."

579
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,240
They say, "Finger-licking good."

580
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,040
-"Finger-licking good."
-"Finger-licking good."

581
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,800
Why has Rid not come out to eat?

582
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,240
Is he not hungry?

583
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,240
Choi?

584
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,640
He is not eating.

585
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,920
He said that if I kept on at him,
he would smack me on the head.

586
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,360
I said I am not eating.

587
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,640
Why are you pressing me, Choi?

588
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,600
I shall toss this at your head.

589
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:01,880
Father.

590
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,160
Rid.

591
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,760
Will you not eat
chicken kaprao with fried egg?

592
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,560
Your mother prepared it
especially for you.

593
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,240
I…

594
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,720
am not hungry.

595
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,520
You are not hungry.

596
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,800
That is quite unusual.

597
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,800
You have not eaten anything.

598
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,680
It is mealtime, but you refuse to eat.
There must be a reason.

599
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,400
What is it, Rid?

600
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,840
Your mother prepared it
especially for you,

601
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,440
but you refuse to eat.

602
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,280
There must be an important reason

603
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,960
for you to disregard
your mother's good intentions.

604
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,640
Your two sisters

605
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,640
enjoyed it greatly.

606
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,560
Even Pudtarn

607
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,520
enjoyed it a good deal.

608
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,840
She ate every last bit.

609
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,400
He has left.

610
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,520
Keaw and Prang.

611
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,200
Again?

612
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,320
According to Pudtarn,
this shall make our skin pretty.

613
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,800
And clear

614
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,280
like a baby's face.

615
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,920
You two are still babies.
How much younger would you like to be?

616
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,520
Where did she go?

617
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,320
The dock?

618
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,920
Choi, come back now!

619
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,360
You said you would not come.
So why did you come?

620
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,440
Why did you go back on your word?

621
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,760
How could I trust you
when you are this way?

622
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,080
What is the matter?

623
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,560
What?

624
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,080
Whom are you speaking to, my lord?

625
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,680
She is not here.

626
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,400
How could she not have come yet?

627
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,880
Will you stay here, Eung?

628
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,440
I am not a fool.

629
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,440
Here, have some water first.

630
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,560
You must be tired.

631
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,600
Come with me now.

632
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,840
Hey, what?

633
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,640
-I'm not going.
-Come.

634
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,240
What the heck?

635
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,760
This happens too, does it?

636
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,480
What happens?

637
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,200
This shot.

638
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,480
What shot?

639
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,120
What is it?

640
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,000
A scene like this one.

641
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,240
How so?

642
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,600
What the hell?

643
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,280
Why did you let go? It hurts.

644
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,440
Well, I am a man.

645
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,600
I must not touch a woman.

646
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:12,880
I…

647
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,960
apologize.

648
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,680
Hey, what's wrong with you?

649
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,760
You rode the horse like you were racing.
Where were you hurrying to?

650
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,320
I was in a bad mood.

651
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,640
You were in a bad mood.
So you took it out on an animal?

652
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,400
Didn't you see it could hardly run?
It was almost frothing at the mouth.

653
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,280
The horse has done nothing wrong.

654
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,480
Well, it is because I was

655
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,840
-in a bad mood.
-In a bad mood.

656
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,240
About what?

657
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,080
About you not coming
for a meal at my house.

658
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,440
That's it?

659
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,880
My mood worsened greatly
when I saw you at my house.

660
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,840
What?

661
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,800
You were in a bad mood
because I didn't come.

662
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,480
When I came,
shouldn't your mood have improved?

663
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,360
I'm confused.

664
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,720
I do not understand you.

665
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,720
On one side of the coin,
you said you would not come.

666
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,240
The coin flipped, then you came.

667
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Coin?

668
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,960
Coin, yes. Like a tossed coin.

669
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,320
Your mind changes like a tossed coin.

670
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,840
Coin? Are you talking about money?

671
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,720
Are you accusing me
of being a money-grubber?

672
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,800
I didn't go to ask for money.
I just went for a meal.

673
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,640
Money?

674
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,320
Who is speaking of money?

675
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,720
You just said, "Like a tossed coin."

676
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,280
You said it. I remember.

677
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,640
I was not speaking of money.

678
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,840
But you said that.

679
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,560
I did, but it does not refer to money.

680
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,240
Then what does it refer to?

681
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,680
A coin.

682
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,920
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

683
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,520
Where are you going?

684
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,400
I am right here. I am going nowhere.

685
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,160
Sit here.

686
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,760
Say what is on your mind.

687
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,200
I enjoy listening to you.

688
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,760
Sure.

689
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,440
Here's the thing.

690
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,560
I would like to learn sword fighting.

691
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,280
Do you know someone who can teach me?

692
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,600
Sword fighting?

693
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,920
Why would you learn that?

694
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,400
You are a woman.

695
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,360
For self-defense.

696
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,080
In case thugs harass me.

697
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,720
Like Eung's husband, Kam.

698
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,840
I'm sure he will be back.
I want to learn so I can fight him.

699
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:03,040
Only men learn sword fighting.

700
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,680
Women in Phra Nakorn
don't learn sword fighting.

701
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,360
Such a patronizing bigot.

702
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,560
Indeed, that is right.

703
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:18,720
I patronize women, believing they are weak
and deserving of being patronized.

704
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,880
Totally and utterly patronizing.

705
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,000
So I can't learn it then?

706
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,040
That might not be the case.

707
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:39,880
I cannot think of anyone
who would teach you.

708
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,280
Try and think.

709
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,440
Focus, all right? Focus.

710
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,560
I know now.

711
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,080
He wouldn't say
he'll teach me himself, would he?

712
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,120
For sure, he'll offer to teach me himself.

713
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,600
I shall teach you myself.

714
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,960
I knew it. I never get it wrong.

715
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,360
You are giggling.
What do you find amusing?

716
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,560
What you just said,

717
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,840
what did you mean?

718
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,520
Should I tell you?

719
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,000
That's why I need to learn sword fighting.

720
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,840
What is the reason for you
to learn sword fighting?

721
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,560
In case thugs go…

722
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,560
like this at me.

723
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,440
Like what?

724
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,960
You are speaking nonsense again.

725
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,480
I have no desire to speak to you anymore.

726
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,480
What?

727
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,800
You are not even wearing it.

728
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,400
He's really leaving this time.

729
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,720
Don't forget to come
to teach me sword fighting!

730
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,160
I'm not even wearing it?
What am I not wearing?

731
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,920
The necklace.

732
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,440
My gosh, he gets upset so easily.

733
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,880
You are giggling.

734
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,720
What do you find amusing?

735
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,520
Should I tell you?

736
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,920
Lord Rid, let me tie it for you.

737
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,760
No.

738
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,240
Leave it. I shall go like this.

739
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,400
But…

740
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,360
Why not come tomorrow instead?

741
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,200
Why tomorrow?
You are going to the palace today.

742
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,440
That is the case.
Why did you come at this hour?

743
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,840
At what hour?

744
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,200
This hour.

745
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,360
Rid.

746
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,880
Choi, move.

747
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,400
My lord, your mother called you.

748
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:46,400
My lady, he heard you.

749
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,360
-Choi.
-Rid,

750
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,360
present this dessert to the king for me.

751
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,160
Let the royal kitchen inspect it first.

752
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,360
My goodness, Rid!

753
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:06,120
Rid, why are your eyes dark like a panda?

754
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:15,960
Rid.

755
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,680
Yes, my lord.

756
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,040
Lord Rid has an audience
with the king today.

757
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,600
I see.

758
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,920
Is that so?

759
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,960
It is not in the schedule.

760
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,040
I did not know.

761
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,480
It is a private audience

762
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,760
at the Banyong Rattanat Throne Hall.

763
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:49,000
Choi, how did you let Rid
tie the cloth so untidily?

764
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,560
I might strike you.

765
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,480
Rid, what happened?

766
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,440
Why do you have bags under your eyes?

767
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,320
If you continue to meddle with me,
I shall replace you.

768
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,200
Rid.

769
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,240
Where are you headed so early?

770
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,480
Choi, where are you two headed?

771
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:49,080
Choi, what is the matter?
Why are you not answering?

772
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,280
Why did you ask Choi, Keaw?

773
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,920
Ask Rid.

774
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,160
Do you think
you're handsome striking that pose?

775
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,680
Choi, what is the matter?

776
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,920
It must be related to Pudtarn, for sure.

777
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,640
I was wondering since he did not
come out to eat yesterday.

778
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:22,400
You may not know why, but I do.

779
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,160
Choi,

780
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,040
is it true that
Rid took Pudtarn home yesterday?

781
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,520
Do not hesitate. Just tell me it is true.

782
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,120
I do not know.

783
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,360
You must know.

784
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,520
You did not take Pudtarn home. So who did?

785
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,880
Was it Muang, Chom,

786
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,520
or Kaew?

787
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,200
None of them did.

788
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,160
Lady Prang, please ask your brother.

789
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,920
No, I am asking you.

790
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,120
Prang, do not raise your voice at Choi.

791
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,560
I didn't.

792
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,760
This is called interrogation.

793
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,720
You could speak softly, could you not?

794
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,640
I could not.

795
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,360
Choi.

796
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,399
Prang.

797
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,920
Rid.

798
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,160
Where are you headed so early?

799
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,600
My goodness!

800
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,200
Prik.

801
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:35,920
I was startled.

802
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:41,240
Even if you are startled,
do not shout like that.

803
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:42,720
I am old.

804
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,520
What if I fainted?

805
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,040
What would you do?

806
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,680
You never faint, my lady.
You shall be fine.

807
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,840
Prik, you are talking back
to Lady Champa again.

808
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,120
Do not meddle, Chuang.

809
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,640
Chuang is right.

810
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,359
-Stop talking back to me now.
-Yes, my lady.

811
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,000
Rid, where are you hurrying to?

812
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,600
I shall be going, Grandmother.

813
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,160
Choi, if you do not hurry,
I shall kick you into the water.

814
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:17,840
Here, Prik.

815
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,880
What happened?

816
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:27,840
He has left.

817
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,399
I am too late.

818
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:32,720
Why would you badger Rid, Prang?

819
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:36,279
Prang, Keaw, what happened?

820
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,560
Paddle quickly.
Why are you dawdling, Choi?

821
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,880
Chom, would you like a beating?

822
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,040
Hurry now.

823
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,520
But you really do have
bags under your eyes.

824
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,960
What happened?

825
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,360
Oh dear, I understand now.

826
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,880
I shall paddle now.

827
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,080
This deranged woman is a commoner like us.

828
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,440
You must throw her out.

829
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,520
Throw me out?

830
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,440
You have dark rings around your eyes.

831
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,280
Did you not sleep last night?

832
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,160
When someone doesn't sleep
the whole night,

833
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,640
it can mean only one thing.

834
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:48,600
Really, Prik?

835
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,400
Whom does Rid have an eye for?

836
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,480
Baron Chunphubet,
how often does he come here?

837
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,960
Not as often as you do, my lord.

838
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,400
Please try this.

839
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,760
It's good.

840
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,680
It's no ordinary rice with omelet.

841
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,520
Open up.

842
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,320
Put it on me.

843
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,640
The Lantern Festival is in a few days.

844
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,160
Would you like to go?

845
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,560
No, thank you.

846
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:59,080
