1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,080
Pudtarn,

2
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,520
you are not from this era.

3
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,440
We both came from
the world 300 years in the future.

4
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,320
Keep a close eye on Prince Dum.

5
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,280
Prince Dum is plotting a treasonous coup
to seize the throne.

6
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,520
Spread the word that I will
disguise myself

7
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,040
and take some leisure time
outside the city.

8
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,480
We're here to ask for some water.

9
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,600
If you have some food to spare,
we would appreciate it.

10
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,360
Thongkam.

11
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,240
It is as I expected.

12
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,440
I still hold out hope
that it is not Uncle Dum.

13
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,400
Do you know of history?

14
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,960
I gave my teachers hell.

15
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,080
You shouldn't have done that.

16
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,400
What a shame.

17
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,320
I'll stop talking. I have a sore throat.

18
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,360
Your throat was sore the other day.
Have you not recovered?

19
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,120
I shall ask Gui to tend to your throat.

20
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,600
It shall heal within a day.

21
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,520
No, thank you. I'm better now.

22
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,880
How wonderful.

23
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,440
You take ill and heal so quickly.

24
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,680
Yes, my lord.

25
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,560
I will get going.

26
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,040
Who is stopping you?

27
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,600
No one.

28
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,280
I'm going.

29
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,240
Be careful.

30
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,080
You forgot your sword.

31
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,839
Hey.

32
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,240
What is it?

33
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,920
Nothing, miss.

34
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,880
Why did you tease his lordship, miss?
It's not appropriate.

35
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,680
Well, I'm a woman.

36
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,880
A woman, you know?

37
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,120
This is what women do sometimes.

38
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,520
You are all excused.

39
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,520
I have no need for you.

40
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,120
Why is George taking so long?

41
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,320
George is here, Your Majesty.

42
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,960
Did you get them, George?

43
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,880
They got away, Your Majesty.

44
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,800
I believe

45
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,360
they got off the boat and swam.

46
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,400
I found an abandoned boat, Your Majesty.

47
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,720
How dare you show your face here, George!

48
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,160
If you couldn't do what I asked,
why did you return? Well?

49
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,520
-Your Majesty--
-Stop!

50
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,000
This is not your business.

51
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,880
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

52
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,560
I shall not forgive you, George.

53
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,520
I never imagined you were so idiotic.

54
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,960
You're too foolish to deserve forgiveness.

55
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
Get out now.

56
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,160
Get out!

57
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,800
Get out of my sight.

58
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,640
I trusted you,

59
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,040
but you have ensured
we risked our lives tonight

60
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,760
for nothing.

61
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,480
He will ridicule me,

62
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,880
saying I'm just playing at being king.

63
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,840
He will think even less of me,

64
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,280
that I'm merely a child

65
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,760
who cannot rule, George!

66
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,800
Look me in the eye.

67
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Now!

68
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,520
If you can't see this mission through,

69
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,960
don't let me see your face again.

70
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
Go!

71
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,280
I'm coming with you.

72
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,480
Rid.

73
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,360
Come back here.

74
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,240
Go back, Rid.

75
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,880
I'm coming with you.

76
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,080
If you go,

77
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,080
then you shall also leave for good.

78
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,840
Go.

79
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,400
Don't ask for trouble.

80
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,840
George.

81
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,280
When you go to Prince Dum's residence,

82
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,760
be careful.

83
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,320
It's them.

84
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,320
Can you smell medicine?

85
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,240
Two of them were injured.

86
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,880
This is frustrating.

87
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,560
They outwitted us.

88
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Or could it be that…

89
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,520
they lured us there?

90
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,840
Your Highness,

91
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,240
please stop this.

92
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,840
What are you saying, Kaew?

93
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't want to hear it.

94
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,760
Please listen to me, Your Highness.

95
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,960
This is very risky.

96
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,680
Do you think
His Majesty doesn't have any support?

97
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,400
He has a great deal more than you.

98
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,040
If you get caught,

99
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,600
you will surely be executed.

100
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,640
Kaew.

101
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,840
If you're content with our daughter

102
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,920
being a mere consort

103
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,480
of the crown prince,

104
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,720
then do as you please.

105
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,880
But I don't want just that.

106
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,000
King Phet

107
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
is weak

108
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,640
and unreliable.

109
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,240
All he does is play around.

110
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,640
He doesn't deserve to be on the throne.

111
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,960
Please don't.

112
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,120
It's Bhorn, our son-in-law,
who deserves the throne.

113
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,360
The truth is,

114
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,000
the Tiger King had a great vision.

115
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,520
He knew which of his sons

116
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,160
was most suited to rule.

117
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,840
Even though Bhorn is second in line,

118
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,480
the Tiger King said
he would give Bhorn the throne.

119
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,840
But our son-in-law

120
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,200
was afraid of what people would say,

121
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,880
so he gave it to that weakling.

122
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,160
That's why our daughter

123
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,760
hasn't been crowned queen.

124
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,600
My daughter

125
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,280
deserves much more.

126
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,840
But what led you

127
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,480
to employ Khmer soldiers to fight for you?

128
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,880
Isn't this considered
letting the enemy troops into our land?

129
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,720
Keep your voice down, Kaew.

130
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,360
-I'm scared.
-Stop it.

131
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't act without reason,

132
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,520
so stop your nonsense.

133
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,320
So what's your reason

134
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,600
for getting involved with foreigners?

135
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,280
In the Khmer kingdom,

136
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,680
Prince Keawfah, who is my ally,

137
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,760
will very soon seize power there.

138
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,480
This is because neither
Prince Thong nor Prince Sadej

139
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,960
deserves to sit on the throne.

140
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,160
Goodness.

141
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,320
All I hear is treason, treason, treason.

142
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,600
Kaew.

143
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,560
A weak person

144
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,000
is not fit to be a leader.

145
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,200
Don't you know that?

146
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,880
I only see bloodshed and death,
Your Highness.

147
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,760
If we die, then we die.

148
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,160
Ayutthaya needs a new king
as soon as possible.

149
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,880
Otherwise,

150
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,160
if Prince Keawfah successfully seizes
the throne,

151
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,720
Prince Sadej and Prince Thong

152
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,680
may come and ask King Phet for assistance,

153
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,520
as they are friends.

154
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,120
The king will surely grant them refuge.

155
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,560
Can you now guess what will happen?

156
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,080
If he finds out, you're dead.

157
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,240
War will surely break out.

158
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,320
I shall go to Wat Dusidaram tomorrow

159
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,640
and will stay there for a week
for a dharma retreat.

160
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,360
Please reconsider this while I'm away.

161
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,040
Before you do anything,

162
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,040
please think about the past.

163
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,360
You are family.

164
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,320
If I don't do this

165
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,040
when King Phet has just ascended
the throne,

166
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
then when would you have me do it?

167
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,440
Let's report this to His Majesty.

168
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,280
Who goes there?

169
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,960
Deal with them.

170
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,200
Do not let any of them escape.

171
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,520
What should I do, Your Highness?

172
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,280
You should go to Wat Dusidaram now.

173
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,160
It's almost dawn.

174
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,280
You're the dearest granddaughter
of the Queen Mother,

175
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,160
Krom Phra Thephamat.

176
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,880
Her Highness will protect you.

177
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,320
What is your plan, Your Highness?

178
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,480
I will have my people kill those who…

179
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,280
I must kill them all.

180
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,240
Don't speak of this to anyone.

181
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,760
Otherwise, word might reach the king.

182
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,280
Please don't. Please don't kill them.

183
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,600
Do you want me to die?

184
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,080
If he finds out about this,

185
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,880
do you think he will spare me?

186
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,360
Do you understand?

187
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,319
Is anyone here?

188
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,160
Follow the Khmers.

189
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,480
Don't leave them to be witnesses.

190
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
I think something bad has happened.

191
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,800
I have a feeling

192
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,640
that something terrible has happened.

193
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,600
I'm going to have a look.

194
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,640
In, prepare a boat.

195
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

196
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,040
Go faster.

197
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,320
I said go faster.

198
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,120
Is this all you can do?

199
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,520
Give it to me. I'll do it myself.

200
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,120
I said give it to me. Come on.

201
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,200
-George.
-George.

202
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,600
George.

203
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,920
George.

204
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,480
George!

205
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,800
-George!
-George!

206
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,640
George!

207
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,880
George.

208
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,040
George.

209
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Summon the doctor.

210
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,480
Someone get the doctor. In, go!

211
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

212
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,160
George.

213
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,960
Arrest…

214
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,040
Arrest

215
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,440
Prince Dum,

216
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,160
Your Majesty.

217
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,600
The Khmer soldiers

218
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,640
of Prince Keaw

219
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,960
Fahsachok

220
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,160
are preparing to rebel.

221
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,680
George.

222
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,880
In, is the doctor here?

223
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
George.

224
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,000
George.

225
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,680
Please take care of my mother.

226
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,520
In!

227
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,760
Is the doctor here?

228
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,600
George!

229
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,720
George!

230
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,360
George!

231
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,880
He's not breathing, Your Majesty.

232
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,280
George.

233
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,120
George.

234
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,400
George!

235
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,200
I shall not forgive you,

236
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,200
George.

237
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,280
I never imagined you were so idiotic.

238
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,680
You're too foolish to deserve forgiveness.

239
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,840
If you can't see this mission through,

240
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,160
don't let me see your face again.

241
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,280
Go!

242
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,960
Dum.

243
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,080
From now on,

244
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,200
you and I

245
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,520
are no longer family.

246
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,960
You don't know your place.

247
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,240
Not only did you attempt to kill me,

248
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
but you also killed my people.

249
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,120
You must die

250
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,400
to pay for what you have done.

251
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,120
I won't let George's death be in vain.

252
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,480
Don't spread the news
about George's death just yet.

253
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,160
Prepare his funeral
as secretly as possible.

254
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,720
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

255
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,000
My lord.

256
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,640
Choi.

257
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,600
George…

258
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,480
George is dead.

259
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,720
He got slashed.

260
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,440
Who did it?

261
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,040
I don't know, Mother.

262
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,280
What happened, Rid?

263
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,760
Prince Dum ordered…

264
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,560
My poor Mali.

265
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,120
She has lost both of her sons.

266
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,640
I don't know how to console her.

267
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,080
I shall go see Mali today.

268
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,440
Are you going anywhere today?

269
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,400
His Majesty won't see anyone.

270
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,000
He wants to be alone.

271
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,440
Do you want to visit Mali with me?

272
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,600
No, Mother.

273
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,360
I can go by myself.

274
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,560
Well then, I will get going.

275
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,400
Khun Pi.

276
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,760
Do you know where he's going?

277
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,560
No.

278
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,480
You're truly oblivious.

279
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,160
Where are you going, my lord?

280
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,640
Are you going home?

281
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,200
Yes.

282
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,120
Let's go back.

283
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,080
I don't know how I got here.

284
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,120
Yes, my lord.

285
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,160
Perm, there's a lot of it over here.

286
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,080
Perm, hand me your machete.

287
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,160
Will this work well as firewood?

288
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,360
Not really, miss.

289
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,240
Why not?

290
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,800
Softwood burns away in no time.

291
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,800
Really?

292
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,480
I won't take it then.
Let's find some hardwood.

293
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,760
-Which way should we go?
-Well…

294
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,520
Hey, you're just in time.

295
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,320
I was just thinking of you.

296
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,800
What is the matter?

297
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,560
Why don't you come down? My neck hurts.

298
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,360
Please sit over there.

299
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,240
I'm going to make some kindling.

300
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,720
So

301
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,160
what is the matter?

302
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,160
What do you mean?

303
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,920
Well,

304
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,760
you said

305
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,200
you were thinking of me.

306
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,120
Just a second.

307
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,480
Perm,

308
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,440
this should be enough.

309
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,200
You can go back first, Perm.

310
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,480
I'll go back with His Lordship.

311
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,960
Yes, miss.

312
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,360
Aren't you going to eat, miss?

313
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,440
Okay.

314
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,880
Well then, tell Eung to fry me some fish.
I'll eat it when I get back.

315
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,280
I should be hungry soon.

316
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,720
Yes, miss.

317
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,640
My lord.

318
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,920
Hey.

319
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Why did you clap your hands?

320
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,000
To wake you up.

321
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,800
So why didn't you call me?

322
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,160
Why did you clap your hands?

323
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,080
I wasn't sleeping.

324
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,360
Why did you have to wake me up?

325
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,960
My lord,

326
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,240
did the person you asked to get the book

327
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,120
from your brother catch up with him?

328
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,760
Right, Choi.

329
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,440
Yes, my lord.

330
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,960
Order an express rider
to go after Baron Ruang's convoy.

331
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,160
If he catches up to him,

332
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,480
tell him to ask my brother
for the manuscript.

333
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,520
Also, tell the messenger

334
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,040
not to let Mother see him.

335
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,320
Today, my lord?

336
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,960
If you can't send one today,
then do it tomorrow.

337
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,960
I will send one tomorrow then.

338
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,600
Of course.

339
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,880
Are you satisfied now?

340
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,440
Did you just make the order?

341
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,800
Well, I did it.

342
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,000
Just now?

343
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,280
Yes, you heard it correctly.

344
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,320
-Gosh.
-Hey.

345
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,360
Why only now?

346
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,040
How will he catch up?

347
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,560
Why are you doing this?

348
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,600
You're trying to trap me here, aren't you?

349
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,239
-I--
-Tell me what your intention is.

350
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,960
I can't answer you.

351
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
What intention?

352
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,880
Answer me. Don't ask a question.

353
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,639
-Answer what?
-You're insincere.

354
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,360
You never intended to get the book for me.

355
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,679
Do you want me to be here until I die?

356
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,239
That wasn't my intention.

357
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,239
I really told him to get the book.

358
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,400
Why did you only just do it?

359
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,960
But I still did it.

360
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,679
But why only just now? Tell me.

361
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,800
I did it.

362
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,440
How will he catch up?

363
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,760
He will.

364
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,120
-How?
-He will.

365
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,960
-How?
-Well, he's an express rider.

366
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,920
So what?

367
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,719
He's on a horse, so it's quick.

368
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,679
My brother goes by boat.

369
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,280
Are horses where you come from

370
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,040
slower than boats?

371
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,360
-Well? Can your horses not catch a boat?
-Be quiet!

372
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,560
Choi.

373
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,560
Yes, my lord.

374
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,720
Go home. Take the horse with you.

375
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,480
How will you get back, my lord?

376
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,600
I will walk back.

377
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,280
It's far, my lord.

378
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,960
I can walk.

379
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,480
Let's ride the horse. I want to ride it.

380
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,520
Do you know how to ride?

381
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,520
No.

382
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,520
What?

383
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,000
So how are you going to ride it?

384
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,200
Believe it or not,
I've never ridden a horse in my life.

385
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,480
People ride them in Hua Hin,
but those are tiny ones.

386
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,680
If you're tall,
your feet touch the ground.

387
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,440
What?

388
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,120
What's with your arms?

389
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,440
Are you afraid of being handsy?

390
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,680
What do you mean by that?

391
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,240
I'd better not say.

392
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,840
Why?

393
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,880
Does your throat hurt?

394
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,040
I told you to let Gui treat your throat,
but you wouldn't listen.

395
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,040
Can you make the horse run?

396
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,920
Go.

397
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,000
Let me lean on your chest.

398
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,400
I'm tired.

399
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,280
Why are you so quiet?

400
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,440
My lord,

401
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,920
why do you look so sad?

402
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
What's wrong?

403
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,640
No.

404
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,680
Mali.

405
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,280
You must be completely heartbroken.

406
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,520
When João died,

407
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
I was so sad.

408
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,280
But it doesn't compare to this.

409
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,680
We were close for so long.

410
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,640
I feel as if…

411
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,200
I have lost my whole heart.

412
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
It…

413
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,920
It may be for the best

414
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,040
if I follow my sons there.

415
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,200
No, Mali.

416
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,480
Don't do that.

417
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,360
I know you are very upset.

418
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,320
I also feel the same.

419
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,760
I also loved George

420
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,280
like my own son.

421
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,720
But birth, old age, sickness, and death

422
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,120
are things we all experience.

423
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,880
Your religion

424
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,480
says that the people
you love and are close to

425
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,240
will never leave you.

426
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,560
You will meet them again in the future.

427
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,080
Am I right?

428
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,640
Karaked.

429
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,360
I will get to meet João

430
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,320
and George again,

431
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,200
won't I?

432
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,000
Of course.

433
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,680
And they must be together now.

434
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,960
My dear sons.

435
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,480
Let's not worry them.

436
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,040
Believe me.

437
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,120
Someone I regarded as a brother

438
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,840
and who served
as a royal page to His Majesty

439
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,120
passed away today.

440
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,440
What happened to him?

441
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,760
He was killed.

442
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,680
Was it the people
who attacked you yesterday?

443
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,040
Yes.

444
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,360
I'm sorry.

445
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,480
Death is inevitable for all of us.

446
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,800
His time had come.

447
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,720
By the way,

448
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,560
are you able

449
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,200
to live here?

450
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I have nowhere else to go.

451
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,480
Can you not survive here?

452
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,240
Are you pretending not to know?

453
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,480
What did you see?

454
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,600
Pudtarn.

455
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,640
If I do this,

456
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,560
it means I can't continue
the conversation,

457
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,680
or I don't know what else to say.

458
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,440
You don't know what else to say?

459
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,200
Is it because you don't want to say it,

460
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,280
or you don't have anything to say?

461
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,920
Well?

462
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,160
Both.

463
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,520
I see.

464
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,240
Okay. I understand.

465
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,560
-That's great.
-But…

466
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,440
how will I know

467
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,040
if it's the first or the second reason?

468
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,760
You will have to work it out yourself.

469
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,880
Work it out myself?

470
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,360
How will I do that?

471
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,600
I said you have to work it out yourself,

472
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,080
so how would I know how to do it

473
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,440
if you have to do it yourself?

474
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,360
Okay, try it.

475
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,440
What does this mean?

476
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,760
I shan't talk to you anymore

477
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,000
because you're making fun of me.

478
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,360
I am not your jester.

479
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,720
Where are you going, my lord?

480
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,360
Don't go. Let's talk.

481
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,080
Don't do it.

482
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,880
I won't help you if you get hurt.

483
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,360
Go.

484
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,960
You're just the worst!

485
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,600
You can see me lying here,
but you still won't help me.

486
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,960
How am I going to get up? I hurt all over.

487
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,760
Eung.

488
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,400
Eung.

489
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,960
Eung!

490
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,280
-Miss!
-Miss!

491
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,720
Miss!

492
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,000
What's wrong, miss?

493
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,480
Are you lounging?

494
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,800
Lounging?

495
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,040
Well, I can't think why

496
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,080
you are lying

497
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,800
with your limbs spread out this way.

498
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,600
If you aren't lounging,

499
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,280
does it mean you're sleeping?

500
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:23,960
Come.

501
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,400
Help me up.

502
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,360
I'm sorry, miss.

503
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,720
Let's go.

504
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,960
What do you think

505
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,400
His Majesty will do
with Prince Dum, Khun Pi?

506
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,960
It's unlikely that His Majesty
will spare his life.

507
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,480
But he's his uncle.

508
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,400
My dear Karaked,

509
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,640
you know
the history of Ayutthaya, do you not?

510
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,840
Yes.

511
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,120
I just wanted to be clear

512
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,480
as not all the history I learned

513
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,200
has turned out to be true.

514
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,160
Is that so?

515
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,120
So why do you put

516
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,880
so much faith in your history?

517
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,920
You always talk about it.

518
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,320
That's because
we have nothing else to rely on.

519
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,720
Whenever anything

520
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,960
gets recorded as history,

521
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,880
we recognize it,
but we also analyze its reliability.

522
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,840
How do you do that?

523
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,160
Well, we compare historical records.

524
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,120
So you may still not know
whether it's true or not.

525
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,960
That's right.

526
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,160
We still can't be sure about it.

527
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,240
After 300 years,

528
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:30,640
the truth
inevitably becomes distorted by time…

529
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,520
and the memories
of the people who pass it down.

530
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,920
You understand things so well, Khun Pi.

531
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,840
So His Majesty's uncle will have to die.

532
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,840
What does your history say

533
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,040
about this?

534
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,480
I don't know the history of this period.

535
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,160
I might have studied it,
but it has faded from my memory.

536
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,840
I don't remember it.

537
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,320
No one is here.

538
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,400
Where did they go, Prik?

539
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,480
How should I know, my lady?

540
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:34,960
Is that so?

541
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,080
Yes, my lady.

542
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,280
Well, I have been with you
since this morning.

543
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,640
If you don't know,

544
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,720
then how could I know, my lady?

545
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,080
That's enough.

546
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,480
Stop with your wordplay.

547
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,280
Just say you don't know.

548
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,200
Yes, my lady.

549
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,440
-Prik.
-Yes?

550
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,280
Her Ladyship told you
to say, "I don't know,"

551
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,520
not, "Yes, my lady."

552
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,280
I don't know.

553
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,800
My lady.

554
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,280
I'm so sick of you two.

555
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,520
I wonder how I have put up with you both

556
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,400
all this time.

557
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,040
Especially you, Prik.

558
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,720
Dech and Karaked are there.

559
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,680
Didn't you see them?

560
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,440
-No, my lady.
-No, my lady.

561
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,640
Well, you've just seen them

562
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,320
and so have I.

563
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,240
Hey, you're getting bolder and bolder.

564
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,560
You always have an answer.

565
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,960
You're so annoying.

566
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,080
Dech,

567
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,120
Karaked.

568
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,720
What are you talking about?

569
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,600
You both look rather serious.

570
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,400
Yes, Mother.

571
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,720
What is it about?

572
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,440
It's about…

573
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,920
You two, leave us.

574
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,520
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

575
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,480
Take the other servants with you.

576
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,480
Yes, my lady.

577
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,520
George…

578
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,640
has been killed.

579
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,760
What happened, Dech?

580
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,000
Prince Dum, His Majesty's uncle,

581
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,920
is plotting something.

582
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,160
A rebellion?

583
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,480
Oh, dear.

584
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,120
It seems that betrayal
and murder between family members

585
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,600
will never cease to blight
the throne of Ayutthaya, does it not?

586
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,640
You are right.

587
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,360
It seems it won't end.

588
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:51,440
Throughout the 400-year history
of the Ayutthaya Kingdom,

589
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,960
power struggles led to killing

590
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,920
time and time again,

591
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,840
whether they are between siblings,

592
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,560
uncles and nephews,

593
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,800
or officials killing kings.

594
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,560
It happened in various ways.

595
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,360
Wat Khok Phraya

596
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,480
was the execution site,
so it was drenched in blood.

597
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,040
It seems Prince Dum

598
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,080
will have his life cut short.

599
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,400
I just feel sorry for Princess Kaew.

600
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,760
She could not stop her husband.

601
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:03,960
You lot,

602
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,520
did you kill all the Khmer soldiers?

603
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:09,960
Yes, Your Highness.

604
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,760
We killed all of them.

605
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,280
What about the intruders from last night?

606
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,160
The Khmer soldiers killed them,
Your Highness.

607
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,040
Did you witness it?

608
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,040
Are you sure they're dead?

609
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,760
Did you see their bodies?

610
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,760
Yes, Your Highness.

611
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,240
Good.

612
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,200
You should leave now, Rid.

613
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,320
His Majesty needs his close aides with him

614
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,440
so he will feel secure.

615
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,560
Yes, Grandmother.

616
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:13,920
Rid.

617
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,280
Do your best to protect His Majesty.

618
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:20,920
Yes, Father.

619
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,840
Prince Dum

620
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,680
wishes for nothing more

621
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,360
than for his daughter

622
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,280
to be a king's consort

623
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,480
rather than a mere crown prince's wife.

624
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,720
You should go now, son.

625
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,120
His Majesty must be waiting.

626
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,120
Dum must be very anxious today.

627
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,440
I sent someone to scout out his residence.

628
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,920
It seems he sent people
to check the city's canals.

629
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,440
He also went along.

630
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,520
He must believe
that George drowned, Your Majesty.

631
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,960
I must have revenge.

632
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,840
It's a pity he has connections
with my brother

633
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,560
and he also has many officials
on his side.

634
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,000
I am not able to do anything.

635
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,000
The witnesses are also all dead.

636
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,240
With only George's body,

637
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,720
it will be difficult
to prove what he has done.

638
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,120
He recognized the threat

639
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,040
and killed the Khmers
before we could find them.

640
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,440
If I had known

641
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,760
that taking the throne

642
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,040
would result in my friend, George, dying,

643
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,600
I wouldn't have accepted it.

644
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,800
I don't think

645
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,080
the crown prince

646
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,400
was aware of this, Your Majesty.

647
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,080
I hope you are correct.

648
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,080
This throne is mine
because he gave it to me.

649
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,960
I find it hard to believe

650
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,360
that he's conspiring with Dum.

651
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,760
This throne is rightfully yours,
Your Majesty.

652
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,080
That's enough, Ming.

653
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,360
Can't you see I'm troubled by this?

654
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:04,000
It's not easy to rule over people.

655
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,520
I knew it would be tough

656
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,560
and I would have to be vigilant.

657
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,120
I have to balance
the power of the officials

658
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,160
to prevent one

659
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,760
from having power over another.

660
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,840
I believe

661
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,720
Prince Dum

662
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,360
will seek an audience with you

663
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,960
to find out how much you know
about it, Your Majesty.

664
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,160
If that is the case,

665
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,880
then I don't know if he's stupid or smart.

666
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,880
But he will find out for himself today.

667
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,200
You may not enter, Your Highness.

668
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,720
Stand back.

669
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,560
Why may I not enter?

670
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,720
I'm His Majesty's relative

671
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,040
and a senior official.

672
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,520
I will go and see him.

673
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,600
Who are you? How dare you stop me.

674
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,520
Dum.

675
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,120
Who is the daring one here?

676
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,680
Answer me.

677
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,160
Who dares to try
and enter a restricted area?

678
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,360
Are you not aware

679
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,960
that I have forbidden access to this area?

680
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,320
It's only for those who are loyal to me.

681
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,520
I…

682
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,520
merely request
an audience with you, Your Majesty.

683
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,200
I have something to tell you.

684
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,200
I don't want to hear it.

685
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,600
Guards.

686
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,520
Take Dum to the prison.

687
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:20,440
He dared to enter a prohibited area
of a royal residence

688
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,640
without my permission.

689
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:26,880
Your Majesty.

690
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,400
Let go of me!

691
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,800
You can't accuse me this way,
Your Majesty.

692
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,640
I'm not doing anything wrong.

693
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,200
How many times

694
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,960
have you challenged my orders?

695
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,880
Why would you come here

696
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,280
if not to challenge me?

697
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,360
I may be younger than you

698
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,120
and lack allies,

699
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,400
but did you really think
you'd get away with it?

700
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,600
You don't know me well enough.

701
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,480
Take him away.

702
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,840
If the crown prince hears of this,

703
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,240
what will he say?

704
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,200
Don't think
I don't know what you're plotting.

705
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,760
I also want to know

706
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,760
what my brother thinks.

707
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,200
Rid, In, Ming, Thongkam,

708
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,840
accompany me to the crown prince's
residence immediately.

709
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:48,920
Let go!

710
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:17,960
What do you say?

711
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,960
What do you say, Bhorn, my brother?

712
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,160
Dum attempted to kill me.

713
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,560
What would you have me do with him?

714
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,640
I think it would be reasonable
to execute him.

715
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,000
For what Uncle Dum has done,

716
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:52,360
ten lifetimes would not be long enough
to atone for it.

717
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,720
But…

718
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,400
But what?

719
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,720
Uncle Dum is our relative.

720
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:15,600
If we announce
that Uncle Dum tried to overthrow you,

721
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,360
then word would spread

722
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,480
that even your own kin

723
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:25,240
disagrees with your right to the throne.

724
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:35,920
I think it's better to punish him

725
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,440
for trespassing in a prohibited area

726
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,360
and being defiant,

727
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,920
Your Majesty.

728
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,880
I will consider

729
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,760
the advantages and disadvantages

730
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,080
of doing what you recommend.

731
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:05,040
I don't want to impose the punishment
upon seven generations of his line,

732
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,040
as his daughter

733
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,240
is your wife.

734
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,960
And Princess Kaew, his wife,

735
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,880
is also a beloved niece
of our grandmother.

736
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,360
If I bring too much suffering upon them,

737
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,120
it could split
our family apart indefinitely.

738
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,520
You know…

739
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,960
that I didn't want this throne.

740
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,040
If you want it,

741
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,680
I can always give it to you.

742
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,120
You only have to ask.

743
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,080
This way, you will also not have
to lose your men

744
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,240
and the people will not have to suffer.

745
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:07,040
No matter what my position is,

746
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,880
I'm your elder brother

747
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,720
and you're my younger brother.

748
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,560
This will never change.

749
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,120
I…

750
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,320
would like to swear in front of you…

751
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,320
that I

752
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,920
will not let you down…

753
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,760
because I also…

754
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,920
only have one brother.

755
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,640
That is you, Your Majesty.

756
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,640
I'm going to the market.

757
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,880
You are new here. You do not know the way.

758
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,200
If I accompany you,
I can help you if you have any inquiries.

759
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:40,640
Are you Kam? You were married to Eung.

760
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:44,120
My grandmother gave Eung to Pudtarn,
who wants her to take a new husband.

761
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,160
You must nip it in the bud.
Pudtarn is the key.

762
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,040
It's only because
she resembles Mother that I like her.

763
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:51,760
No, I do not like her.

764
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,240
What don't you like, Baron?

765
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,600
I sold some food and brought the money
to buy back my necklace.

766
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,560
It is not here.

767
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,040
How could it be gone?

768
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,640
Klin, tell me that you took it!

769
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,720
I have already sold it.

770
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,560
Pudtarn, I beg you.

771
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,800
I will punish her myself.

772
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,399
You deranged woman! You witch!

773
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,680
