1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,440
I would like to request
a royally-bestowed wife.

2
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,720
Whom do you have in mind?

3
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,560
It is Keaw, Rid's sister, Your Majesty.

4
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,520
But I don't want an arranged marriage.

5
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,520
Even though marrying him means

6
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,120
you will get to be with the man you love?

7
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,360
No one can defy a royal command.

8
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,440
No one has ever tried before.

9
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't know anymore
if you want to marry him or not.

10
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,480
I don't understand the women
in my family at all.

11
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,880
You have the same absurd ideas.

12
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,240
-"Love lights the path."
-"Love lights the path"?

13
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,360
I give in.

14
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,760
Why was it so simple in the end, my lady?

15
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,760
I am just as confused as you are, Prik.

16
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,320
I do not want to go to Song Kwae.

17
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,080
I was so far away,
yet I ended up here and met you.

18
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,760
I doubt you can get rid of me that easily.

19
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,560
Little Ruang.

20
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,880
It is nearly kite season.

21
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,960
The wind is gentle now,
but it shall soon strengthen.

22
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,280
You may come here
to fly your kite every day.

23
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,840
Fai, escort her home.

24
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,120
Her parents are waiting.

25
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,120
Yes, my lord, my lady.

26
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,480
I shall be going.

27
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,160
Guests from Ayutthaya will arrive
within a week, Riem.

28
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,280
You shall meet Little Ruang's twin.

29
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,400
Yes, my lady.

30
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,720
She is rather cheeky.

31
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,320
As the governor's only daughter,
that is to be expected.

32
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,320
She is a cherished child.

33
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,960
You must be glad to see
your father, mother, and brother.

34
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,640
Indeed.

35
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,480
I have not seen them in nearly a year.

36
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,840
They must currently be
preparing boats and supplies.

37
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,920
Thank you, Madam Gui.

38
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,160
Hey, these are not for you.

39
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,840
These are for you to take to Song Kwae.

40
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,080
These are the items I must provide
as rent payments to the marquess.

41
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
I know that.

42
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,720
I've been meaning to prepare them.

43
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,680
Baron has asked me to be the cook
on our journey there.

44
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,240
It's so exciting.

45
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,720
What brings you such excitement?

46
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,600
Cooking on a boat.
I've never done it before.

47
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,840
Cooking on a boat?

48
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,120
I've only cooked on land, never on a boat.

49
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,920
What makes it exciting, cooking on a boat?

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,080
It's exciting that…

51
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,440
it would be swaying.

52
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,760
Eung, Perm, go and pack these.

53
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,760
What?

54
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,640
-Pack?
-Pack them in baskets and crates.

55
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,640
Why?

56
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,800
You know the word "pack"?

57
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,480
Lady Karaked always tells me
to pack things for her

58
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,920
when the marquess goes on
a long official journey.

59
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,240
Will you bring any flesh?

60
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,800
Flesh?

61
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,000
Pork, chicken, beef.

62
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,440
It's called animal flesh.

63
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,040
Sun-dried pork.

64
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,200
Sun-dried chicken.

65
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,640
Sun-dried beef.

66
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,760
I have prepared them all, Madam Gui.

67
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,720
Shall we pack them now?

68
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,640
You say "pack" as well, do you?

69
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,720
When I lived with Madam Gui,
I used to pack stuff all the time.

70
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,040
Okay, let's pack.

71
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,080
You are truly an angel's child.

72
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,080
Do you still not see me as human, Gui?

73
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,720
I've lived here as a human for months.

74
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,440
Hasn't that changed your mind?

75
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,360
If you were an ordinary human,

76
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,160
you would not have made a home like this.

77
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,360
It is so beautiful
that it could be heaven.

78
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,160
I was only able to build this heaven
because of you.

79
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,360
It was you who gave me all of this.

80
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,120
You are my guardian angel.

81
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,760
Pudtarn.

82
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,360
I…

83
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,360
I…

84
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,440
Gui, why are you crying?

85
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,760
I held you because I love you.

86
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,960
You…

87
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,880
Please stop, Miss Klin.

88
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,240
What will you do, Eung?

89
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,240
You're such a busybody.

90
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,880
The nerve.

91
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,520
Do you love each other so much?

92
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,880
That's my mistress's concern.

93
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,200
Who is the real busybody here?

94
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,960
Eung!

95
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
You!

96
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,080
-Eung! Do not do this, miss.
-Eung!

97
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,400
-Perm!
-It sounds like…

98
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,240
Is it Klin?

99
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,280
-Please, miss!
-You insulted me!

100
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,600
Come with me.

101
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,680
-No, miss. Eung, don't!
-Where are you going?

102
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,080
-Do not do this, miss.
-Let go right now, Perm!

103
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,400
Stop this now, Klin!

104
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,240
What on earth are you doing?

105
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,080
Why are you harassing Eung?

106
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,920
Stay out of it.
It's none of your business.

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,160
It's my business
as long as you're my granddaughter.

108
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,560
Are you still my granddaughter
or not, Klin?

109
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,560
You don't want me to be, do you?

110
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,440
That is why you asked me so.

111
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
Eung, what did she do to you?

112
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,280
She has not done anything.

113
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Oh no, Eung!

114
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,320
That is what I did, Grandmother.

115
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,240
-Klin!
-What will you do to me, Pudtarn?

116
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,400
Why did you hurt my friend?

117
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,960
Bah! Your friend?

118
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,000
Eung was a servant in my house for a year.

119
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,280
Your friend?

120
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,640
How pitiful!

121
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,920
Klin, you have gone too far.

122
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,160
Why did you slap Eung?

123
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,120
Just ask her
what audacious thing she said to me.

124
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,360
You are just a servant, Eung.

125
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,320
You dared say that to me.
I shall make you pay for that!

126
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,000
I simply told the truth.

127
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,040
You called me a busybody.
How is that the truth?

128
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,080
It is the truth, Madam Gui.

129
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,800
She called me a busybody first.

130
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,240
I simply said she was the busybody.

131
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,480
She was trying to barge into the house
to start a fight with my mistress.

132
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,200
Did you hear that, Grandmother?

133
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,280
She called me a busybody.

134
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,200
You insulted her first.

135
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
She is a servant. How dare she insult me?

136
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,000
Are you siding with her?

137
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,400
If anyone was wrong, both of you were.

138
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,600
Come home.

139
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,760
I shall handle it myself.

140
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,960
Pudtarn, you deal with Eung.

141
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,200
Yes, Gui.

142
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,400
Grandmother, you are siding with her.

143
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,680
I should have known.

144
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,360
I will no longer be your granddaughter.

145
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,480
Pudtarn.

146
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,320
Yes, Gui.

147
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,000
May fortune favor you on your journey.

148
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,840
May your merits safeguard you
with the Buddha's guidance

149
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,120
and the angels' protection.

150
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,000
May you prosper.

151
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,640
Actually, I will only be away
for a few days.

152
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,200
I won't be gone for long.

153
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,280
When you love someone,

154
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,840
even just a few days apart
is long enough to cause a longing.

155
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,200
May you have a safe journey
to your destination and back.

156
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,960
Song.

157
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
Klin.

158
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,560
What is the matter?

159
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,120
What trouble has brought you to tears?

160
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,640
Let me dry your tears.

161
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,640
I do not want to live with my grandmother.

162
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,280
Take me away, Song.

163
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,760
Take me somewhere far from here.

164
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,120
I do not want to be here anymore.

165
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,160
Do not cry.

166
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,400
Do not cry, Klin.

167
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,240
I shall take you to live in my house.
I shall ensure you live in comfort.

168
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,000
-I--
-I won't be your wife.

169
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,960
Goodness, why not?

170
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
Being my wife would be advantageous.

171
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,880
I shall ensure you never suffer.

172
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,840
No insects or bugs will pester you.

173
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,280
I am not afraid of insects or bugs.

174
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,960
I am afraid of you.

175
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,600
If you force me to become your wife,
I will set fire to your house.

176
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,320
Do you understand me?

177
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,560
I am a person of my word.

178
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,200
Song.

179
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,360
I understand, Klin.

180
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,920
The boat that will transport us
is a large madpratun boat.

181
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,840
We will eat and sleep aboard.

182
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,960
There are six paddlers.

183
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,840
We travel using three boats
along the Chao Phraya River,

184
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,520
passing through Nakhon Sawan
at Pak Nam Pho.

185
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,920
Maintaining a steady pace,

186
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,520
we shall eventually veer off
onto the Nan River,

187
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,240
making our way through Phichit
until we arrive at Phitsanulok,

188
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,000
also known as Song Kwae.

189
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,080
How long will it take?

190
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,120
Only three days, during which
we will eat and sleep in the boats.

191
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,360
Are you tired, Khun Pi?

192
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,160
I'll prepare this meal myself.
Please get some rest.

193
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,960
Make something simple,
so you won't get too tired.

194
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,680
I'll prepare jungle curry,
omelet, sun-dried pork,

195
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,960
and chicken pad kaprao.

196
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,720
That sounds great.
Rid likes chicken pad kaprao.

197
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,079
But there must be a fried egg, Tarn.

198
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,360
The egg white should be fluffy and crispy,
while the yolk should be runny.

199
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,360
Rid only eats it that way.
Otherwise, he won't even touch it.

200
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,880
What kind of chicken is this?

201
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,720
Sun-dried chicken.

202
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,680
Is it like sun-dried fish?

203
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,840
Yes.

204
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,600
My mother

205
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,760
wanted to visit Phitsanulok.

206
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,920
She has wanted to for some time.

207
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,480
She misses my brother.

208
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,680
Does she know her son doesn't want to go?

209
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,480
I did not know how to tell her.

210
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,800
What is troubling you?

211
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,120
Since we left Ayutthaya,
you have seemed down.

212
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,120
And are you not?

213
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,240
I have good reason to be.

214
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,920
You know that.

215
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,800
But you, what is troubling you?

216
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,120
I should be glad to go home, right?

217
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,040
How badly do you want to return home?

218
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,120
Well,

219
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,240
I should want to, right?

220
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,960
I know what you mean.

221
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,240
If destiny

222
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,960
dictates it, then must you go home.

223
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
That's right.

224
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,680
I mean destiny.

225
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,040
Please turn this way, Pudtarn.

226
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,960
And listen to me.

227
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,720
Hear me out.

228
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,600
You see, I don't want you to go anywhere.

229
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,560
I keep telling myself
that I must heed your wishes.

230
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,400
Whatever you desire,
I shall try my best to accept it.

231
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,920
That is because I do not want you
to endure longing for home

232
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,320
and your family who are far away.

233
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,360
And I would be overjoyed

234
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,440
if you chose to settle down here.

235
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,880
But I cannot force you

236
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,840
and cause you more suffering.

237
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,320
What is your response to that?

238
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,800
Destiny will be the answer.

239
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
-Pin and Yaem.
-Yes, my lady?

240
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,440
Pudtarn, who is she?

241
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,080
Just tell me.
I want to check if you think what I think.

242
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,240
Who do you suppose she is, my lady?

243
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,120
Karaked.

244
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,200
But they are not entirely alike.

245
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,080
Pudtarn seems gentle and more reasonable.

246
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,640
If she is truly the old Lady Karaked,

247
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,280
we would have seen her more ruthless side.

248
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,680
When you awoke from your illness,

249
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,480
we both thought your merit was used up.

250
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,840
You started to speak differently.

251
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,120
The same way Pudtarn does.

252
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,360
Listen to me.

253
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,240
If she truly is Karaked,
that means she was my sister.

254
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,400
I should repay her.

255
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,960
The fact that I am right here

256
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,920
means that I've taken things
that belong to her.

257
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,960
If she is not,
it might mean that she has died

258
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,240
and her spirit has gotten lost like mine.

259
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,560
If she is truly Lady Karaked,

260
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,160
the two of us shall find out.

261
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,960
Indeed.

262
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,120
Especially when we arrive in Song Kwae,
there will be a sign.

263
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,960
Lady Karaked's character,

264
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,240
no one is more familiar with it

265
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,280
than the two of us.

266
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,880
Rid, my beloved son,
it's quite clear you're utterly smitten.

267
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,720
Behavior such as this
is unlike that of any woman in Ayutthaya.

268
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,720
Do you agree, Yaem?

269
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,560
As I see it, that is Lady Karaked, Pin.

270
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,680
She behaves as she wishes.

271
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,560
As a strong and fearless person does.

272
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,680
This is the Nan River,
coursing through the heart of the city.

273
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,520
There is another river running
parallel to the Nan River over there.

274
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,880
It is called the Kwae Noi River.

275
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,240
That is why the city is known
as Song Kwae.

276
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,320
Pin, Yaem, have you been well?

277
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,200
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

278
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,280
Choi, have you been well?

279
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,880
Yes, my lord.

280
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,960
I have missed you, Lord Ruang.

281
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Have you been living comfortably, my lord?

282
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,760
Yes, I have.

283
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,960
Auntie, why do they look so alike?

284
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,280
I told you before, Pudtarn.

285
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,960
There are many things
that happen in this world

286
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,520
that lack explanation and require none.

287
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,760
Okay, Auntie.

288
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,240
Riem, come pay your respects
to your elders.

289
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,600
How lovely this young woman is.

290
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,720
Who is she, Chanwad?

291
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,680
She is called Riem.

292
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,360
She is Marquess Phitsanulok's
youngest daughter,

293
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,760
Father, Mother.

294
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,080
You look lovely.

295
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,840
She is quite cheeky.

296
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,200
You two truly look alike,

297
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,960
just as Little Ruang told me.

298
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
I can barely tell you apart.

299
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,640
You are quite outspoken.

300
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,320
That is typical of a youngest
and only daughter.

301
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,640
She speaks boldly like her brothers,

302
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,840
much like Prang.

303
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,680
Is that your relative, Karaked?

304
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,800
She closely resembles you.

305
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,000
She could be Dech's and your daughter.

306
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,720
Is she, Karaked?

307
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,400
Yes, Pudtarn is a distant relative
of mine.

308
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,960
It is unbelievable.

309
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,320
When you were younger, about 20 years ago,

310
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,400
you were practically identical to her.

311
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,680
Are you sure you are only
distantly related?

312
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,520
Uncle Rueang,

313
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,880
when will you take us
to pay our respects to the governor,

314
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,440
Marquess Phitsanulok?

315
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,480
It has been 20 years.

316
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,160
Nothing has changed.

317
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,840
People have, Yaem.

318
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,160
Our little girl,

319
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,160
who used to be timid,

320
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,000
grew up to be known for her cruelty.

321
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,840
Was it due to the way we raised her?

322
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,480
It was because of her own family.

323
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,160
They are all despicable people.

324
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,240
I hope that those people

325
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,200
face the consequences of their sins.

326
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,800
Please wait for me.

327
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,080
What are you called?

328
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,120
Are you Little Ruang and Rid's sister?

329
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,800
No.

330
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,320
I am Pudtarn.

331
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,000
I am a distant relative.

332
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,880
I'm so distantly related to Lady Karaked
that it's hard to keep track.

333
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,920
Pretty Pudtarn,

334
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,600
there is a market near my house.

335
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,840
They sell so many interesting items.

336
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,080
Are you tired?

337
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,560
If you would like to go, I shall join you.

338
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,640
It's a good idea to go for a walk.
I am not tired from traveling.

339
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,200
My muscles are sore from sitting.
It'll be good to stretch my legs.

340
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,760
Just hearing her talk,

341
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,320
I can tell that you two are related.

342
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,280
The way she speaks is confusing,
much like you.

343
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,240
I could understand one word
and not the next.

344
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,160
We are old.

345
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,600
Let us return home.

346
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,240
Indeed.

347
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,600
You should go and get some rest,
Karaked. You must be worn out.

348
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,120
As for me,

349
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,720
I shall go and prepare a meal for you
for this evening.

350
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,960
Khun Pi,

351
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,880
would you prefer to get some rest
or go to the market?

352
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,920
I have a lot to discuss with Rueang.

353
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,320
But I…

354
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,120
You prefer the market?

355
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,600
Yes.

356
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,720
You should not go.

357
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,280
Let the young ones go
and enjoy themselves.

358
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,800
All right.

359
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,800
This is not because I am old.

360
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,600
It is because I listen to you.

361
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,520
Has anyone seen Pin and Yaem?

362
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,240
-No, ma'am.
-No, ma'am.

363
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,280
Choi, go find Pin and Yaem.

364
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,760
Have them accompany the young ones

365
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,360
instead of me.

366
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,520
Let us go.

367
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,320
Hey!

368
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,120
Hey, stop it!

369
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,440
Go away, Gloy! You thief!

370
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,800
You cheater!

371
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,200
You wretch!

372
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,680
You two, get away from my stall now!

373
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,159
Is your family full of thieves?

374
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,480
You thieving wretch!

375
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,920
I need to watch out for you.

376
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,920
You are wasting
my time and livelihood. Go!

377
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,880
Goodness, I am going now.

378
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,560
Go!

379
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,000
Hey, Gloy!

380
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,080
-You thief!
-Stop it!

381
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,679
I'll give it back.

382
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,719
Go!

383
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,679
Please have some sympathy.

384
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,679
You know I have nowhere else to go.

385
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,120
My husband has been unwell.

386
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,280
He has been bedridden for a long time.

387
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,520
Both my daughter and son-in-law died.

388
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,480
Saeng is all I have left,
and he is so small.

389
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,440
It has been a while since he had a meal.

390
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,080
When I went to the temple to ask for food,
they threw me out.

391
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,080
Please have pity on my grandson.

392
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,480
Please.

393
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,040
You people have reaped what you sowed.

394
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,320
Even the temple boys are disgusted by you.

395
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,400
I heard that Karaked ran away from you

396
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,080
and has since become a lady,
living comfortably in Phra Nakorn.

397
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,120
It serves you right.

398
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,240
All the wealth and possessions
you stole from them,

399
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,800
you could not even hold onto them.

400
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,080
Gloy, you cheater!

401
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,000
Have you heard, Gloy?

402
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,760
I heard that they are here now.

403
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,160
-Who are here?
-Who?

404
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,440
The ones you cheated out
of their possessions.

405
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,640
They are here to put you in prison.

406
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,840
You shall lose your head.

407
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,160
This is so satisfying!

408
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,800
-Please.
-Go!

409
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
-Go!
-Take this!

410
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,920
This is really cheap.

411
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,720
This cloth is so pretty.

412
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,800
It does not suit you. It is above you.

413
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,040
Yes, my lady?

414
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,640
Madam Gloy, why did you slap Yaem?

415
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,240
Because she had the audacity
to criticize what I was touching.

416
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,720
She did not mean you, Madam Gloy.

417
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,240
You two are behaving arrogantly,
daring to talk back to me!

418
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,080
Is that you, Madam Gloy?

419
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,040
I doubt that, Pin.

420
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,280
Madam Gloy could not be in such a state.

421
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,400
You are right.

422
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,640
She was grand,

423
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,000
exuding power and prestige
in her residence.

424
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,720
But this is a dirty beggar in the streets.

425
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,720
Madam Gloy should be elegant
with numerous ornaments

426
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,560
and jewelry all over her.

427
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,000
Even though she stole them all.

428
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,960
Oh, dear.

429
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,440
Karaked, I am remorseful.

430
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,320
I am truly remorseful.

431
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,720
I should not have listened to my husband

432
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,000
and stolen your possessions.

433
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,160
But Pad and Jaem also stole from you.

434
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,560
It wasn't just me.

435
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,120
I cannot listen to this anymore.

436
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,840
Pin.

437
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,200
You are hurting me!

438
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,840
Please do not hurt me!

439
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,360
You ingrate!

440
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,480
You thief!

441
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,080
You cheater!

442
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,400
You even stole
from those who were generous to you.

443
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,200
How much do you owe
to Lady Karaked's mother?

444
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,720
Are you not grateful at all?

445
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,280
You tried to blame Pad and Jaem.

446
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,240
They stole because you told them to.

447
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,560
Do not call her madam.

448
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,120
Pin, Yaem.

449
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,200
Please stop.

450
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,640
It hurts.

451
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,440
Let's go, Miss Pudtarn.

452
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,960
Leave her to die here in the market.

453
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
-Please come.
-Wait.

454
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,400
Who is she?

455
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,000
She is Lady Karaked's aunt.

456
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,720
After Lady Karaked's mother died,

457
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,640
she assumed the role of her father's wife.

458
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,080
She mistreated her stepdaughter,
her own niece.

459
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,360
In the end, she stole so many
of Lady Karaked's possessions.

460
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,880
Did you think a child wouldn't realize?

461
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,360
And why…

462
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,840
Pudtarn, what is the matter?

463
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,960
I don't know.

464
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,000
I feel lightheaded,

465
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,240
like I'm going to faint.

466
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,600
Can you stand?

467
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,920
I also saw…

468
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,720
something

469
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,480
in my eyes.

470
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,760
Eung.

471
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,880
Take your mistress to sit down.

472
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,800
-I shall bring you a chair.
-Good.

473
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,120
No.

474
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,320
I have something to say to this woman.

475
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,640
No!

476
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,480
I have repented.

477
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,400
I have repented, Karaked.

478
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,520
I am remorseful.

479
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,720
Come, let us go home.
I shall take you home.

480
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,200
Wait.

481
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,600
Let us go home.

482
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,720
Please don't cry.

483
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,080
I am not Lady Karaked.

484
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,920
Lady Karaked

485
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,920
is my mother.

486
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,920
Is that true, Pin and Yaem?

487
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,880
-Yes.
-Yes.

488
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,280
I apologize, my great-nephew.

489
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,120
We are family, nonetheless.

490
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,960
Please do not send me to prison.

491
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,000
If I end up there, it will be my death.

492
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
I lack the strength to work.

493
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,200
Please.

494
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,840
Please try and remain calm.

495
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,240
See to your grandson. Is he unwell?

496
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,280
He is unwell.

497
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,640
He has had a fever for a while.

498
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,040
We do not even have food to eat,
so we cannot afford medicine.

499
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,760
It seems that

500
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,360
he shall not survive until next week.

501
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,760
In that case,
you may come with us to our accommodation.

502
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,400
You are welcome to have a meal,

503
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,840
and I shall have my servants

504
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,520
bring a doctor to examine the child.

505
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,160
Do you two
truly wish to see the child die?

506
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,560
No, my lord.

507
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,280
I accept my past sins.

508
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,120
The curse has come true.

509
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,120
Lady Karaked's curse

510
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,040
for our lives to be filled
with misfortune and misery

511
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,640
has come to pass.

512
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,440
The possessions I stole
and cheated from others

513
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,720
are all gone, Pin and Yaem.

514
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,320
All right.

515
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,360
Since you are remorseful

516
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,920
and have paid for your sins, all is even.

517
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,600
What is the matter, Pudtarn?

518
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,960
Before, it felt like
something was pressing down on me here.

519
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,920
But now, it feels light and free.

520
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,560
Riem, you look pale.

521
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,920
Are you feeling unwell?

522
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,440
I was taken aback.

523
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,840
I have never witnessed
anything like this before.

524
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,040
Are you scared?

525
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,960
I am, Ruang.

526
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,360
That person is scary.

527
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,960
Riem,

528
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,120
is there actually
something that scares you?

529
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,520
I shall take you home.

530
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,920
Actually, this is not that scary, Ruang.

531
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,600
But you still look pale.

532
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,040
My cheeks are rosy again.

533
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,400
The curse has come true, Pin, Yaem.

534
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,920
Buddha, I have done wrong.

535
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,720
I have done wrong.

536
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,560
I have done wrong.

537
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,240
My goodness.

538
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,040
Do you still believe

539
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,080
that it was Lady Karaked's curse
that put you in this state?

540
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,680
Clearly, she had nothing to do with this.

541
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,240
She lives in Ayutthaya.

542
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,280
Your life is in ruins
because of you and your family.

543
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,800
Even if Lady Karaked hadn't cursed you,

544
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,160
do you think this would not have happened?

545
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,040
I'm tired of people blaming fate,
karma, or others for their misfortune

546
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,760
when, in reality, it's their own actions
that have caused it.

547
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,160
Well, it's true. Fate and karma do exist.

548
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,520
But from now on, don't obsess
over the things others have done to you.

549
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,120
It's about your own actions.

550
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,560
From now on, just do good deeds
to make up for your past sins.

551
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,760
Yes, miss.

552
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,200
At first,
it seemed she might have remembered.

553
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,080
That's right.

554
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,560
She was staring at Gloy.

555
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,640
She was behaving strangely as well.

556
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,440
Like she remembered?

557
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,240
Not exactly.

558
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:41,040
Eventually, she began saying
that Gloy brought this upon herself.

559
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,680
In an instructive manner.

560
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,280
That means she is not vengeful.

561
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,320
That is amazing.

562
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,440
If she really was the old Lady Karaked…

563
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,360
Gloy's life would have ended right there.

564
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,320
Oh dear, that startled me.

565
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,240
If you are Karaked,
even if you don't remember

566
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,360
the past connection between you
and that grandmother and grandson,

567
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,360
the fact that you have forgiven them
for their cruel actions towards you

568
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,520
is a virtuous deed, Pudtarn.

569
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,640
Marquess Phitsanulok

570
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,640
is in charge of matters
concerning Burma and Mon.

571
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,680
He oversees Phitsanulok,
which is fortified by 14 forts,

572
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,680
the construction of which
was supervised by a French engineer.

573
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,440
Various goods are sold,
including forest produce, rhinoceros horn,

574
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,720
wild animal skins, sugar, tobacco,

575
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,760
onions, beeswax, and honey.

576
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,520
Torches are made using tar and oil.

577
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,560
Resin is produced to make sealing wax.

578
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,400
Many people craft dyed wood
for house construction.

579
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,760
They also produce tin and gray amber.

580
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,600
The governor of Phitsanulok
is a former member of the royalty.

581
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,520
Currently, he is a trusted nobleman
and close personal aide to the king.

582
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,720
He has been tasked
with overseeing the city.

583
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,560
Most temples in Phitsanulok
were constructed or restored

584
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,000
during the reign of King Li Thai.

585
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:57,760
It is said that he resided in Phitsanulok
for seven years.

586
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,120
He is regarded as a king
who promoted Buddhism,

587
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,320
undertaking the restoration
of temples in Phitsanulok,

588
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,720
ensuring that the city
has Ratchaburana Temple, as in Ayutthaya.

589
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,640
Over there stands
Phra Si Rattana Mahathat,

590
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,760
also known as Yai Temple.

591
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,400
It features an ordination hall

592
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,600
and an assembly hall
that are both rong-shaped.

593
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,440
The doors of the assembly hall
are carved from wood.

594
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,480
My mother once told me that in the future,
this place will change.

595
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,680
For instance,
the carved wooden doors of this temple

596
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,040
shall be replaced with pearl-inlaid doors.

597
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,080
You must not have slept last night,

598
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,360
Pudtarn, my…

599
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,800
beloved.

600
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,240
Eung, bring a cloth and some water
to wipe your mistress's face.

601
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,760
Yes, my lord.

602
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,920
Are you awake?

603
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,080
Did I fall asleep?

604
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,200
Yes, miss.

605
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,520
What?

606
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,680
I remember that I went
on a horse ride with the baron.

607
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,640
You did.

608
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,920
But you fell asleep along the way,
so he brought you back.

609
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,400
That means I slept for a long time.

610
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,040
I slept through everything
as if I was dead.

611
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,040
Then how did I end up on the bed?

612
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,640
Baron Rid carried you back.

613
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,920
The baron
didn't do anything to me, did he?

614
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,960
I do not know.

615
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,520
He carried you to this sleeping chamber

616
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,200
and told me to bring water
to wipe your face.

617
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,520
Are you sure?

618
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,840
Yes, miss.

619
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,200
Are you sure he didn't do anything to me?

620
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,800
Yes, miss.

621
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,760
But why?

622
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,720
Are you really sure?

623
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,480
Yes, miss.

624
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,160
Why are you so sure?

625
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,400
Because I did not see it.

626
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,280
What a good reason.

627
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,200
There is so much food.
Everything looks delicious.

628
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,000
It also tastes delicious, Pudtarn.

629
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,560
Did you personally
prepare everything, Chanwad?

630
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,480
I only instructed the cooks
to prepare them.

631
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,240
What are the dishes?

632
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,640
The first dish is black chicken gang jued.

633
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,960
It is a local delicacy.

634
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,720
They say black chicken has benefits

635
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,200
such as cooling the body
and reducing inflammation.

636
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,560
Bamboo shoots are plentiful here.

637
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,280
Here is bamboo shoot curry
with ya nang leaves.

638
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,840
And this is fermented fish curry
with toddy palm fruit.

639
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,960
Toddy palms are also abundant here.

640
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,520
We also have fresh toddy palm juice.

641
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,960
Fresh toddy palm juice was used as
a seasoning for the black chicken broth.

642
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,400
Bring fresh toddy palm juice
for everyone to taste.

643
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,040
It is sweet and delicious, is it not?

644
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,080
We also eat red ant eggs here, Karaked.

645
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,320
Has anyone ever tried red ant eggs?

646
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,120
I have.

647
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,960
They're delicious. Nutty and a bit sour.

648
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,600
People here prepare it as a curry
with a type of vegetable called phak wan.

649
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,200
Do you know that

650
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,680
the people in this city
produce their own salt for consumption?

651
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,440
We have a salt pond
that is hundreds of years old.

652
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,640
How lucky.

653
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,760
A place that has salt
has an essential strategic resource.

654
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,600
Strategic resources

655
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,200
refer to materials needed
during times of war.

656
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,520
That is true.

657
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,440
We produce our own salt in Song Kwae.

658
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,400
We supply it to the troops.

659
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,960
They don't need to wait for it
to come from Bangkok or Samut.

660
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,320
This is wonderful.

661
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,280
Any city that has salt
is considered wealthy.

662
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,880
The village with the salt pond
focuses solely on boiling salt.

663
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,520
And they trade the salt
for rice from other villages.

664
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,400
The village is called Bo Pho.

665
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,040
Would you like to visit it?

666
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,960
Let me feed you.

667
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,400
Slowly.

668
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,760
Saeng.

669
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,920
Ma'am.

670
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,720
Miss.

671
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,280
Eung, bring me some water and a cloth.

672
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,440
Hurry.

673
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,520
Eung.

674
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,040
Miss.

675
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,200
What?

676
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,960
The child has a fever.

677
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,280
If you rub him like that, it might give
him brain fever, and he could die.

678
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,680
What brain fever?

679
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,600
Please stop.

680
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,280
Miss, the fever will return.

681
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,680
You need to rub him with a wet cloth
to reduce the fever.

682
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,880
He has a very high fever.
How will this make it worse?

683
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,880
It's fortunate he didn't have a seizure
and end up biting his tongue.

684
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,880
Only if we do nothing will he die.

685
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,040
Listen to her, all of you.

686
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,840
Nothing is wrong.

687
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,840
Everything she is doing is correct.

688
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,800
Tomorrow, you shall see
Gloy's grandson's fever gone.

689
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,400
Is that true?

690
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,680
Trust me.

691
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,720
If his fever rises again,
you rub him like this.

692
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,160
Do it all night.

693
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,120
I can assure you
he will be better tomorrow.

694
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,160
Yes, miss.

695
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,920
Saeng.

696
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,640
Mother wanted you to have this money.

697
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,200
If you need anything
to help Gloy's grandson,

698
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,760
you may make use of it.

699
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,640
Why did you come down? It is late.

700
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,680
I was thinking about you.

701
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,120
Really?

702
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,440
What were you thinking?

703
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,280
I thought,

704
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,760
and I was right,
that you would tend to the ill child.

705
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,680
It seems we are of the same mind.

706
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,680
This way.

707
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,520
Lady Riem is lovely.

708
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,720
It is exhausting raising her.

709
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,840
Is that so, Fai?

710
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,600
She is mischievous.

711
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,520
I have had a hard time keeping up with her
since she started walking.

712
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,080
In fact, if you plant bushes

713
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,840
and place flowers around the pond,

714
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,680
I can assure you it will look so dope.

715
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,520
Dope?

716
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,280
Legendary, the fairest of them all.

717
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,240
Super pretty.

718
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:27,480
I'm telling you, she will surely
invite Pudtarn to run around with her.

719
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,760
Super pretty, is that right?

720
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,440
Actually, there is a place over there
that is super pretty.

721
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,080
Come on, Pudtarn.

722
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,480
She will fall over.

723
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,440
Oh, my goodness!

724
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,600
See?

725
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,360
Oh, dear.

726
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,720
It is not my duty to help her anymore.

727
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,160
Who will help her?

728
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,040
That one.

729
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,480
Where are you hurt, Riem?

730
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,400
I am hurt here.

731
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,520
Riem.

732
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:19,240
You asked me where I am hurt.

733
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,320
That's right.

734
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,960
You asked her, Baron Narong.
I was witness to it.

735
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,960
I asked.

736
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,080
You only need to tell me.

737
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,320
You don't need to show me.

738
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,680
If I did not show it, how would you see?

739
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,040
That's true.

740
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,160
If she did not show it,
you would not see it.

741
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,920
You must always remember

742
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,760
not to just expose
parts of your body to anyone,

743
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,480
regardless of whether
it is to a woman or a man.

744
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,400
Amen.

745
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,400
Amen.

746
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,280
You know what, baron?

747
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,000
Riem, my dear,

748
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,200
the two of them are super alike,
aren't they?

749
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,720
They are super alike.

750
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,680
That's right, super alike.

751
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,920
But we can still
tell the difference, can't we?

752
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,520
I cannot.

753
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,640
How about this?

754
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:25,840
If I were to compare Baron Maharit
to the ocean…

755
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,160
Do you know the ocean?

756
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,280
Yes, I do.
I have been to the ocean at Pribpree.

757
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,320
Pribpree again.

758
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,920
I would say he is like a sparkling ocean.

759
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,680
Like when the sun reflects off it,
it sparkles everywhere.

760
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,600
What would you compare Baron Narong to?

761
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,640
I see.

762
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,280
I know.

763
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,720
He is like a mountain.

764
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,080
A gigantic mountain.

765
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,400
Still, quiet, peaceful,

766
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,800
yet standing strong against the sun
and the rain, unafraid of storms.

767
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,600
Riem.

768
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,520
Only I dare to push against this mountain.

769
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,880
That's too much.

770
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,960
Pudtarn!

771
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,240
Pudtarn!

772
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,920
My lady, you are being too loud.

773
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,040
Be careful, your mole might dance.

774
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,320
-Oh, dear.
-You are just too graceful.

775
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,360
Pudtarn!

776
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,640
What is it, Riem?
Did someone get sick or die?

777
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,840
Let us go somewhere.

778
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,240
Rid is away.

779
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,600
But Little Ruang is available.

780
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,320
He is available.

781
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,680
Where are we going?

782
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,720
Phra Phuttha Chinnarat

783
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,880
is an ancient Buddha image,
seven elbows tall.

784
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:57,480
It is a magnificent sight,
the pride of Phitsanulok,

785
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,000
or Song Kwae.

786
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,800
This Buddha image is believed
to have been built

787
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,200
during the Sukhothai period.

788
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,040
According to the legend of Phitsanulok,

789
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,360
it was originally a bronze Buddha statue.

790
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,760
During the reign of King Ekathotsarot,

791
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,120
he graciously offered
his personal belongings

792
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,600
to be turned into gold leaf

793
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,160
and then applied it to the statue.

794
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,440
You may pray.

795
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,120
It is beautiful.

796
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,120
Do you agree?

797
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,320
I agree.

798
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,880
Well…

799
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,960
If it was as you said,
it is quite strange.

800
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,720
It's very strange, Perm.

801
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,040
I can't get that image out of my head.

802
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,760
It appeared for a moment, but it was as if

803
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,800
someone had glued it inside my head.
Do you get me?

804
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,280
-No, miss.
-No, miss.

805
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,280
I wasn't asking you.
I was talking to myself.

806
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,840
-Yes, miss.
-Yes, miss.

807
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,760
What do you have to say to that?

808
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,720
I…

809
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,000
I suppose…

810
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,240
You go ahead.

811
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,880
You go ahead.

812
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,440
Miss.

813
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,000
Would you like to know…

814
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,720
Pin, Yaem, did you hear me?

815
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,400
I did.

816
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,840
We went to see the place where we grew up.

817
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,080
After coming back,

818
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,680
we found a spot to rest behind the tree.

819
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,640
We are now in a sacred land.

820
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:12,560
Phitsanulok is ancient, miss.

821
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,280
It predates even Ayutthaya.

822
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,479
Wat Phra Si Rattana Mahathat

823
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,319
has the sacred Phra Phuttha Chinnarat.

824
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:26,399
The people of the city respect
and regard it as a refuge.

825
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,120
Good, moral, and honest people pray to it

826
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,160
and receive what they wish.

827
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,439
If a sign appears to you before it,

828
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,359
there is a meaning to it.

829
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,840
Pin,

830
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,200
why did you say that?

831
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,040
What does it mean?

832
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,319
I am merely saying what people believe.

833
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:00,520
Can you explain what has happened to me?

834
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:07,920
There might be a promise tying you
to someone from the past.

835
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:22,319
Thank you both.

836
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:24,960
I know that what has happened to me
is far from ordinary.

837
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,920
Auntie Karaked told me
not to try to find reasons behind it.

838
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,240
But I know that one day,
I will find the answer.

839
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,120
One day, I will know.

840
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,920
-Grandmother.
-Klin.

841
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,320
Why are you here?

842
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,680
Who are you with?

843
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:12,960
Please don't hurt Klin.

844
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,280
He is my husband.

845
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,760
Madam!

846
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,040
What is this?

847
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,640
Klin, you bitch.

848
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,160
Song!

849
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:32,040
Your speech is so disarming.
You are quite silver-tongued.

850
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,600
If she must return to where she came from,

851
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:40,520
it is my intention
never to wed for the rest of my life.

852
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,360
