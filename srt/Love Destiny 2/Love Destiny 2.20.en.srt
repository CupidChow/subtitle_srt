1
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,680
Please stop, Miss Klin.

2
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,600
-Let go right now, Perm!
-Stop this now, Klin!

3
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,880
It's none of your business.

4
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,800
It's my business
as long as you're my granddaughter.

5
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,960
Are you still my granddaughter
or not, Klin?

6
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,880
You don't want me to be, do you?

7
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,800
I will no longer be your granddaughter.

8
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Who do you suppose she is, my lady?

9
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,760
Karaked.

10
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,120
You see, I don't want you to go anywhere.

11
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Destiny will be the answer.

12
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,400
The curse has come true.

13
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,000
Lady Karaked's curse

14
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,920
for our lives to be filled
with misfortune and misery.

15
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,720
I can't get that image out of my head.

16
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,040
It appeared for a moment, but it was as if
someone had glued it inside my head.

17
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,760
If a sign appears to you before it,
there is a meaning to it.

18
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,000
Does Pudtarn want to touch
the Krishna Kali Manuscript?

19
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes, Ruang.

20
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,520
But you don't want her to.

21
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,840
You still know me well.

22
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,360
I saw the look in your eyes

23
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,400
when you saw Pudtarn
at the market in Ayutthaya

24
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,200
the day we took our sisters there.

25
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,040
I knew then how you felt about her.

26
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,240
Ruang, I shall be honest with you.

27
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,640
My feelings for Pudtarn are unusual.

28
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,560
It's as if I have been searching for her
for such a long time.

29
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,600
It has been so long that my heart

30
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,560
aches whenever I look at her.

31
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,520
At first, I wasn't sure
about my feelings for her,

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,560
as those feelings
are something I never expected to feel.

33
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,839
As time went on, I realized that

34
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,279
I didn't want her to go anywhere.

35
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,800
I want her to be with me forever.

36
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
I'm aware of this.

37
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,000
Otherwise, you wouldn't have asked me

38
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,440
to bring the Krishna Kali Manuscript here.

39
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,480
You didn't want her to touch it

40
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,720
as you were scared she might disappear.

41
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,760
However, I don't want her to suffer.

42
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,160
She has been taken away from her home,

43
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,400
which I would never be able
to reach to see her

44
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
if she were to go back there.

45
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,720
So what are you going to do?

46
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,520
I don't know.

47
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,520
In the end,

48
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,000
I can't defy her wishes.

49
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,960
If she must return to where she came from,

50
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,920
it is my intention
never to wed for the rest of my life.

51
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,000
There must be a reason why she came here.

52
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,600
I don't believe
the Krishna Kali Manuscript

53
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,560
brought her here by chance.

54
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,040
Why don't you discuss this
with Father and Mother?

55
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,280
They are far wiser than we are

56
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,280
and their suggestions
might help you solve your problem.

57
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,320
Miss Pudtarn is here, my lord.

58
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,400
Rid.

59
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,920
Choi, what are you hiding from me?

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,960
You're acting
as if you don't want me to go inside.

61
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,240
There's nothing strange
about brothers talking.

62
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,240
But if you don't want me
to interrupt you, I will go.

63
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,480
Okay, miss.

64
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,800
Let me see you to the door.

65
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,480
Seriously, this is important.

66
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,520
Why don't we just get it over with?

67
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,040
You know what I mean, don't you?

68
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,320
Don't tell me that
the manuscript has disappeared

69
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,920
or has been taken elsewhere.

70
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,560
Has it?

71
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,240
No.

72
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,760
Anyway, let's go to the pavilion first.

73
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,600
You should tell my parents
before you do this.

74
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,000
My father is now
at Marquess Phitsanulok's residence

75
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,360
and won't be back until this evening

76
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,280
while my mother is conversing
with Lady Chanwad.

77
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,640
Do you want to leave this place so badly

78
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,120
that you won't even bid them farewell?

79
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,440
I think someone is sulking.

80
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,240
Lord Ruang.

81
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,280
Please think about it.

82
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,600
Okay, I shall do so.

83
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,000
Lord Rid.

84
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,200
I'm waiting.

85
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,280
All right. Please think about this.

86
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,960
If I could vanish
just by touching the manuscript,

87
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,520
then that would mean I would be able
to come back here easily too.

88
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,320
But I think that
there must be a reason I came here.

89
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,640
And I doubt it is that easy for me
to go back and forth.

90
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,720
What are you confused about?

91
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,080
Even though I'm not so smart,
I'm not stupid.

92
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,680
So where is the Krishna Kali Manuscript?

93
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,400
Let's get it over with.

94
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,440
Ruang, please bring out the manuscript.

95
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,640
Let her touch it

96
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,800
so we will get the answer to our question.

97
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,520
I haven't seen Duean.

98
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,160
She moved to her husband's home
in Sukhothai after their marriage.

99
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,560
I didn't know this.
You should have told me.

100
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,400
Your daughter got married,
but I didn't come and congratulate her.

101
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,440
It's all right. I didn't want you
to travel all this way just for that.

102
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,000
We will visit you in Ayutthaya.

103
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,320
And what about my Little Ruang?

104
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,800
Do you think he might find a wife?

105
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,680
He hasn't expressed an interest in anyone.

106
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,600
Even when all the women
in the city would like to marry him?

107
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,680
You never change.

108
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,440
You're still funny.

109
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,680
I don't see why I need to change.

110
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,960
What about your younger son?
Is he close to marrying?

111
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,360
Yes, he's working on it.

112
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,280
But I'm about to get a son-in-law.

113
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,760
That's great to hear. Congratulations.

114
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,680
Is it Keaw or Prang?

115
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,800
It's Keaw, of course.
How could the younger sister marry first?

116
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,600
Lady Champa would never let that happen.

117
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,600
Who is she marrying?

118
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,080
His name is Ming or Earl Srisornrarak.
He is one of the king's royal pages.

119
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,120
That's great to hear.

120
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,760
The children are starting
new chapters in their lives.

121
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,240
I suppose we are approaching the end.

122
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,400
Never think that way, Chanwad.

123
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,120
We must always think we're young.

124
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
We will never get so old
that people will pity us.

125
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,160
Do you exercise at all?

126
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,560
What you showed me,

127
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,720
I haven't done anything.

128
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,280
I have been occupied with my daily tasks.

129
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,520
Good. Take care of your husband's needs
so he won't have any mistresses.

130
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,400
Though I would say,
exercise is also important.

131
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,640
Otherwise, your belly will get bigger.

132
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Also,

133
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,720
your breasts will sag and droop.

134
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,960
The way you talk,

135
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,200
I can easily identify you

136
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,760
just by hearing your voice alone,

137
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,480
as no one else talks like you.

138
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,240
So is Pudtarn fun like you?

139
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Yes, Chanwad.
She has been here less than a week.

140
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,520
Haven't you seen that she is
twice the woman I am?

141
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,040
Is that true?

142
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,280
She's a modern woman.

143
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,920
A modern woman?

144
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,760
She's younger than us,

145
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,760
so she is energetic

146
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,840
and does whatever comes to mind.

147
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,240
She doesn't know how to wait.

148
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,880
I'm going to open it now.

149
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,400
Let me do it.

150
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,920
Don't do it, Pudtarn.

151
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,800
Rid.

152
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,320
I knew it.

153
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,960
I could feel some kind of energy,

154
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,480
but it wouldn't take me back.

155
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,240
Maybe we need to return to the same spot.

156
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,560
I mean, I may have to touch it there

157
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,280
and once I have returned home,
I may find that

158
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,240
no time has passed.

159
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,000
It may still be the same day
and time that I came here.

160
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,080
You want to return no matter what.

161
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,640
It doesn't mean that
I don't want to stay here

162
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,200
or that I won't miss the people here…

163
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,400
especially…

164
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,360
But I want to find out the truth
rather than run from it.

165
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,880
Would you have me stay here forever,
aimlessly wondering

166
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,760
about where I came from or why I am here?

167
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,360
I can't do that.

168
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,240
I want to know where I'm meant to be.

169
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,760
I will do everything I can to find out.

170
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,720
Everything.

171
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,760
I need to be sure that I can't go back

172
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,680
and if that's the case,

173
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,400
I am willing to stay here

174
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,080
for the rest of my life.

175
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,240
In that case,

176
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,840
you shall take

177
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,080
the Krishna Kali Manuscript
back with you to Ayutthaya

178
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,640
so you will get the answer
you are looking for.

179
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,560
However, you must be careful,

180
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,600
and most importantly,
keep it away from my mother.

181
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,960
We all know

182
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,040
what will happen if she touches it.

183
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,560
This also applies to Keaw and Prang.

184
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,280
Don't let them touch it.

185
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,760
Once, Prang touched it only briefly,

186
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,240
but she said that it felt like

187
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,520
a wave of needles piercing her.

188
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,000
I suspect this manuscript

189
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,080
gives different experiences

190
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,920
to women who touch it.

191
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,240
I will keep it in my chamber for now.

192
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,720
Lord Rid, I'm hungry.

193
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,360
I haven't eaten yet.

194
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,360
Do you have anything for me to eat?

195
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,840
I told the servants to keep some for you.

196
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,960
You're the most thoughtful
and kind man I know.

197
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,080
I was so fortunate
to touch the Krishna Kali Manuscript

198
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,920
at the moment you found it.

199
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,520
That's how we got to know each other.

200
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,360
I really mean it.

201
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,720
If I had appeared
at some other guy's house who was cruel,

202
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,440
he might have treated me badly
and hurt me.

203
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,200
For example, he might have locked me up

204
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,520
or sold me to a brothel.

205
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,680
He might have even forced me to be his…

206
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,320
wife.

207
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,040
Promise me

208
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,160
that you will not touch the manuscript
when I'm not around.

209
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,520
If you are to disappear…

210
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,400
I must see it with my own eyes.

211
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,520
I understand.

212
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,600
I wish you won't touch
the Krishna Kali Manuscript ever again.

213
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,640
But I love you too much

214
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,280
to deny you the answers you seek.

215
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,600
You are unswerving and determined,

216
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,040
and I respect this part of you.

217
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,720
No matter what the future holds,

218
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,760
I shall accept it

219
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,040
as long as it is your desire.

220
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,120
But as for this moment,

221
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,120
with you in my arms,

222
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,400
I shall never forget it.

223
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,560
If you want to cry,

224
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,240
go ahead.

225
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,680
-My gosh.
-Who said I'm crying?

226
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,840
Who's crying?

227
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,480
No one's crying.

228
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,040
Pudtarn.

229
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,760
You bitch.

230
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,600
Song, give me a hand.

231
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,040
Sure, Klin.

232
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,200
-Madam, why would you go there?
-It's my business.

233
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,040
-Please slow down or you'll trip, ma'am.
-It's my business.

234
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,040
Why would you go there, ma'am?

235
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,000
-For god's sake, I said that it's--
-It's your business.

236
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,480
You're right.

237
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,680
Why would I go to Pudtarn's residence?

238
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,040
Klin has been gone
for almost a week, hasn't she?

239
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,640
Six days, ma'am.

240
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,560
I have no clue where she's gone.

241
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,760
Where should I look for her?

242
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,160
Ma'am,

243
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,200
were you going to look for her
at Miss Pudtarn's house?

244
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,360
I wanted to see
if they have returned from Phitsanulok.

245
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,960
I also thought of looking for her there.

246
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,200
That's what I thought.

247
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,760
I thought maybe Pudtarn had returned.

248
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,520
Since Klin keeps a close eye on Pudtarn,

249
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,680
she might notice her return
and go there to trouble her,

250
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,840
as they still have it in for each other.

251
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,840
-What? Goodness.
-Hey.

252
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,720
They haven't returned yet.

253
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,920
It's so quiet.

254
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,440
That means no one is home.

255
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,720
Let's leave.

256
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,760
What about this?

257
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,440
That's great. Again, even harder.

258
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,280
Sure.

259
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,000
That's amazing.

260
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,720
I love it.

261
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,000
Grandma.

262
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,680
Klin.

263
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,920
Why are you here?

264
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,920
Answer me.

265
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,320
Miss.

266
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,520
Goodness, I have turned over
every stone in search of you.

267
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,640
I have been everywhere.

268
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,200
Why?

269
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,440
Did you think I was dead?

270
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,480
Yes, I thought you were.

271
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,960
Damn you! Are you cursing me?

272
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,240
Klin.

273
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,320
Who are you with?

274
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,560
Judging by your voice,

275
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,440
I bet you think I'm here
doing improper things with a man.

276
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,320
I'm not your beloved Pudtarn
to be so wanton.

277
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,080
Don't try to change the subject.

278
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,000
Answer me. Who are you with?

279
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,360
Otherwise, I shall go in there
and kill him with my own hands.

280
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,440
Dear me.

281
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,720
-You're so fierce like--
-Please don't say she's a dog.

282
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,760
Who are you?

283
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,520
Come out now!

284
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,040
Otherwise, I will beat Klin to death!

285
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,000
Please stop, Gui!

286
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,600
Please don't do it!

287
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,840
Please don't hurt Klin.

288
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,960
Song.

289
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,480
Are you with Song?

290
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,560
That's right.

291
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,080
Klin is my wife.

292
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,320
He is my husband.

293
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,200
Didn't you just say you weren't wanton?

294
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,720
-My goodness!
-Grandma!

295
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,720
-Madam!
-Gui!

296
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,480
-Madam!
-Gui!

297
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,480
-Grandma!
-Gui!

298
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,760
-Madam!
-Song, carry her!

299
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,000
-Grandma!
-Madam!

300
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,800
Can't you say something?

301
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,920
I thought you didn't want to hear me.

302
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,840
Yes.

303
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,280
You're right.

304
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,360
But I don't mind if you say something.

305
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,040
What? Why is that?

306
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,920
It's too quiet.

307
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,400
Do you not hear your inner voice?

308
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,600
Do I hear

309
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,320
my inner voice?

310
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,080
That's right.

311
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,840
What does it say?

312
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,280
Klin.

313
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,960
I can't tell whether
my grandmother loves me or not.

314
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,440
Can you still not tell

315
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,480
even after what she said?

316
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,920
You will be full of sorrow, my dear.

317
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,560
No sorrow is comparable

318
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,680
to that caused by your husband
having mistresses.

319
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,920
Gui.

320
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,720
I love Klin
and I plan to start a family with her.

321
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,920
She may not be my first wife,
but she will be the only one with a say.

322
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,960
Why are you discouraging me?

323
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,280
If Klin finds a husband who loves her

324
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,440
and puts her above his other wives,

325
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,120
you should be pleased.

326
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,840
-My goodness.
-Good grief.

327
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,080
No.

328
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,360
I don't want my granddaughter to get hurt.

329
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,200
If your husband has many wives,

330
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,440
your life will be full of distress, Klin.

331
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,240
Even I can tell that Gui loves you.

332
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,960
Does she?

333
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,240
Klin,

334
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,040
no matter what I say, you won't listen.

335
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,160
You won't come home.

336
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,320
You will go and be Song's wife.
Am I right?

337
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,400
If that's so, then go!

338
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,440
Go and don't let me see your face again.

339
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,440
I'll cut off all ties with you
from now on.

340
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,720
Klin.

341
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,680
Klin.

342
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,720
Madam.

343
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,680
Madam.

344
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,760
Didn't you hear her say
that she would cut me off completely?

345
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,840
Yes, I heard it.

346
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,960
Yet you still think she loves me.

347
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,400
I don't know.

348
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,360
But I could feel it.

349
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,000
I could feel it in my heart

350
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,800
that your grandmother was worried
about you being my wife.

351
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,320
She's afraid you will get hurt.

352
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,720
If I become your wife,

353
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,520
I will certainly get hurt, like she said.

354
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,000
Even though you might not be
my first wife,

355
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,840
you will be above my other wives.

356
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,200
How many wives do you have, exactly?

357
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,240
How many?

358
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,160
Tell me.

359
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,160
Hold on. I'm counting.

360
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,040
She's right to be worried about me.

361
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,840
Klin,

362
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,480
I truly love you.

363
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,000
Song.

364
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,680
Be honest with me.

365
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,040
Why do you love me?

366
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,320
Do you know me well enough?

367
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,960
You want me to be your wife
and put me above the others.

368
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,960
Once I get to that point, do you think
you will get to live in peace?

369
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,680
What would you say
if I turned out to be monstrous

370
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,960
and made your other wives run away?

371
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,360
I'd be fine with that because I love you.

372
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,800
Hey, stop your nonsense.

373
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,720
Do you think I will fall for that?
In your dreams.

374
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,560
I will speak like this
every time I see you

375
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,240
until you give in to me.

376
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,760
I won't, so stop dreaming.

377
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,400
I'm staying at your residence now.

378
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,480
If you force yourself on me…

379
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,800
I will kill--

380
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,840
Kill me?

381
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,080
I'm not scared.

382
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,360
I will kill myself.

383
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,679
I will hang myself.

384
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,440
Once I am a ghost,

385
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,800
I will come back to haunt you
and all of your wives.

386
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,040
Imagine people in your residence

387
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,159
walking around

388
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,120
with their hair standing on end.

389
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,480
This is why I love you, Klin.

390
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,960
You make me happy.

391
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,080
Please be my wife.

392
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,120
I can see that you truly love me,

393
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,320
but I have no feelings for you yet.

394
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,280
If you can make me love you

395
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,880
and make me willing
to have you as my husband,

396
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,640
then I will become your wife.

397
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,960
Do you mean it, Klin?

398
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,600
Please don't lie to me.

399
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,760
Hey, Song.

400
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,360
If you're already doubting me,
then let's call it off.

401
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,440
Take me back to my grandmother now.

402
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,080
Klin, I'm not doubting you.

403
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,080
I said that
because this is about the future.

404
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,120
I…

405
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,920
was afraid you would change your mind.

406
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,880
Then you should know
that I'm a serious person.

407
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,920
I mean what I say.

408
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,120
Very well.

409
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,120
What is this for?

410
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,080
This is from Lady Karaked.
It's for your grandson's treatment.

411
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,120
I have also saved some for you

412
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,400
to buy necessities
for you and your grandson.

413
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,640
Please don't do this.

414
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,080
I don't know what to say.

415
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,400
From now on, I will no longer sin.

416
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,120
Karaked,

417
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,720
please forgive me.

418
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,480
Pin, Yaem, don't tell me that…

419
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,400
I'm not her, am I?

420
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,480
What's the point of knowing that?

421
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,040
You don't have to worry
whether you're her or not.

422
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,560
She's right.

423
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,960
You did the best thing, miss.

424
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,720
Even if you're not her,

425
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,920
you have helped a person

426
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,560
to realize that she must pay back

427
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,920
for what she has done.

428
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,320
Thank you, Pin and Yaem.

429
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,760
Today is such a good day.

430
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,280
How can you be so clueless, Eung?

431
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,280
She's right.

432
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,440
There is a time and a place.

433
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,440
What's the matter? What am I doing wrong?

434
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,960
I'm a servant,
so I must escort my mistress.

435
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,440
Good grief, you fool.

436
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,720
Don't argue with us.

437
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,920
That's right.

438
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,880
Don't get in the way.

439
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,320
Whose way, Pin, Yaem?

440
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,640
I get it now.

441
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,120
I'm such a fool.

442
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,880
Well then, I'll get going.

443
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,680
What are you standing here for?

444
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,120
You're unbelievable.

445
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,600
Yaem, who did she insult?

446
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,720
You, of course.

447
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,480
Did she not insult you at all?

448
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,040
No.

449
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,920
I will get going.

450
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,560
What are you waiting for?

451
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,520
Gosh.

452
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,240
They have left.

453
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,680
They get it.

454
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,840
Get it?

455
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,040
Get what?

456
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,520
This, perhaps.

457
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,680
Just you wait.

458
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,000
Bring it on.

459
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,680
Do you know what I will do?

460
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,560
Of course.

461
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,760
How did you know
that I wanted to take you to eat?

462
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,680
I guessed wrong.

463
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,400
Are you ribbing me?

464
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,040
Do you know what that means?

465
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,880
-Of course.
-What does it mean?

466
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,240
Well, it's like spareribs

467
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,600
that you eat.

468
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,840
Hey, take this to the boat.

469
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,120
Be careful.

470
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,280
-Are you tired, Perm?
-I'm fine, Choi.

471
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,520
-Be careful, Perm.
-Yes, sir.

472
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,400
Karaked, thank you so much for your visit.

473
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,280
I've missed you.

474
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,400
I'm glad to see that you are happy here.

475
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,880
Lord Rueang…

476
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,840
Oh, no.

477
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,400
Earl Ramnarong,
you have taken great care of my friend.

478
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,760
The same goes for you, Karaked.

479
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,480
You have also taken great care
of my friend.

480
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,960
He's so plump

481
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,120
and strong.

482
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,920
I miss the time when we worked together
and traveled together.

483
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,960
It has already been 20 years.

484
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,960
That's a long time.

485
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,480
Well, of course.
Your sons have now grown into men.

486
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,720
You looked after them well, Pin and Yaem.

487
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,600
Yes, my lady.
I'm grateful for your kind words.

488
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,720
Having raised them,
I have grown most fond of them.

489
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,080
Hey, didn't I raise my own kids?

490
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,200
Well, Pin and Yaem?

491
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,120
-Yes, you did.
-Yes, you did.

492
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,520
Please visit me again, Pudtarn.

493
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,480
Why don't you come to Ayutthaya?

494
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,160
Yes, I will.

495
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,960
I have wished to visit for some time,
but no one would take me.

496
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,680
If you get your father's permission,
I shall take you there.

497
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,280
Do you promise, Ruang?

498
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,000
Of course.

499
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,760
I always keep my promises.

500
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,720
I will be waiting for you there.

501
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,960
Okay.

502
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,880
You just arrived and now you're leaving.

503
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,480
I'll miss you so freaking much.

504
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,360
Riem.

505
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,760
Where did you get that from?

506
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,800
Pudtarn taught me that.

507
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,040
You use it to mean "very much."

508
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,080
There is more.

509
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,080
-I'm so glad you came.
-See you soon.

510
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,560
Visit me again soon.

511
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,880
Please don't forget me.

512
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,840
I will miss you a lot, Eung.

513
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,560
Same here.

514
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,440
How long is the boat ride to Ayutthaya?

515
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,480
Three days. Have you been there?

516
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,720
Never.

517
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,720
I would like to see it.

518
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,800
Is it beautiful?

519
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,280
Of course.

520
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,080
I heard it looks like heaven, does it not?

521
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,840
Yes, it's a city of angels.

522
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,000
Is that true?

523
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,200
-Yes.
-Yes.

524
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,840
Song!

525
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,880
Who among you threw things at her?

526
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,560
Confess

527
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,240
and I shall not punish you.

528
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,280
You can't do that.

529
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,560
You must punish them.

530
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,200
They won't confess if I punish them.

531
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,880
Wrong is wrong.

532
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,440
Who would admit it
if they knew they would get punished?

533
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,920
If you don't punish them, I will go home.

534
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,400
Klin.

535
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,960
Please stay, Klin.
Be my source of happiness.

536
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,760
Her.

537
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,320
Her, her, her, and her.

538
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,840
They were making faces just now.

539
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,760
They must be the ones
who threw rotten food at me.

540
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,600
I don't see any connection.

541
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,360
Call them over here and you'll see.

542
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,040
Why should I do that?

543
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:02,960
Do it.

544
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,960
You, you, you, and you.

545
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:20,880
Get up.

546
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,240
You too.

547
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,240
Now.

548
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,080
I have called them.

549
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,800
Song, come here.

550
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,000
Come here.

551
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,920
Smell it.

552
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,200
Was it them?

553
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,360
Did you think I wouldn't catch you?

554
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,960
Song,

555
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,200
smell their hands one by one.

556
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,440
Hurry up.

557
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,320
Come here.

558
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,160
Come here.

559
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,400
Where are you going?

560
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,960
Smell it.

561
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,000
More.

562
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,920
Have some rotten vegetables.

563
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,960
Rotten mangos.

564
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,960
Rotten bananas.

565
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,440
This is so satisfying!

566
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,960
Rotten eggs.

567
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,480
Rotten eggs.

568
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,840
How about this?

569
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,560
What do you think?

570
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,120
Will you do that to me again?

571
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,880
Rotten fermented fish.

572
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,600
Isn't fermented fish already rotten?

573
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,640
You madwoman!

574
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,280
Sure, I'll give you extra.

575
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,560
A handful of worms.

576
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,760
You're mad!

577
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,760
What is this?

578
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,240
Miss.

579
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,440
-Where are you going?
-Be careful.

580
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,360
Pudtarn.

581
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,920
Where are you going?

582
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,600
-Stay out of it.
-Hey.

583
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,400
Tell me where you are going.

584
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,760
You have just arrived.

585
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,240
What happened?

586
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,000
Why is she upset?

587
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,320
Someone vandalized her home.

588
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,680
-It's a complete mess, Choi.
-What?

589
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,920
Why are you here? We just parted.

590
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,640
Well, I'm worried about you.

591
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,640
Why? Did you know about this before?

592
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,360
Did you ask someone to trash my house?

593
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,880
What are you talking about?

594
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,080
If it wasn't you, then move.

595
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,000
-Miss.
-Eung.

596
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:01,920
Don't come.

597
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,760
I'm fine by myself.

598
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,080
Someone vandalized her house, my lord.

599
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,160
Who?

600
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,280
Klin.

601
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,400
Klin, you bitch!

602
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,640
Calm down.

603
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,360
Why don't you sit down?

604
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,640
I can't be calm anymore.

605
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,320
Don't forget that
you're a daughter of angels.

606
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,040
I'm not.
I'm a devil, just like your granddaughter.

607
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,560
My house was completely trashed.

608
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,840
I know you know who did that.

609
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,600
-I do.
-Who did it?

610
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,240
Klin and Song.

611
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,760
Klin has become Song's wife.

612
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,480
Klin.

613
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,720
Song has taken her from me.

614
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,360
I raised her since she was just a baby.

615
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:15,320
I never thought
she would become someone's mistress.

616
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,000
Song has countless wives.

617
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:24,600
Why did she put herself in that situation
for people to look down on her?

618
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,160
I'm distraught, Pudtarn.

619
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,560
Is Klin at Song's house right now?

620
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,280
She said she is his wife now.

621
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,040
Gui, do you believe in fate?

622
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,720
Fate?

623
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,600
I do believe in it.

624
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,440
If it weren't for fate,
I wouldn't have met you.

625
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,200
Absolutely.

626
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,360
That's why you appeared on my land.

627
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,520
Right?

628
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,720
You're right.

629
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,960
Klin became Song's wife
because she was fated to do so.

630
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,400
You're her grandmother.

631
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,280
Don't try to change her fate.

632
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:34,560
Those two were destined to be together.

633
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,400
My dear.

634
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,880
My good girl.

635
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,440
Pudtarn, you are truly a child of angels.

636
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,640
Do you miss her?

637
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,000
Do you?

638
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,960
Well?

639
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,360
I do.

640
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,160
Well then, go and find her.
What are you waiting for?

641
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,400
Go and find her?

642
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,680
I…

643
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,160
I'm embarrassed.

644
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,120
-Yes?
-You can walk now.

645
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,000
Lift your foot.

646
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,920
Isn't this a bit much?

647
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,120
You will find out soon.

648
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,400
My gosh.

649
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,560
Did you cast a spell?

650
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,800
Yes, that's right.

651
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,760
A special spell

652
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,960
cast by those three.

653
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,600
You're incredible.

654
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,160
It's as beautiful as before.

655
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,800
Thank you so much.

656
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,160
By the way,

657
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,000
aren't you mad at Klin anymore?

658
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,840
I still am.

659
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:52,960
You are?

660
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,960
I see.

661
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,920
But you have forgiven her.

662
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,080
You're so kind-hearted.

663
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,960
I can't forgive her.

664
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,720
I thought you weren't mad at her anymore.

665
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,360
If so,
how did you talk Gui into forgiving her?

666
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,040
Well, Gui should stop being mad at her.

667
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:17,120
As for me, I'm still mad at her

668
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,880
even if my house is back to how it was.

669
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,640
Think about it.

670
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,920
She was mad at me
but took it out on my house.

671
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,200
She had no guts.

672
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,560
If she did, she'd have come
to fight me face-to-face.

673
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,480
Wait and see.

674
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,880
I will haunt her for 100 years
and 100 lifetimes.

675
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,760
I will never forgive her.

676
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,840
I know you want to scold me.

677
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,480
I don't,

678
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,120
because I don't understand what you said.

679
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,760
Your speech is so disarming.
You are quite silver-tongued.

680
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,600
Is my tongue silver?
See for yourself if it's silver.

681
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,880
You said so.

682
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,320
Well, I…

683
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,440
I…

684
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,680
I'm sorry.

685
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,120
What are you sorry for?
You did nothing wrong.

686
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,280
Was I…

687
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,680
Was I not wrong?

688
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,360
What did you do wrong?

689
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,880
Well…

690
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,960
I…

691
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,720
Well, I…

692
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,280
-I--
-You kissed me.

693
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,040
Yes.

694
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,360
So did you want to kiss me?

695
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,880
Why would I do so if I didn't want to?

696
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,760
So what's wrong with that?

697
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,880
What's wrong with that?

698
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,160
Well, you would be wrong
if you hadn't wanted to kiss me.

699
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,600
You're so…

700
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,000
Silver-tongued.

701
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,360
That's right.

702
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,160
Isn't it good?

703
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,440
It is.

704
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,960
How good?

705
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,440
Very good.

706
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,960
To what extent?

707
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,440
To what extent?

708
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,440
Well?

709
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,680
I'm not going back.
I have already become Song's wife.

710
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,040
If so, then you should stay here.

711
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,640
I missed you,

712
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,000
so I came here to visit you.

713
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,960
Is this you speaking?

714
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,560
Am I hearing things?

715
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,200
It's me,

716
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,640
Gui, your grandmother.

717
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,920
You aren't hearing things.

718
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,120
Grandma.

719
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,040
Are you possessed by a ghost?

720
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,280
I'm not possessed by any ghost.

721
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,760
Is that true?

722
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,520
It was Pudtarn
who talked me back to my senses.

723
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,600
She said it wasn't my business

724
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,520
who you took as your husband.

725
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,560
Pudtarn.

726
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,440
Did you need her
to talk you back to your senses?

727
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,000
Well then, take her as your granddaughter.
Don't come to me.

728
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,360
Klin, actually--

729
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,720
You should leave.

730
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,000
Go back to her. Don't come to me.

731
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,480
Klin.

732
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,640
Gui.

733
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,480
Greetings.

734
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,960
Take good care of my granddaughter.

735
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:07,000
Don't forget the promise
you made to me, Song.

736
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:11,400
You're talking about putting Klin
above my other wives. Am I right?

737
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:12,440
That's right.

738
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:15,000
I won't forget it even after I die.

739
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,320
Though she is not yet my wife,

740
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,360
you must see how much I love her.

741
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,600
Once she becomes my wife,
I will love her even more.

742
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,920
Very well.

743
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,400
What?

744
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,800
Song, is Klin not your wife yet?

745
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,400
Not yet. I'm not yet her husband.

746
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,520
Thank you.

747
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,440
Thank you.

748
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,880
You're thanking the wrong person.

749
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,480
Song can't wait to be my husband.

750
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,280
It's me.

751
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,240
I protected my dignity
just as you taught me to.

752
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,240
Have you ever seen the good in me?

753
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,360
Or do you only see it in Pudtarn?

754
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,560
Take her as your granddaughter
if you love her so much.

755
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,800
You don't need me.

756
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,000
What are you looking at?

757
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:15,200
Gui, I haven't forced myself
on your granddaughter.

758
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,280
I appreciate that, Song.

759
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,360
Forcing yourself on a woman

760
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:26,120
is something a dog does, not a man.

761
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,600
What a waste of a life.

762
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:29,920
Let's go.

763
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,480
Help! Help me!

764
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,840
Help me!

765
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:10,920
Help!

766
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,280
Klin.

767
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:39,840
Klin.

768
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,680
What's wrong?

769
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:48,960
I…

770
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,160
I can't breathe.

771
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,520
You can't breathe?

772
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,720
Are you dying?

773
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,280
Watch your mouth.

774
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,240
I shouldn't have said it, should I?

775
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,320
No.

776
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:06,040
I heard you tossing
and turning last night.

777
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,560
I thought you must be having a nightmare.

778
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:14,040
But I stopped myself
from coming here to console you.

779
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,400
Come on, Song.

780
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,000
Don't you know
I would kick you out if you did so?

781
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,560
I do. That's why I didn't go inside.

782
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,400
I don't want to upset you in any way.

783
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,360
You have many wives.
Grandma doesn't like that.

784
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,560
I don't want you, I want your grandmother.

785
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,160
I mean, I don't want your grandmother,

786
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,600
I want you.

787
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,360
Even though I want a husband, I trust her.

788
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,440
You can't do that, Klin.

789
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,240
If you do so,

790
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,760
I will never have you as my wife.

791
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,840
Yes, you never will.

792
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,600
No, Klin.

793
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,880
I can't accept this.

794
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,600
I would rather die.

795
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,560
Let me help you.

796
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,400
You won't have to die
if you get rid of all your wives.

797
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,520
Do this, and my grandmother
will be happy to give me to you.

798
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,240
I can't do that, Klin.

799
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,040
Why not? Didn't you say you love me?

800
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,680
If I leave them,

801
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,280
it will be them

802
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,400
who will die.

803
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:56,120
Today, we have omelet
with minced pork and Thai basil,

804
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:57,960
steamed fish curry,

805
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:03,280
and Chinese vegetable stew,
my dear customers.

806
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,320
Everything is delicious,

807
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,560
my dear customers.

808
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,680
Our food is fresh, clean…

809
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,920
And safe, my dear customers.

810
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,359
Safe and toxin-free,

811
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:25,880
-my dear customers.
-My dear customers.

812
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,680
What would you like?

813
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,359
-These look nice.
-I'll have the stew.

814
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:33,080
-I'd like some stew.
-This one?

815
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,560
-Sure.
-I'll get it for you, my dear customer.

816
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,040
Would you like some rice too?

817
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,520
-Yes, please.
-Miss.

818
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,000
My goodness.

819
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,279
They all look so delicious.

820
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,439
-Here you go.
-I'd like some stew.

821
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,399
It looks so good.

822
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,880
Here you go, ma'am.

823
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,800
What would you like?

824
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,000
You seemed anxious on the way back.

825
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,800
What's wrong?

826
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:43,960
I saw Kam.

827
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,200
I saw you follow him.

828
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,479
What did he say to you?

829
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,760
What?

830
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,120
I thought you went to the privy.

831
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,280
Why did you follow him? It's dangerous.

832
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,200
What did he want?

833
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,920
-What did--
-Miss.

834
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,440
Atitaya, my child.

835
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,240
I shall bring her into the palace.

836
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,440
This way, she can cook for me every day.

837
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,080
Do you suppose a stubborn person like her

838
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,120
would be willing
to serve me in the palace?

839
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,200
Destiny brought me here.

840
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,520
In eight months,
you shall no longer believe in it.

841
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,800
I'm going to test our destiny.

842
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
