1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,440
How are you so certain
that you can return?

2
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,720
I have to try.

3
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
You'll have to wait…

4
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,040
Six months?

5
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,840
Did you see Pudtarn's face?

6
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,840
She looks just like Mother.

7
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,800
Let's go. Someone is waiting for you.

8
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,440
There she is, Lady Karaked.

9
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,920
Her son must have asked her to tell me

10
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,480
that the Krishna Kali Manuscript
belongs to their family.

11
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,760
He sent his mother to threaten me.

12
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,280
How much money
could I get for this necklace?

13
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,880
And what is this pendant?

14
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,240
Sell this for me.

15
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,760
This necklace…

16
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,880
Klin, Gui's granddaughter,
asked me to sell it for her, my lord.

17
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,320
I shall buy it.

18
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,440
Two, three…

19
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,080
My lady.

20
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,720
You could fall.

21
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,680
You could fall, my lady.

22
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,880
Prang.

23
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,200
Yes?

24
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,480
Mother.

25
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,200
What is it, Keaw?

26
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,120
Please look at Prang.

27
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,880
Nothing is wrong.

28
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,280
Do not touch it.

29
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,120
-Prang, Grandmother will hear
-Please be careful.

30
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,800
and lean out to look.

31
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,280
I have already stopped. Look.

32
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,080
It is time.

33
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,160
Let's do it one more time, Keaw.

34
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,920
Come on, kids. I shall teach you yoga.

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,600
-Yoga?
-Yoga?

36
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
What is it?

37
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,160
Yoga is about harmonizing the body, mind,

38
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,880
and spirit as one.

39
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,600
I shall see to Ginger.

40
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,320
Prang.

41
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,680
I shall give Grandmother a massage.

42
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,360
Wait for me!

43
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,120
Where are they all going?
I was about to explain it.

44
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,040
Pin, Yaem.

45
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,800
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

46
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,720
You can do it.

47
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,480
Yes, my lady.

48
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,480
Pin!

49
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,840
Tighten the stomach, breathe,

50
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,160
-and smile.
-Yes, my lady.

51
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,480
Lady Prang.

52
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,920
Lady Prang.

53
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,760
Please do not rush.

54
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,400
When you return next time,
I shall make sure to teach you yoga.

55
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,120
-Why?
-Why?

56
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,480
Because I want to, okay?

57
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,320
Do not roll your eyes. It is impolite.

58
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,600
How often must I remind you
not to do that to your elders?

59
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,040
-Understood.
-Understood.

60
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,320
Say goodbye to Grandmother.

61
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,920
May happiness be upon you.

62
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,720
Please return quickly.

63
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,960
-Yes, Grandmother.
-Yes, Grandmother.

64
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,080
Go on.

65
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,240
Please be safe, Keaw and Prang.

66
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,760
Rest assured, Mother.

67
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,520
I shall be A-Okay.

68
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,080
DW, don't worry.

69
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,880
I shall also be A-Okay.

70
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,520
Keaw, Prang.

71
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,520
Did you say goodbye to Grandmother?

72
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,280
I shall escort you to the palace myself.

73
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,040
Shall we leave now?

74
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,240
-Yes.
-Yes.

75
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,920
Choi, have you prepared the boat?

76
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,960
Yes, my lord.

77
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,240
Chom, transport the ladies' belongings.

78
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,760
Shall we use an additional boat
for all these items?

79
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,040
No need, I have already
prepared a large boat.

80
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
Prik, Chuang.

81
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,760
I shall be going. Bye.

82
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,520
-Bye.
-Okay.

83
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,360
I shall not be gone for long.
I shall return shortly, Pin, Yaem.

84
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,480
Let me see you off.

85
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,880
Mother, you needn't come to the pier.

86
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,680
Let us go.

87
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,640
Make sure to clean between the tiles too.

88
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,840
Sweep out the whole room.
Move the furniture too.

89
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,080
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

90
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,480
It is a very sunny day today.

91
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,640
Air the pillows out in the sun.

92
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,080
Hurry now. You must also clean
Prang's room and Keaw's room.

93
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes, my lady.

94
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,800
What is this?

95
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,440
A necklace.

96
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,760
Does it belong to Rid?

97
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,840
What?

98
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,680
Look at this, you two.

99
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,400
Whose heart has my son been keeping?

100
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,480
I am curious.

101
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,480
Is that a heart, my lady?

102
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,760
A heart?

103
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,880
What?

104
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,880
The heart that is right here.

105
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,240
I know what a heart is.

106
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,120
But I did not know that
this is what a heart looks like.

107
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,720
It is not like this.
They just made it a similar shape.

108
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,160
That's why it is as pretty as this.

109
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,520
-Indeed.
-Indeed.

110
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,880
What?

111
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,000
What?

112
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,920
What is the matter, my lady?

113
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,800
It…

114
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,480
Am I dreaming?

115
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,080
This is

116
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,440
a picture, a photograph.

117
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,680
A photograph?

118
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,480
-Oh, dear.
-Oh, dear.

119
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,960
Yaem.

120
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,440
Who does it belong to?
Where does it come from?

121
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,240
Pin.

122
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,680
Do you not recognize that necklace?

123
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,680
Of course.

124
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,840
It belongs to Pudtarn.

125
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,680
I think you're right.

126
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,480
Pudtarn was wearing it.

127
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,720
So why does Rid have it?

128
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,560
Why, indeed.

129
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,160
Are you two certain
that it belongs to Pudtarn?

130
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,600
-Absolutely, my lady.
-Absolutely, my lady.

131
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,160
-For sure.
-For sure.

132
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
You two.

133
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,520
Yes, my lady.

134
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,320
This woman resembles me.

135
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,960
At first, I thought that she could be
my sister, Karaked, reincarnated.

136
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,920
But she has a locket with this picture.

137
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,280
This picture is from my time.
She is from my era.

138
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,200
She might have come here
the same way I did.

139
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,560
I must go to see her.

140
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,040
I must see her,
no matter how long I must wait for her.

141
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,640
I must know.

142
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,080
-My lady.
-My lady.

143
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,640
-My lady.
-I am fine.

144
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,280
I am just flustered.

145
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,440
Shall I go see her now?

146
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,600
My lady.

147
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,560
Please try and remain calm.

148
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,200
My lady.

149
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,800
My lady.

150
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,400
Yaem.

151
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,160
My lady.

152
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,120
Yaem.

153
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,440
-Goodness.
-Yaem, Pin.

154
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,720
I can no longer bear it, my lady.

155
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,400
Neither can I, my lady.

156
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,840
Then do not come. Stay here.

157
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,880
-Okay.
-Okay.

158
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Come, hurry now.

159
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,280
-My goodness.
-Come, get up.

160
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,360
My lady.

161
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,080
-My lady.
-My lady.

162
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,520
My lady.

163
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,880
Will you not call for her?

164
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,920
I shall wait.

165
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,280
Yaem, perhaps we should ask Eung
where her mistress is.

166
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,760
I agree.

167
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,840
Eung, where is your mistress?

168
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,440
She is inside the house, Pin.

169
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,080
Has she not come out yet?

170
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,960
She has not awoken yet.

171
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,840
She seems just like her.

172
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,360
She does.

173
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,520
Eung.

174
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,760
Perm.

175
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,360
Eung.

176
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,080
Eung, Perm, where are you?

177
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,560
There is a giant gecko!

178
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,720
-Miss!
-Miss!

179
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,440
Eung, Perm, where are you?

180
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,320
You are Pudtarn, are you not?

181
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,960
Are you Baron Rid's mother, my lady?

182
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,920
Miss!

183
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,960
Yes.

184
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,880
I am Baron Rid's…

185
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
mom.

186
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,040
Did you say…

187
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,560
"mom"?

188
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,920
Yes.

189
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,400
I did.

190
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,480
You are…

191
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,160
Let us go sit over there.

192
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,000
We have much to discuss.

193
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,480
Pudtarn.

194
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,560
Yes.

195
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,680
Where are you from?

196
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,520
You're from

197
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,280
Bangkok, aren't you?

198
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,080
My lady,

199
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,160
you know that…

200
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,760
That…

201
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,360
Gosh, I don't know what to say.

202
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,080
Why did you ask me that?

203
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,520
Because I have a feeling that you are not…

204
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,480
That you are not from this era.

205
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,160
You're right. I'm from Bangkok.

206
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,760
How did you come here?

207
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,160
I found a book in a chest
buried in the ground.

208
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,240
Baron Rid calls it
the Krishna Kali Manuscript.

209
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,160
When I touched it, I was transported here.

210
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,600
Your whole body was pulled here?

211
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,840
Yes, I came here like that.

212
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,560
I was wearing the same clothes
as when I found the chest.

213
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,920
My shoes and bag came with me too.

214
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,640
Were you also brought here
by the Krishna Kali Manuscript?

215
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,000
Twenty-five years ago,

216
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,160
I died.

217
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,360
Really?

218
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,320
I was in a car accident.

219
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,280
-Ket!
-I died at the scene.

220
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,480
Ket!

221
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,360
Then my spirit came here,

222
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,880
into this body.

223
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,760
It is the body of a lady named Karaked,

224
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,960
who happened to die
at the same time as I did.

225
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,360
At the same time?

226
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,680
One person was in Ayutthaya

227
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,840
and the other was in Bangkok.

228
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,720
Around 300 years later.

229
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,840
My lady, what about me?

230
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,360
I came here with my body. I didn't die.

231
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,560
Or did I die in the future?

232
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,240
Maybe I did.

233
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,360
No. Your body was pulled here.

234
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,960
I have heard about time dilation

235
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,560
from Einstein's theory of relativity.

236
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,160
Have you heard of it?

237
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,320
Yes.

238
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,800
According to the theory,
dimensions are independent of each other.

239
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,240
Independent of each other?

240
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,520
I can't explain to you more
because that's all I know.

241
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,760
We may not understand
the theory or science

242
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,600
behind what has happened.

243
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,840
What we do know is that
we came to this place, Ayutthaya.

244
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,000
Although we came by different means,

245
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,080
we both come from the world
300 years in the future.

246
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,960
That is amazing.

247
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,880
It's insanely amazing.

248
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,480
There are many more
amazing things in this world.

249
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,000
But none quite like this.

250
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,240
Sometimes, I think I must be dreaming

251
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,120
and that when I wake up in the morning,

252
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,480
I will be home in Bangkok.

253
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,720
I apologize, my lady.

254
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,240
Let it all out.
Cry as much as you need to.

255
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,400
I understand how you feel

256
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,600
because I used to feel the same way.

257
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,840
Given what's happened to us,

258
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,480
so long as it doesn't send us mad,
that's enough.

259
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,320
It has already happened, Pudtarn.

260
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,040
Maybe it is destiny or magic
that caused it to happen.

261
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,120
The only thing we can do is to accept it.

262
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,160
There's nothing else we can do.

263
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,560
You understand that, right?

264
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,320
Yes, my lady.

265
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,160
The time here,
in Ayutthaya where you are living,

266
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,920
is over 300 years before our time.

267
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,600
The living conditions are uncomfortable.
There are no modern conveniences.

268
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,360
No electricity, running water,

269
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,280
Wi-Fi,

270
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
Internet,

271
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,880
cars, or roads.

272
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,240
There are only the canals,

273
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,120
the boats, and your own two legs.

274
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,920
No radio.

275
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,240
No television.

276
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,480
For some people,
this would be a nightmare.

277
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,040
They could not live like this.

278
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,960
I don't know if you feel that way.

279
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,280
I don't know either.

280
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,080
The good thing about this place

281
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,640
is the lack of pretense.

282
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,600
You will find sincerity in everything.

283
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,240
Even the people who are mean to you,
they will be mean to you in a sincere way.

284
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,680
There are no two-faced people
like those from our time.

285
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,040
You make them sound like good people.

286
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,000
"Mean in a sincere way."

287
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,320
Right.

288
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,240
You will meet someone
who is mean to you in a sincere way

289
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,400
and you will not wonder
if they are actually mean or not.

290
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,320
Right.

291
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,160
I think I have already met that person.

292
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,760
Is that so, Karaked?

293
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,200
Yes, Khun Pi.

294
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,200
I am still confused.

295
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,680
It is impossible, but it has happened.

296
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,120
How is it impossible?

297
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,920
It must be possible

298
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,960
because you are here.

299
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
Indeed.

300
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,200
I am here.

301
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,480
May I never disappear.

302
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,680
Wherever you go,

303
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,920
I shall go with you.

304
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,640
If I cannot,

305
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,040
I would rather die.

306
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,280
Your Highness,

307
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,400
we have received word from the palace

308
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,240
about His Majesty's scheduled visit.

309
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,520
Your Highness.

310
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,120
Bhorn.

311
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,720
Kindly instruct your royal pages to leave.

312
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

313
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,400
You have a secret order for me,
do you not?

314
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,720
Don't fret.

315
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,480
These two are in my charge.

316
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,800
They may stay and observe.

317
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,280
Certainly, Your Majesty.

318
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,320
Bhorn,

319
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,840
I must ask a favor from you.

320
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,400
I realize my request

321
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,040
may trouble you,

322
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,600
but I must speak with you,

323
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,520
not because you are the crown prince

324
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,360
representing the Front Palace.

325
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,840
I must speak with you

326
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,000
as my brother, who shares my blood.

327
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,800
If that is the case,
why would it trouble me?

328
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,400
Because I must ask you

329
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,720
to keep a close eye on someone

330
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,200
I suspect

331
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,320
Prince Dum is plotting a treasonous coup
to seize the throne.

332
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,520
This person

333
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,040
is your father-in-law.

334
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,480
Your wife's father,

335
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,880
Prince Dum.

336
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,360
I never expected

337
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,120
that our father's own brother,

338
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,240
our uncle,

339
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,760
could conceive of such a terrible plot.

340
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,320
As I suspected,

341
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,120
you appear uneasy.

342
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,520
Do you not believe it?

343
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,360
I shall refrain from stating
whether I believe it or not.

344
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,120
However, it is true that

345
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,640
I feel uneasy.

346
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,960
But if there is no doubt that

347
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,120
Uncle Dum

348
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,160
has truly conceived
of such an ambitious scheme,

349
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,360
then our blood,

350
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,200
my king and brother,

351
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,120
would undoubtedly be thicker than water,

352
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,040
Your Majesty.

353
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,080
If you have the chance
to speak with Uncle Dum,

354
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,760
I would truly like to know

355
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,200
his thoughts about me.

356
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,360
It has not been a year
since I ascended the throne.

357
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,320
Have I acted in such a manner

358
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,520
that has led him to view me
as unfit to be king?

359
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,040
Or is his ambition

360
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,120
merely driven by his arrogant nature
and desire to become king himself?

361
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,760
What action shall we take
regarding Uncle Dum?

362
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,040
At this time, it is my opinion that

363
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,440
we should refrain from taking any action.

364
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,200
It's because

365
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,720
Prince Dum has not yet
taken any explicit action.

366
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,320
If you make a move,

367
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,600
I fear that

368
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,720
it could do more harm than good.

369
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,760
I have asked the crown prince
to watch him closely.

370
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,400
He must feel quite uneasy.

371
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,520
Whatever the situation,
Uncle Dum is his father-in-law.

372
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,120
Do you fear that

373
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,880
the crown prince
might side with his father-in-law?

374
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,400
Do I have cause for concern?

375
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,880
Please share your thoughts

376
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,440
on what should be done

377
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,120
to prompt Uncle Dum into action.

378
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,480
We must nip it in the bud.

379
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,239
How may we provoke him

380
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,520
to grow impatient

381
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,080
and reveal his true nature
so we may deal with him?

382
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,719
My mother taught me that

383
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,480
to draw rats from their hole,
one must lure them with bait.

384
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,400
Give the rats

385
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,120
what they desire

386
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,480
and then deal with them.

387
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,320
What Uncle Dum desires.

388
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,440
What else could he desire?

389
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,800
I shall give it to him then.

390
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,080
That is not what I meant.

391
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,400
Do not put yourself

392
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,600
in danger.

393
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,120
I agree.

394
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,240
It is not worth the risk.

395
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,360
Without taking any risks,
when might we achieve our result?

396
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,880
Am I to allow him
to remain a thorn in my side?

397
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,240
I fail to see the point in that.

398
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,160
George.

399
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,440
Spread the word

400
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,640
that I will disguise myself and take
some leisure time outside the city.

401
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

402
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,320
Your Majesty,

403
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,880
I do not agree with this plan.

404
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,880
Please reconsider.

405
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,600
I must insist that

406
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,640
no one here

407
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,560
agrees with this plan.

408
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,360
-Indeed, Your Majesty.
-Indeed, Your Majesty.

409
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,200
I have made my decision.

410
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,720
Thongkam,

411
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,640
Ming,

412
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,640
In,

413
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,560
George.

414
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,640
Each of you,

415
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
prepare to disguise yourselves as well.

416
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,920
Not you, Rid.

417
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,320
Everyone in Phra Nakorn knows you.

418
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,040
You must oversee the guards from afar,

419
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,160
ready to strike back.

420
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,760
Now,

421
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,240
you all may leave.

422
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,200
Do as I have commanded.
Make sure this is not in vain.

423
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,920
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

424
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,720
Where are you going?

425
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,440
Mun, no!

426
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,680
In,

427
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,720
you'll blow our cover.

428
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,200
Don't bow to me like that.

429
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,520
Do all men in Ayutthaya
treat their wives so harshly?

430
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,760
What is considered customary

431
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,680
must be reevaluated.

432
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,080
My grandfather told me that

433
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,000
such things don't happen in France.

434
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,960
And who is your grandfather?

435
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,160
Ambassador Pan.

436
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Who would dare strike their wife
in the presence of Ambassador Pan?

437
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,040
My mother also insisted
that my father never struck her.

438
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,120
I see.

439
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,880
Perhaps it is true that

440
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,520
foreigners do not strike their wives.

441
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,360
In Ayutthaya, husbands are allowed
to strike their wives.

442
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,160
It is the law, Your Majesty.

443
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,360
Let us stop here for now.

444
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

445
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,800
Is there anyone here?

446
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,720
Is there anyone nearby?

447
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,280
Is there anyone here?

448
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,200
Yes, I'm here.

449
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,560
I went to forage for bamboo shoots.

450
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,400
Who are you looking for?

451
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,360
Do you

452
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,640
live on your own?

453
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,040
I live…

454
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,480
I live…

455
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,600
I live with loads of people.

456
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,960
Many men.

457
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,480
I see.

458
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,800
Many men?

459
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,280
Indeed.

460
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,880
How many?

461
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,920
How many?

462
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,160
Well…

463
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,840
I already said. There are many.

464
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,960
They have gone
to catch fish and pick vegetables.

465
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,720
We're here to ask for some water.

466
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,760
If you have some food to spare,
we would appreciate it.

467
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,560
How is that?

468
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,840
Well…

469
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,760
We are all starving.

470
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,120
Very well. I can prepare you a meal.

471
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,960
But you all must help out because
the many men living here are away.

472
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,840
Why do you persistently repeat "many men"?

473
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,720
Well, I…

474
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,840
In, George, Thongkam,

475
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,400
help this woman.

476
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,320
Many men live here,
but they are away at the moment.

477
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,720
Ming, you remain here with me.

478
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,920
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

479
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,520
I've never lit a fire myself.
How do I do it?

480
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,040
Miss.

481
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,080
Let me light the fire for you.

482
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,360
I shall leave it to you then.

483
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,520
The two of us shall catch fish for you.

484
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,920
That'd be sweet.

485
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,440
That is good.

486
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,520
That is good.

487
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,640
I caught one.

488
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,200
Mine is larger.

489
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,120
You have not descaled it.
How can we eat it?

490
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,000
Like this.

491
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,600
Ming, do you notice anything

492
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,400
about this woman?

493
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,880
She resembles Lady Karaked, Your Majesty.

494
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,400
Speak casually.

495
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

496
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,320
Yes, my lord.

497
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,160
Whether she is related to the lady or not,
I must ask Rid.

498
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,120
Rice is in the pot.

499
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,560
Help yourself to some, my lord.

500
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,680
Act casually.

501
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,920
Is it ready to eat?

502
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,960
Not yet.

503
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,440
Dig in!

504
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,680
That woman speaks unlike other people.

505
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,280
She also resembles Lady Karaked.

506
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,320
She is indeed very beautiful.

507
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,200
She is older than you, In.

508
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,840
That doesn't bother me, Your Majesty.

509
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,120
About my departure from the city,

510
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,280
are you certain that
Prince Dum is aware, Thongkam?

511
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,120
I am certain he is, Your Majesty.

512
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,200
Mind your words.

513
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,840
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

514
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,640
It is almost dark.

515
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,200
We shall wait here.

516
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,040
If they fail to appear today,

517
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,360
we shall return another day.

518
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,400
Perhaps he has changed his mind.

519
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,000
Who? Prince Dum?

520
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,440
People like him
don't suddenly decide to do good

521
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,240
rather than evil.

522
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,960
These look lovely.

523
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,840
-Eung, where have you been?
-Miss.

524
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,760
Perm, I had to light the bra…

525
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,520
Bra…

526
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,960
What is it?

527
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,520
Brazier.

528
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,840
You weren't here.

529
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,520
Who lit it for you?

530
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,240
Those men.

531
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,360
Perm, is that who I think it is?

532
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,640
I believe it is.

533
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,280
I saw him during
the crown prince designation ceremony.

534
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,160
He participated in the procession.

535
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,840
Is that who?

536
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:30,880
What?

537
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,240
Who do you think it is? Tell me.

538
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,120
Thongkam.

539
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,320
What is happening, Eung?

540
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,160
Find something to protect yourself.

541
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,640
Be careful, miss.

542
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,800
Perm.

543
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,160
Not me!

544
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,800
-Perm, let's confuse them.
-Yes, miss.

545
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,080
-Change!
-Change!

546
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,800
-Change! Quickly!
-Change!

547
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,560
Do not go out!

548
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,080
Watch out!

549
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,800
In, go and protect Pudtarn.

550
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,120
But there are many of them.

551
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,320
-I fear--
-Do it!

552
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,640
Go!

553
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,320
Let go!

554
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,640
Hey!

555
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,320
Wait.

556
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,160
Do not kill him yet.

557
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,800
Question him first.

558
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,920
Who sent you?

559
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,840
Make him talk.

560
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,560
If you talk,

561
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,520
I shall spare you.

562
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,720
I shall ask the royal physician
to treat you.

563
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,160
You only need to say

564
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,480
who sent you.

565
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,720
George,

566
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,440
see the plan through.

567
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,560
I saw two of them escape.

568
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,480
Have you ordered men to pursue them?

569
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,480
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Hurry and follow them.

570
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,320
Are you wounded, Your Majesty?

571
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,560
Eung.

572
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,120
It is him.

573
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,440
I knew it.

574
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,080
I am not wounded.

575
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,240
Shoot. I'm in deep trouble.

576
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,320
It is as I expected.

577
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,160
Let us hope that George is successful.

578
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,640
The pursuit may lead him
to the responsible party.

579
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,240
I still hold out hope that…

580
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,080
it is not Uncle Dum.

581
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,320
I shall go on ahead.
You stay here to report to the count.

582
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,320
He went that way, my lord.

583
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:20,960
Pudtarn,

584
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,560
you must have been frightened.

585
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,800
I was frightened…

586
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,960
But not too much…

587
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,320
Your Highness.

588
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,040
What was that movement?

589
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,440
Good.

590
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,360
I admire a woman
who is not easily alarmed.

591
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,920
Please stand up.

592
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,080
Act normally as though
you do not know who I am.

593
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,080
To tell you the truth…

594
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:20,240
I still do not know who you are.

595
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,040
I only know that you are royalty.

596
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,200
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

597
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,560
Well, you may speak casually.

598
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,480
Rid,

599
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,240
you may tell her who I am.

600
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,440
Pudtarn,

601
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,720
when you learn who I am,
do not be alarmed or cause a fuss.

602
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,560
I may travel here for leisure
of this nature again.

603
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,040
I would not want you to blow my cover.

604
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,600
I shall be going.

605
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,720
Meet me at the throne hall
at the end of the pond, Rid.

606
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,440
You may come at any time.

607
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,720
I shall wait there for George all night.

608
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,840
Please wait.

609
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,760
Is something bothering you?

610
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,560
It must be of great importance

611
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,520
since you were so quick to beckon me.

612
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,560
Payment for the meal.

613
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,960
Thongkam.

614
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,800
They boarded a boat there, my lord.

615
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,640
They won't be traveling quickly.

616
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,920
They are seriously wounded.

617
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,480
Come, let us pursue them.
Where is the boat?

618
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,680
Yes, my lord.

619
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,120
The king may visit here again.

620
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,800
He enjoys traveling in this area.

621
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,800
What is there around here?

622
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,120
There is a cockpit.

623
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,720
I see, he comes here for cockfighting.

624
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,760
Is that not the case?

625
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,640
If you should meet him again,

626
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,200
speak to him as though
he is a normal person.

627
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:35,680
I will.

628
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:42,040
King Sanphet IX,
also known to the people as…

629
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,040
King Tai Sra.

630
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,080
Why is he known by that name?

631
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,640
Because he resides
in Banyong Rattanat Throne Hall

632
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,480
or as we commonly refer to it,
the throne hall at the end of the pond.

633
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,800
It is a waterside throne hall.

634
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,160
This is frustrating.

635
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,760
What is the matter?

636
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,200
I feel upset with myself.

637
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,440
When I was at school,
I didn't care for history at all.

638
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,720
Do you know of history?

639
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,920
I do. Why wouldn't I?

640
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,880
I only know what it is though.
I remember nothing.

641
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,640
I gave my teachers hell.

642
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,400
Why did you give them that?

643
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,520
Did your teachers ask for it?

644
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,160
No.

645
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,200
I gave it freely.

646
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,280
You shouldn't have done that.

647
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:33,880
What a shame.

648
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,880
Your laughter

649
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,520
closely resembles that of my mother.

650
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,880
That is true.

651
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,200
That is true?

652
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,200
Do you know?

653
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,600
Well, I…

654
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,480
Please don't tell my son

655
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,880
that I came to meet you.

656
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,880
I won't.

657
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,280
I…

658
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,760
I heard someone mention it.

659
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,200
Let me ask you something.

660
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,160
King Tai Sra is a member
of the Ban Phlu Luang dynasty, isn't he?

661
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,280
What dynasty?

662
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,040
Ban Phlu Luang dynasty.

663
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,440
All I remember is that the Tiger King

664
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,440
was part of the Ban Phlu Luang dynasty.

665
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,800
Yes, the Tiger King.

666
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,600
But there is no such dynasty
as you mentioned.

667
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,320
How could that be?
I remember the word "phlu."

668
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,800
I know it. People chew
the phlu leaf with betel nut paste.

669
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,600
There is no such thing.
I have never heard of it.

670
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:01,000
I have never heard
of the dynasty you mentioned.

671
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,240
How could you not?

672
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,600
It's a dynasty.

673
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,120
It's like a surname.

674
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,520
Surname?

675
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,320
What is that?

676
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,480
Come on, everyone must have a surname.

677
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,360
Right, I remember.

678
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,240
Surnames began around
the time of King Rama VII.

679
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,360
Right, I remember that
King Rama VII introduced surnames.

680
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:34,880
But a dynasty is like the Chakri dynasty.

681
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,280
The king is a member
of the Ban Phlu Luang dynasty.

682
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,120
I remember. I am not wrong.

683
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,520
What? It doesn't exist?

684
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,640
I have heard that

685
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,000
King Phetracha came from
the district of Ban Phlu Luang

686
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,600
in the city of Suphan Buri.

687
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,880
I'll stop talking. I have a sore throat.

688
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,280
Oh, dear.

689
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,600
Your throat was sore the other day.
Have you not recovered?

690
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,800
I shall ask Gui to tend to your throat.

691
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,480
It shall heal within a day.

692
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,560
I shall go with you.

693
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,720
Go where?

694
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:19,920
Gui's house.

695
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,479
No, thank you. I'm better now.

696
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,200
Is that true?

697
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,520
It is.

698
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:32,680
How wonderful.

699
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:35,120
You take ill and heal so quickly.

700
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,720
Yes, my lord.

701
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,520
What?

702
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,800
What's with your arms?

703
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,279
Are you afraid of being handsy?

704
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:21,040
Did the person you asked to get the book
catch up with him?

705
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,720
Order an express rider
to go after Baron Ruang's convoy.

706
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:24,920
Did you just make the order?

707
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,279
Yes, you heard it correctly.

708
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:28,120
You're trying to trap me here, aren't you?

709
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,960
This is frustrating.

710
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,160
They outwitted us.

711
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,359
If you get caught,

712
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:35,240
you will surely be executed.

713
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:36,319
Who goes there?

714
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,800
Deal with them.

715
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,720
Do not let any of them escape.

716
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,080
I may be younger than you,

717
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,240
but did you really think
you'd get away with it?

718
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,479
You don't know me well enough.

719
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,840
What would you have me do with him?

720
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:37,400
