1
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,240
Let's get it over with.

2
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Don't do it, Pudtarn.

3
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,360
Rid.

4
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,040
Maybe we need to return to the same spot.

5
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,680
You want to return no matter what.

6
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,080
What is this?

7
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,000
Klin, you bitch!

8
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,080
Calm down.

9
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,960
Klin has become Song's wife.

10
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,080
I can see that you truly love me.

11
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,560
If you can make me love you,
then I will become your wife.

12
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,880
Is Klin not your wife yet?

13
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,200
Not yet. I'm not yet her husband.

14
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,920
Thank you.

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,560
Your speech is so disarming.
You are quite silver-tongued.

16
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,920
Everything is delicious.

17
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,280
You seemed anxious on the way back.

18
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,320
What's wrong?

19
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,280
I saw Kam.

20
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,480
I saw you follow him.

21
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,800
What did he say to you?

22
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,720
Kam.

23
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,400
I no longer wish to be your wife.

24
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,480
You probably do not want
a wife like me either.

25
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,240
Please let me go.

26
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,800
If I wanted to let you go,

27
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,080
why would I show my face?

28
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,760
Hey.

29
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,960
Watch yourself.

30
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,280
Why did you follow him? It's dangerous.

31
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,200
What did he want?

32
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,920
-What did--
-Miss.

33
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,880
I have something to tell you.

34
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,160
What?

35
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,360
I shall press charges against him.

36
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,880
I will report him
to the judiciary authority.

37
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,440
Phra Nakornbal officials
could put him in prison.

38
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,560
I will officially divorce him.

39
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,320
Really?

40
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,800
That's good.

41
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,520
Wait.

42
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,160
Did something happen?
Why the sudden bold move?

43
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,279
Aren't you afraid of people
gossiping about you,

44
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,079
saying a divorced woman is repulsive?

45
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,040
You once mentioned that

46
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,040
the women where you came from
love themselves

47
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,320
and are willing to do anything
to make themselves happy,

48
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,440
as long as it does not
cause trouble for others.

49
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,400
Is that right?

50
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,480
That's right.

51
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,200
But people gossip about them anyway.

52
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,040
It happens.

53
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,920
There are people who take pleasure
in rubbing salt into others' wounds.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,240
There are so many of them.

55
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,120
They are psychos.

56
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,920
If I do not press charges against him

57
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,560
and allow him to remain my husband,

58
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,880
I shall never be happy

59
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,600
and he might cause you trouble as well.

60
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,320
I am willing to be the subject of gossip.

61
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,160
Eung, whether your husband is good or bad,

62
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,840
having one provides protection.

63
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,680
He never protected me.

64
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,160
All he did was harm me.

65
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,520
Perm, do you not see?

66
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,480
Are you blind?

67
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,200
Try and stay calm, Eung.
Don't get worked up.

68
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,280
Don't be afraid. I've got your back.

69
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,640
I have enough money to free you
from your duties to Madam Gui.

70
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,040
Auntie Karaked gave me some money.

71
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,040
And there's also money
from selling our food.

72
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,040
That just leaves you, Perm.
I still haven't saved up enough.

73
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,160
Let Eung have it first.

74
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,440
Five tamlueng is not a small amount.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,840
Please keep it, miss.

76
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,880
I can live like this.

77
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,480
I can continue serving you like this.

78
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,400
It is enough for me.

79
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,320
But what if…

80
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,760
What if I return home?

81
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,960
If I go back, why would I need this money?

82
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,720
Wouldn't it be better to leave it here
for you to use?

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,480
I will ask Baron Rid

84
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,120
to accept you as a commoner
under his father's authority.

85
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,480
And you can then earn money
and build a better life for yourself.

86
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,680
This way, you can help free Perm
instead of me.

87
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,200
Eung.

88
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,920
If you don't go back,

89
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,960
I will serve you for the rest of my life.

90
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,480
Please do not go back, miss.

91
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,920
And Baron Maharit,
could you truly abandon him?

92
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,640
She is right.

93
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,080
Do you not feel sympathy for him?

94
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,920
I'll think about that later.

95
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,600
That's enough practice for today.

96
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,960
You must be tired.

97
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,400
It's not enough. I need to do more.

98
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,240
Why must you continue learning this?

99
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,640
Do you intend to use it on someone?

100
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,159
If not, why would I do this?

101
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,760
There is always someone
you need to kill or slash.

102
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,000
Thank you.

103
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,120
Pudtarn.

104
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,200
Where did you come from?

105
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,600
Would you know even if I told you?

106
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,840
What?

107
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,960
Why are you laughing?

108
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,480
Are you going to think about it all day?

109
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,280
No.

110
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,480
I inquired merely to gain a notion.
I fear I would not know.

111
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,760
-What?
-Do not show your teeth when you laugh.

112
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,800
That's impossible.

113
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,760
You have to open your mouth
when you laugh.

114
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,840
And the teeth are right here.

115
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,520
How can I not show them?

116
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,400
You try, Baron.
Try laughing without showing your teeth.

117
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,760
Men are allowed to show their teeth.

118
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
This again.

119
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,320
I'm so tired of it.

120
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,040
But I have not tired of you.

121
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,840
I never will.

122
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,680
Why not?

123
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,160
I see.

124
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,600
Only the men here can get tired of things?

125
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,640
When they become tired of one thing,
they move on to the next.

126
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,760
Unlike the women.

127
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,040
Indeed. Women cannot tire of things.

128
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,720
See?

129
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,080
Then you can be tired of me. Go ahead.

130
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,040
You talk in circles.

131
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,760
I shall shut your mouth.

132
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,400
Go ahead. Do it.

133
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,320
Gosh, I thought…

134
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,080
It is nearly dark.

135
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,000
Let us go home.

136
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,760
Gosh, that's it?

137
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,480
What did you say?

138
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,800
I said…

139
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,280
Do not expect me
to do what you are thinking.

140
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,520
Why not? Why can't you do it?

141
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,760
No.

142
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,240
Patience is a virtue.

143
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,280
Gosh.

144
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,880
Nobody believes that anymore
in this day and age.

145
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,160
What day and age?

146
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,040
Well… This day and age.

147
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,680
No matter what the day and age,
one must believe in that.

148
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,920
Fine.

149
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,880
Then let me ask you this.

150
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,400
Should men or women believe in it more?

151
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,240
Why must you even ask?

152
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,920
This thing can happen
between a man and a woman.

153
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,600
For that reason, both men and women

154
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,240
should believe in it equally.

155
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,520
They must believe it equally, so it won't…

156
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,240
It won't happen.

157
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,520
You speak in circles again.

158
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,120
If we believe it equally, it won't happen.
Isn't that right?

159
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,840
Just answer yes or no.

160
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,680
Yes.

161
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,240
I don't believe patience is a virtue.

162
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,240
You do not believe it?

163
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,800
-You do not believe it?
-No.

164
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,680
See? We don't believe it equally.

165
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,560
So why doesn't it happen?

166
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,000
Well? Why?

167
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,240
You speak in riddles.

168
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,840
I do not want to listen.

169
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,360
Hey, are you feeling shy right now?

170
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,160
You're not?

171
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,160
That's not true.

172
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Turn this way so I can see your face.

173
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,720
-No.
-Come on, turn this way.

174
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,040
Turn this way if you dare.

175
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,480
Let me touch the Krishna Kali Manuscript
again tomorrow.

176
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,440
Baron.

177
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,080
Even now,

178
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,760
you still think of leaving?

179
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,640
If destiny dictated that I came this far,

180
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,080
it might also dictate that I return.

181
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,960
If I am destined to leave,

182
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,240
it might be better if I leave now.

183
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,680
How would that be better?

184
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,160
Think about it.

185
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,640
How would it be better?

186
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,120
Thank you.

187
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,080
Why must you go to such lengths?

188
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,840
Because I believe

189
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,200
that once…

190
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,640
Once I have left,

191
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,720
everyone's memories will be gone.

192
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,280
So I won't leave anything behind.

193
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,000
Do as you please.

194
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,080
What you're going to encounter

195
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,280
is something you can't avoid.

196
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,800
Remember my words well.

197
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,480
Be mindful.

198
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,040
Consider your actions carefully.

199
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,960
I am so afraid, Choi.

200
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,600
She will not go anywhere.

201
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,320
Trust me, my lord.

202
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,600
Don't worry about it until it happens.

203
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,520
Eung,

204
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,120
Perm,

205
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,720
we must trust in destiny.

206
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,840
Please do not go anywhere.

207
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,920
Consider the baron's feelings.

208
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,240
Gosh.

209
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,800
I can't leave.

210
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,560
This is fine.

211
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,200
Stay here if you cannot leave.

212
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,760
I shall take care of you

213
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,240
and ensure you never face any trouble.

214
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,920
I don't understand.
Why could I come but I can't return?

215
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,320
Something isn't right.

216
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,000
Baron,

217
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,200
could you try touching the book
together with me?

218
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,200
Rid.

219
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,560
Are you certain about this?

220
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,480
Won't you try to stop him?

221
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,920
No.

222
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,640
I would only stop you.

223
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,520
I will not stand for it.

224
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,800
Karaked.

225
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,800
If you let Rid touch it, fine.

226
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,960
But I will touch it with him.

227
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,320
-Oh, dear.
-Oh, dear.

228
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,880
I remember.

229
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,960
There was an eclipse
that caused the sky to turn dark.

230
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,400
Perhaps we have to wait
for another eclipse.

231
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,560
How will we know
when and where it will happen?

232
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
I can calculate that.

233
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,080
Eight months from now,

234
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,800
there shall be another eclipse.

235
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,880
-Eight months.
-Eight months.

236
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,720
When you came here,

237
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,720
an eclipse occurred,

238
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,240
but it was not a full eclipse.

239
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,520
In eight months,
I'm going to test our destiny.

240
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,240
To see how it will dictate our lives.

241
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,640
I also have eight months

242
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,200
to persuade you

243
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,240
not to go anywhere.

244
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,080
To make you

245
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,800
want to stay here
for the rest of your life.

246
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,400
To make you

247
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,920
the one who dictates your life,

248
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,480
not destiny.

249
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,480
Right now, I still believe in destiny.

250
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,480
Destiny brought me here.

251
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,360
In eight months,

252
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,720
you shall no longer believe in it.

253
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,480
I'll wait and see.

254
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,600
Please take this medicine.

255
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,360
Will you be able to go, Little Ruang?

256
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,280
Earl Rueang is unwell.

257
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,320
How could I go?

258
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,800
If they cannot go,
I would rather not go alone.

259
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,040
I can accompany you.

260
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,240
Don't be ridiculous, Riem.

261
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,160
I mean it.

262
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,280
I would like to join you.

263
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,440
I can accompany you.

264
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,840
You do not want to go alone, do you?

265
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,120
I do not want to go
if they are not going as well.

266
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,760
I am concerned about Uncle Rueang.
He is unwell.

267
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,840
I shall go for you,
representing the three of you.

268
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,880
I can assure--

269
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,320
No one is going.

270
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,920
Everyone must stay
and care for Uncle Rueang.

271
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,760
It is your sister's wedding.

272
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,960
And what of it?

273
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,320
It is not my wedding.
It is not necessary for me to attend.

274
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,280
Are you so eager to go, my lady?

275
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,880
-It is not the wedding I am interested in.
-Pardon?

276
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,800
I just want to go with Little Ruang.

277
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,520
Fai, could you not tell?

278
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,640
Well, it was in your mind.

279
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,680
How was I supposed to know?

280
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,680
I was forced to go public.

281
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,440
You made me.

282
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
Goodness.

283
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,040
My lady, what do you mean by "go public"?
I do not understand.

284
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,080
Whatever Miss Pudtarn says,
my Lady Riem repeats.

285
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,080
I have decided
not to go to Keaw's wedding.

286
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,160
You should go, Ruang.

287
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,120
There is no need.

288
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,600
I do not need to go.

289
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,440
Ming, I cannot attend your wedding.

290
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,000
However, I plan to go to Pribpree

291
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,800
the day you and Keaw are to be escorted.

292
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,200
We shall travel together.

293
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,640
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your decision is understood and respected.

294
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,120
Thongkam,

295
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,760
do not decorate the convoy
with the royal insignia.

296
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,760
Just arrange it as you would
for an ordinary person.

297
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

298
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,440
I prefer not to make a fuss.

299
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,440
Just ordinary boats
and not too many people.

300
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,160
Just enough to handle the boats.

301
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

302
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,000
My primary objective

303
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,960
is to survey the route
along Khok Kham Canal,

304
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,760
excavated under my father's command.

305
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,320
The traces of the excavation
are no longer visible.

306
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,720
Never mind.

307
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,360
I am considering another excavation.

308
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,120
I plan to invite Prince Bhorn to join me.

309
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,320
By the way, Rid.

310
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,120
I would like Pudtarn to join us.

311
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,960
In what…

312
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,120
In what capacity?

313
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,000
To prepare the food.

314
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,920
So Bhorn can enjoy something delicious.

315
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,400
I understand, Your Majesty.

316
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,520
She is an exceptional cook.

317
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,480
I am starting to wish
to have her cook for me regularly.

318
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,080
Do you suppose a stubborn person like her

319
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,040
would be willing
to serve me in the palace?

320
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
Here is your medicine, Khun Pi.

321
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,520
I am feeling much better.

322
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,680
I truly appreciate you coming to visit.

323
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,000
I brought your grandchild to see you.

324
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,760
Pay your respects to your grandfather.

325
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,120
Has Duean arrived?

326
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,520
She just got here.

327
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,160
It's a shame that
Duean will not attend Keaw's wedding.

328
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,400
It is more unfortunate for you
than it is for her, Ruang.

329
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,680
You will not attend
your own sister's wedding.

330
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,040
I find it acceptable.

331
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,240
With Rid there,

332
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,200
it's much like having Ruang there.

333
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,080
You always know
the right thing to say, Riem.

334
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,160
Keaw must be super pretty.

335
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,360
What pretty?

336
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,840
Super pretty.

337
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,400
Pudtarn, hurry.

338
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,120
Come with me.

339
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,040
Thank you.

340
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,360
Thank you.

341
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,040
Thank you.

342
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,600
Welcome.

343
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,200
Come on.

344
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,440
Come. Choi, hurry.

345
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,800
More, please!

346
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,200
Yes, sprinkle my whole body!

347
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,120
Over here, please!

348
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,240
When will I have
the opportunity to marry, Ruang?

349
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,600
You will be scolded

350
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,200
if the adults hear you say that.

351
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,400
There are no adults here.

352
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,160
I am here. I am an adult.

353
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,200
That is true.

354
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,760
Looking closely,

355
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,200
I can see that you are quite old.

356
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,960
Then do not look closely,

357
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,400
so I would not seem so old.

358
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,000
Whether I look closely or not,

359
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,640
I could not see you as any younger.

360
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,000
Rid, on the other hand,
is more like a young person.

361
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,520
I do not fault you for that.

362
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,640
It is the truth.

363
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,160
After the wedding,
there is the sending-off, is that right?

364
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,400
I truly wish to see it.
How is the sending-off done?

365
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,240
The elders are responsible
for preparing the bedding.

366
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,920
These are people
who have been married for some time,

367
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,920
who do not argue,

368
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,320
and have raised many children together.

369
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,160
I presume my father and mother
are doing it.

370
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,640
And the sending-off?

371
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,520
Who performs the sending-off?

372
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,720
I entrust her to your care.

373
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,760
Please look after her well.

374
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,240
Yes, my lady.

375
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,320
So the baron asked me to inform you that

376
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,480
you should prepare for a journey
to Pribpree with him in two days.

377
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,760
To where?

378
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,280
Pribpree.

379
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,880
To escort Lady Keaw and Earl Ming.

380
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,880
He mentioned that

381
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
King Phet and Prince Bhorn
shall also be present

382
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,280
and need a cook on the journey.

383
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,800
What? King Phet again?

384
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,880
Prince Bhorn as well? Who is that?

385
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,560
Can I say no?

386
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,600
Well…

387
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,760
I am afraid that
it would not be advisable.

388
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,600
It appears you shall be required to cook
for the journey there and back.

389
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,120
Gosh.

390
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,680
Why don't they hire a professional?

391
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,520
I'm only good at making simple dishes.

392
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,480
It's a decent way to make money,

393
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,560
but traveling with King Phet,
I might have a heart attack.

394
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,040
It would stress me out.

395
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
Why isn't the baron here
to tell me himself?

396
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,320
Marquess Kosathibodi has administrative
tasks that require the baron's assistance.

397
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,160
So he is currently

398
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,320
at Marquess Kosathibodi's residence.

399
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,880
I see.

400
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,600
He's helping out his future father-in-law.

401
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,560
Indeed.

402
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,120
Choi.

403
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,520
Did you clear your throat?

404
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,960
I did not.

405
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,920
No one cleared their throat
or made a sound.

406
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,440
I guess I was hearing things.

407
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,280
All right.

408
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,880
You can tell Baron Rid
that I accept the job.

409
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,440
I will come up
with tasty dishes for them to try.

410
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,720
By the way,

411
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,720
did no one really clear their throat?

412
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,440
No, miss.

413
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,520
It is a grave matter.

414
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,120
I hope that

415
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,280
you can mend these fragments of sins.

416
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,560
At this time,

417
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,160
no one can help you

418
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,840
but yourself.

419
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,560
May you refrain
from creating any more bad karma.

420
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,440
Atitaya, my child.

421
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,200
Come.

422
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,720
Keaw, my beloved granddaughter,

423
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,680
you are now wed.

424
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,040
You are now considered an adult.

425
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,840
Remember my teachings.

426
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,280
Yes, Grandmother.

427
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,280
Be a good wife to your husband.

428
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,120
And may your husband
be equally good to you.

429
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,520
May you both live together in goodness.

430
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,320
As a husband and wife,
may you both live by shared virtues.

431
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,880
Do not cry.

432
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,600
Do not cry.

433
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,640
KHOK KHAM CANAL (SAKHON BURI)

434
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,920
KHOK KHAM CANAL (SAKHON BURI)

435
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,320
Khok Kham Canal…

436
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,360
It should be named something like
the Winding Canal.

437
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,280
Bhorn, my brother.

438
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,240
Once I've dealt with all the chaos
in the royal court,

439
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,120
I shall have the canal excavated
to cut across, creating a straight route.

440
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,880
Traveling along it leads to delays
due to the winding nature of the canal.

441
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,160
Here at the Khok Kham Canal,

442
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,480
Father brought Westerners
to survey the area

443
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,080
from the mouth

444
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,600
to the far end.

445
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,080
Indeed.

446
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,400
If he were to know,
it would bring him great joy

447
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,920
that you have thought
of completing the route excavation.

448
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,920
Excavating a more direct route
along the canal

449
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,200
is not merely for the sake
of my personal convenience.

450
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,200
The winding canal tends to deposit mud
that scours the land,

451
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,200
particularly when the water level is low,
making it hard for my subjects to travel.

452
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,560
If this action proves beneficial
for my subjects,

453
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,000
I believe it should be undertaken.

454
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,240
What our father once instructed

455
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,280
shall be followed through.

456
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,680
That is wonderful.

457
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,600
It is fortunate for the people.

458
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,960
It is well past lunchtime.

459
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,920
Shall we eat?

460
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,360
Yes.

461
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,080
Thongkam.

462
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

463
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,600
Rid and Pudtarn must have finished
preparing the meal by now.

464
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,280
Not yet, Your Majesty.

465
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,840
Not yet, my lord.

466
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,520
Good.

467
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,680
Rid has transformed into a cook.

468
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,920
Shrimp paste chili sauce.

469
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,640
Steamed mackerel mixed with rice

470
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,320
accompanied by crispy fried pork rind.

471
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,480
This dish

472
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:27,120
is chicken marinated in soy sauce
with a blend of garlic, pepper, and honey,

473
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,040
wrapped in a lotus leaf to infuse aroma,

474
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,920
and then piled up in hay for heating.

475
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,080
A mixture of soil and sea salt
was plastered over the lotus leaf

476
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,240
before baking it in embers.

477
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,920
It smells amazing.

478
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,120
On a journey this long,

479
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,600
having roast chicken
like this is super appetizing.

480
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,920
Too bad there aren't mountains
blowing up or sheds catching fire

481
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,760
or this would be
an even more thrilling scene.

482
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,000
Please enjoy.

483
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,480
How is it?

484
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,360
The name Bhorn is similar to Phet.

485
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,200
He must be another member
of the royal family, right?

486
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,520
-Yes.
-Who is he?

487
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,160
The brother of the king.

488
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,680
The king's brother?

489
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,040
Yes.

490
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,200
Are you here
to supervise a worker like me?

491
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,560
Why not go over to that boat?

492
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,480
Auntie Karaked is waiting to eat with you.

493
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,960
Someone appears to be in a bad mood here.

494
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,600
If I leave her alone with the servants,

495
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,160
I fear the meals might not be delicious

496
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,320
all the way from Ayutthaya

497
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,600
to Pribpree.

498
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,240
Not in a good mood?

499
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,160
Yes.

500
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,680
I doubt anyone is in a better mood
than Lady Praejeen.

501
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,560
What does Lady Praejeen
have to do with us?

502
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,760
She didn't come with us.

503
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,960
Her body didn't, but her heart did.

504
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,720
I see.

505
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,600
Listen, I visited Kosathibodi's
residence for work.

506
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,160
It was not to see a woman.

507
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,800
Do not be upset.

508
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,640
I can no longer look at any other woman.

509
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,440
In my heart, there is only…

510
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,800
this woman with a frown on her face.

511
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,160
On Keaw's wedding day,

512
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,280
Lady Praejeen told me that

513
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,600
Lady Champa requested the Queen Mother

514
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,400
to ask the king to bestow you a wife

515
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,480
and that wife is Lady Praejeen.

516
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,160
Praejeen made a point of telling me.

517
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,080
You can't possibly cancel the wedding.

518
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,720
As far as I know,

519
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,760
no one can defy a royal command.

520
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,400
That is my concern.

521
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,240
You just need to wait and see.

522
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,240
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

523
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,560
Sure.

524
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,400
Sorry.

525
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,520
Sorry?

526
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,040
Why must you say sorry?

527
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,720
By the way, who is the Queen Mother?

528
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,160
She sounds like
she must be very influential.

529
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,160
The Queen Mother, Krom Phra Thephamat,

530
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,400
or simply known by the people

531
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,760
as the king's grandmother.

532
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,400
Gosh, she used
some high-level connections.

533
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,400
If you are so possessive of me,

534
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,680
do not go far away.

535
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,240
Whatever you are possessive of,

536
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,600
do not let it out of your sight.

537
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,040
Just as I am doing with you.

538
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,640
Do not leave.

539
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,760
Has that

540
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,280
changed your mind at all?

541
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,080
Eight months.

542
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,840
Wait eight months.

543
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,200
I found it peculiar

544
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,720
that you needed to hire an outside cook.

545
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,200
I now understand
the exceptional quality of her cooking.

546
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,480
That is why the meal also looked
quite unique and delicious.

547
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,080
It is a pity
your son, Narenthon, could not join us.

548
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,640
The roast chicken was so aromatic
that it made the mouth water.

549
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,800
My nephew, Narenthon,
would have enjoyed it.

550
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,720
The meal tasted absolutely delightful.

551
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,000
Do you agree, Bhorn?

552
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,880
We nearly ate our hands along with it.

553
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,280
The food tasted exquisite.

554
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,680
This woman is quite peculiar.

555
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,840
Aside from her culinary skills,
she is remarkably brave.

556
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,800
The way she thinks and speaks
sets her apart from other women.

557
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,520
The only comparable woman

558
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,240
is Lady Karaked.

559
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,680
They bear a striking resemblance.

560
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:19,840
Yes.

561
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,400
She is said to be the lady's
distant relative from Song Kwae.

562
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,800
Distant relative?

563
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,400
That is hard to believe, Phet.

564
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,520
When we return,
I shall bring her into the palace.

565
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,720
This way, she can cook for me every day.

566
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:04,320
PRIBPREE (PHETCHABURI)

567
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,240
We are officials from
the Administrative Department.

568
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,280
We welcome you, Marquess.

569
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,760
This is Lady Karaked.

570
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:31,000
And these are Keaw and Prang,
my two daughters.

571
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,520
Keaw is the one who shall reside here.

572
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,720
I see.

573
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,040
Our wives are waiting to welcome you.

574
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,120
I am grateful.

575
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,440
You have been granted
the title of Earl Surinthararuchai

576
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,760
and assigned to be
Pribpree's deputy governor.

577
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,280
You are his wife.

578
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,840
Why would you show such veneration
to officials under his command?

579
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,720
Keaw has no position.

580
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,240
Though she is the deputy governor's wife,
she is still very young.

581
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,000
Showing respect to her elders
is appropriate.

582
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,480
Subsequently, we shall escort you
to meet the governor,

583
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,200
who is waiting at his residence.

584
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,480
We have our elders with us.
We must attend to them first.

585
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,880
However,
please do not concern yourself about me.

586
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,600
The governor is well aware

587
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,880
that I must prioritize
the care of my elders.

588
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,720
He shall likely understand.

589
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,680
Tomorrow, I shall pay him a visit.

590
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,000
Oh, my.

591
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,520
-Did you bring this?
-Yes, my lady.

592
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,280
The king will visit Somdej Tangmo.

593
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,200
Somdej Tangmo?

594
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,400
He was the teacher of the Tiger King.

595
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,240
He also tutored
both the king and the prince.

596
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,960
Do I need to come with you, Ming?

597
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,360
Yes.

598
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,160
I have no desire to be apart from you.

599
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,960
That's too much. Too much.

600
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,160
You speak strangely, Keaw.

601
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,760
I am not familiar with it at all.

602
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,440
This is how I speak with my family.

603
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,080
From now on,
you must try to get used to it.

604
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,160
Get used to it?

605
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,040
Because you are now part of my family.

606
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,720
Very well.

607
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,280
Do not do this.

608
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,160
We should be ashamed
of spirits and angels.

609
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,760
I am not.

610
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,160
Ming.

611
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,400
You may be if you wish.

612
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,720
I am not.

613
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,720
In matters of love,
there is no need for shame.

614
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,880
That's such a cool motto.

615
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,600
Ming.

616
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,320
-Lady Prang, please wait!
-Keaw!

617
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,360
What did Ming say that was so amusing?

618
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,280
You were laughing so loud
I heard it outside.

619
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,520
-Ming said that--
-Do not tell her.

620
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,920
Prang would tell everyone.

621
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,640
Of course.

622
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,920
Keaw, is Ming trying to seduce you?

623
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,920
Prang,

624
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,840
try keeping your mouth closed for once.

625
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,600
It is tightly closed now.

626
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,720
Dear me.

627
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,360
Goodness, Prang.

628
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,280
My head hurts.

629
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,440
By the way, where are you two headed?

630
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,760
We plan to pay our respects
to Somdej Tangmo.

631
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,280
Which temple does he reside at, Ming?

632
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,960
Noi Pak Tai Temple.

633
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,600
What are your thoughts, my lady?

634
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,440
It appears unfavorable, my dame.

635
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,560
What shall we do?

636
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,600
Send someone to inform the king.

637
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,440
That is my opinion.

638
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,440
Your mother and I must accompany
the king back to Phra Nakorn.

639
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,920
Ming, did you tell her?

640
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,640
Yes, I did.

641
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,480
I told her that the Queen Mother's health
is not favorable.

642
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,040
Keaw,

643
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,560
while living here,

644
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,440
you must take good care of yourself,
your house,

645
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,800
and your family.

646
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,000
Yes, Mother.

647
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,040
If you ever feel dissatisfied

648
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,320
or distressed,

649
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,240
have someone send a letter to inform us.

650
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,200
Although you have started your own family,

651
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,120
you are still our daughter.

652
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,480
You are also Rid and Ruang's
younger sister

653
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,240
and Prang's elder sister.

654
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,160
No matter what happens,

655
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,440
you shall always have a family

656
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,640
you can rely on for the rest of your life.

657
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,920
Yes, Father.

658
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,000
Or if you ever feel overjoyed
and wish to share it,

659
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,800
you can write that in a letter to me.

660
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,720
Yes, Mother.

661
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,800
Did I say something wrong?

662
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,040
Don't roll your eyes. I know.

663
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,400
I did not roll my eyes.

664
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,560
There is nothing up there
for me to roll my eyes to see.

665
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,720
Mother,

666
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,160
does Father not know

667
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,560
that rolling one's eyes means
you're fed up with something?

668
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:28,720
I see.

669
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,600
I did not know.

670
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,120
I truly did not.

671
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,520
Is that true?

672
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,760
Yes.

673
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,920
Otherwise, would I dare roll my eyes?

674
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,840
Ming is all confused now, Khun Pi.

675
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:52,800
I shall be familiar with it soon, my lady.

676
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,240
How can you still address me as that?

677
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,800
Address me as Mother.

678
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,120
Please address her as Mother.

679
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,240
Yes, Mother.

680
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,120
My gosh,

681
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,520
you are already obeying her, Ming.

682
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,560
I must start now, Prang.

683
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,880
Prang,

684
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,880
I can no longer laugh.

685
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,720
I can see.

686
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,960
Cry if you need to, Keaw.

687
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,880
I can no longer laugh either.

688
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,240
I wish to get married,

689
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,400
but I also do not wish to be married.

690
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,800
You did not hear it wrong.

691
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,720
I wish to participate
in the wedding ceremony

692
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,600
and to be dressed beautifully.

693
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,840
But…

694
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,960
But I do not wish to be anyone's wife.

695
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,680
In any case,

696
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,680
one day, you must be.

697
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:03,120
One day is not today.

698
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,560
Riem, you speak in a roundabout manner,

699
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,240
not becoming of a woman.

700
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,600
Perhaps we should have Pudtarn sit here

701
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,680
and tell you that

702
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,440
men and women are not different.

703
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,440
We are all human.

704
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,000
If anyone says that
women are low and men are high,

705
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,960
we'll see about that.

706
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,160
For that reason,

707
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,040
no one leads

708
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,360
and no one follows.

709
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,240
Is that also from Pudtarn?

710
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:35,520
Indeed. Pudtarn is my idol.

711
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,120
I can even sing a song about this.

712
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,080
Idol?

713
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,920
Yes.

714
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,240
Idol.

715
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,560
What is it, an idol?

716
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,040
I am rather uncertain.

717
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,760
I suppose it means something
like a good example.

718
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,840
Why not say that instead?

719
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,720
Why say "idol"?

720
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:01,360
You seem to know about many things.

721
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,600
Why do you not know what an idol is?

722
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,680
I suppose my mother has not taught me.

723
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:15,760
Okay. Consider this as me teaching you.

724
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,840
Do you miss Pudtarn, Riem?

725
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,560
I miss her greatly.

726
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:40,120
I wonder if she has returned
from Pribpree yet.

727
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,080
Baron.

728
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,720
Baron.

729
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,040
What did you ask me about?

730
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,320
What?

731
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,360
I asked you loudly. Didn't you hear me?

732
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,840
I apologize.

733
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,840
What is troubling you?

734
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,520
Could you tell me?

735
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,560
I am about to tell you now.

736
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,960
The king

737
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,560
would like you to serve him.

738
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,320
Serve him?

739
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,319
As a cook?

740
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,439
No.

741
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,800
No?

742
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,560
Then serve him as what?

743
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,520
As a concubine.

744
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,439
A concubine?

745
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:34,000
Does it mean
something like making a contribution?

746
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:36,399
No.

747
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,439
I'm waiting to hear.

748
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:47,040
Being a concubine means

749
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,560
you serve him

750
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,640
as a wife.

751
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:58,640
A wife?

752
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,080
Is he insane?

753
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,439
No way.

754
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,399
Please, wait.

755
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:18,960
Stop, that's enough.
I don't want to hear anymore.

756
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,000
I'm going home.

757
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,560
Going home? It is that way.

758
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,520
Not this home, my home.

759
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,120
My home in Bangkok.
I don't want to stay here anymore.

760
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,920
This is beyond ridiculous!

761
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,080
Do people here think
they can just pick and choose a wife?

762
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,040
I'm a free person.

763
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,479
Free person?

764
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,479
I am independent, not anyone's servant.

765
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,120
Did you expect me to just accept it?
Dream on.

766
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,439
Don't talk to me anymore.

767
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,200
I will go home.

768
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,399
Your home is that way.

769
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,720
You don't need to tell me. It's my house.

770
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,160
Pudtarn.

771
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,640
What will you do, Pudtarn?

772
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,560
No one in this land

773
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:18,280
may defy the king's command.

774
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,000
Every problem has a solution.

775
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,560
Please be my wife.

776
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,360
I will be your wife.

777
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:28,160
You must kick all 20 of your wives
out of your house.

778
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,840
People are bored of the stew.

779
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,640
I'm going to cook something new.

780
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:37,160
He will become my son-in-law.

781
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,760
The king has ordered it.

782
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,640
Perhaps he sent Baron Maharit
to see the ins and outs.

783
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,640
Silver barbs belong to the people.

784
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,080
-They do not belong to the king alone.
-That's right.

785
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,480
Can't you sell it?

786
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,400
No.

787
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,320
He has gone mad.

788
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,240
I'm going to Pudtarn's house.

789
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:36,360
