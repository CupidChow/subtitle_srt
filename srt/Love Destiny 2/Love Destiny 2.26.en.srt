1
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,040
I shall anoint you.

2
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,560
Consider it me marrying you two, Rid.

3
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,760
Pudtarn.

4
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,240
I will begin preparations
for your wedding.

5
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,800
I will tell your father

6
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,720
to arrange the wedding within the year.

7
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,400
If I cannot go back on my word

8
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,960
and you have no intention of objecting
or officially challenging it,

9
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,920
then the other party
must withdraw willingly.

10
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,160
There is no way they would.

11
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,720
You must create a way then.

12
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,760
If we can procure enough rice
to sell to them,

13
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,920
up to three million buckets,
the Emperor will waive the taxes on it.

14
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,280
Keep your voice down.

15
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,080
Regarding the Emperor's tax exemption,
do not let anyone know.

16
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,120
Choi has yet to come to fetch you.

17
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,000
Why are you leaving now?

18
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,960
This plant, may I have it?

19
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,840
You may.

20
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,320
Give that plant to the viscount.

21
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,960
Yes, my lady.

22
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,120
Where will you plant it?

23
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,560
At your residence?

24
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,200
Well…

25
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,800
I shall give it to someone
who shares their name with this plant.

26
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,600
Name?

27
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,120
This is a pudtarn tree.

28
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,080
His Majesty has bestowed you upon him.

29
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,560
You will be superior to his other wives.
Remember this.

30
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,440
Hey, it's a pudtarn.

31
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,320
That's right.

32
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,080
I got it
from the Marquess Kosathibodi's residence

33
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,880
for you.

34
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,360
I just thought
it had the same name as you.

35
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,280
Did you really go there
just to ask for it?

36
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,800
Are you sure
you didn't visit your side chick?

37
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,760
Side chick?

38
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Yes, side chick.

39
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Someone who is more than a friend,
but not a lover.

40
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,040
A sister.

41
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,400
Someone who is more than a friend
but not a lover.

42
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,400
That's called a sister.

43
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,720
Fine, I believe you.

44
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,600
The flowers of the pudtarn tree
are strange.

45
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,880
They change color three times per day.

46
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,040
They are strange, just like you.

47
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,800
You know nothing.

48
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,760
It's teaching us a life lesson.

49
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,760
The changing colors of the pudtarn flowers

50
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,320
tell us that

51
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,440
everything in the world can change.

52
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,240
It's also saying that life is like this.

53
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,680
We come into existence, prevail,
and then perish.

54
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,920
My love…

55
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,840
came into existence,

56
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,800
is prevailing,

57
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,920
and…

58
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,360
will never perish.

59
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,200
The same goes for mine.

60
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,600
Even if I can't marry you
and be your wife,

61
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,480
I will love you…

62
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,720
forever.

63
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,800
I promise.

64
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,880
You cannot marry me?

65
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,360
Everything in this world can change.

66
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,680
Remember this.

67
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,840
What is the important matter
you wanted to talk to me about?

68
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm grateful to you
for agreeing to see me.

69
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,440
Of course.

70
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,600
Just say it, Rid.

71
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,040
You are to be my son-in-law.

72
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,680
You shall take care of my daughter,
so of course I'll listen to you.

73
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,480
Also,

74
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,679
you are a decent and talented man.

75
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,039
I'd be glad to give Praejeen to you

76
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,799
without the king's command.

77
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,880
What I wish to speak about,

78
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,919
with respect, Marquess,

79
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,000
concerns what I have discovered
and observed.

80
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,080
Why do you speak of this?

81
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,080
You're acting as if you don't know

82
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,840
that this is our tradition.

83
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,840
It is how it has been done
for generations.

84
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,880
I know it's our tradition.

85
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,000
I also know that…

86
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,160
What?

87
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,960
Why hold your tongue? Just say it.

88
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,960
I also know…

89
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,440
that some people
wouldn't have to work so hard

90
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,920
and would have a better life

91
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,640
if officials were less corrupt

92
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,120
and were considerate of them.

93
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,800
But since this isn't the case,

94
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,840
then I'm afraid
I can no longer work with you.

95
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,200
I will ask His Majesty
to transfer me to my previous post.

96
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,640
He is a grave threat.

97
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,760
I cannot allow you to marry him.

98
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,760
A threat to whom?

99
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,520
I have never seen him harm anyone.

100
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,120
Who is he a threat to, Father?

101
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,080
Don't ask.

102
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,560
You do not need to know.

103
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,600
All you need to know is that
he is a threat.

104
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,560
Slowly, my lady.

105
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,240
I'm sorry, Rid.

106
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,880
Please forgive me.

107
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,480
Everything in this world…

108
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,360
can change.

109
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,560
Yes.

110
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,320
Change is inevitable.

111
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,080
My lady.

112
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,280
My lady, it's time for your medicine.

113
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,320
My lady, it's time for your medicine.

114
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,360
My lady.

115
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,720
My lady.

116
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,960
My lady, it's time for your medicine.

117
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,960
My lady.

118
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,720
My lady.

119
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,800
My lady.

120
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,360
My lady, please get up
and take your medicine.

121
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,560
Grandmother.

122
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,600
Rid, Marquess Kosathibodi
has requested Praejeen back.

123
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,080
So the problem of your love triangle
has been solved, has it not?

124
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,640
Is there anything else I can do for you?

125
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,760
Your kindness knows no bounds,
Your Majesty.

126
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,280
I have no more requests.

127
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,720
All right.

128
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,119
Let's move on to In.

129
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,040
Rid.

130
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,440
What do you call it again?

131
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,440
Pudtarn calls it…

132
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,080
being crazy in love, Your Majesty.

133
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,200
Right.

134
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,360
I have never heard of this before.

135
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,560
Thongkam.

136
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,160
Were you ever crazy in love
with your wife?

137
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,080
I was for the first few days,
Your Majesty.

138
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,640
It has been a few years now,
so not any longer.

139
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,880
Who is your eldest son?

140
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,640
He is Thongdee, Your Majesty.

141
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,040
How old is he now?

142
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,840
He's 20 years old, Your Majesty.

143
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,120
I see.

144
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,880
He shall work with us.

145
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,240
He seems like a good man.

146
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

147
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,920
As for you, Rid.

148
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,680
You gained one and lost one.

149
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,640
You lost your grandmother,
but you got a wife.

150
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

151
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,600
I believe Pudtarn
will no longer object to marrying you.

152
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,840
Your eyes are all puffy from crying.

153
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,360
You should stop, my dear.

154
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,480
I was about to marry Rid.

155
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,200
Why did things turn out this way, Mother?

156
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,840
Let bygones be bygones, dear.

157
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,040
You won't get Rid back,
no matter how much you cry.

158
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,720
You know I love him.

159
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,000
Why didn't you object to Father?

160
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,600
I wasn't aware of it.

161
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,280
He informed me
after he had made the request to the king.

162
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,880
I want to die, Mother.

163
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,280
My poor child.

164
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,960
Rid is getting married today.

165
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,880
I should be his bride.

166
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,240
I'm supposed to be with him.

167
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,640
I'm supposed to be there.

168
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,240
This necklace represents my parents.

169
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,320
It represents the bond
between you and me, my lord,

170
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,960
-because--
-Khun Pi.

171
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,320
Yes, Khun Pi.

172
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,760
It represents the bond
between you and me, Khun Pi.

173
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,800
If you hadn't returned it to me,

174
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,400
it would have been lost
from my life forever.

175
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,920
You two may be

176
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,560
the parents of that girl named Pudtarn,

177
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,760
but the fact that
I have had the chance to live in this body

178
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,920
indicates that we were once bonded
in a past life.

179
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,680
That's why I feel that you two

180
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,400
are my real parents.

181
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,440
Do you know

182
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,800
how long I have been waiting for this day?

183
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,040
I have waited so long.

184
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,520
It has been terribly long.

185
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,040
Many lifetimes.

186
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,840
You told me once that…

187
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,400
you would cook something for me.

188
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,400
Did you mean something that is

189
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,040
spicy,

190
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,200
delectable,

191
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,680
and

192
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,200
requires some pounding?

193
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,520
My lord, you want to eat…

194
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,720
What?

195
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,720
Khun Pi.

196
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,480
Khun Pi.

197
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,440
From now on,
there will be no more Lord Rid.

198
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,560
There will only be Khun Pi.

199
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,760
This is the last time
I shall tell you this.

200
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,760
My lord.

201
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Khun Pi.

202
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,760
Khun Pi.

203
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,240
Khun Pi.

204
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,880
Do you want to eat now?

205
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,800
We are about to spend
our first night together.

206
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,600
It's not the time to eat.

207
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,760
I'm going to eat

208
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,280
right now.

209
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,080
Into the mortar enters

210
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,000
The pestle

211
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,720
As it mixes and pounds

212
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,720
The ingredients…

213
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,040
Garlic, chilis

214
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,480
And shrimp paste combine

215
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,200
And fuses with the mango

216
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:19,400
As it pounds

217
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,640
Rid, I don't mind Pudtarn selling food,

218
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,680
as I see she loves making a living,

219
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,920
but she should do it moderately.

220
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,800
Yes, Mother.

221
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,640
What?

222
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,080
Hey, Choi.

223
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,200
Yes, my lady.

224
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,080
What is she selling today?

225
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,280
Boat noodles, my lady.

226
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,520
My gosh, boat noodles?

227
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,040
I want some.

228
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,960
Didn't you say
you don't want her to sell food?

229
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,640
Hey, it's boat noodles. She must sell it.

230
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,840
It's a specialty in Ayutthaya,
Pin and Yaem.

231
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,400
I want some. It's the bomb.

232
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,520
My gosh.

233
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,680
My dear customers,

234
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,160
please taste our delicious boat noodles.

235
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,360
Please wait a minute.
It will be worth the wait.

236
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,160
Here you go, ma'am.

237
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,240
Here you go.

238
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,400
Please come and try
our delicious boat noodles.

239
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,600
It's fresh, safe, and toxin-free.

240
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,560
Yes, my lord.

241
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,200
One bowl of noodles, please.

242
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,800
What noodles would you like?

243
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,920
Thin rice noodles, wide rice noodles,
vermicelli, or egg noodles?

244
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,080
Wide rice noodles.

245
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,840
I would like thin rice noodles.

246
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,440
Act normal.

247
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,320
If you don't,

248
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,960
you may not trade.

249
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,120
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

250
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,680
Please wait a minute, my lord.

251
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,560
What would you like, sir?

252
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,840
This guy is good-looking.

253
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,800
Whose son is he?

254
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,280
I don't know, my lord.

255
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,120
What are you selling, my lady?

256
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,280
Noodle soup.

257
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,400
What noodles do you want?

258
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,080
I don't like noodles.

259
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,200
Can I have a bowl without noodles, please?

260
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,200
That's called gao lao.

261
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,880
So fragrant

262
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,240
and appealing.

263
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,680
That's flirting.

264
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,520
He's flirting with Pudtarn.

265
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,880
He's quite bold.

266
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,960
If Rid were here, he wouldn't spare him.

267
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,040
Even I didn't get her.

268
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,840
Who do you think he is?

269
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,080
And who are you?

270
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,360
If you are going to fight,
then please go over there,

271
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,720
my dear customers.

272
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,960
I'm fine with her selling noodles,
but she must stop everything else.

273
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,920
If she spends all her time making food,
will she ever make any babies?

274
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,840
Aren't you pleased
that she is hardworking?

275
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,720
Well, I want grandchildren.

276
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,520
I see.

277
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,360
You will have to tell Lord Rid this then.

278
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,600
It's not Miss Pudtarn
you should be concerned about.

279
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,800
Tell Lord Rid that if he works too much,

280
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,440
he won't be able

281
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,240
-to raise the flag.
-To raise the flag.

282
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,520
No way.

283
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,440
My son has no problem in that department.
Just wait and see.

284
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,760
My goodness.

285
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,040
Yaem.

286
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,680
Sit still.

287
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,960
Why is she so quiet?

288
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,000
You're right.

289
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,560
Our lady was loud
when delivering our lords and ladies.

290
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,880
Yes.

291
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,200
Do you want to try being in labor?

292
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,400
They are just wondering
why Pudtarn is so quiet.

293
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,440
Prik, I hope she doesn't--

294
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,640
-Hey.
-Goodness!

295
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,880
-For god's sake.
-I haven't said a single word.

296
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,400
I know you were going to say
something inauspicious.

297
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,360
-I'm going to hit you.
-My goodness.

298
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,120
I'm sorry, my lord.

299
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,720
I'm sorry, my lord.

300
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,200
She's so quiet.

301
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,160
-Mother, why--
-Just wait a little longer.

302
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,440
But she should at least make some noise.

303
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,040
I shall wait no more.

304
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,240
Rid.

305
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,000
-It's a…
-It's a…

306
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,000
-It's a…
-It's a…

307
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,440
-It's a…
-It's a…

308
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,360
-Say it or we'll hit you.
-Say it or we'll hit you.

309
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,920
It's a boy!

310
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,880
-My gosh!
-What? Eung, do I have a son?

311
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,400
Mother, it's a boy.

312
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,440
I heard it. I'm not deaf.

313
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,679
I have a name for him.

314
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,560
He shall be called Phat.

315
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,040
Phat.

316
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,199
Go and tell my husband
that his grandson has been born.

317
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:21,000
Hey, Rid, hurry and make another.
You can't have just one.

318
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,199
Pudtarn told me she would only have one.

319
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,000
Don't let that happen. Do you understand?

320
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,760
Yes, Mother.

321
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,480
It's a boy.

322
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,639
It's a boy.

323
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,960
-It's a boy.
-It's a boy.

324
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
-A boy.
-What?

325
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,120
It's a boy, right?

326
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,880
Here is mine.

327
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,199
That's a lot.

328
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,320
A boy.

329
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,520
It's short.

330
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,880
Lord In.

331
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,280
It's a boy, my lord.

332
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,400
There's no need to be sad, Pong.

333
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,040
Look at our daughter.

334
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,480
Yes?

335
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,360
She's prettier than any other woman
in Ayutthaya.

336
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,760
A beautiful flower
shall be visited by a bee soon.

337
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,200
Greetings, my lord.

338
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,320
My lady.

339
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,520
This is Wake.

340
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,360
He took up a post at the treasury
just today.

341
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,880
Have a seat.

342
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,480
Praejeen.

343
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,200
Come here for a second, my dear.

344
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,240
What?

345
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,160
Praejeen.

346
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,920
Praejeen.

347
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,960
Khun Pi.

348
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,480
Her heart is devoted to Rid.

349
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,320
Please be considerate.

350
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,400
I am being considerate.

351
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,440
That's why I brought him here.

352
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,240
Congratulations, Mali,

353
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,160
for having been granted the title
of Thao Thong Kip Ma.

354
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,120
Thank you so much, Karaked.

355
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,320
I was already fulfilled
through serving as a courtier

356
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,480
in the royal kitchen.

357
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,240
The title was beyond my expectations.

358
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,400
That's because you worked hard
and served His Majesty with honesty.

359
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,440
You started out as a royal kitchen hand

360
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,840
and have worked your way to the top,
overseeing hundreds of people.

361
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,560
His Majesty recognized your hard work
and decided to reward you.

362
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,960
I often think of their kindness.

363
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,880
Both of them,

364
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,480
King Phetracha,
who allowed me to become a civil servant,

365
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,120
and King Tai Sra,
who has granted me the title.

366
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,760
Now, let's wait and see

367
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,360
if the request you submitted
to King Louis XIV

368
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,760
requesting dividend payments

369
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,040
from the French companies
your husband invested in will be granted.

370
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,080
I think it will.

371
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,160
I don't think
the king of France will cheat you.

372
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,680
Be patient.

373
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,760
I have enough to live on.

374
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,960
I don't wish for great fortune.

375
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,560
Father.

376
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,360
Phin, what is it, dear?

377
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,840
Auntie Keaw and Auntie Prang are here.

378
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,960
Here they are.

379
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,720
Greet them, dear.

380
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,880
-Good boys.
-Hello.

381
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,320
How have you been?

382
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,520
Keaw.

383
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,840
Prang.

384
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,440
Yok, my dear.

385
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,920
Rid.

386
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,560
Mother, your baked goods are ready.

387
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
Shall we have them over there?

388
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,240
Go.

389
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,440
-Take them there.
-Go.

390
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,440
It's time for your medicine.

391
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,400
What is the matter?

392
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,720
I don't know.

393
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,840
I have a bad feeling.

394
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,760
I feel sad.

395
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,440
I feel very sad.

396
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,280
Malaria…

397
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,120
is difficult to treat.

398
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,080
Do not worry

399
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,880
that people will say
you didn't care for your husband well

400
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,560
and that you caused his death.

401
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,720
Take Ruang's ashes to Ayutthaya.

402
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,760
Hand them

403
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,720
to his father and mother yourself.

404
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,680
Yes.

405
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,160
Take Boonruang with you, dear.

406
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,600
Fai and two more servants
are ready to escort you.

407
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,920
Yes.

408
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,040
What's wrong?

409
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,960
Rid,

410
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,760
Ruang has passed away.

411
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,040
He died of malaria.
I didn't take care of him well.

412
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,560
Choi.

413
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,600
Lord Ruang.

414
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,640
I know.

415
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,080
It's not true, is it, Prik?

416
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,120
He has gone to heaven.

417
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,600
This isn't true, is it?

418
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,640
My dear lord.

419
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,840
Don't wallow in grief, my dear Karaked.

420
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,480
I feel like my heart has been torn apart,
Khun Pi.

421
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:47,760
Birth, old age, sickness, and death
are normal.

422
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,520
I never thought…

423
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,200
our son would die before us.

424
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,120
If Little Ruang weren't in Phitsanulok…

425
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,480
I would have been with him…

426
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,320
before he passed away.

427
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,360
Ten years ago…

428
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,120
when the Krishna Kali Manuscript
let out a golden light,

429
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,560
I read your fortune and found that…

430
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,760
you would retrieve something you loved,

431
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,400
but would lose something else you loved.

432
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,040
At first, I thought that…

433
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,920
you would have to part with me

434
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,200
and go back to the life you lived before.

435
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,040
I got back Pudtarn,

436
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,400
who must be the real Karaked, my sister.

437
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,680
But it is at the expense
of Little Ruang, is it not?

438
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,080
In a person's life,

439
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,080
there are things you gain

440
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,680
and things you lose.

441
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,680
This is inevitable, my dear.

442
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,080
Even though I know

443
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,920
that the departures
of Lady Champa and Little Ruang…

444
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:49,040
are not permanent,
as we will meet each other in the future,

445
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,800
I can't help but feel saddened.

446
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,160
That's normal.

447
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,880
If we are destined to be with each other,

448
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,040
our destiny will bring all of us

449
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,360
who have a shared bond

450
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,880
back together in no time.

451
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,200
Kids.

452
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,440
Grandmother.

453
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,520
No, I'm your great-great-grandmother.

454
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,240
I'm the great-great-grandmother
of you all.

455
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,040
-Great-great-Grandmother.
-Great-great-Grandmother.

456
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,040
Take care
of my great-great-grandchildren well.

457
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,640
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

458
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,040
Grandma.

459
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,760
Grandma.

460
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,880
My dear Ket.

461
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,600
What about Mom? Didn't she come with you?

462
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,600
She is now living a peaceful life

463
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,760
practicing dharma.

464
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,360
I have something to say to Dech.

465
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:33,640
Ayutthaya was once
a prosperous and heavenly city,

466
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,840
but when the time
of its collapse approached,

467
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,160
even heaven

468
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,600
could not prevent such an occurrence.

469
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,600
Change is inevitable.

470
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:48,120
Be aware of and accept this truth.

471
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,320
Khun Pi.

472
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,960
Does Ayutthaya collapse, Karaked?

473
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,840
How do you know?

474
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,760
I…

475
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,400
had a dream.

476
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,760
You had a dream?

477
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,560
I dreamed that…

478
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,520
your grandmother told me this.

479
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,040
That's right, Khun Pi.

480
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,320
Ayutthaya collapses.

481
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,760
Everything my grandmother said was true.

482
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,120
Hey.

483
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,960
Look.

484
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,320
I can do it myself.

485
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,680
-My lord.
-Will this do, my lord?

486
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,080
We are moving to Pribpree.

487
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,360
All of us are moving there.

488
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,880
For those who do not wish to come,
I beg you to come.

489
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,320
Let's live there together.

490
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,560
We will live together

491
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,080
until we die.

492
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,200
That way, we won't be sad
when we die and leave each other.

493
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,720
That's because
no matter what life it may be,

494
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,960
destiny and fate

495
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:42,520
will bring all of us
back together once again.

496
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,320
And again.

497
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,520
My lord, my lady.

498
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,360
-Hey, my dear.
-Please be careful.

499
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,360
My lord, my lady.

500
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,040
-Miss.
-Eung.

501
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,800
-Miss.
-Miss.

502
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,520
Miss, please come over here.

503
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,600
-Father.
-Father.

504
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,680
What is it, my dear?

505
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,680
Mother vomited
after smelling flowers, Father.

506
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,440
Where is your mother?

507
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,600
Goodness.

508
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,440
Please be careful, miss.

509
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,760
My gosh.

510
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,680
Please come this way.

511
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,640
Did you vomit after smelling flowers?

512
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:10,560
Are you pregnant?

513
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,560
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

514
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,440
This will be the last one.

515
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,560
I find flowers smelly now.

516
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:39,640
In the future,
I might find my children and--

517
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,800
Husband.

518
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,400
Goodness.

519
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,680
You're having your third child now,

520
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,120
but you haven't changed at all.

521
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,880
My mother wants many grandchildren.

522
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,280
If you believe that destiny and fate

523
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:00,200
will bring those who have left us
back to us again,

524
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,040
then the person in here

525
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:06,600
may be one of our family members
who has passed away.

526
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,960
My father and mother believe that

527
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,720
-this is Ruang.
-Ruang.

528
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,600
Can you stop reading me like a book?

529
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,640
Stop reading you like a book?

530
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,600
That's impossible.

531
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,520
VISCOUNT PIPATRACHASIN - RID

532
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,360
MARQUESS WISUT SAKORN

533
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:27,840
BARON NARONGRATCHARITTHA - RUANG

534
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,880
PUDTARN

535
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,040
KETSURANG

536
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,720
KARAKED

537
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,320
KING SANPHET IX (KING TAI SRA)
WAS THE 30TH AYUTTHAYAN KING.

538
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,960
HE ISSUED THE ROYAL ORDINANCE

539
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,480
TO PROHIBIT THE CATCHING OF SILVER BARB,

540
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,840
THE FIRST LAW
ON AQUATIC ANIMAL CONSERVATION.

541
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,520
HE ORDERED
THE REPAIR OF WAT MAHEYONG,

542
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,920
BUILT BEFORE AYUTTHAYA
WAS ESTABLISHED.

543
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,200
HE EXTENDED THE MAHACHAI CANAL,

544
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,960
LINKING THE CHAO PHRAYA
AND THA CHIN RIVERS,

545
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,200
AND DEVELOPED BOTH SIDES OF THE CANAL

546
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,800
INTO LARGE RICE-GROWING AREAS,

547
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,200
LEADING TO THE FIRST EXPORTS OF RICE.

548
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,920
HE HAD CLOSER DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS

549
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,760
