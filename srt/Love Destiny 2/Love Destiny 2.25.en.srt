1
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,480
I shall bring a woman in as a concubine.

2
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,720
Her name is Pudtarn,

3
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,120
a commoner under the authority
of Marquess Wisut Sakorn.

4
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,640
If you don't want to lose me to the king,

5
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,440
then you must be brave.

6
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,560
Inform him that I'm your girlfriend.

7
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,160
Which department does he work in?

8
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,480
The Ministry of Treasury, Your Majesty.

9
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,280
Rid.

10
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,480
His Majesty requests
your presence immediately.

11
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,640
Pudtarn.

12
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,320
Get up.

13
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,800
Get up.

14
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,800
Could you not have said something to me?

15
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
That you are her…

16
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,200
What did you call it, Pudtarn?

17
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,200
Boyfriend, Your Majesty.

18
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,520
Yes, that.

19
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,800
Why did you not tell me?

20
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,320
Why leave it to her to tell me here?

21
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,960
Well?

22
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,320
I can…

23
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
see…

24
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,040
that you are angry.

25
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,200
Yes, I am angry with her.

26
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,480
And?

27
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,080
So…

28
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,480
She shall offer herself…

29
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,880
How could she?

30
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,120
She can, Your Majesty.

31
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,520
I asked you how?

32
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,160
She would not do it.

33
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,000
Did she tell you so?

34
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,120
Yes.

35
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,440
You hold affection for her.
That is understandable.

36
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,160
Everyone develops affection for her
after talking to her.

37
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,440
But your major mistake,
do you know what it was?

38
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,720
No.

39
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,480
I do not know, Your Majesty.

40
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,280
Do you not know me at all, Rid?

41
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,160
Why endure the pain in silence?

42
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,120
If I had known,

43
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,680
how could I have hurt you?

44
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,280
You are like a brother to me.

45
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,400
I shall anoint you.

46
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,560
Consider it me marrying you two, Rid.

47
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,960
Pudtarn.

48
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,200
Khun Tao.

49
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
So I can move on from you more quickly.

50
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,040
I shall see to your marriage with Praejeen

51
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,440
as a royally-bestowed wife
at a later time.

52
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,360
What kind of wife am I to be?

53
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,040
You?

54
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,560
You shall be his klang muang wife.

55
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,560
Rid's father and mother
are in charge of your marriage.

56
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,600
-It is called the klang--
-No, I do not accept.

57
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,880
Do not interrupt me while I am speaking.

58
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,440
Let me finish first.

59
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,840
What did you want to say?

60
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,040
I will not be a klang muang wife.

61
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,200
Rid.

62
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

63
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,600
Tell…

64
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,919
Tell your girlfriend that I am the king.

65
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,280
I cannot go back on my word.

66
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,120
It is up to you now.

67
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,560
Very well.

68
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,560
As your mother often says,

69
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,560
"To each their own."

70
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,120
Here we are once again.

71
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,000
This matter of having
one wife, two wives, three wives,

72
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,520
we are back here again.

73
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,560
Not only did my dear granddaughter Keaw
face this trouble,

74
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,680
but now Rid is also in the same situation
because of that woman.

75
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,360
Now that the king is aware of this,
we should feel fortunate

76
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,120
we still have our heads on our shoulders.

77
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,160
How bothersome.
I shall hear no more of this.

78
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
My lord,

79
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,360
the daughter of the Minister of Treasury

80
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,200
holds a much higher status

81
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,320
-than that woman--
-Prik.

82
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,600
Oh, dear.

83
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,520
My lord.

84
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,760
From now on,

85
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,440
do not speak to me, Prik.

86
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,640
You scolded me, my lord.

87
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,120
My lord.

88
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,960
My words were too harsh.

89
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
Rid,

90
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,560
Prik would never stop loving you.

91
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,720
Do not worry about it.

92
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,600
Your current predicament is serious.

93
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,960
What do you intend to do?

94
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,120
I cannot defy royal command.

95
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,400
Even if it means losing Pudtarn?

96
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,040
There is one thing I absolutely forbid.

97
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,080
I forbid each of you
from having any conflict with Klin.

98
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,280
All of you must serve Klin.

99
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,240
Do not allow her to become tired.
Never let her exert herself.

100
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,160
So protective.

101
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,120
Yes, I am protective.

102
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,320
What about it?

103
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,240
When you first became my wife,
was I not protective of you?

104
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,480
It is normal.

105
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,000
I have loved this woman for a long time.

106
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,560
I loved her before you, you, and you.

107
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,880
For that reason,
Klin shall never be my old wife.

108
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,400
She shall remain forever new.

109
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,480
And I shall protect her all my life.

110
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,600
Go, carry out your duties.

111
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,720
You may take money to your parents.

112
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,040
Yoi has a stomachache, Song.

113
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,840
My stomach hurts.

114
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,880
Bring the money bag!

115
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,160
Go and get it.

116
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,000
My stomach hurts.

117
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,040
Let us go.

118
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,400
What is the matter?

119
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
Why do we need to come here to talk?

120
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,920
I have something to ask you.

121
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,600
Do not doubt me. I truly love you.

122
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,280
I have not asked yet.

123
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,200
You have not.

124
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,840
I thought you were going to ask me
if I truly love you or not.

125
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
I have no doubt about that.

126
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,680
None at all.

127
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,760
I…

128
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,880
I just have doubts about myself.

129
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,400
Klin, do you love me?

130
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
Do you love me?

131
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,160
Klin,

132
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,360
do you love me?

133
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,520
Do you truly love me?

134
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,320
You do, truly?

135
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,720
Allow me,

136
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
my dear Klin.

137
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,720
Song, what is the matter with you?

138
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,600
Why are you crying?

139
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,640
You are sobbing after kissing me once.

140
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,760
If you kiss me again,
will you start wailing?

141
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,880
-Song.
-Klin.

142
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,760
-Song.
-I love you, Klin.

143
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,800
Why are you crying?

144
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,640
Why did you come out to talk on the boat?

145
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,520
I wanted to find out
if my fear of water had gone.

146
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,360
Has it gone?

147
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,520
It has.

148
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,200
I know now
that I will never fear the water again.

149
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,080
If I were to die, I would have no regrets.

150
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,480
Is that true?

151
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,600
It is true.

152
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,720
Can you leave all your wives?

153
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,120
No?

154
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,560
Speak up so I can hear you.

155
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,400
No.

156
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,640
I am trying to understand.

157
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
Just tell me why.

158
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,440
Well…

159
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,840
It…

160
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,680
Just tell me. Do not be shy.

161
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
Can't I just get rid of a few of them?

162
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,520
No, you must leave them all.

163
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,720
It is not just the women
who would face difficulty.

164
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,560
Their entire families
would be in trouble as well.

165
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,080
Very well.
How many people would it be altogether?

166
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,360
One hundred.

167
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,440
One hundred?

168
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,800
Just take me back to my grandmother, Song.

169
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,360
You love him,

170
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,840
do you not, Klin?

171
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,760
Grandma.

172
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,120
Goodness, Klin.

173
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,200
Call me quick to love if you wish.

174
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,400
I would not say that.

175
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,160
What am I, Grandma?

176
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,160
A person's heart can be fickle.

177
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,640
Women like us,

178
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,400
our hearts are vulnerable to men
who love us sincerely.

179
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,520
I believe that Song loves you sincerely.

180
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,280
Yes,

181
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,520
he loves me sincerely.

182
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,720
And you?

183
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,920
I love him sincerely as well.

184
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,760
The day has finally come
that I hear those words from you.

185
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,280
Very well.

186
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,360
Klin,

187
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,440
if you can accept being a wife
to a man who already has over 20 wives,

188
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,920
that is your choice to make.

189
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,480
I won't stand in your way.

190
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,960
I agreed to be his wife

191
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,560
only if he leaves all his other wives.

192
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,480
I gave him an ultimatum.

193
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,440
I cannot go back on it.

194
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,880
He must have left them all by now.

195
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,760
Oh, dear.

196
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,360
Poor little women.

197
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,040
Is it not usually "poor little children"?

198
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,680
Yes, poor little children.

199
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,280
There are also poor little old ladies.

200
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,840
Such as me.

201
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,160
I am also about to be left behind,
am I not?

202
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,360
Did you come to pack your belongings?

203
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,400
In any case, he must come
to officially ask for your hand.

204
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,920
You cannot just take your things
and elope with him

205
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,080
like someone who has no family, Klin.

206
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,080
Klin, how long will you be unyielding?

207
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,400
It is not about me
being yielding or unyielding.

208
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,560
But I stick to my word.

209
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,960
You will become a spinster.
Is that what you wish?

210
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,400
Never having a husband does not worry me.
I can live with my grandmother.

211
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,040
I love you. And you love me, do you not?

212
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,040
You made me fall in love with you,
and I have.

213
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,600
And I love only you.

214
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,640
But you love dozens of women.
How can I compete with that?

215
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,800
What do you need to compete with?

216
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,400
I need to compete with what I see ahead.

217
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,480
What do you see?

218
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,880
I see your dozens of wives
competing to serve you.

219
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,000
As for you,
you just sit around as their master.

220
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,480
And then what?

221
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,040
I will not be one of your wives
walking around your house.

222
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,080
You keep wives like a herd.

223
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,360
I will not agree to join the herd.
I must be the only one.

224
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,320
I am trying to make you
the leader of the herd.

225
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,000
I do not accept just being
the leader of the herd.

226
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,760
Klin, this is normal for men.
You know that.

227
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,720
Other women don't mind.

228
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,160
A woman like Madam Gui's granddaughter
would not agree to join your herd.

229
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,120
Will you take me home or not?

230
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,920
Song.

231
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,640
Very well.

232
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Klin.

233
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,200
Klin.

234
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,640
I am not going anywhere, Grandma.

235
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,200
I am back to stay with you.

236
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,280
Darn.

237
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,600
Is Song that decent?

238
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,680
Yes.

239
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,800
He would not leave any of his wives.

240
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,480
Rid, for the restoration
of the Maheyong Temple,

241
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,560
we must plan the budget carefully.

242
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,320
I believe the cost
will be quite substantial.

243
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,440
It is my opinion that
we should try to persuade our suppliers

244
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,440
to lower the prices of their goods,

245
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,560
stating that it is for royal work.

246
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,800
As for the commoners
to be enlisted to contribute their labor,

247
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,040
inform them
they must bring their own meals.

248
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,600
Meals will not be provided.

249
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,320
If we do that,
many may flee to escape duty.

250
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,720
Never mind them. Let them go.

251
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,360
We will enlist more people.

252
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,080
Word will spread and they will all flee.

253
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,880
I already said, let them go.

254
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Soldiers shall pursue and capture them.
We shall see if they do not fear death.

255
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
I understand.

256
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,200
It is fine. Do not worry.

257
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,360
Have you finished, Rid?

258
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,520
Yes, my lord.

259
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,800
Here. Please put it away.

260
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,520
Khun Pi, is this all?

261
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,960
It is not as much as last time.

262
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,560
The restoration of the temple
is not such a crucial matter, Pong.

263
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:57,400
For those who prefer not to be enlisted
as workers, this amount is appropriate.

264
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,680
It has been like this in every era.

265
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,400
From my estimate,
it was more than half the money.

266
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,600
Even if Marquess Phrakhlang is allowed

267
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,240
to take a cut of the money collected
from tributes and taxes or sacred fees,

268
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,360
it should not be such a large amount,
Your Majesty.

269
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,520
This Marquess Phrakhlang
was greatly trusted by my father.

270
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,640
He worked in the treasury
during my father's reign.

271
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,320
For that reason,

272
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,280
I shall not harbor
any doubts or suspicions.

273
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,040
Aside from that,

274
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,440
considerable income has been earned

275
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,320
through his efforts.

276
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,920
The treasury

277
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,680
should purchase goods from the people

278
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,280
at prices higher than
those that have been offered.

279
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,040
The offered prices are unfairly low.

280
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,160
The people labor diligently,

281
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,120
risking their lives
to gather forest goods.

282
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,880
Many suffer injuries or lose their lives.

283
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,680
Very well.

284
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,160
On that matter,

285
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,440
I shall broach the subject
with discretion.

286
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,840
With discretion?

287
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,760
I must handle it with discretion.

288
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,000
The king does not engage
directly in trade.

289
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,360
I merely receive money
without making any effort.

290
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,920
When I make an inquiry,
I must do so in a careful manner.

291
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,320
By the way,

292
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,800
I intended to ask you,

293
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,280
what will you do regarding
the Marquess Kosathibodi's daughter?

294
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,640
Whom do you mean?

295
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,640
Rid, you feign ignorance.

296
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,200
Perhaps I should force you
to marry tomorrow.

297
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,560
Then I could see your face

298
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,520
when Pudtarn rejects you
and refuses to marry you.

299
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,680
And Pudtarn…

300
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
Well…

301
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,360
Your girlfriend.

302
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,960
What did she say?

303
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,400
Is she still unwilling?

304
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,000
Don't you love my son, Tarn?

305
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,520
I do, Auntie.

306
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,080
He loves you very much too.

307
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,160
I know.

308
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,280
We're in the Ayutthaya period,

309
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,040
hundreds of years
before Bangkok in the 21st century.

310
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,880
Don't you think that
the culture and traditions of this place

311
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,480
might be suited to this way of living?

312
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,240
Men can have many wives.

313
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,760
Rid will love only you, no matter what.

314
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,160
Do you know
I don't actually believe what I said?

315
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,600
Yes, I do.

316
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,720
Because if it were you,
you would not stand for it either.

317
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,120
Yes.

318
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,440
I was luckier than you in that my love
faced no obstacles from anyone.

319
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:40,480
For you, even the most significant
and powerful obstacle in the land

320
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,000
surprisingly chose to step aside.

321
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,880
The king truly has a good heart.

322
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,120
He is a peace-loving king.

323
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,880
He is sensitive and compassionate.

324
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,680
Can't he rescind his command?

325
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,160
He is the ruler, isn't he?

326
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,280
He is the most powerful in the land.

327
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,920
But what a ruler doesn't do

328
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,040
is go back on his word.

329
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,239
The king shall not break his word.

330
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,719
If I cannot go back on my word

331
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,440
and you have no intention of objecting
or officially challenging it,

332
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,920
then the other party
must withdraw willingly.

333
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,719
There is no way they would.

334
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,280
Rid,

335
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,880
you must create a way then.

336
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,760
I shall visit the area
around Maheyong Temple

337
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,080
for martial arts training.

338
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,200
Tomorrow, you are scheduled
to visit Phra Si Sanphet Temple.

339
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,560
That is true.

340
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,960
And?

341
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,680
I am afraid if…

342
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,440
I might be struck in the face?

343
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,160
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

344
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,000
I shall go and pray.

345
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,120
Have the crown prince join me.

346
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,360
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

347
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,680
What?

348
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,160
Madam Gui, Klin.

349
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,600
You're here too, Song.

350
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,440
Goodness.

351
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,680
Pudtarn,

352
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,240
my honorable lady, my respected lady.

353
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,760
You are blessed,

354
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,080
-worthy of being--
-Truly an angel's child.

355
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Klin, why did you use my words?

356
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,280
I was afraid I would not get to speak.

357
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,840
What? Just say what you want to say.

358
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,320
Why use the words I wanted to say?

359
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,040
I realized you had a lot to say.

360
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,160
I was afraid I wouldn't get a word in.
So I hurried and spoke first.

361
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,680
-You…
-Hold on, ma'am.

362
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,920
Do not harm my beloved Klin.

363
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,720
Listen to Pudtarn…

364
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,280
Oh, dear.

365
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,760
The royal concubine.

366
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,880
What?

367
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,320
Do you belong to him now?

368
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,880
Not yet, Grandma.

369
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,680
I told you I would not be
just another pig in your pen,

370
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,240
even though I might end up the lead pig.

371
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,520
Goodness, Klin.

372
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,960
Stop! Do not discuss other matters yet.

373
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,880
-May I pay--
-Madam Gui.

374
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,960
I didn't go to the palace
to become a royal concubine.

375
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,480
It's absolutely true.

376
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,360
Is it true?

377
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,840
It is true, ma'am.

378
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,800
Why else would Miss Pudtarn
be back at her home?

379
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,040
Well, I saw it with my own eyes.

380
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,080
A procession of boats
came from the palace.

381
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,240
-Precisely.
-People in the palace were gossiping

382
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,200
about the king
bringing in a new royal concubine

383
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,640
from Madam Gui's orchard.

384
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,120
Precisely.

385
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,760
The ladies in the palace were bustling
about in preparation to welcome her.

386
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
Precisely.

387
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,920
And the procession
escorted Pudtarn to the palace.

388
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,560
-Precisely.
-Precisely.

389
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,760
-Precisely.
-Precisely.

390
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,680
Goodness, Perm.

391
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,520
She simply went there
and then she came back.

392
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,440
Take this! She simply went there?

393
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,720
Klin, if I were you, I wouldn't agree
to be the lead pig either.

394
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,360
You're very cool.

395
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,000
I am cool, right?

396
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,600
You know the word "cool"?

397
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,960
I do. Lady Karaked says it often.

398
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,160
I heard that you are

399
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,840
unwilling to be a secondary wife
to Lady Praejeen. Is that right?

400
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,480
Yes.

401
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,320
You won't even stand for just one other?

402
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,880
All noblemen have royally-bestowed wives.

403
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,200
Their husbands do not love them.

404
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,440
They are merely ceremonial,
to receive guests and gifts.

405
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,800
But the klang muang wife

406
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,960
stays inside the mosquito net.

407
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,360
Klin, your grandmother might hear you.

408
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,000
So? I asked you, not even just one?

409
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,920
Not even just one.

410
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Even if they were sent from heaven,
I wouldn't stand for it.

411
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,360
Oh, dear.

412
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,240
Pudtarn.

413
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,520
I know what you want to say.

414
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,760
Don't think about what's in the past.

415
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,120
I have no idea
how I could have been so terrible.

416
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,480
I have never been mean
to anyone upon first meeting them

417
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,640
before I knew their true character.

418
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,040
I needed to share this with you.

419
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,600
You may choose not to believe it,
but I did not recognize myself.

420
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,200
When I first saw you,

421
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,600
I felt agitated inside.
It was all-consuming.

422
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
I even wanted to end your life.

423
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,160
I have no idea
what malevolent force possessed me.

424
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,520
If there ever was a malevolent force,
it would probably be around here.

425
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,200
Forget all about it, Klin.

426
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,840
I will throw a celebration feast.
I will go all out.

427
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,520
It is the viscount.

428
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,840
The viscount is here.

429
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,400
I pay my respects.

430
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,920
Today, I am throwing a celebration feast.

431
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,320
I accept your invitation.

432
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,720
What've you got for us, Choi?

433
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,840
He is your elder. Be respectful to him.

434
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,880
Respectful?

435
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,240
Choi, could you please let us know
what is being served?

436
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,440
Pork pan.

437
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,840
-Pan pork.
-Pan pork.

438
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,160
It will not splatter, Klin.

439
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,400
Indeed.

440
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,720
Oh, dear.

441
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,320
Madam Gui.

442
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,920
Much appreciated.

443
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,320
Eung.

444
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,320
Our new dish.

445
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,120
Meat skewers.

446
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,440
-Skew…
-Skew…

447
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,680
Skewers.

448
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,880
What?

449
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,120
Look, Grandma.

450
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,880
It means

451
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,520
love.

452
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,200
How do you know?

453
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,320
My mother told me.

454
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,720
If I marry

455
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,040
and I do not see your face again,

456
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,640
what will I do?

457
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,360
I do not want to think about it at all.

458
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,480
Don't cry.

459
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,200
But I am sad.

460
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,760
Why do you--

461
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,480
Don't ask me again.
You should understand by now.

462
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,840
Don't be a crybaby.
Don't let me see your tears again.

463
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,960
When you are married,

464
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,680
don't consider not sleeping
with Lady Praejeen.

465
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,600
Don't do that.

466
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,640
I will sleep there.

467
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,680
Where else would I sleep?

468
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,440
Nobody does that.

469
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,360
Okay, you'll sleep in the same room,
but you should sleep with her too.

470
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,200
I will certainly sleep with her.
You do not need to tell me.

471
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,240
I suppose it's a language difference.

472
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,600
The rain has stopped.

473
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,360
Will you go outside?

474
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,720
You mentioned that
you had something important to tell me.

475
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,000
Please go ahead.

476
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,880
I wanted to…

477
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,000
If you're going to tell me

478
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,240
that Rid does not love me,

479
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,880
but he loves Pudtarn

480
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,680
and that I should call off the marriage,

481
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,720
do not bother telling me.

482
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,600
I will not agree to it.

483
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,000
Even if you do not marry Rid,

484
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,040
there are many men who adore you,

485
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,440
men of higher status
with titles and positions,

486
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,920
surpassing even Viscount Pipatrachasin.

487
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,000
In,

488
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:57,320
my heart has always been devoted to Rid.

489
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,040
Praejeen.

490
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,320
In.

491
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,280
Fear nothing.

492
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,360
You shall become
the royally-bestowed wife.

493
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,520
No woman shall come before you.

494
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,080
Rid does not love me.

495
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,920
Why would you be sad?

496
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,600
Love is not important.

497
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,600
Wealth, possessions, and status
are important.

498
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,000
Remember this in your heart, my daughter.

499
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,840
I will begin preparations
for your wedding.

500
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,760
You will soon be married
and away from my embrace.

501
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,600
Your father is Marquess Phrakhlang.

502
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,000
There will be many guests.

503
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,800
The gifts will fill our house.

504
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,320
I will tell your father

505
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,520
to arrange the wedding within the year.

506
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:50,000
At present, the Queen Mother,
Krom Phra Thephamat, is unwell.

507
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,680
I fear it might be inappropriate
to arrange a celebration.

508
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,120
Oh, dear.

509
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,120
Perhaps we should arrange it even sooner,

510
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,960
before the Queen Mother's health worsens.

511
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,760
Within this year would be preferable.

512
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,080
Is that so?

513
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,040
Does Marquess Kosathibodi agree to it?

514
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,720
If you consulted
Marquess Phrakhlang first,

515
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,240
would it not be wiser?

516
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,600
There is no need to consult him.

517
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,560
He is inclined to comply
with the royal proclamation

518
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,000
at the earliest time possible,
given the considerable delay.

519
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,920
Do you have any reservations,
Lady Karaked?

520
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,800
I do not.

521
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,920
I have no objections at all, Lady Pong.

522
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:06,480
If you have objections,
why did you not raise them?

523
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,880
Jeez, I don't want to talk to you anymore.

524
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,600
Dear me.

525
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,880
Women.

526
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,880
I know what you will say.

527
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,360
I do not want to hear it.
Do you understand?

528
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,320
Even if you do not want to,
you must hear it.

529
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,000
I must tell you that

530
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:38,000
the marriage of Rid and Praejeen
is unavoidable.

531
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,000
Rid is aware

532
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,080
and he has no objection.

533
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,440
As for Pudtarn,

534
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,600
she does not object to it either.

535
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,200
And it pleases Mother,

536
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,760
as well as the servants in the house.

537
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,120
This is how it is.

538
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,960
No matter how troubled you are by it,

539
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,920
you cannot change anything.

540
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,560
Say what you wish to say.

541
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,680
Destiny.

542
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,240
Destiny will change it, trust me.

543
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,000
I know it. I see it.

544
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,680
I am a fan of superstition.

545
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,440
As for me…

546
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,880
I am at my wit's end.

547
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,240
I shall go to sleep.

548
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,320
What do we need to pray to, Pin and Yaem?

549
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,960
You said you did not believe in it.

550
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,640
I don't.

551
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,560
How would you pray if you do not believe?

552
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,480
I will pray even though I do not believe.

553
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,680
Simply waiting for a miracle
will not work.

554
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,080
You two, believe me, because I believe.

555
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,880
-Believe what?
-Believe what?

556
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,960
I believe the power
of Rid and Pudtarn's destiny

557
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,440
is quite something.

558
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,320
-Quite something.
-Quite something.

559
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,440
That's right.

560
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,960
Quite something.

561
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,080
Quite something.

562
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,760
Quite something.

563
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,560
I shall depart

564
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,360
in a short time.

565
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,560
As king,

566
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,920
you must tend to the needs

567
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,520
of every person in this land.

568
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,680
Marquess, are you busy with work today?

569
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,640
No.

570
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,920
I am available all day today,

571
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,840
having delegated tasks
and provided detailed instructions.

572
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,840
If you have any matters to discuss,

573
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,480
please feel free to speak.

574
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,960
I would like to discuss the wedding.

575
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,000
This way, I can understand
what preparations to make.

576
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,720
And Praejeen can begin
preparing for her role as the bride.

577
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,680
Due to her youth,
she is filled with excitement.

578
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,840
I have already told you that
I shall make thorough preparations.

579
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,680
Rest assured that nothing will be lacking.

580
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,560
Your father is the Minister of Treasury.

581
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,600
I assure you

582
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,480
there shall be plenty of people
assisting with the wedding.

583
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,600
Lady Pong.

584
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,240
Yes?

585
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,320
There is something
I would like to tell you.

586
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,760
That's right.

587
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,280
He has intended to tell you
for several days.

588
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,160
What is it?

589
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,320
For our son's wedding, I think…

590
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,400
we should make it a grand
and all-inclusive event.

591
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,920
Very well.

592
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,160
Praejeen,

593
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,000
pay your respects.

594
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,400
He is so generous.

595
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,960
It is an honor, my…

596
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,720
Father.

597
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,160
Father.

598
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,880
Lady Pong, you may prepare the bride.

599
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,440
We shall also prepare the groom
on our end.

600
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:29,880
You said that the marquess
would tell Lady Pong something different.

601
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,920
Given the Queen Mother's passing,

602
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,680
a celebratory event
should not be arranged.

603
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,400
I told him to tell her that.
I reiterated it so many times.

604
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,600
-What did he say?
-What did he say?

605
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,520
He nodded,
so I thought he was okay with it.

606
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,040
Was he not okay with it?

607
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,040
Did he nod?

608
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,600
You nodded.

609
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,920
Yes.

610
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,200
I nodded to indicate that I heard you.

611
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,040
What reason did he give?

612
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,080
For not following the plan.

613
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,880
Why didn't you tell her what I told you?

614
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,600
Because I disagree with you.

615
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,560
-What did he think about it?
-What did he think about it?

616
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,560
What is my opinion?

617
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,600
I believe

618
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,000
it is not justified
to postpone any events.

619
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,160
The royal funeral has concluded.

620
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,600
It cannot serve as an excuse.

621
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,280
-I see.
-I see.

622
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,680
-Quite something.
-Quite something.

623
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:04,320
Praejeen is making such a fuss
over her wedding preparations.

624
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,080
Did you hear me, Prang?

625
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,440
I did.

626
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,200
But I prefer not to know.

627
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,560
Prang, my dear,

628
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,840
each of us has our own fate.

629
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,840
And you, In,

630
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,600
will you change your mind about loving me?

631
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,960
Who says I would ever change?

632
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,440
Never.

633
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,880
My love is unwavering.

634
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,360
Please do not ask me that again.

635
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,360
If you ever change your mind,
let me know promptly.

636
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,920
I told you I will not change my mind.

637
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,040
Why should I let you know promptly?

638
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,040
So I can find someone new.

639
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,960
I will not accept being left.

640
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,400
Goodness, be careful.

641
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,720
Please sit down slowly.

642
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,800
Please sit down slowly.

643
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,760
I have noticed her losing strength

644
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:26,440
since the Queen Mother's passing, Prik.

645
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,640
Because she used to serve her.

646
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,240
May you rest in heaven.

647
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,400
Why?

648
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,840
What is it?

649
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,920
What are you doing?

650
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,600
If you wish to gaze at me,
then gaze at me, Little Ruang.

651
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,120
Stealing glances is more enjoyable.

652
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,160
Are you excited about the wedding?

653
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,280
I am not that excited.

654
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,400
I merely have not slept well
for several nights.

655
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,960
I am very excited.

656
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,160
Are you truly?

657
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,400
Yes, I am.

658
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,840
Because I sleep well every night.

659
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,080
What is on your mind?

660
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,320
Do not act so lovely.

661
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,080
Otherwise,

662
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,600
I will tell Uncle Rueang
to hasten preparations for the wedding.

663
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,240
That is wonderful.

664
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,800
Do you mean it?

665
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,040
Your father and mother cannot come

666
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:14,200
because your grandmother,
Lady Champa, is very ill.

667
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,240
Are you aware?

668
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,920
I am.

669
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,560
Little Ruang,

670
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,880
would you like to visit your grandmother?

671
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,680
You may go.

672
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,720
The wedding can be postponed.

673
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,880
Riem, what is your opinion?

674
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,880
I have no opinion.
It is up to you to decide.

675
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:54,280
Do what is best for you, Ruang.

676
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,040
The auspicious time has been set.

677
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,240
All the necessary preparations

678
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,080
have also been completed.

679
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,800
That is the situation.

680
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,680
My father's guests
have prepared themselves.

681
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,360
All the relatives

682
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,120
have also sent word
of when they will arrive.

683
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,200
It is my decision

684
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,640
to marry on the scheduled auspicious date.

685
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,080
What will happen?

686
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,120
This is good. It should be fine.

687
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,840
Your father and mother
would likely prefer it.

688
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:45,560
And your grandmother
would understand the reason.

689
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,800
Do not worry, Ruang.

690
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,280
The king has ordered the crown prince
to restore Kudi Dao Temple.

691
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,000
In,

692
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,840
calculate the budget.

693
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,360
You should be able to get
some advice from Rid.

694
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,560
Rid,

695
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,920
the amount should not be much different.

696
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,360
Yes, my lord.

697
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:45,200
Kudi Dao Temple and Maheyong Temple
are equally run-down.

698
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,360
It likely needs
a substantial amount of money.

699
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,600
The king intends them
to be sister temples.

700
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,640
Craftsmen are proven to be
the most crucial elements.

701
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,640
Craftsmen from all over Phra Nakorn
are likely required.

702
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,120
The king states that

703
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,160
it is to take place two years after
the restoration of Maheyong Temple,

704
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,760
using the same craftsmen for each.

705
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,920
That is a good plan.

706
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,320
It gives us time to find the funds.

707
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:15,240
It is not as easy to find funds as…

708
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:17,640
he might believe.

709
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:30,880
Purchase orders from China for rice
have increased greatly, Father.

710
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,840
I hear the Emperor plans to persuade us
to sell more rice by reducing taxes.

711
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,080
Is that right?

712
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:39,080
Something not yet certain
should not be spoken of.

713
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,840
Pong.

714
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,319
Please serve the meal.

715
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:49,640
Certainly.

716
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,319
If I cannot go back on my word

717
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:10,240
and you have no intention
of objecting or officially challenging it,

718
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,600
then the other party
must withdraw willingly.

719
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,319
There is no way they would.

720
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,600
You must create a way then.

721
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,000
If we can procure enough rice
to sell to them,

722
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,640
up to three million buckets,
the Emperor will waive the taxes on it.

723
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:32,600
Keep your voice down.

724
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:36,399
Regarding the Emperor's tax exemption,
do not let anyone know.

725
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:37,840
Certainly.

726
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,840
You must create a way then.

727
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,160
Even if I can't marry you
and be your wife,

728
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,200
I will love you forever.

729
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,160
You cannot marry me?

730
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,320
Everything in this world can change.

731
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,320
What I wish to speak about,
with respect, Marquess,

732
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,240
concerns what I have discovered
and observed…

733
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,720
Malaria is difficult to treat.

734
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,040
What is the matter?

735
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,640
I have a bad feeling.

736
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,560
I feel sad.

737
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,880
Does Ayutthaya collapse, Karaked?

738
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,880
How do you know?

739
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,920
