1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,160
Kam!

2
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,320
-What is happening?
-Ming.

3
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,120
Tie them up. Do not let them get away.

4
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,240
This house…

5
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,720
So you are Pudtarn.

6
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,400
-She resembles…
-Karaked.

7
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Indeed. That one, the old Lady Karaked.

8
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,200
I would like to learn sword fighting.

9
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,640
You are not even wearing it.

10
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,280
Rid.

11
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,160
My goodness, Rid!

12
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,200
Do you think
you're handsome striking that pose?

13
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,440
My goodness!

14
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,640
-He has left.
-What happened?

15
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,880
I don't know, Grandmother.

16
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,360
But I do, Grandmother.

17
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,040
Tell me.

18
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,600
Rid is acting strangely, is he not?

19
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,000
That's because he didn't have any sleep.

20
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,880
He was out on the balcony all night.

21
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,280
I peeked at him
and saw him sitting, standing,

22
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,080
looking up at the moon,
and looking down at the ground.

23
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,600
He came back inside at dawn
and then went out shortly after.

24
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,160
That's why I think
Rid didn't sleep at all.

25
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,120
Why is that?

26
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,040
Keaw, my dear, say something.

27
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,920
I don't know, Grandmother.

28
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,400
Grandmother,

29
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,880
if you won't listen to me, I will go

30
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,880
and leave you alone with Keaw,
who doesn't know anything.

31
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,680
Even though Keaw is here,

32
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,000
you can dream on if you think
you will learn anything.

33
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,440
"Dream on." There you go again.

34
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,320
What language is that, Prang?

35
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
I have told you many times

36
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,400
to refrain from using those obscure words.

37
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,160
What does "dream on" mean?

38
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,800
Mother said it.

39
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,920
I got it from her.

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,120
Why don't you ask her?

41
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,200
There you are.
Your mother speaks nonsense.

42
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,680
There is little point in asking her.

43
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,600
My lady,

44
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,120
you must pay close attention
when Lady Karaked speaks

45
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,800
to understand her.

46
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
But Grandmother,

47
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,000
I know what happened.

48
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,120
Prang,

49
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,720
don't speak of matters
you are uncertain about.

50
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,760
I knew it. You want to tell me
when you are still unsure yourself.

51
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,080
I won't hear it from you.

52
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,240
I have learned enough from Keaw.

53
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,400
Oh my, Grandmother, you should be careful.

54
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,560
Of what?

55
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,400
You might lose your balance.

56
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,440
You see, you're leaning to one side

57
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,160
like this…

58
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,160
and…

59
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,560
-you might fall!
-My goodness!

60
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,560
Take this, Prang.

61
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,280
Behave, will you?

62
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,320
I'm doing this for you.

63
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,520
What is it?

64
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,440
Let's go to your chamber
for a nap, my lady.

65
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,560
You haven't had enough sleep.

66
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,160
What?

67
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,880
My lady, let's go.

68
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,280
I will escort you there.

69
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Okay.

70
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,760
-Come.
-Yes, my lady.

71
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,760
You went too far
making fun of Grandmother.

72
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,720
Well, she gives you
preferential treatment.

73
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,480
She is much more fond of you than me.

74
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,600
I can't let her do this.

75
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,840
I have to keep reminding her

76
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,640
or she will regard me

77
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
as unimportant one day.

78
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,320
Don't you think so,

79
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,280
Grandmother's dearest one?

80
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,200
Oh, dear.

81
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,240
You're giving me a headache.

82
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,360
Okay, I will leave you alone.

83
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,320
And as for our brother,

84
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,440
I'm sure he's in love.

85
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,040
Lord Rid.

86
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,720
Oh, right.

87
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,840
I was waiting for that.

88
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,880
You've been itching to tell me,
have you not?

89
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,440
All right, tell me what you want to say.

90
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,800
The young lord isn't his usual self.

91
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,040
In what way?

92
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,400
Just tell me already. In what way?

93
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,800
What I saw this morning, my lady,

94
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,800
it gave me a fright

95
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,640
and I screamed my lungs out--

96
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,240
-That's enough.
-Goodness.

97
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,760
I'm not listening to you anymore.

98
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,280
My lady.

99
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
-Take this.
-That hurts.

100
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,640
I haven't heard anything
of any substance all morning.

101
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,160
I've had it with you two.

102
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,880
Close the door, Chuang.

103
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,120
Yes, my lady.

104
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,440
-Oh, dear.
-Move.

105
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,280
Hold on, my lady.

106
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,200
You saw it, didn't you?

107
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,680
Lord Rid looked like
he had been up all night.

108
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,320
He had huge bags under his eyes.

109
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,160
When someone doesn't sleep
the whole night,

110
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,680
it can mean only one thing.

111
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,560
Really, Prik?

112
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,800
Yes, my lady.

113
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,120
Whom does Rid have an eye for?

114
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,520
Perm, are you done?

115
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,720
Yes, miss.

116
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,040
Here is your ground sappanwood
mixed with water.

117
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,680
This looks nice.

118
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,360
It's a beautiful red. Are you done, Eung?

119
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,240
Yes, miss.

120
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,560
It's the unscented powder.

121
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,840
It's very smooth. How did you make this?

122
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,080
I mixed it with water and stirred it well.

123
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
Do you see that?

124
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,720
You needn't ask. What if I said I don't?

125
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,240
Then I would believe you.

126
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,080
You're joking, aren't you?

127
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,160
No, miss.

128
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
I'm cloaking.

129
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,440
What? What did you say?

130
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,480
She's cloaking, miss.

131
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,440
What does it mean?

132
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,360
She isn't telling you the truth.

133
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,440
Perm, you're talking too much.

134
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,200
Why don't you mix the powder with water?

135
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,520
-Take it.
-Okay.

136
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,680
Can I add colors now?

137
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,120
How would I know that, miss?

138
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,080
I still don't know what this is.

139
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,880
It's called face powder.

140
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,480
Face powder.

141
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,600
Can you add colors to it?

142
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,840
Of course.

143
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,800
We add some colors
to give it a hint of red, pink, or orange.

144
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,960
Then you leave it to dry to harden it up.

145
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,160
It makes your face look pretty
and ready to go.

146
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,560
-Ready to go?
-Yes, ready to go.

147
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,440
Go where, miss?

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,680
To…

149
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,520
Whatever.

150
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,760
Just wait and see.

151
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,840
Add a little at a time, miss.

152
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,680
Is His Lordship coming today, miss?

153
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,800
Of course.
He has to teach me sword fighting.

154
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Would you like me
to catch some fish for you to eat?

155
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,600
That would be great.

156
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,880
I will cook my best dishes for him.

157
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,160
I have received plenty of fish.
Send them to the kitchen.

158
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,520
I have summoned Kosathibodi here today.

159
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,960
Once my business with him is settled,

160
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,880
I have several matters
to discuss with you all.

161
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,200
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

162
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,640
Rid.

163
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

164
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,080
What are you anxious about?

165
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,640
You look troubled.

166
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,960
Rid.

167
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,680
You have dark rings around your eyes.

168
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,360
Did you not sleep last night?

169
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,600
I am a little unwell, Your Majesty.

170
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,120
Good.

171
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,960
If it's a physical sickness,

172
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,000
you can just take medicine to cure it.

173
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,800
But make sure not to become
emotionally unwell.

174
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,760
That is more difficult to cure.

175
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

176
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
In.

177
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,000
Has your father arrived?

178
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

179
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,640
Okay.

180
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,320
Rid and In, come with me.

181
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,480
This concerns both of you.

182
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

183
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,400
How is trade between Ayutthaya
and other kingdoms these days?

184
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,000
Make it short.
I don't want anything lengthy.

185
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

186
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,600
In short,

187
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,360
trade between Ayutthaya
and Western nations

188
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,960
has stagnated, Your Majesty.

189
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,840
Be it the British, the Dutch,

190
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,880
the French, or the Portuguese,

191
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,520
the number of cargo ships arriving
decreases daily, Your Majesty.

192
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,560
Why is that so?

193
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,760
I conversed with the merchants,

194
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,160
and they all say

195
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,920
that trade in their homelands

196
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,240
has slowed

197
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,800
as there have been
great wars going on there.

198
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,680
People have died and wealth has been lost.

199
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,640
Traveling to Ayutthaya
for trade isn't viable

200
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,160
as they do not make
enough profit from it, Your Majesty.

201
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,760
In that case,

202
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,560
will Ayutthaya's economy not also suffer?

203
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,880
No, Your Majesty.

204
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,280
Ayutthaya has other key trade partners

205
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,800
other than the Westerners, Your Majesty.

206
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,040
Yes, that's right.

207
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,600
Ayutthaya also distributes goods
to Japan and China.

208
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,280
Am I right, Kosathibodi?

209
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,440
You have told me this,

210
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,080
but I forgot about it.

211
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

212
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,560
Particularly China,

213
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,840
which will likely expand its trade with us
from now on, Your Majesty.

214
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,720
Good.

215
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,640
It's a good thing for Ayutthaya
to have a Chinese treasurer.

216
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,840
My father had a great vision

217
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,080
in appointing you as Kosathibodi.

218
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,200
It's my honor, Your Majesty.

219
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,600
My father spoke highly of you.

220
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,000
I heard him do so often.

221
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,160
That is why I have not appointed anyone
to replace you.

222
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,800
I'm grateful for your gracious kindness,
Your Majesty.

223
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,280
By the way, I don't understand one thing.

224
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,360
Why does China make it a rule

225
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,080
that it will only trade with the kingdoms
that comply with its jingong?

226
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,760
Rid and In,

227
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,320
listen carefully

228
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,440
as you will be transferred
to the treasury.

229
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,160
Do you understand what jingong is?

230
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,600
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

231
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,200
You do.

232
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,040
Explain it to me then.

233
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,640
In, you don't have to.

234
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,280
I believe you have learned of it
from your father.

235
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,640
Rid.

236
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,520
Tell me.

237
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,880
Jin means give.

238
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,240
Gong means tribute, Your Majesty.

239
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,720
Yes, I know that.

240
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,160
Answer my question.

241
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

242
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,680
China has a policy

243
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,840
to only trade with kingdoms
that pay tribute to its emperor.

244
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,280
I asked why China has such a policy.

245
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
For heaven's sake.

246
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,040
Stop beating around the bush.

247
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,280
China believes its emperor
was sent from heaven.

248
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,840
Therefore, it only trades with kingdoms
that recognize its emperor, Your Majesty.

249
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Is that right, Kosathibodi?

250
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

251
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,720
Ayutthaya

252
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,080
benefits from its trade with China.

253
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,920
So why did my grandfather, King Phetracha,

254
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,520
not send tributes to him?

255
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,240
I'm still curious about this.

256
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,680
None were sent throughout his reign,
were they?

257
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,440
That is correct, Your Majesty.

258
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,280
During the reign of King Phetracha,

259
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,520
a large number of Chinese merchants
came to trade with Ayutthaya,

260
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,440
so we didn't find it necessary
to send ships to China

261
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,320
and risk the lives of our people
on the seas, Your Majesty.

262
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,800
This is why King Phetracha
didn't send a tribute to the emperor.

263
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,120
I see.

264
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,520
So that's what happened.

265
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,920
After you're done,
dry it so you can fry it easily.

266
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,640
Can you do it, Eung?

267
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,680
I have never done it,
so I don't know, miss.

268
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,720
She can't do it, miss.
She has never cooked.

269
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,000
Perm, don't say that.

270
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,240
I don't like to cook.

271
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,320
Cooking delicious food for someone
is like making merit.

272
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,760
-Making merit?
-Making merit?

273
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,359
Yes, they feel happy
when they have delicious food.

274
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,040
Food cures everything,

275
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,520
and you won't have
to rely on medicine when you're old.

276
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,880
Is that true?

277
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,560
I don't think so.

278
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,359
All right, I'm done.
Put it out to dry for me.

279
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,800
Yes, miss.

280
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,920
Miss,

281
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,359
you're cooking so much food.

282
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,359
Who is coming over?

283
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,839
Well, it's Baron Maharit.
He will teach me sword fighting.

284
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,600
Have you forgotten, Perm,
or are you just playing dumb?

285
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,920
Eung, you can be at ease from now on.

286
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,720
If Kam comes here,
I will slice him in half.

287
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,320
Are you really going
to learn sword fighting, miss?

288
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,440
Women don't do that, miss.

289
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,480
Yes, they do.

290
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,840
-Who?
-Who?

291
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,240
Me.

292
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,480
All right?

293
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,600
-Yes, miss.
-Yes, miss.

294
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,680
Rid, you must master the Chinese language.

295
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,320
In, how is your grasp of Chinese?

296
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,520
Not great, Your Majesty.

297
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,960
I will study with Rid, Your Majesty.

298
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,600
Good.

299
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,960
I'm planning to send a mission to China.

300
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,280
It won't be soon.

301
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,600
In a few years.

302
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,280
Don't look so surprised.

303
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,840
Come, I have something
more interesting for you.

304
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,240
What do you think

305
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,320
if I pass a law prohibiting
the catching of silver barbs?

306
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,040
Would you agree with it?

307
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
Thongkam,

308
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,720
what do you say?

309
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,120
I haven't fully grasped
what you mean, Your Majesty.

310
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,640
What is this?

311
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,720
I have explained it to you.
Do you not understand?

312
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,120
Or has what I said gone in one ear
and out the other?

313
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,240
Well, Ming?

314
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,880
Will you say something?

315
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,080
I have nothing to say, Your Majesty.

316
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,320
What is this?

317
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,400
Think about what I say.

318
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,880
This matter

319
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,880
sounds bizarre to me, Your Majesty.

320
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,520
Rid.

321
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,800
I have two concerns, Your Majesty.

322
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,080
Firstly?

323
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,120
Firstly, the people will not like it.

324
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,960
Why not?

325
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,720
I shall only prohibit
the catching of silver barbs,

326
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,360
not other fish.

327
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,600
I will encourage them
to catch those as they please.

328
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,200
It's just the silver barbs.

329
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,160
Can't they leave them to their king?

330
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,160
If people agree--

331
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,640
Yes, if they agree,
what other problem do you foresee?

332
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,440
How do you intend to enforce it,
Your Majesty?

333
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,160
There are many waterways

334
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,160
that pass through our land,

335
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,000
which is also surrounded by other rivers,

336
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,080
as well as the ones--

337
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,760
Don't beat around the bush.

338
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,640
Just tell me what the problem will be

339
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,800
if people agree.

340
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,200
Who will you assign

341
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,800
to monitor the catching of silver barbs,
Your Majesty?

342
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,960
If you order me to oversee it,

343
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,160
I will keep watch without blinking,
Your Majesty.

344
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,680
Who would have you overseen it?

345
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,200
Exactly, Your Majesty.

346
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,720
Fine, let's leave this for now.

347
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,800
I won't think about it now.

348
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,920
I don't have any ideas.

349
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,600
In.

350
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

351
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,680
I also don't have any ideas, Your Majesty.

352
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,800
Who asked you for ideas?

353
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,000
Stop it now.

354
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,120
I have something else for you to do.

355
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

356
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,040
Tomorrow, I shall take my rooster
to the same place I took it last time.

357
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,920
I need you to go to Pudtarn's house.

358
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,800
Tell her to prepare some food.

359
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,120
In particular, I want fried silver barbs

360
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,920
like she prepared last time.

361
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,000
Rid.

362
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,360
Rid.

363
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,240
Hey, In, why do you speak so loudly?

364
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,760
I thought you didn't hear me.

365
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,880
Of course I heard you.
I heard every single word.

366
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,520
Hurry up and attend to your duties.

367
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,600
What's wrong with him?

368
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,760
-Choi.
-Yes, my lady.

369
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,440
What's wrong with him?

370
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,560
His Lordship is not in a good mood.

371
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Why is that so?

372
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,880
I don't know, my lady.

373
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,800
You don't need to know exactly.

374
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,920
Just make a guess. Come on.

375
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,840
I…

376
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,640
can't do that either, my lady.

377
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,680
You can't make a guess.

378
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,040
In that case…

379
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,240
where has he been?

380
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,360
Only the palace, my lady.

381
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,240
He didn't go…

382
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,040
to anybody's house?

383
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,360
Not at all, my lady.

384
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm not going.
Why must you force me to go with you?

385
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,680
Just go alone.

386
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,280
Goodness, you brat. Why didn't you
tell me you were turning around?

387
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,240
Didn't you see
I almost fell down the stairs?

388
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,880
Yes. I see that you didn't fall.

389
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,720
-You…
-My goodness!

390
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,240
I haven't hit you yet.

391
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,120
Gosh. Im.

392
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,600
Take everything I have prepared.

393
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,800
Yes, just give everything to her.

394
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,880
And do you know

395
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,320
if a daughter of angels eats and sleeps
like a human, Grandma?

396
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,600
I don't know,
so I'm going there to find out.

397
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,240
You're going to find out?

398
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,160
What's all this then?

399
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,520
Food and whatnot.

400
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,480
Don't argue with me, as you won't win.

401
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,240
We can all see that

402
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,760
you're giving her enough food
and supplies to last ten years.

403
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,560
But you say you're just going to see.

404
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,600
Oh, dear.

405
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,560
It turns out you just envy her.

406
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,240
That's right.

407
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,400
I envy her.

408
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,920
Am I wrong

409
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,680
to envy her?

410
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,480
Tell me I'm wrong for envying her.

411
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,600
As someone who has lived
with you for over a decade,

412
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,200
I mustn't envy someone
who just came a month ago.

413
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,200
Just because she's an angel's daughter,

414
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,080
not only can I, your granddaughter,
not envy her,

415
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,160
but I also have to serve all this to her
on a silver platter.

416
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,920
And when I get there,

417
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,360
do I also have to bow down to her?

418
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,880
Klin, there's no need for you to complain.

419
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,440
If you don't want to go, then don't.

420
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,200
And why are you crying?

421
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,680
I haven't scolded you or anything.

422
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,320
Madam,

423
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,280
please have some sympathy for Miss Klin.

424
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,040
Why should I? This is not your business.

425
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,440
She's sad, ma'am.

426
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,120
She's your granddaughter.

427
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,440
I know that. You don't have to tell me.

428
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,680
Your lady started it first.

429
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,600
If she doesn't want to go,
she doesn't have to.

430
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,520
No one is forcing her to go.

431
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,920
But she insulted me. You heard it.

432
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,400
What did I say? Well?

433
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,440
You said I insulted you.

434
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,480
What did I say?

435
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,440
Come with me

436
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,040
and I will tell you.

437
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,840
Put this on my husband's table
once you have finished.

438
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,880
Choi.

439
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,640
Yes, my lady.

440
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,880
Will you go to fetch my husband?
Let me come with you.

441
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,640
Why would you go, Mother?

442
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,520
There's no reason for you to go.

443
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,200
You will be prettier
if you stay home and prepare the food

444
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,200
while waiting for Father to return.

445
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,640
Goodness, Rid.

446
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,680
You won't let me go out,
but where are you going?

447
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,360
Gui.

448
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,800
You have brought me too much.

449
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,480
It's all from my orchard.

450
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,960
Just enjoy it. I have plenty.

451
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,080
But you sell it, don't you?

452
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,920
You will lose out.

453
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,080
It's fine.

454
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,120
It's also my gain to let you eat it.

455
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,760
But I'm not paying for it.

456
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,360
I didn't order it.

457
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,640
You mean

458
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,320
you won't buy it?

459
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,200
I guess this is the heavenly language.

460
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,600
It's already my gain

461
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,480
to see you eat these fruits.

462
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,880
Back in heaven,

463
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,640
you must have a residence
made of glass and gold, right?

464
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,360
Why did you fall from there?

465
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,200
Or were you punished by angels?

466
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,800
Do you have parents?

467
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,600
Or you were born like this?

468
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,080
Gui, I'm a human being

469
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,000
just like you.

470
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,920
Gui.

471
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,040
I came here to tell you

472
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,320
that I will take you
to register as a commoner.

473
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,800
But you won't have to enroll
in the royal government service

474
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,800
like the male commoners.

475
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,640
Okay.

476
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,480
By the way,

477
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,360
why must I register?

478
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,600
Can't I just live independently?

479
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,160
I don't want to register.

480
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,040
I prefer to be free.

481
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,760
Gui.

482
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,560
My goodness.

483
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,560
I really want to believe
that you're a human being like us.

484
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,880
You must believe me
because I'm telling you the truth.

485
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,760
Hey, Eung.

486
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,280
What are you doing over there?

487
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,160
I'm just sitting, ma'am.

488
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,400
I'm waiting for you.

489
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,080
What for?

490
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,400
I'm waiting for you
to tell me to put all this away.

491
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,640
May I?

492
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,600
Yes, put it away.

493
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,880
Im, help her.

494
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,240
Yes, ma'am.

495
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,000
Guys, carry these and follow me.

496
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,240
Come, get everything.

497
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,840
I won't let you eat this.

498
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,840
Perm.

499
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,840
Yes, miss.

500
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,960
You snuck up on me.

501
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,400
What do you want?

502
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,360
Well…

503
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,360
What do I want, miss?

504
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,840
I'm asking you, so answer me.

505
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,760
I…

506
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,160
want to…

507
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,120
get rid of the insects, miss.

508
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,280
What's with you?

509
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,640
Are you saying I'm an insect, Perm?

510
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,600
How dare you call me an insect?

511
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,280
-No, miss.
-No what?

512
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,560
I heard it clearly.

513
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,040
I'm not deaf.

514
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,080
You misunderstood, miss. I'm not--

515
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,360
No, I didn't misunderstand.

516
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,120
I heard you say it clearly.

517
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,640
Your voice is still echoing in my ears.

518
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,880
You said you wanted to get rid of insects,
but it is only you and me here.

519
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,400
If you weren't talking about me, then who?

520
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,400
Well, Perm? Who were you talking about?

521
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,720
Yourself?

522
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,200
-Perm, be quiet.
-Goodness.

523
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,640
I brought lemongrass leaves to keep
the insects away from the vegetables.

524
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,840
You got it wrong, miss.

525
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,880
Miss.

526
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,160
It's for raising your voice at me.

527
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,440
Remember this.

528
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,640
Don't you dare do that to me.

529
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,040
If you want to do that,
go and do it to your mistress.

530
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,840
She's just a vagrant
who came from who knows where.

531
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,880
But don't act bold with me

532
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,280
because I'm the granddaughter of Madam Gui
who provides you protection.

533
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,000
If you don't do as I say,
I will teach you a lesson.

534
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,320
Yes, miss.

535
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,560
Thank you.

536
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,720
Once you have registered as a commoner
under Marquess Wisut Sakorn,

537
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,720
you'll be in His Lordship's care.

538
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,880
If misfortune happens to come your way,

539
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,320
the master you're registered under
will help you.

540
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,720
I'm also under Marquess Wisut Sakorn,

541
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,440
and so are my servants,

542
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,760
including Perm and Eung.

543
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,640
Really? In that case,

544
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,280
I'll do it.

545
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,680
I'll be a commoner
like you and everyone else.

546
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,160
Okay.

547
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,480
What's wrong?

548
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,320
Okay is…

549
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,639
okay.

550
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,679
Okay.

551
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,320
I should get going.
I have been here too long.

552
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,639
Hey,

553
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,320
where have you been, Klin?

554
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,320
Grandma,

555
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,280
now you know

556
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,840
that this deranged woman
is a commoner like us

557
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,560
and not a child of angels or anything.

558
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
Fine,

559
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,600
you think what you like.

560
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,120
What I like?

561
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,960
Whether she's a commoner
or a child of angels,

562
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,000
I don't like her.

563
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,520
But you wouldn't know

564
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,080
because you no longer care about anyone.

565
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,960
I'm a human being.

566
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,200
A human being, all right?

567
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,160
You mad woman.

568
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,000
Look at her, Grandma.

569
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,480
It's all right.

570
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,040
-Let's go home, Klin.
-I'm not going

571
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,640
unless you put her in her place.

572
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,600
What's with you?

573
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,120
She's not a child of angels.
She's a commoner, just like us.

574
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,960
She's a vagrant

575
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,080
who came from somewhere unknown to us,
but she's acting bold with me.

576
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,640
You can't let her do this to me, Grandma.

577
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,440
Come on, Klin.

578
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,840
If you won't listen to me,
what would you have me do?

579
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,440
-You must throw her out.
-Throw me out?

580
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,720
Shut it, you commoner.

581
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,120
A commoner like me can't talk,

582
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,720
but a commoner like you can.
How does that work?

583
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,600
-I said shut it!
-No!

584
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,240
You have no right to stop me
or chase me away.

585
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,120
This land is in Thailand
and I'm a Thai just like you.

586
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,320
I can stay wherever
the owner allows me to.

587
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,600
If anyone tries to chase me away,
I'm prepared to fight.

588
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,200
Just tell me how you want it,
so we can end this.

589
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,160
Stop being such a pain in the ass.
It's freaking annoying!

590
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,840
Grandma.

591
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,880
Right.

592
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,880
What's she saying?

593
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,800
I…

594
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,160
Thailand.

595
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,640
A Thai. What is that?

596
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,760
This is the land of Ayutthaya,
not Thailand.

597
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,560
Or are you not from Ayutthaya?

598
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,000
Grandma.

599
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,000
What do you say, Pudtarn?

600
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,080
Where are you from?

601
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,560
Are you not from Ayutthaya?

602
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,080
Madam.

603
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,560
Didn't Miss Pudtarn once say

604
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,880
that she came

605
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,200
from Krung Thep?

606
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,120
Eung, keep your nose out of it.

607
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,480
Hey!

608
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,280
-Goodness.
-Eung.

609
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,800
Pudtarn.

610
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,240
Can you see now she's just a fake?

611
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,320
I didn't see anything.

612
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,960
You have a blind spot for her.

613
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,960
Klin,

614
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,520
when are you going to stop
provoking Pudtarn?

615
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,880
It's you who should stop provoking me.

616
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,880
It's fine if you don't see it,

617
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,480
but I see it clearly.

618
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,160
She smiles from ear to ear,
flashing her teeth.

619
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,480
What kind of decent woman
smiles that way to men, Grandma?

620
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,160
Am I right?

621
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,480
You taught me
that a decent lady doesn't bare her teeth

622
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,840
while smiling, like this.

623
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,040
I'm so tired of listening to you, Klin.

624
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,040
Im, are you tired?

625
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,040
No, ma'am.

626
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Yes, I'm tired. I'm very tired.

627
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,880
I'm so tired I can't breathe.

628
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,200
I've had enough of your favoritism.

629
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,360
But you can't argue with me
that she's sneaky.

630
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,880
I won't waste my energy arguing with you.

631
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,400
Grandma.

632
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,760
Im.

633
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,480
Yes, ma'am.

634
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,040
Fried silver barb is a must.
Do you understand?

635
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,000
My master likes it very much.

636
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,600
Are those the silver barbs
I'm talking about?

637
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,560
Yes, my lord.

638
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,280
Who are you preparing them for?

639
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,520
Baron Maharit.

640
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,600
I'm preparing him food,
as he's coming to teach me sword fighting.

641
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,480
Is that so?

642
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,120
Why do you want to learn
to fight with a sword?

643
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,960
To protect myself.

644
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,040
Protect yourself from what?

645
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,240
Well, from danger.

646
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,760
What danger?

647
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,160
It hasn't happened yet,
so how can I tell you what it is?

648
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,360
Would you learn with me

649
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,640
if I offered to teach you?

650
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,240
-No.
-What?

651
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,360
I thought you said you wanted to learn it.

652
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,880
Yes, I do.

653
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,680
But I already have someone to teach me.

654
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,880
Rid probably won't come.

655
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,280
Yes, he will.

656
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,160
We made an appointment.
How can he not come?

657
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,360
If he were coming,
he would be here by now.

658
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,120
We got off duty together,

659
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,160
-and… Hold on.
-But--

660
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,640
Let me finish first.

661
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,280
If Rid were coming,

662
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,320
he would have told His Majesty

663
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,760
when His Majesty ordered me
to come and tell you

664
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,160
about his visit tomorrow,

665
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,360
and it wouldn't be me sitting here
but Rid.

666
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,960
But your friend, Rid, promised me,

667
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,840
so I'm going to cook for him.

668
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,720
Also, it's not yet the end of the day.

669
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,560
He still has time.

670
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,840
All right.

671
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,520
I respect your determination,

672
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,080
so I will wait with you
to see for myself whether Rid comes.

673
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,360
Of course.

674
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,720
When Baron Maharit comes,
you can eat with us.

675
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,200
You want me to join you?

676
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,760
I need to cook. You can wait here.

677
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,920
Perm, are you okay?

678
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,560
About what, miss?

679
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,800
About Klin.

680
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,240
Don't be mad at her.

681
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,760
-Yes, miss.
-Why can't we be mad at her, miss?

682
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,240
Miss Klin is terribly cruel.

683
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,800
She's very scary, miss.

684
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,440
-Are you scared of her?
-Of course.

685
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,240
She's intimidating.

686
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,760
That's good.
Be scared, but don't be mad at her.

687
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,360
If you get mad at her, you'll feel bad,

688
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,040
but nothing will happen to her
because she has no clue about it.

689
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,920
But if you're scared, you must…

690
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,720
Must…

691
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,400
Must what?

692
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,560
I must run away when she comes.

693
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,200
To where?

694
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,640
Whichever way she comes,

695
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,200
I'll run the opposite way.

696
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,960
But I won't run away,

697
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,480
in case Miss Klin wants to hurt you, miss.

698
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,480
And what are you going to do?

699
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,400
I will stay and help you.

700
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,080
How will you do that?

701
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,880
I will let Miss Klin curse me instead.

702
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,520
She can also beat me.

703
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,640
My gosh, you suddenly look prettier.

704
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,720
But your teeth are a bit black.

705
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,920
Well, not just a bit, but very.
How about I brush them for you?

706
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,720
-I will do it for you too, Perm.
-No, miss.

707
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,600
I will help.

708
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,160
Goodness.

709
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,720
You two can come here.

710
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,680
Just ignore them
and give me a hand instead.

711
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,400
I guess it will be
just the two of us for the meal.

712
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,000
It must be almost five o'clock now.
I don't think he's coming.

713
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,920
Could you pass me the pan?

714
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,000
Please go ahead.

715
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,000
Can I start now?

716
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,560
I should get going, Pudtarn.

717
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,960
Goodbye.

718
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,680
Please leave this to me.

719
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,160
That man didn't keep his word.

720
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,040
No more appointments from now on.
I will never accept them.

721
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,400
Does your lord always flip
his script like this?

722
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,880
What did you say, miss?

723
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,960
Flip his script.

724
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,640
I asked if Baron Maharit

725
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,400
always flips his script.

726
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,680
If so, then just say it, Eung.
No one will hear you.

727
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,800
I won't tell him you said it,

728
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,000
but if I see him,

729
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,640
I will turn him into a vegetable.
Just wait and see.

730
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,160
What are you going to do?

731
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,600
I don't know.
All I know is I won't spare him.

732
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,560
What is it?
Are you worried about him, Eung?

733
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,760
You don't have to be.

734
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,880
He will be dead. I assure you.

735
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,720
Why? Is he here?

736
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,120
Is he behind me?

737
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,280
Yes, miss.

738
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,320
Baron.

739
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,520
Yes.

740
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:03,880
Did I surprise you?

741
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,000
Why would I be surprised?

742
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,360
I knew you would come.

743
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,440
You're too nice to stand me up.

744
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,480
Wait.

745
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,920
Am I hearing it wrong?

746
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,680
Did you really say that?

747
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,560
Well, you heard me. Why do you doubt me?

748
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,120
I'm questioning you

749
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,560
because what you said
differs from what I heard earlier.

750
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,920
Perm, the silver barbs.

751
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,560
Now.

752
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,960
Wait.

753
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,560
What are you upset about?

754
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,360
You keep telling lies.

755
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,880
This isn't the first time
you have done this.

756
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,280
You change your words as easily

757
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,880
as the wind changes direction.

758
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,280
I won't listen to you anymore.

759
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,200
You're hungry.

760
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,200
Are you hungry, my lord?

761
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,120
I'm not a baby.
You can't manipulate me with food.

762
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,880
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

763
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,800
There you go. I knew it.

764
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,720
But I shall not have your food.

765
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,120
And whose food are you going to eat?
What other food is there?

766
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,720
Answer me.

767
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,920
Well, I…

768
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,400
I can't answer you.

769
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,800
I don't know.

770
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,920
If you don't know, then listen to me.

771
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,280
Come here.

772
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,440
Sit over here.

773
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,240
Wait for me here.

774
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,560
Sit down and chill out
while you wait for your food.

775
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,000
My food is delicious, I'm telling you.

776
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,920
You will love it.

777
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
If there is the Michelin Guide here,
I would get a star

778
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,120
or if it were the Thai version,
I'd get recommended.

779
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,920
I don't want to listen to you anymore.

780
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,800
Sit here. Don't go anywhere.

781
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,440
Wait for me.

782
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,840
Please wait for me.

783
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,680
Please, my lord?

784
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,920
Eung, come here.

785
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,200
Yes, my lord.

786
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,160
Come closer.

787
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,960
I'm not going to kill you.

788
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,320
If I were to do something to anyone,

789
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,760
it wouldn't be you I did it to.

790
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,720
Yes, my lord. It would be my mistress.

791
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,560
Yes, that's right.

792
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,800
I need to ask you something.

793
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,240
Baron Chunphubet,

794
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,960
how often does he come here?

795
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,600
I see.

796
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,160
Stop doing that right now, Eung.

797
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,160
Not as often as you do, my lord.

798
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,600
Don't compare him to me.

799
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,320
Just him alone,

800
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,440
how often does he come?

801
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,080
Well, he has only been here once
on his own.

802
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,720
Eung!

803
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,280
Yes, miss.

804
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,360
This smells so good.

805
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,480
Rice with omelet?

806
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,800
You know it?

807
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,840
Is this all you made for me?

808
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,800
Is this not enough?

809
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,360
I saw…

810
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,880
what you two had just now.

811
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,720
You had fried fish, pad kaprao,

812
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,240
curry, tom yum soup, and chili paste.

813
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,920
While you were sneaking around,

814
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,720
you must have been drooling, I imagine.

815
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,840
That's right.

816
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,480
I saw you were hungry
and I didn't have time to cook all that.

817
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,880
You would have starved to death.

818
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,520
Please try this. It's good.

819
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,280
It's no ordinary rice with omelet.

820
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,360
-How?
-Do you want to know?

821
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,480
Yes.

822
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,160
-Eat it.
-No.

823
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,320
Eat it and I will tell you.

824
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,080
Please, my sweet lord.

825
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,480
Here you go. Open your mouth.

826
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,760
Eat it. Open your mouth.

827
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,920
Don't be shy. It's normal.

828
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,120
Open up.

829
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,680
Eat it.

830
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,680
Good boy.

831
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,160
Take this. Eung.

832
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,640
Bring His Lordship some water.

833
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,880
I'm going to prepare some fish to cook.
I have visitors tomorrow.

834
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,880
Your chili garlic fish sauce.

835
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,480
Perm, you can go. Don't watch me eat.

836
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,000
Is it good, my lord?

837
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,440
Well, yes.

838
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,440
It's different from what
I have had before.

839
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,160
Go.

840
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,600
I was hungry, so I ate all of it.

841
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,000
What's so funny?

842
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,560
You're funny.

843
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,880
Eung, bring it here.

844
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,880
Do I have to sit?

845
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,560
Sit on the floor right here.

846
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,440
Yes, sir.

847
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,640
This is a real sword,

848
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,920
and these are the wooden ones
we will use for practice.

849
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,360
I'm going to put the swords on the trays.

850
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,400
Consider this
a simplified wai khru ceremony.

851
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,800
You're a woman,
so we need not take it too seriously.

852
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,840
I won't teach you much

853
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:09,080
as you won't be able to fight a man
in an actual duel anyway.

854
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,640
But you might be able to escape.

855
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,200
If not, you could use something
to fight with other than a sword

856
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,560
if you're in trouble.

857
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,160
When are you going to sit so I can start?

858
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,760
What are you going to do?

859
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,640
Well, I'm going to pay respect to you.

860
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,760
Who said you need to do it to me?

861
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,760
Do it to the swords.

862
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,560
How was I supposed to know that?

863
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,360
I think it would be fine
to pay respect to you,

864
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,840
seeing as you're going to teach me.

865
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,560
You will be my master.

866
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,200
I don't want to argue with you.

867
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,280
Perm, light the incense.

868
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,840
Yes, my lord.

869
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,640
Homage to the Blessed One, the Worthy One,
the Perfectly Self-awakened One.

870
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,840
Homage to the Blessed One, the Worthy One,
the Perfectly Self-awakened One.

871
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,800
Homage to the Blessed One, the Worthy One,
the Perfectly Self-awakened One.

872
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,400
Why are they doing it in the forest?

873
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,520
I know.

874
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,720
I won't get to watch.

875
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,520
Gosh.

876
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,040
Hey.

877
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,800
Why do we have to walk so far?

878
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,160
And why is it just the two of us?

879
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,160
Perm wants to watch.

880
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,480
You must not reveal
your sword techniques to others.

881
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,160
This place is suitable.

882
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,640
Pick the sword up.

883
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,720
Put it on me.

884
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,800
Pick the sword up.

885
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,640
Have you ever held a sword?

886
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,160
I will show you.

887
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,240
Forward, gather,

888
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,200
lift, dance,

889
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,800
turn, tug,

890
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,400
down, and pinch.

891
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,560
Forward, gather,

892
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,160
lift, dance…

893
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,280
Stop it.

894
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,440
Is that not right?

895
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,360
Lift your sword up.

896
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,960
You cannot use one hand.

897
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,240
You are a woman.
You are not as strong as a man.

898
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,120
If you hold it in one hand,
the sword will fall from your hand

899
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,560
with the slightest knock.

900
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,480
You must use both hands.

901
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,560
This feels better.

902
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,480
Watch me.

903
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,920
Set yourself.

904
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,520
Like this.

905
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,880
Try it.

906
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,640
What?

907
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,840
Why are you laughing?

908
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,400
I'm laughing at myself.

909
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,080
I remembered the first technique,

910
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,560
but I forgot it when I was about
to practice the second one.

911
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,880
I guess I'll forget the second one
when I learn the third one.

912
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,720
So I laughed at myself.

913
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,520
Swordsmanship isn't easy.

914
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,080
When the time comes,

915
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,640
the surprise will make you
forget the techniques.

916
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,280
Therefore, you have to practice
until your body remembers them.

917
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,160
Do you understand?

918
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,560
Yes, I do. I used to do a bit of Aikido.

919
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,520
I had to make my body memorize it
through practice as well.

920
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,240
Aikido?

921
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,040
What is it like?

922
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,920
I've told you this before.

923
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,880
It's a close-contact fighting technique

924
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,120
for self-defense
when someone tries to abduct you.

925
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,840
Would you like to learn it?

926
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,360
I can teach you for free.
No ceremonies needed.

927
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,000
What are you talking about?

928
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,640
Who would abduct me?

929
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:24,080
Well, you must have women
trying to snatch you away

930
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,720
with that oppa face of yours.

931
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,280
Oppa?

932
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,360
What is that?

933
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,720
Oppa. It means you're good-looking.

934
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:48,120
No woman is as bold as you.

935
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:49,920
The other day,

936
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,240
a criminal fell right in front of you,

937
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,280
but you stood there looking at him
without fainting.

938
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,240
So you won't argue
about being good-looking,

939
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:02,000
but instead infer that I'm hard-hearted?

940
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,120
I get it.

941
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,360
At my house, there is a looking glass.

942
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,840
I get to see myself sometimes.

943
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,640
Yes, you're so handsome.

944
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,360
That's enough for today.

945
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,400
You're still new to this,
so it can make you sore.

946
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,280
After this,

947
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,880
you must practice often.

948
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,360
In a few days, I will come and see

949
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,720
if your arm strength and postures

950
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,320
are good enough.

951
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,640
The Lantern Festival is in a few days.

952
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,240
Would you like to go? I can take you.

953
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:57,800
No, thank you.

954
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,279
I'm taking Prang and Keaw there anyway.

955
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,120
You just came here.
You won't have seen many places.

956
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:25,640
I said I would take care of you,
so I want to take you there.

957
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:29,840
I don't like going out.
I prefer lazing around.

958
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,240
I have never met anyone like you.

959
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:34,760
You're a woman,

960
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:37,240
but you're saying loud and clear
that you like to laze around.

961
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,200
You really are something.

962
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:42,319
Well, I don't know why I should pretend.

963
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:44,120
I like to tend to my garden

964
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,160
and lie down for some rest after I'm done.

965
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:50,680
You need to rest when you are tired.
What's the point of going anywhere?

966
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,800
You look surprised. Don't you understand?

967
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,319
You spoke too fast.

968
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,920
I like to sleep, not travel.

969
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,240
I'm not going.

970
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:02,600
As you please.

971
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,200
What brings you back, Baron In?

972
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:17,240
Are you leaving, Rid?

973
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:18,800
-No.
-Yes.

974
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:23,120
What? Aren't you leaving yet?

975
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:52,080
Seeing both of you together is a blessing.

976
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,480
You should come every day for a blessing.

977
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,720
I shall be waiting.

978
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,800
Your dear Ming is right there.

979
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,800
Are you hurrying off to see Lady Praejeen?

980
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,680
Even if Rid takes Pudtarn as a wife,

981
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,800
I shall continue to await
Rid's royally-bestowed wife.

982
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,920
-The necklace.
-Klin.

983
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,680
Where have you been?
And where are you going?

984
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,880
Will my men and I have the chance

985
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,880
to enjoy a meal here again today?

986
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,560
Boiled vegetables topped with coconut milk
served with shrimp paste chili sauce

987
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,840
and fried silver barb, my lord.

988
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,800
I'm going to pass a law

989
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,480
prohibiting the catching and eating
of silver barb for three months.

990
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,760
What are your thoughts?

991
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,800
-Take this.
-My goodness!

992
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,280
No!

993
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,440
Hey.

994
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,480
Take this!

995
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,440
Mun is outnumbered.

996
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:23,480
