1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,040
Do you intend to stay here
or in a separate house?

2
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,240
She can build one for you.

3
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,400
I want to stay here.

4
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,160
I'll make sure you want to leave.

5
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,640
I'm not scared of you.

6
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,760
I don't want anything to happen to Mother,

7
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,560
Take the manuscript chest to Song Kwae.

8
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,280
I need to find that book.

9
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,360
About our encounter with that lady,

10
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,280
I forbid anyone
from telling Father and Mother.

11
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,000
I didn't lose my book.

12
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,440
You took it!

13
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,720
I will visit Gui's residence tomorrow

14
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,840
so we can talk about this thoroughly.

15
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,720
The baron would not know.

16
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,520
She will go tomorrow for sure.

17
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,240
Sure about what?

18
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,600
I understand you both.

19
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,400
You wish for Mother to see this woman,

20
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,240
do you not?

21
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,840
If she found out about her,

22
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,240
before you even had time to blink,

23
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,520
she would go see her.

24
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,040
Don't you agree?

25
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
Pin?

26
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,000
-Yaem.
-What?

27
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,320
You answer him.

28
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,120
I asked you, Pin.

29
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,160
I could not possibly know.

30
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
I could not possibly know either.

31
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,640
As you do not know,

32
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,280
feel free to find out.

33
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,320
You may inform Mother now.

34
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,720
She will want you
to escort her there immediately.

35
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,160
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

36
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,720
That woman will surely

37
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,360
mention the Krishna Kali Manuscript

38
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,400
and that I took it.

39
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
And then,

40
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,640
Mother will question me about it

41
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,360
and I will have to answer.

42
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,519
Am I right?

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
-You are right.
-You are right.

44
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,560
Say I were Mother.

45
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,760
Listen carefully, you two.

46
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,120
If I were Mother,

47
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,680
I would wish to know

48
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,400
whether touching
the Krishna Kali Manuscript

49
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,120
would cause me to collapse or faint

50
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,640
or whether my spirit would suddenly
leave my body, as it did last time.

51
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,240
We would not have Grandfather
to help recall her spirit this time.

52
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,680
Mother's spirit…

53
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,600
I mean,

54
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,200
my spirit… No.

55
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,520
That is not right.

56
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,280
Let me be frank with you.

57
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
You see,

58
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,080
Mother's spirit

59
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,360
would not be able to return.

60
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
My siblings and I

61
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,360
would be left

62
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,360
motherless.

63
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,560
-We won't tell her.
-We won't tell her.

64
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,640
What could possibly happen?

65
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,280
You may tell her.

66
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,680
What should we do, Yaem?

67
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,640
You always do the thinking.

68
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,080
Why are you asking me?

69
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,800
You should think as well.

70
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,240
I always have to do the thinking.

71
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,720
Not this time though.

72
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,320
-I won't either.
-I shall no longer think.

73
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
-I shall not either.
-No more.

74
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,920
-I shall not.
-I shall no more.

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,760
-I won't…
-I shall think for you.

76
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,120
-Well, Prik…
-Well, Prik…

77
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,240
There is no need. I heard everything.

78
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,000
Do you understand our dilemma, Prik?

79
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,320
Well?

80
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,000
Maybe you just heard bits. Did you?

81
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,040
I only heard that
the baron could be left motherless.

82
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,280
Prik, what are your thoughts?

83
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,000
Well…

84
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,880
I have none.

85
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,640
-What?
-What?

86
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,800
-What?
-What?

87
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,040
Do whatever it takes to ensure that

88
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,400
the baron is not left without a mother.

89
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
-What?
-What?

90
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,360
You do it.

91
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,600
What should I say?

92
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,040
You do it.

93
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
You do it.

94
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,920
-You.
-You.

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,280
-You.
-You.

96
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,600
You two.

97
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,880
-Yes, my lady?
-Yes, my lady?

98
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,480
If you have something
to say to me, say it.

99
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,280
Why do you hesitate?

100
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,880
It's nothing.

101
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,120
Are you comfortable, my lady?

102
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,320
I don't believe you.

103
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,440
Please believe us.

104
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,280
Are you comfortable?

105
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,520
Never mind.

106
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,680
Then I shall not force you,
press you, beg you, or plead with you.

107
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,160
It's fine if you don't tell me.

108
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,160
If anything should happen,
I would have nothing to do with it.

109
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,720
It's the right thing to do, Yaem.

110
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,720
I think so too, Pin.

111
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,640
This way,

112
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,800
-the baron will still have a mother.
-The baron will still have a mother.

113
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
-Oh, dear.
-Oh, dear.

114
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,600
Miss, do not leave.

115
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,000
Do not go there.

116
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,240
Miss.

117
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,000
Miss.

118
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,360
Miss, goodness.

119
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,000
Miss.

120
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,560
Goodness.

121
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,440
What's the matter, Eung?

122
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,160
Can't you go on your own?

123
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,640
I am afraid.

124
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,920
What are you afraid of?

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,960
I am afraid of being dragged
to another realm.

126
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,440
What?

127
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,400
Well, you said

128
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,200
you used to be in one place,

129
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,200
and all of a sudden, you ended up here.

130
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,560
Did you not?

131
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,520
That is why I am so afraid.

132
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,720
If that happens to anyone,
it will be me, not you.

133
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,520
Why would it not happen to me?

134
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,880
Fine, you don't have to come with me.

135
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,240
But if I disappear,

136
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,320
you can tell Madam Gui for me
that I returned to heaven.

137
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,840
But you

138
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,320
should be careful.

139
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,440
She won't spare you.

140
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,920
Oh, dear.

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,560
Poor Eung.

142
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,240
Prepare to die.

143
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Let's go.

144
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,920
Go where?

145
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,040
I shall go with you, miss.

146
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,160
Perfect.

147
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,720
Have you found it?

148
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,600
No. Have you found anything, Eung?

149
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,040
I do not know what we are looking for.

150
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,320
I might have found it already

151
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,000
and discarded it.

152
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,320
Hey!

153
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,400
This is it! I found it!

154
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,840
This is more than what Madam Gui gave me.

155
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,840
It's bigger.

156
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,200
The one from Madam Gui was one fueang.

157
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,320
One piece is one fueang.

158
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,440
And this one?

159
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,440
Just come closer.

160
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,800
This one is a quarter.

161
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,480
Just a quarter.

162
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,320
Gosh. So big yet only worth a quarter.

163
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,680
But the symbol on this one

164
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,760
looks like a lotus flower.

165
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,920
I wonder what symbol
Madam Gui's piece had.

166
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,760
The Urna symbol.

167
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
What does the Urna look like?
I've never heard of it.

168
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,080
Does it look like…

169
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,800
this one?

170
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,240
Yes, miss.

171
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,080
Each king has their own symbol.

172
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,840
For King Tai Sra,

173
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,200
it is a lotus flower.

174
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,960
Come here.

175
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Eung.

176
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,520
Watch me.

177
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,240
See? We won't disappear.

178
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,360
Oh, dear.

179
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,400
I don't want to stay here.

180
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,000
I want to go home.

181
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,920
Can you take me home?

182
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,320
Miss.

183
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,080
Miss.

184
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,760
I'm fine. I'm okay now.

185
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
Miss,

186
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,600
what is the matter?

187
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,800
I'm okay now.

188
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,160
Let us return home.

189
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,520
Goodness.

190
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,320
Come on.

191
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,840
Eung.

192
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,280
Yes, miss?

193
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,040
It seems I will be here for a long time.
I don't know how long.

194
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,760
Madam Gui asked you to accompany me

195
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,560
in this place I know nothing about.

196
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,920
You are my first teacher.

197
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,720
My first friend.

198
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,760
No, miss.

199
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,160
Friends walk together side by side.

200
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,560
I'm counting on you.

201
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,040
You're counting on me?

202
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,120
What do you mean by that?

203
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,200
You'll see.

204
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,680
I cannot.

205
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,040
I truly cannot.

206
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,480
Come on.

207
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,200
Is this it,

208
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,680
the Krishna Kali Manuscript

209
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,000
Pudtarn wishes to have?

210
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,720
If I remember correctly,

211
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,040
Father said that

212
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,280
this manuscript has been handed down
through our family. Is that correct?

213
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,320
Prang,

214
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
hold your tongue and mind your words.

215
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,360
If Father were to learn of it,
it would cause quite a fuss.

216
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,680
Choi said

217
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,480
Father buried this chest himself

218
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,800
to prevent Mother from touching it.

219
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,319
Choi also told me that

220
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
before the four of us were born,

221
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,119
Mother touched the book,

222
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,319
causing her spirit
to leave her body for days.

223
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,520
Fortunately, at that time,

224
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,760
Grandfather and Father were there

225
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,319
to help chant mantras
to recall her spirit.

226
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,400
If it were to happen

227
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,880
once more,

228
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,800
I am not certain

229
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,720
I would be able
to help Father recall her spirit.

230
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,080
It sounds so scary.

231
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,640
Both of you are able to touch it.

232
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,800
I must be able to as well.

233
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,040
Prang.

234
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,320
You must never do that again.

235
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,520
That startled me.

236
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,880
It felt as if I was pricked
by a wave of needles.

237
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,600
Given the state of things,

238
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,800
I shall take it to Song Kwae.

239
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,480
If I take it there

240
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,680
and that woman inquires about it,

241
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,280
what will you tell her?

242
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,840
I shall not lie.

243
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,920
I shall tell her the truth.

244
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,120
In any case, it belongs to us.

245
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,600
Our ancestors have preserved it
for generations.

246
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,640
If I remember correctly,

247
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,680
Father said that

248
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,120
this manuscript has been passed down

249
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,680
the Brahmin family of ours
for thousands of years.

250
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,200
How could it belong to her?

251
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,120
If she insists that it belongs to her,

252
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,080
she is a barefaced liar.

253
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,960
I think

254
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,560
you should tell Father
about this manuscript immediately

255
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,960
and try asking Mother about Pudtarn.

256
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,480
She resembles Mother so closely,

257
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,360
it cannot be a coincidence.

258
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
If she were just similar to Mother,

259
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,400
one might assume they were not related.

260
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,920
But the fact is

261
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,320
they resemble each other
as if they are family.

262
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,760
Her manner of speaking
also resembles that of Mother.

263
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,000
She is like no other woman in Ayutthaya.

264
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,280
Except for…

265
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,160
Prang and Keaw.

266
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,440
Their manner of speaking is so peculiar
that it wears Grandmother out.

267
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,360
What?

268
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,480
Why are you bringing it back to me?

269
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,520
Let us discuss Pudtarn.

270
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,720
It seems that she's refusing to let us go.

271
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,280
How do you propose

272
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,080
to resolve this matter?

273
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,680
That hurt.

274
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,480
When I met her,

275
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,440
the sky darkened in the middle of the day

276
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,520
as if foretelling a misfortune.

277
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,800
I am afraid

278
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,040
that she might bring trouble to our home.

279
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,160
So I believe

280
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,280
it would be wise
not to associate with her.

281
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,360
It's most suspicious.

282
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,320
It could be dark magic cast by someone

283
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,840
who intends us harm.

284
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,160
That is why I shall not tell Mother
about their resemblance, Ruang.

285
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,880
It is a matter of consideration.

286
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,600
In that case,

287
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,280
I shall be responsible

288
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,680
for taking this manuscript
to Phitsanulok for safekeeping.

289
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
Keaw.

290
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,440
Keaw, did Grandmother see you?

291
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,800
I massaged her until she fell asleep.

292
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,600
How might I have entered here
so chilled otherwise?

293
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,720
What a relief.

294
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,280
I am so tired of it.

295
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,480
Why is it uncustomary

296
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,000
for brothers and sisters
to enter each other's rooms?

297
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,400
Why is it this way?

298
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,240
"You are a woman of maturity.

299
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,360
It would not be proper to enter
a gentleman's sleeping chambers.

300
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,600
Even if he is your brother,

301
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,360
it would not present well.

302
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,360
Keaw, you must listen
to your grandmother."

303
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,080
Indeed.

304
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,760
She has persistently filled our ears
with this since our youth.

305
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,000
I am weary of it, for goodness' sake.

306
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,240
A knock for being mischievous, Prang.

307
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,760
You did this again.

308
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,960
-Want me to hit you again?
-That is enough.

309
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,560
Yes, Madam Gui.

310
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,400
You appear quite different.

311
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
This is Perm.

312
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,240
He will be at your service.

313
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,040
Once your house is completed,

314
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,800
Perm and Eung shall live with you

315
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,800
to assist with meal preparation
and sleeping arrangements.

316
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,000
These two are good, honest people.

317
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,520
You may rely on them.

318
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,400
Feel free to ask them any questions.

319
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,160
You have come all the way
from your home to this place.

320
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,800
It is only natural
that you may feel lonely,

321
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,080
even if you are an angel.

322
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,120
I want you to be comfortable.

323
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,360
Trouble yourself with nothing.

324
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,440
Pay her no mind.

325
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,240
She has lost both her father and mother.

326
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,480
She is fortunate to have me

327
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,840
to support her and provide for her.

328
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,840
Do not listen to her.

329
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,760
She is even like that with me.

330
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,440
Perm.

331
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,160
Tomorrow, ensure you have
all the required tools prepared.

332
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,960
-Take three or four people.
-Yes, ma'am.

333
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Build a fine hut.

334
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,920
Make her comfortable.

335
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,000
May Buddha protect you.

336
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,120
Why did you pull me?

337
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,240
I did not, miss.

338
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,040
Eung.

339
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,680
Do what you can to prevent it.

340
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,200
Do not allow Klin
to stir trouble with Pudtarn.

341
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,280
What is the matter?

342
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,920
I cannot do that.

343
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,200
Please prevent Miss Klin yourself, ma'am.

344
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,000
I am afraid of her hands and feet.

345
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,600
Between her and me,

346
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,280
whom do you fear more?

347
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,920
You, ma'am.

348
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,200
Must I say any more?

349
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Well?

350
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,640
Must I?

351
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,280
No, ma'am.

352
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,160
May fortune be with you.

353
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:55,280
KING TAI SRA

354
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,160

363
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,800
I am grateful to all of you

364
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,360
who labor to serve the kingdom under me.

365
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,920
I express my gratitude to my wife

366
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,760
and my children, Narenthon,

367
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,400

368
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,000
I also entrust my three sons

369
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,640
to your care.

370
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,840
I am grateful

371
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,120
to my brother, the Crown Prince.

372
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,840
I thank you for your loyalty to me.

373
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,600
I pledge my loyalty to Your Majesty.

374
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,920
You are my brother. We grew up together.

375
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,400
I am grateful for the loyalty

376
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,480
you have shown me.

377
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,000
I vow that

378
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,440
you shall never need to doubt my devotion

379
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,360
and loyalty, Your Majesty.

380
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,560
I'm still new to this throne

381
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,680
and to affairs of government.

382
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,880
I did not have much time to prepare

383
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,760
owing to the fact that my father,
the former king,

384
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,800
passed away too soon.

385
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,040
He reigned for just shy of six years.

386
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,880
Therefore, I request your cooperation

387
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,080
and the kindness

388
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,360
you may extend to me.

389
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,960
I have the Chancellor of Defense,

390
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,840
the Chancellor of Interior,

391
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,200
Ministers of the Four Pillars,

392
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,440
City, Palace, Treasury, and Agriculture.

393
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,120
I consider each of you
as a pillar of the throne.

394
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,960
Especially Kosathibodi.

395
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,120
For your management of trade
between Ayutthaya and foreign lands,

396
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,920
which generates income

397
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
for the betterment
of our kingdom and its people,

398
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,960
is indeed challenging.

399
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,840
Your Majesty.

400
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,800
Trade with the foreigners,

401
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,320
though it endures,

402
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,080
is not thriving as it did

403
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,360
during the reign of your father,
the Tiger King,

404
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,280
and that of your grandfather,
King Phetracha,

405
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,800
when it flourished,

406
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,920
particularly with the Dutch.

407
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,080
If that is the case,

408
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,080
new measures are required,

409
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,280
are they not?

410
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

411
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,880
I am considering trade with China.

412
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,320
China has expressed an interest

413
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,640
in a large quantity
of forest commodities from Ayutthaya

414
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,560
as well as rice.

415
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,200
As much as we have available,
China is willing to purchase it,

416
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,200
Your Majesty.

417
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,040
Excellent.

418
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,240
I am grateful to you, treasurer.

419
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,760
And we have

420
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,600
Crown Prince Bhorn,

421
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,600
who represents the Front Palace.

422
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,880
Among the members of the royal family,

423
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,800
my uncle, Prince Dum, is the most senior,

424
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,080
and he shall be my eyes and ears.

425
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,160
And I have my trusted royal pages.

426
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,400
Ratchanukul,

427
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,200
Chit Phuban,

428
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,520
Srisornrarak,

429
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,320
Maharit,

430
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,400
Chunphubet.

431
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,560
I regard these five

432
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,000
as my brothers,

433
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,040
friends,

434
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,080
and companions.

435
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,960
I deem my throne to be secure.

436
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,400
May I speak, Your Majesty.

437
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,640
Horathibodi,

438
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,120
do you intend to discuss
the water-drinking ceremony of allegiance?

439
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,760
Yes, Your Majesty.
As the tradition accords.

440
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,880
I do not deem it urgent.

441
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,520
We shall wait for an auspicious time.

442
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,880
Though even at the most auspicious times,

443
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,080
the stability of the throne

444
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,080
is not contingent on mere cups of water,

445
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,880
no matter how sacred the water may be.

446
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,920
I have cleared the land.
We are ready for piling, ma'am.

447
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,280
Get to work.

448
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,040
Yes, miss.

449
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,000
Let's get to work.

450
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,480
Perm, buddy.

451
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,360
Yes, miss.

452
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,120
Why do you address me

453
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,360
as if we are equals?

454
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,480
Never mind that.

455
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,720
How many pillars will there be altogether?

456
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,320
Six pillars, miss.

457
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,720
That's it, miss.

458
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,240
Perm, add a double-layered roof

459
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,720
and a porch too.

460
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,200
It cannot be done.

461
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,520
No one builds a double-layered roof.

462
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
What's your name?

463
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,440
-Perm.
-That should be easy for you then.

464
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,000
Double-layered roof.

465
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,400
-No one does that, do they?
-No.

466
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,080
Perm.

467
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,480
What's the matter? Why are you startled?

468
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
Please…

469
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,960
listen to me.

470
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,960
How long will it take?

471
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,159
Four days, miss.

472
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,239
The foundations will take one day.

473
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,680
Go down!

474
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,440
Go down!

475
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
-What?
-Please come down.

476
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,240
This is not a woman's job.

477
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,840
Please…

478
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,240
I'm down now, so get on with it.

479
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,200
Yes, miss.

480
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
Perm.

481
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,400
Are you building the walls?

482
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,600
Yes, miss.

483
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,120
Make a door for me on this side.

484
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
A door?

485
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,000
What for?

486
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,800
I want to build a bathroom and toilet
extending from there.

487
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,640
A bathroom?

488
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,400
What is it?

489
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,520
It's the room where you bathe

490
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,240
and where you…

491
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,760
Where you piss and pass stool?

492
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,680
Yes.

493
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,400
Perm, she wants us
to build the privy here.

494
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,000
-The privy!
-Why?

495
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,280
Why? Let's talk about this first.

496
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,200
Eung?

497
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,240
What?

498
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,000
What is happening here?

499
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,720
Why can't I do it?

500
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,720
No one does it that way.

501
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,000
It's more convenient.
I don't have to go into the forest.

502
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,320
In case snakes or tigers

503
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,320
or other creatures are out there,
I will be safe.

504
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,920
Safety is the top priority.

505
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,360
It will also meet hygiene
and public health standards.

506
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,520
It'll be clean and not be
a breeding ground for germs.

507
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,440
Did that leave you stunned?

508
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,160
You're at a loss for words, aren't you?

509
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,320
Do you understand now?

510
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,360
Understand what?

511
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,120
That it's a necessity.

512
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,640
What is it?

513
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,080
What? The toilet of course.

514
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,680
What toilet?

515
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,840
What is it called again, Eung?

516
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,000
The privy, miss.

517
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
Right.

518
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,840
The privy.

519
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,880
Look.

520
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,400
Listen to me.

521
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,000
No one builds a privy
inside the house or too near to it.

522
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,320
It is deemed unclean,

523
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,480
which may taint the spirit of the house.

524
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,720
This would lead
to neither success nor prosperity.

525
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,560
The residents would fall ill
or suffer an early death.

526
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,120
These people will not build it for you.

527
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,760
Do not get your hopes up.

528
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,800
Ever.

529
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,760
Remember that.

530
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,600
Blast it!

531
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,520
Blast…

532
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,200
I'm disappointed.

533
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,160
Hey.

534
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,240
Is he leaving?

535
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,080
Hey, wait!

536
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,520
Wait!

537
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,440
Wait!

538
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,280
Hey, wait! Come back!

539
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,880
Come back! Come back right now!

540
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,000
Give me the Krishna Kali Manuscript!

541
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,880
Wait!

542
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,080
So Perm,

543
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,160
how is the assembly
of Pudtarn's house proceeding?

544
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,480
We are making the floor, ma'am.

545
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,960
How are you making the floor?

546
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,920
As any person would.

547
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,120
And how is that?

548
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,960
Goodness, Perm.

549
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,240
Do not act like a fool now.

550
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,880
Split cane flooring, ma'am.

551
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,880
Get some timber to make the floor.

552
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,200
Do not use the split cane.

553
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,200
Grandma.

554
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,440
Is that not too much?

555
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,720
Can't she sit on cane flooring?

556
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,840
Why not?

557
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,520
Would she get splinters in her bottom?

558
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,960
Stay out of this.

559
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,080
Perm.

560
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,040
Come here.

561
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,120
No, Grandma.

562
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,280
If you build her timber flooring,

563
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,000
I shall become Song's wife.

564
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,520
I shall no longer stay with you.

565
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,640
I shall leave and never return.

566
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,080
You may build her four or five rooms

567
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,080
with timber flooring if you wish.

568
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,840
Then let it be known

569
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,560
that you threw

570
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,640
your own granddaughter

571
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,640
onto the streets

572
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,920
while you allowed that leech

573
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,600
to strut around in her house.

574
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,480
Would Song let his wife
live on the streets?

575
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,880
Do not meddle.

576
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,920
I am not talking to you.

577
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,720
I'm not talking to you either.

578
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,360
I am talking to myself.

579
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,680
-I should slap you.
-Stop!

580
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,800
Klin.

581
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,840
The angel entrusted her to me.

582
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,440
How could we allow an angel's kin
to sleep on a cane floor?

583
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,560
Grandma, please stop.

584
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,640
What angel's child?

585
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,600
Where's the filthy hole
you crawled out of?

586
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,880
Where?

587
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,720
Klin.

588
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,320
Have some sympathy.

589
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,880
You sleep on a mattress
inside a mosquito net.

590
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,960
It would not be too much
to let her sleep on a timber floor.

591
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,120
No, I shall not stand for it.

592
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,480
I can sleep on a cane floor.

593
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,640
Pudtarn.

594
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,280
I can do it. I'll be fine.

595
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,920
It is not comfortable
to sleep on a cane floor.

596
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,000
What does a split cane look like, Gui?

597
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,280
Do you not know, you fool?

598
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,360
So…

599
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,480
How do you not know what it is?

600
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,800
I do know.

601
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,560
I just want to make sure.

602
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,440
I see.

603
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,560
It's fine.

604
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,000
Do you see, Grandma?

605
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,800
She knows that she is a leech
and this is all she deserves.

606
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,760
Enough, Klin.

607
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,720
You could provoke the angel's anger.

608
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,440
Gosh, you are gullible.

609
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,960
Perm.

610
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,520
Hurry now.

611
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,160
So…

612
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,840
What is it?

613
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,200
The floor… How shall--

614
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,280
Cane. Is that not clear?

615
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,480
Do you wish to start a war?

616
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,080
No, ma'am.

617
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,800
Miss, here is your water.

618
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,560
The house is almost finished.
Why hasn't that baron come by?

619
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:06,960
Perm.

620
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,960
Yes, miss.

621
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,440
Can you extend the roof over here?

622
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,480
Extend it?

623
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,200
Why?

624
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,760
To stop the rain.

625
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,880
The rain won't get in.

626
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,800
You won't do anything I ask.
Whose house is it?

627
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,160
Isn't that right, Eung?

628
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,640
Yes, miss.

629
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,120
What should I do then?

630
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,760
Nothing, miss.

631
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,960
Why not?

632
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,040
It would be a waste of effort.

633
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,880
Have you gone mad?

634
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,760
Yelling loudly like this.

635
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,160
What are you doing here?

636
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,520
I am here against my will.

637
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,760
I am here only because
my grandmother made me.

638
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,760
Leave then.

639
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,880
She asked me to check on the progress
of the house she is building for you.

640
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,240
You leech.

641
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,520
Suddenly, you appeared
and latched onto my grandmother.

642
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,960
God knows where you strayed from.
And it appears you intend to stay a while.

643
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,280
When will you return
to where you came from?

644
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
I intend to stay until I die.

645
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,840
-You--
-Come at me!

646
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,800
Come at me!

647
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,080
I'll hit you back.

648
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,320
I'll hit you back hard.

649
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,720
You…

650
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,560
Do you want to try me?

651
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,960
-Let go!
-No, miss!

652
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,320
No!

653
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,720
Let go of me!

654
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,520
-No, miss!
-Let go!

655
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,440
Let go, Aun!

656
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,200
Come here.

657
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,560
Fine.

658
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,680
Aun.

659
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,240
Take everything back.

660
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,000
Take it all back!
Go back to where you came from!

661
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,080
I don't need it! I can find my own food!

662
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,440
That's a shame.

663
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,120
He caught one.

664
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,760
Is it a silver barb, Rid?

665
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,720
The end of the pond
is filled with silver barbs.

666
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,840
We rarely see any other fish.

667
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,720
George.

668
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,640
Yes, Rid?

669
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,400
Are you returning home today?

670
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,400
I suppose so.

671
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,200
Mother and Grandfather complained
I rarely returned home to see them.

672
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,240
I had the pleasure of tasting
his mother's desserts two days ago.

673
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,680
Thong yip,

674
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,440
thong yod,

675
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,200
foi thong, and med kanoon.

676
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,720
I took them to the kitchens
to be served as part of a royal meal.

677
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,760
I only wish to say that

678
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,800
they were invigoratingly sweet.

679
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,800
They are unrivaled.

680
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,160
They were truly the work
of a royal dessert chef.

681
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,400
George.

682
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,880
Please tell your mother

683
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,560
that her desserts smell and taste sweeter

684
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,880
and more delicious

685
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,800
than those made by anyone in Ayutthaya.

686
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,800
Do you both

687
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,760
share my opinion

688
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,960
that our king

689
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,840
seems unhappy?

690
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,400
I feel

691
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,920
sympathy for the king.

692
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,280
He has only just ascended the throne,
yet everything is disorderly.

693
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,520
All eyes are on him.

694
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,120
How heartbroken he must have been

695
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,960
when he learned that

696
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,400
his father, the Tiger King,

697
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,640
bestowed the throne to his brother,
Crown Prince Bhorn?

698
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,840
I imagine it was no small matter

699
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,680
because he had been the crown prince

700
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,680
who represented the Front Palace.

701
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,480
But he almost did not become king,

702
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,640
succeeding his father as is customary.

703
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,040
It is fortunate that
the brothers love each other.

704
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,160
Crown Prince Bhorn
gave up the throne for his brother.

705
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,720
Our master was able to inherit the throne.

706
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,240
Otherwise, our kingdom
would have been in chaos.

707
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,240
It would surely have been so.

708
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,040
He would not have tolerated it.

709
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,280
Neither would any of us.

710
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,480
I caught several silver barbs.

711
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,920
Take them to the kitchens.
Have them cooked for today's meal.

712
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

713
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,400
You may leave.

714
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,040
I am glad all of you are here.

715
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,520
I have been considering

716
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,760
issuing a royal decree
to establish this place,

717
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,640
the throne hall at the end of the pond,

718
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,520
as a restricted area that no one may enter

719
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,440
without prior permission.

720
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,800
What are your thoughts?

721
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,520
Would it not alert
the conspirators to the fact

722
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,480
that they are under suspicion,
Your Majesty?

723
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,600
Let them know I suspect them.

724
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,200
If I suspect them

725
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,320
and then I do not prohibit their entry,
that would be dishonest.

726
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,480
My hidden enemies

727
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,760
include not only Uncle Dum,

728
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,800
but also officials

729
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,640
and some of the royalty

730
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,720
who are ready to do
inappropriate things to me.

731
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,520
But Uncle Dum

732
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,880
is the main one.

733
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,600
I am not a king

734
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,160
who has acquired power and influence.

735
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,360
At times, I find myself discouraged,

736
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,680
yet at others, I am motivated to fight.

737
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,400
My constant wavering

738
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,840
is the reason I may seem unwell
or troubled.

739
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,880
I frequently feel
as though I am burning up.

740
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,760
Listen, all of you.

741
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,520
Worry not for me.

742
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,240
I can bear this.

743
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,560
Do you know why?

744
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,600
Because I have you all.

745
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,560
You, whom I regard as my brothers,

746
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,920
whom I know

747
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,120
would not allow me to fight alone.

748
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,600
In,

749
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,600
I have known you since you were a child.

750
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,040
Your father, Marquess Kosathibodi,

751
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,360
has served in the treasury
since my father's reign.

752
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,360
He has been a great asset
to Ayutthaya's economy.

753
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,480
Rid.

754
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

755
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,320
I remember

756
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,400
when my father was the crown prince,

757
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,400
he took me to your residence.

758
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,600
Though I was ten years older than you,

759
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,840
I was still eager to play with you,
a little child,

760
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,120
and your twin brother, Ruang.

761
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,280
As for you, George.

762
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,680
Because your mother

763
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,880
is a close friend of Lady Karaked,

764
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,680
the four of us, despite our varying ages,

765
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,480
were all able to play together.

766
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,560
Hey.

767
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,040
There is no need for such formalities.

768
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,560
Also, at your residence, Rid,

769
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,800
the food your mother made,

770
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,240
such as

771
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,120
grilled shrimp with that tasty sauce…

772
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,160
What is it called?

773
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,480
Seafood sauce, Your Majesty.

774
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,480
That's it.

775
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,960
Indeed.

776
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,440
What was even better
was the pork barbecue.

777
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,400
Am I right?

778
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,880
I remember

779
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,360
I learned how to use chopsticks
while eating pork barbecue that time.

780
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,760
What did your mother say?

781
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,880
The word that means

782
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,960
delicious?

783
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,720
"Yummy," Your Majesty.

784
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,080
Indeed.

785
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,640
Yummy.

786
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,560
Is that so? That is superb.

787
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,200
I shall prepare it for him again.

788
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,320
Or perhaps we could marinate some pork,

789
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,880
serve it with a spicy sauce,
and present that to the king.

790
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,680
What do you say, Pin, Yaem?

791
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,960
Oh, dear.

792
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,240
I must have Cheen Hong
make a new pan first.

793
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,000
Ours is too old now.

794
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,320
Commission him to make many, my lady.

795
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:05,960
I agree, my lady.

796
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,800
The pan we are using now is the 20th.

797
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,000
One for every year of Lord Rid's life.

798
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,160
Cheen Hong must make one a year.

799
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,320
He'll carry on until he dies, I suppose.

800
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,680
He's made more than 20.

801
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,360
I have given them as gifts
to many people over the years.

802
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,240
The king mentioned pork barbecue,

803
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,680
so I told him

804
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,240
we also eat it frequently at our house.

805
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,680
Lady Karaked

806
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,400
has probably given a barbecue pan

807
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,080
to everyone in Ayutthaya.

808
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,880
Lady Karaked's pork barbecue

809
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,240
is as good as your desserts, Mother.

810
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,440
My desserts may be known
for being enjoyed by all,

811
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,760
but the manner of eating them

812
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,680
is not as enjoyable
as that of pork barbecue.

813
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,120
Yes.

814
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,360
It is hot.

815
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,760
-Were you splattered?
-Be careful.

816
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,360
Rid teased me.

817
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,840
This piece is mine.

818
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,120
No one else is to touch it.

819
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,360
-Will you remember it?
-Yes.

820
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,080
It is all fat. You will put on weight.

821
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,640
I do not mind.

822
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,800
You let Lady Karaked
scare you into thinking that's bad.

823
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,040
Why must I not put on weight?

824
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,800
You will not be pretty.

825
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,760
It will be hard to walk.

826
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,480
Who cares?

827
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,720
That is more like it, Prik!

828
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,920
You must not care.

829
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:47,840
But I care.

830
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,240
I do not wish to become like…

831
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,760
Salee.

832
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,080
Bah! I shall say as Prik said.

833
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,720
I do not care!

834
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,960
What harm would it do

835
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,120
to have them eat in the kitchen?

836
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,280
Lady Champa.

837
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,520
The servants do everything for us.

838
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,600
We need not tire ourselves
with menial tasks.

839
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:30,160
They are not even related to us,
but they work tirelessly to serve us.

840
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,720
That is true.

841
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,200
Pin has cared for me my whole life.

842
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,760
Yaem has also cared for me.

843
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,320
She has cared for me every day

844
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,920
without taking any personal or sick leave.

845
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,680
She does not even care for her own niece.

846
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,640
Pin does not have a niece of her own.

847
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,480
Even if she did,
she would not care for her.

848
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,560
You are all influenced by your mother,
echoing her words.

849
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,920
Your manner of speaking is most peculiar.

850
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,200
Mother.

851
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,600
It's only when we eat pork barbecue.

852
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,560
On other days,

853
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,760
servants do not eat as our equals.

854
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,800
Rid,

855
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,760
were you all permitted
to return home today?

856
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,040
Yes, Father.

857
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,520
The king let us to come home.

858
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,000
In and George too.

859
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,480
He said we should return home
to let our fathers and mothers see us.

860
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,440
Very well, Chuang, you may join them.

861
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,200
Thank you, my lady.

862
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,520
Put the pork on.

863
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,000
Here.

864
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,200
The king is remarkably benevolent.

865
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,280
He inquired if the French have responded

866
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,560
regarding Father's investment with them,

867
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,600
which has yielded no returns.

868
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,000
What did you tell him?

869
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:26,000
There has been no response, has there?

870
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,520
I no longer hold out any hope.

871
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,280
You must not lose hope.

872
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,400
God shall make it happen.

873
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,440
Believe your father, Maria.

874
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,600
He and I pray every day.

875
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,520
It belongs to you.

876
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,320
God shall show mercy and return it to you.

877
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,280
George,

878
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,760
do your best as an official

879
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,880
to serve His Majesty.

880
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,920
He has shown you great kindness.

881
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,920
Even though…

882
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,240
Even though…

883
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,840
his father

884
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,880
was the person who killed my father.

885
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,840
Everyone

886
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,280
has different sides to their character.

887
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,600
Even those you think of as bad
can perform kind acts,

888
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,880
while good people

889
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,520
are not immune to mistakes.

890
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,520
That goes for your father too.

891
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,840
All of you.

892
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,400
Let's eat. Come on.

893
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,680
Thank you.

894
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,600
Eung, come here.

895
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,920
It's fine. We can eat together.

896
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,080
Come here.

897
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,960
Let's eat together, everyone.

898
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,760
There's no need for that.

899
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,800
Let's share the vegetables.

900
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,480
We only have one. Let's just share.

901
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,480
Do you want the head?

902
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,440
You can have this.

903
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:35,760
Thank you.

904
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,880
Miss Pudtarn.

905
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:32,720
Eung,

906
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,120
has no one come to see me?

907
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,440
Madam Gui asked us to bring these.

908
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Thank you.

909
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,680
Thank you.

910
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,080
Let me tell you, Perm.

911
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,480
Can you do one more thing for me?

912
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,880
Tarn,

913
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,400
we need to go now.

914
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,080
I've finished packing.
You're going to live with me.

915
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,800
This is no longer your home.

916
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,480
Wait.

917
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,440
Hey, won't you take anything with you?

918
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,400
I've only packed your clothes.

919
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,800
Thank you so much, Perm,

920
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,880
for building this house for me.

921
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,720
It's my first home.

922
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,800
Thank you too, Eung, for staying here

923
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,760
to keep me company.

924
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,800
Thank you, madam.

925
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,520
Why did you call me madam, not miss?

926
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,720
It's because you are now

927
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,640
the madam of the house.

928
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,360
I see, that's why you call me madam.

929
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,560
Indeed.

930
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,240
Thank you, Eung.

931
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:10,720
Perm.

932
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,840
Yes, ma'am.

933
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,640
Can you do something more for me?

934
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,160
Perm.

935
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,760
It's so cool. You did a great job.

936
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:43,520
Perm.

937
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,359
You used the timber for the floor.

938
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,160
Will this not cause a problem with Klin?

939
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,520
I did not use the timber
for the house's floor.

940
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:52,720
That's true.

941
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,040
Thank you, Perm.

942
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,720
Thank you, everyone.

943
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,880
Thank you.

944
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,279
Please do not thank us, ma'am.

945
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:08,600
We could go to hell for this.

946
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:39,880
Thank you.

947
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:43,600
Why do you keep saying thank you, ma'am?

948
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,960
You thank everyone.

949
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,040
Because I'm so grateful.

950
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,720
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

951
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,080
Thank you so much, Eung.

952
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,680
Hey!

953
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,960
-The book.
-I did not bring it.

954
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,840
Why did your brother
take it to Phitsanulok?

955
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,600
How are you so certain

956
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,320
that you can return?

957
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,600
I have to try.

958
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,240
It's time to send her to the palace.

959
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,840
Perhaps next year would be better.

960
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,040
She's too young.

961
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,840
How much money
could I get for this necklace?

962
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,400
You're just a beggar.
Don't be so arrogant.

963
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,760
Why don't you just hit me?

964
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:39,960
Come here!

965
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,760
Did you see Pudtarn's face?

966
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,760
She looks just like Mother.

967
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,320
Are you going to visit her, my lady?

968
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,040
I would like to see
how closely she resembles me.

969
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,480
Let's go. Someone is waiting for you.

970
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,120
There she is, Lady Karaked.

971
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,800
