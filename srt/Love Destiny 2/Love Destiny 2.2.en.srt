1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,720
Why did your mother not allow me
to speak of King Narai?

2
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,520
What do you know,

3
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,720
Karaked?

4
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,200
You know

5
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,000
what you must do, don't you?

6
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,520
Have you no shame?

7
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,760
You fool. Go to hell then.

8
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,960
Take her. Throw her in the stables.

9
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,760
The hands of time

10
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,040
have turned past this era.

11
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,720
No one can prevent what will happen.

12
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,280
-It's a girl!
-It's a girl!

13
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,600
Rueang. Chanwad.
Have you traveled down from Song Kwae?

14
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
We missed little Ruang.

15
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,200
Viscount Pan positioned the armed vessels

16
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,960
in front of the fort.

17
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Heavy gunfire was exchanged.

18
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,880
As negotiations did not yield results,

19
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,160
the king ordered them to use force.

20
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,320
Viscount Pan told me…

21
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,760
His navy surrounded the fort

22
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,520
for six months.

23
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,440
-Fire!
-They exchanged fire,

24
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,200
but neither side could gain an advantage.

25
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,800
-However, the French soldiers…
-Fire!

26
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,200
became fatigued

27
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,360
because they lacked food supplies

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,680
and many of them were injured.

29
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,680
The French soldiers are at their limit.

30
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,920
I heard

31
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,920
some of them

32
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,120
went out to ask villagers for food.

33
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,520
Some paid for it,

34
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,080
while some simply asked for it

35
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,800
because they had no money
and had never received an allowance.

36
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,560
All they had to eat

37
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,880
was coconuts

38
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,520
every day.

39
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,800
Some of them turned to begging.

40
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,280
Even worse, some of them

41
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,960
resorted to pillaging.

42
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,520
Did some of them flee?

43
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,440
That's right.

44
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,120
Some of them ran away

45
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,320
to live with the Portuguese.

46
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,880
Some stayed with the Indians.

47
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,040
And in the end?

48
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,240
All the French soldiers evacuated the fort

49
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
and left Ayutthaya.

50
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,360
We signed a treaty with them under which

51
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,520
Ayutthaya would provide ships
for them to leave on,

52
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,840
while France will cover the cost

53
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,400
of repatriating
Thai officials and students

54
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,240
who are in France.

55
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
That's because His Majesty

56
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,480
no longer wants them to be there.

57
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,800
He's severing ties.

58
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,240
That's right.

59
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,720
There is so much bad blood
between our nations.

60
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,800
That is everything

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,760
Viscount Pan told me.

62
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,960
Hey, you lot.

63
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,800
You've heard the whole story

64
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,320
about the French leaving now.

65
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Go and get back to work.

66
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,760
Someone told me

67
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,600
Princess Yothathep had a hand in this.

68
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,640
She is said to despise the French

69
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,160
and she must also have hated Phaulkon.

70
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,760
That's right.

71
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,240
It is rumored that

72
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,040
she even took part in the plan
to get rid of Phaulkon,

73
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,560
together with monks

74
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,240
and villagers.

75
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,840
They came all the way here
to seize our land.

76
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,440
Did they see us as mere pigs
they could butcher as they pleased?

77
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,560
It's clear to see

78
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,720
they are in the wrong.

79
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,880
Who is in the wrong, Khun Pi?

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,240
The French.

81
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,000
I mean, what did they do wrong?

82
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,520
Well--

83
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,640
They wanted to colonize Ayutthaya.

84
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,280
Do you have any other stories
written in your history books

85
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,360
about the foreigners

86
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,080
to tell us?

87
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes, I do.

88
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,880
Many of them are very complicated.

89
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,280
How do your historians know
about these things

90
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,880
if they are so complicated?

91
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,040
The era of King Narai

92
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,240
is the era of Ayutthaya's history
with the most written records.

93
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,640
Who wrote these records?

94
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,600
The foreigners.

95
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,280
The French wrote the majority of them,

96
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,200
while the British
and the Portuguese provided fewer.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,840
For heaven's sake.

98
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,560
If France bore Ayutthaya ill will,

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,960
their records would be biased.

100
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,840
How credible is your history?

101
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,280
Many people kept records,

102
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,880
so the historians cross-checked
some of their works

103
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,680
to ensure they were accurate.

104
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,280
That French ambassador named Loubère,

105
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,440
I always saw him taking notes

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,120
and asking people things
everywhere he went.

107
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,400
Did this man make
an accurate record, Karaked?

108
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,560
History says
his records are the most detailed.

109
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,040
Many parts are accurate.

110
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,600
That's right.

111
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,400
Foreigners love to make written records.

112
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,440
So who else kept records?

113
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,000
There is also General Desfarges.

114
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,880
The one who was in charge of Bangkok Fort.

115
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,760
This person

116
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,240
must have kept a great number of records.

117
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,320
Who else?

118
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,440
There was also a priest named De Beze.

119
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,680
Many priests compiled volumes of records.

120
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,640
One was called

121
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,160
Tachard.

122
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,280
There was also a soldier named Forbin.

123
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,480
He is the one King Narai assigned
to serve in the navy and the army

124
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,120
and was granted the title

125
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,560
Earl Sakdisongkram.

126
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,240
Is that true?

127
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,160
I guess so.

128
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,840
I can't remember his title.

129
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,800
How do you know so much?

130
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,480
Are you a historian?

131
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,720
No, sir.

132
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,559
I learned it at school.

133
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,159
So, what becomes of Ayutthaya in the end?

134
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,880
Does it still exist in 300 years, Karaked?

135
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,160
Karaked.

136
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,320
Well, my lady?

137
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,880
In the era I came from,

138
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,240
the capital city of the kingdom

139
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,760
is no longer Ayutthaya.

140
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,920
Does Ayutthaya get conquered?

141
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,840
No wonder

142
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,800
you look so gloomy.

143
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,920
Who attacks Ayutthaya?

144
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,480
Is it the Avans?

145
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,680
It must be them.

146
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,960
We have waged war against them
countless times.

147
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,480
Do they eventually

148
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,800
manage to destroy Ayutthaya?

149
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,680
Ayutthaya is still there.

150
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,440
It continues to exist in the same place.

151
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,920
The royal halls and palaces are there

152
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,280
and so are the temples.

153
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,280
Wat Chaiwatthanaram is visited
by many people.

154
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,760
Kleab Canal is still there as well.

155
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,200
I see.

156
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,160
Is Ayutthaya still a heavenly city

157
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,440
like it is now,

158
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,680
Karaked?

159
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,080
Yes, Chanwad.

160
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,800
Ayutthaya

161
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,920
Its reputation is

162
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,400
Beyond heaven

163
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,400
On earth

164
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,280
Owing to the merits

165
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,880
Accumulated

166
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,240
By its former kings

167
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,880
All pagodas are beautiful

168
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,080
Like those of Indra's halls

169
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,760
Covered in gold inside and out

170
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,920
Glittering brightly

171
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,760
Does Ayutthaya get conquered?

172
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,120
Grill pan.

173
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,120
Pork.

174
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,680
Vegetables. Flavorful dipping sauce.

175
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,120
No matter how many times I try,
I still can't use chopsticks properly.

176
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,200
Karaked,

177
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,480
you're very adept with them, aren't you?

178
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,440
I often eat noodles, Lady Champa.

179
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,680
Noodles?

180
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,560
Yes, they are so delicious.

181
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,400
Lady Champa, would you like some pork…

182
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,360
-Prik.
-My gosh!

183
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,600
-Prik.
-Yes, my lady.

184
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,080
Karaked is going into labor.

185
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,920
Dech.

186
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,680
-Yes, Mother?
-Have you ever had them?

187
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,600
I mean--

188
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,800
What is it again?

189
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,080
It's noodles, Mother.

190
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,360
Noodles?

191
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,840
These are no good at all.

192
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,160
Prik!

193
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,400
-My gosh.
-Yes, my lady.

194
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,080
You're still not moving.

195
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,600
Karaked is going into labor.

196
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,400
Good grief.

197
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,040
Yes, my lady.

198
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,960
Pin, Yaem, get ready.

199
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,600
Boong, go and fetch the midwife.

200
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,360
Pin.

201
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,800
Yes, my lady.

202
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,640
Pin, Yaem, go.

203
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,080
Khun Pi.

204
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,400
I'm about to give birth.

205
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,400
Okay, I'll be there in a bit.

206
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,560
-Pin, Yaem, take her.
-Yes, my lord.

207
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,400
I'll be right back, Mother.

208
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,440
This pork barbecue

209
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,360
is delicious.

210
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,400
I'm better off using my hands.

211
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,240
RID, RUANG

212
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,760
Young masters,

213
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,600
-please be careful.
-Please watch your step.

214
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,440
Please run slowly, young masters.

215
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,040
Young masters.

216
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,680
-Father, Mother.
-Father, Mother.

217
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Prang, don't stick your tongue out.

218
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,560
PRANG

219
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,280
Please come back home soon, Father.

220
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,600
I want to paddle a boat.

221
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,800
You don't know how to, Rid.

222
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,120
You can't do that.

223
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,360
I'll teach you how to do it.

224
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Why didn't you ask someone
to bring her here?

225
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,640
Why do you have to go to her yourself?

226
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
It's the Portuguese community
you're visiting.

227
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,280
Isn't it dangerous, Dech?

228
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,160
No, Mother.

229
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,600
The foreigners are much more reserved

230
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,440
than they used to be.

231
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,640
Also, the Portuguese have been our allies
for a long time.

232
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,960
Mother.

233
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,040
Mali has suffered greatly.

234
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,640
I want to go and console her.

235
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,880
We're going now.

236
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,000
Okay.

237
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,040
Take care of your sisters, dear.

238
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,440
Yes, Mother.

239
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,120
-Yes, Mother.
-I'm leaving.

240
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,960
Does Wat Phanan Choeng still exist

241
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,640
in the future?

242
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,640
Yes,

243
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,600
I visited it often.

244
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,000
Maria is only allowed to leave the prison
and return home from time to time

245
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,440
for four or five days at a time.

246
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,480
This way, please.

247
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,640
The crown prince

248
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
wanted me to be his wife.

249
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,760
He wouldn't take no for an answer.

250
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,640
When I rejected him,

251
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,960
he had me locked up

252
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,520
in a stable.

253
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,960
I was confined to the stables

254
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,160
of my residence in Lavo

255
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,120
for many months.

256
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,560
I suffered so greatly

257
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,320
that I almost lost the will to live.

258
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,680
George was with me.

259
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,240
But

260
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,640
did you hear

261
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,400
João,

262
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,640
my youngest son,

263
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,480
is no longer alive.

264
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Is that true?

265
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,880
Poor you, Mali.

266
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,160
One day,

267
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,160
I was able to escape

268
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,440
with the assistance

269
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,040
of a French soldier.

270
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,720
His name is Sainte Marie.

271
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,720
Where did you go?

272
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,000
Bangkok Fort.

273
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,280
Phaulkon had ordered it.

274
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,400
General Desfarges,

275
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,720
I brought her here as ordered by Phaulkon.

276
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,360
This way.

277
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,120
At Bangkok Fort,

278
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,840
General Desfarges

279
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,760
didn't treat me well

280
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
at all,

281
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,040
even though Phaulkon

282
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,120
trusted him and had even saved his life.

283
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,160
He put my son and me

284
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,920
in a room under the fort.

285
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,240
Let me out! No!

286
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,840
No.

287
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,960
It was dirty,

288
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,960
cold,

289
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,200
and damp.

290
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,920
There were many creatures there.

291
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,040
I felt utterly hopeless,

292
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,520
disheartened,

293
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,640
and tormented.

294
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,000
Mali.

295
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,400
Did you witness what happened at the fort?

296
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,760
There was heavy fighting there

297
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,080
before the foreigners

298
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,840
left Bangkok.

299
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,760
I didn't see anything.

300
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,480
I only heard the sound of guns

301
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,760
shooting back and forth

302
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,680
constantly.

303
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,720
One day,

304
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,320
General Desfarges

305
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,760
sent me back to Ayutthaya.

306
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,360
I was devastated.

307
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,120
You wanted to go to France, didn't you?

308
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,400
That's what my husband ordered.

309
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,120
General Desfarges

310
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,000
was supposed to take me with him.

311
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,600
I could have been killed.

312
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,040
The crown prince

313
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,360
was desperate for revenge.

314
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,880
I heard about that.

315
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,760
The crown prince was absolutely furious.

316
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,280
He went on a rampage.

317
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,240
In the end, the guards
who were assigned to watch you

318
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,080
were executed.

319
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,480
What a brute.

320
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,560
What an absolute brute.

321
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,760
General Desfarges

322
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,880
sent you back here to Ayutthaya

323
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,120
in exchange for ships,

324
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,000
food, and necessities

325
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,440
for his return to France.

326
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,840
His Majesty granted him those

327
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,880
because he didn't want to lose face

328
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,480
for being unable to protect you.

329
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,560
I thought so.

330
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,560
And His Majesty had you locked up

331
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,280
even after you returned to Ayutthaya?

332
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,320
I believe

333
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,240
it's the crown prince's doing.

334
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,400
He is furious at me.

335
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,360
Right now,

336
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,280
I get to come home from time to time

337
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,800
because King Phetracha

338
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,240
has shown me some mercy.

339
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,320
However,

340
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,320
I'm sure it's a source of conflict
with his son.

341
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,040
Duea.

342
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,800
I must keep my promise.

343
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,320
I gave my word
I would not punish Constance's wife

344
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,440
after Desfarges returned her

345
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,760
and that I would allow her to remarry.

346
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,760
I should be her new husband.

347
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,400
She would already be your wife
if she would consent,

348
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,480
but she won't,
so what do you want me to do?

349
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,120
Force her to do it instead of stopping me.

350
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,560
Do you know, Father,
that my chest is about to explode?

351
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,360
I don't know anything about you, Duea.

352
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,680
Just go wherever you want.

353
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,840
You give me a headache
whenever I talk to you.

354
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,320
I'm telling you I will release her.

355
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,920
I won't confine her any longer.

356
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,280
Father.

357
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,880
I will also give her work in the palace.

358
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,720
Why do you pity her so?

359
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,080
I have to do it to make up
for what you did, you bastard.

360
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,720
Why don't you listen to me?

361
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,320
Mali, listen to me.

362
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,560
I have a feeling

363
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,680
that your suffering

364
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
will end very soon.

365
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,400
Hang on, all right?

366
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,000
Soon, you will be free of all your sorrow.

367
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,640
When that time comes,

368
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,680
you will shine

369
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,920
like you did when you were Lady Mali.

370
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,920
May your words come true,

371
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,560
my dear friend.

372
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,240
A happy ending.

373
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,880
Rid, Ruang.

374
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,640
Come here.

375
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,440
How is it, my dear?

376
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,920
Thank you.

377
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,200
Where are my children?

378
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,320
The first twin is practicing…

379
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,480
ju…

380
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,840
-Jujutsu.
-Jujutsu, my lady.

381
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,520
With Lady Keaw, my lady.

382
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,680
And the other one

383
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,720
is practicing with Lady Prang, my lady.

384
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,640
Why are you sighing, my lady?

385
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,360
That's right.

386
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,040
Lady Champa told you about that herself.

387
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,440
What is it, Khun Pi?

388
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,440
I've told you, haven't I?

389
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,080
That King Phetracha

390
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,960
has always had it in for Viscount Pan?

391
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,720
Yes.

392
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,120
I could never forget

393
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,440
how His Majesty cut his nose off.

394
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,200
Pan, you bastard!

395
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,280
I'll kill you!

396
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,480
I'll never forget that
until the day I die.

397
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,080
It's gruesome.

398
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,320
After that,

399
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,600
His Majesty was always quarreling
with Viscount Pan

400
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,400
and regularly punished him

401
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,280
for various reasons.

402
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,160
Well, His Majesty doesn't like him.

403
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,120
And the reason
His Majesty bestowed upon him

404
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,520
the title of Duke Srithammaratch

405
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,600
was because

406
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,440
he wanted to get rid of him,

407
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,520
not because he wanted
to promote him further.

408
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,880
That's right.

409
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,040
Right now,

410
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,800
His Majesty must be content, Karaked.

411
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,480
Content about what?

412
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,520
I'm not sure whether His Majesty
is content or satisfied

413
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,920
because…

414
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,240
Has it happened?

415
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,000
Is Viscount Pan

416
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,200
dead?

417
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,560
That's right.

418
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,480
Of course.

419
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,400
Of course?

420
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,880
What do you mean?

421
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,600
Did you know about this, Karaked?

422
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,040
Yes, I did.

423
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
It is written in our history.

424
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,760
It said

425
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,520
Viscount Pan passed away

426
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,720
ten years after the start of the new era.

427
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,720
Ruang and Rid are now ten years old.

428
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,880
The time has come.

429
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,520
People's lives are like leaves,

430
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,440
they eventually wither away.

431
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,480
Don't think too much, Khun Pi.

432
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,320
Do you remember what the master said?

433
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,840
Whatever will be, will be.

434
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,400
Is that right?

435
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,960
Yes, Khun Pi.

436
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,040
Whatever will be,

437
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,360
will be.

438
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,480
Be careful or you'll trip, dear.

439
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,840
PUDTARN

440
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,520
PUDTARN

441
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,639
Let's go.

442
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,360
Let's go.

443
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,760
She looks like her.

444
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,480
She looks just like her.

445
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,400
She really does.

446
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,520
I always tell Chai

447
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,960
that Pudtarn looks like Ketsurang
when she was little.

448
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,440
The more I look at her,
the more I miss Ket.

449
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,600
You haven't come to see me for so long.

450
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,960
It must have been a few years already.

451
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,400
It's three years
since we last brought her.

452
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,640
The more you grow up,
the more you look like Ket.

453
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
I want to see you
when you're all grown up.

454
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,440
Do you like to eat, dear?

455
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,760
If you do, you will be chubby like her.

456
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,200
Like…

457
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,400
What should I call her?

458
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,040
Right. How are you two related?

459
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,080
Well, Vipa's father

460
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,960
is my older brother,

461
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,320
so your mother is Ket's cousin.

462
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,960
Then you must call Auntie Ket.

463
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,600
You two are related,

464
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,440
so it's not surprising you look alike.

465
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,120
What do you think, Chaimitr?

466
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,320
That's right.

467
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,440
Even though they are distant relatives,

468
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,480
they might have inherited
some common traits

469
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,480
in their genes.

470
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,600
Come and visit me often, dear.

471
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Bring her here often, okay?

472
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,920
Sure.

473
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,840
-What is it, Pong?
-Sister,

474
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,560
Phra Rueang sent me to tell you

475
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,280
that you can meet him this evening.

476
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
Okay.

477
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,320
Phra Rueang?

478
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,280
Is he the one…

479
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,480
That's right.

480
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,600
Phra Rueang

481
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,520
is a monk here.

482
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,160
I don't think he'll leave the monkhood.

483
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,600
Wasn't he the driver
in the accident that killed Ketsurang?

484
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,960
Is Auntie Ket dead?

485
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,640
Yes, dear.

486
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,120
Is she the person you said looks like me?

487
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,680
That's right, dear.

488
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,640
She died a long time ago.
You won't remember her.

489
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,440
You were only three
when you attended her funeral.

490
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,960
I'm Phra Rueang

491
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,080
My apologies, Your Holiness.

492
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,440
Do you miss Grandma, Pong?

493
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,320
Yes.

494
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,120
Even though I just came here,

495
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,480
she was very kind to me.

496
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,080
That's right.

497
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,280
She was very kind.

498
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,760
If she hadn't passed away,

499
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,600
I wouldn't have come to ordain here.

500
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,640
She must be with Ket in heaven now.

501
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,800
The grandma and the granddaughter
must be happy

502
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,600
to see each other.

503
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,080
Are you really not going
to leave the nunhood?

504
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,720
I've already sold my house.

505
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,120
Where would I live?

506
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,680
I will stay in this temple until I die.

507
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,960
I will stay here and learn
from Phra Rueang.

508
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,840
Pay respect to him, dear.

509
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,840
Why don't you recite the alphabet for us?

510
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,800
A, B,

511
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,080
C, D, E…

512
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,680
Can you do it?

513
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,000
Of course.

514
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,880
I like Grandma Sipang

515
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,720
and this wooden bead.

516
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,840
Which one?

517
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,000
Where is it?

518
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,880
Mom.

519
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,880
Dad.

520
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,560
There's someone out there watching us.

521
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,160
I don't see anyone, honey.

522
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,680
She's standing in the rain.

523
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,080
Won't she be cold?

524
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,560
Maybe you're seeing things, dear.

525
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,880
Look, the rain has stopped.

526
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,120
If she's still standing there,
she probably won't be cold.

527
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,760
Dad, be careful.

528
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,920
My gosh!

529
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,760
Dad!

530
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,920
No!

531
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,320
Your spirit

532
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,520
must have been confused,

533
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,120
trying to find its way
for thousands of years.

534
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,280
Chaimitr's relatives said
they aren't interested in his assets.

535
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:08,400
They want them to be used
to help raise Pudtarn.

536
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,400
That leaves it to our side of the family.

537
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,520
As Vipawan's sister,

538
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,840
I will take care of Pudtarn myself.

539
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,520
Do any of you have a problem with this?

540
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,640
Well, Vipavee.

541
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,720
I know I'm just your cousin,

542
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,680
but Vipawan promised

543
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,800
to support me
until I finish my master's degree.

544
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,000
I only have a year left.

545
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,880
It's okay. Don't worry.

546
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,120
I will take care of it.

547
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,880
Vipavee.

548
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,280
I'm 400,000 baht in debt to loan sharks.

549
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,000
Vipawan also promised
to pay it off for me.

550
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,920
Well, that was Vipawan's promise.

551
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,640
I won't be responsible for that.

552
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,600
What? Why?

553
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,720
Well, I just simply won't.

554
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,440
Well, I'm telling you now

555
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,120
that Vipawan promised to--

556
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,520
That's a promise she made.

557
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,880
Not me.

558
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,400
Well, Vipawan is dead.

559
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,040
What do you want Surasak to do?

560
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,280
Dad, it's okay. Leave this to me.

561
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,320
Vipavee.

562
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,360
Please help me.

563
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,840
You see, Vipawan was aware
of my situation.

564
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,320
I was cheated by my business partners.

565
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,440
I can't give you money.

566
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,600
Why not?

567
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,960
Come on. Vipawan already gave her word.

568
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,600
There's plenty of money.

569
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,120
I can't give it to you.

570
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,840
Just tell me why.

571
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,800
Because it's not Vipawan's money anymore.

572
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,240
What are you talking about?

573
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,320
Whose money is it then?

574
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,360
It's Pudtarn's.

575
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,800
You can have it.

576
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,600
I don't want the money.

577
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,720
I don't want it.

578
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,240
If you're going to squabble over it,
then just take it.

579
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,520
You don't talk like a child.

580
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,720
Well?

581
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,040
As I said, I can't give it to you.

582
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,000
What's wrong with you?

583
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,640
It's true the money belongs to Pudtarn,

584
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,200
but she can't give it to you

585
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,760
because she doesn't have the right
to give it to anyone.

586
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,760
Only I have that right.

587
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,800
She's taking everything.

588
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,120
Can we sue her, Dad?

589
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,480
On what grounds?

590
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,720
It's her right.

591
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,880
I will transfer you money

592
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,360
just as Vipawan did every month.

593
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,160
Tell me if you have any other expenses.

594
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,160
Thank you, Vipavee.

595
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,320
Don't thank me. The money isn't mine.

596
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,160
It belonged to Pudtarn's mom.

597
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,000
Thank you so much, Pudtarn.

598
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,960
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

599
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,640
-Stay in touch.
-Okay.

600
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,840
Next time, don't speak
unless you're told to.

601
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,240
Okay.

602
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,160
I'm your aunt.

603
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,320
I'm responsible for your upbringing

604
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,120
until you're an adult.

605
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,720
That includes your food, schooling,
and everything else.

606
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,160
I don't want your money.

607
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,840
I'm keeping it for you,

608
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,280
but you have no right to give it away.

609
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,600
Listen.

610
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,880
It's my legal duty

611
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,640
to raise you.

612
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,720
Whether you want to be with me or not,

613
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,520
you have to stay with me.

614
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,080
We're in this together.

615
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,760
I'm not married.

616
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,440
I have no children or grandchildren.

617
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,920
I have no immediate family other than you,

618
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,640
Pudtarn.

619
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:42,320
PUDTARN

620
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,520
I want these two spots to be the same,

621
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,360
so please arrange
the poles like this, Chet.

622
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,440
-Sure.
-Go straight on and it's on the right.

623
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,320
-I want this one to be the same.
-Hello.

624
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,720
-Sure.
-No mistakes, okay? We don't have time.

625
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,280
-Like this.
-Okay, just a second.

626
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,520
Not like this. That's not how I want it.

627
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,480
Mhee.

628
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,720
-So have you got it?
-Mhee.

629
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,120
What is it?

630
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,480
Top.

631
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,000
Are you going inside?
Can you take a look at the wooden house?

632
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,160
Great, please take this with you too.

633
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,320
Of course, give it to me.

634
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,720
-Good. Over there.
-Okay.

635
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,840
-Mhee.
-What is it?

636
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,040
Are you really not coming
the day after tomorrow?

637
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,680
Right.

638
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,280
I'm busy, so I'll leave it to you.
We're running out of time.

639
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,240
Give them instructions
before you leave then.

640
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,760
I'll just supervise them.

641
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,400
Of course.

642
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,920
You don't need to come tomorrow.
Take the day off.

643
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,880
Will you cut my pay?

644
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,360
Why are you so stingy?

645
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,840
Of course not. Just make sure
everything is done on time.

646
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,160
-Okay?
-I know.

647
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,280
-Hey, are you going to be long?
-Hey, Mhoo.

648
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,000
Are you going to the site?
Let me join you.

649
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,920
What? Hey, be careful, Tarn.

650
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,040
Hey, I forgot my hat!

651
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,640
-Hey!
-Can you throw it to me?

652
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,200
-Tarn, be careful!
-Come on! Throw it!

653
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,640
We're working here! It isn't a playground!

654
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,000
Mhoo.

655
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,080
-Yes, ma'am.
-You can now plant the trees

656
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,800
that I have prepared
in front of the traditional Thai house.

657
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,120
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

658
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,200
You're quite something.

659
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,640
You're only 20
and you've already graduated.

660
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,400
I was terrible at school when I was young.

661
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,080
Really? What happened?

662
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,440
I was in a car accident.

663
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,720
My parents died,

664
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,560
but I survived uninjured.

665
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,360
I didn't even have any scars.

666
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,440
After that,
I became good at school all of a sudden.

667
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,640
Really? What happened?

668
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,120
Did you just knuckle down?

669
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,360
No. I don't know what happened.

670
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,640
I was able to remember
everything I studied

671
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,400
and what I read in textbooks.

672
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,680
I see. That's strange.

673
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,240
Something must have changed
in your brain during the crash.

674
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,600
I guess so.

675
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,640
So are you going to do a master's degree?

676
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,920
Why not?

677
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,240
I can't afford it.

678
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,640
Don't tell me
your inheritance is all gone.

679
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,520
Hey, don't presume
my aunt cheated me out of it.

680
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,040
She didn't.

681
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,200
I've been living off it since I was eight.

682
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,600
It has been 12 years.
That's long enough to use it all.

683
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,560
So what are you going to do next?

684
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,560
What do you think? Work, of course.

685
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,360
Work. I see.

686
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,200
Hey, Tarn.

687
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,840
I'm hungry. What are you cooking today?

688
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,520
Come on.

689
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,680
Can you wait? I'm not done here yet.

690
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,240
Okay, sure. I'll take a look
at the front of the site first.

691
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,160
Cook us something
once you're done, all right?

692
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,400
Okay.

693
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,800
I'll get going. Be quick.

694
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,280
Gosh, you eat so fast.

695
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,120
You didn't wait for me.

696
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,480
Try the sauce first.

697
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,120
-What?
-Can I have your shrimps?

698
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,480
Tarn.

699
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,240
There you are.

700
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,280
I need your help to look
at the big tree behind the site.

701
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,920
Let's go.

702
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,560
What's wrong?

703
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,840
I've seen this before.

704
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,640
Am I hallucinating?

705
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,720
What did you see, Tarn?

706
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,360
It's nothing.

707
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,560
Let's go then.

708
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,400
Mhee.

709
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,000
AUNTIE VEE

710
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,520
Okay, I'll wait over there.

711
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,040
Hello, Auntie.

712
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,080
Tomorrow?

713
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,640
I'm free tomorrow. It's my day off.

714
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,040
Where are we going?

715
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,400
You look just like her.

716
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,720
My dear Ket.

717
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,720
You're crying again, Grandma.

718
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,240
Well then, how about I get ordained too

719
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,360
and be your daughter instead?

720
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,880
My dear.

721
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,720
I'd be so happy if you could do that.

722
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,080
Let me pay respect to the abbot first.

723
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,160
Go.

724
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,320
Pao, Pob.

725
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,760
-Hello, Tarn.
-Hello.

726
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,480
-Are you free?
-Yes.

727
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,280
Let's go see the abbot.

728
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,240
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

729
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,560
Pudtarn,

730
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,480
the more she grows up,
the more she looks like Ket.

731
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,840
Pudtarn is not as sweet as she was.

732
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,280
Vipavee.

733
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,360
You are strange.

734
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,960
You have raised her since she was little.

735
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,360
What do you still have against her?

736
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,520
Auntie, I don't know how to explain it.

737
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,200
That girl,

738
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,080
there's something about her that makes me

739
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,840
neither able to love her nor hate her.

740
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,360
Pong.

741
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,000
So what's the reason?

742
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,920
Both of her parents died,

743
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,320
but she was completely unscathed.

744
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,320
She just had a few bruises.

745
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,160
She didn't cry either.

746
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,920
I asked her once
whether she misses her parents,

747
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,080
but she didn't answer me.

748
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,520
She acted as if
she had no memory of her parents.

749
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,320
How is that possible?

750
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,320
Who would forget their own parents?

751
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,840
She was old enough to remember them.

752
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,080
Well, she doesn't remember.

753
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,640
I'm positive

754
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,160
that she has no memory of her parents.

755
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,680
Back then,
she didn't talk for a while, right?

756
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,680
Yes. She didn't talk at all
for half a year.

757
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,560
Since Pudtarn was born after Ket died,

758
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,840
she could be
the reincarnation of my daughter.

759
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:41,000
It's my birthday,
so I'd like to ask for your blessing.

760
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,200
I wish you to always be mindful.

761
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,880
No matter what happens,

762
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,640
always be mindful.

763
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,120
No matter how bad things are,

764
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,040
so long as you are mindful,

765
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,480
you will be able to handle things wisely.

766
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,440
Mindful?

767
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,840
It's the only word of blessing
I'm giving you on your birthday.

768
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,280
Will something terrible happen to me?

769
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,240
What you're going to encounter

770
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,240
is something you can't avoid.

771
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,560
Remember my words well.

772
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,440
Be mindful.

773
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,640
Consider your actions carefully.

774
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,600
No matter where you are,

775
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,520
I hope you find loving and kind people.

776
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:31,160
But you must make yourself worthy
of their love and kindness.

777
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,320
If I'm ever feeling down,

778
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,240
I will come to see you, Grandma.

779
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,120
Sure.

780
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,560
I know you never loved me.

781
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,360
I did all I could to raise you.

782
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,200
You never loved me.

783
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,880
You only raised me

784
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,480
because you had to.

785
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,920
But I was the only one who raised you.

786
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,680
You sent me to boarding school
after my parents passed away.

787
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,600
I could say you didn't raise me.

788
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,360
The teachers at my boarding school did.

789
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,080
That's because you're like this.

790
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,400
Let me ask you.

791
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,760
Have you ever seen me as your aunt?

792
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:24,280
You are as much of an aunt to me
as I am a niece to you.

793
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,480
Pudtarn.

794
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,520
In your life,

795
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,880
who have you ever loved?

796
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,680
You don't even love your parents.

797
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,280
I said I don't remember them.

798
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,520
But you remember other things.

799
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,600
Why can't you remember your own parents?

800
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,520
It's because you're like this.

801
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,960
You're utterly heartless.

802
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,560
You don't care about anyone.

803
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,160
You don't love anyone.

804
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,200
I do.

805
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,720
Tell me who.

806
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,160
Grandma Sipang.

807
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,280
If you love her,

808
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,120
then go and live with her.

809
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,880
Hey, guys! Come and take a look at this.
I found something.

810
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,120
Hurry up. Come here.

811
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,720
Look, I don't know what it is.

812
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,840
-Dig it up.
-Let me see.

813
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,360
What did you find?

814
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,680
I have no idea, Tarn.

815
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,160
-Be careful. Jeez.
-Hey. Here it is!

816
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,160
Let's move it up here first.

817
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:31,880
Sure, Tarn.

818
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,720
Open it, Tarn.

819
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,480
Do you want me to open it?

820
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,400
-Yes, please open it, Tarn.
-Go ahead.

821
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,440
Tarn,

822
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,640
if there are amulets inside,

823
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,720
let's share them out.

824
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,640
-Good idea.
-Hold on.

825
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,280
Wait. I get the most because I found it.

826
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,000
Hey, you can't do that.

827
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,480
But if it's gold jewelry,

828
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,080
you choose first.

829
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,560
-And we share the rest.
-Great.

830
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,760
No, you can't do that. Valuable finds
are considered state property.

831
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,960
We must tell the Fine Arts Department.

832
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,440
-What?
-Come on.

833
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,240
-But we found it.
-They won't know.

834
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,200
-It's just us.
-They won't know.

835
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,600
Stop.

836
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,440
Don't you know what they say?

837
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,080
The owner will come back for it!

838
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,080
-Come on, Tarn.
-What?

839
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,440
-Tarn.
-Come on.

840
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,680
All right, let's open it.

841
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,080
-Open it.
-Guys, open it.

842
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,280
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

843
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,240
It's hard to open. Slowly.

844
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,800
-Be gentle.
-Slowly.

845
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:44,920
We did it.

846
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,760
Maybe it's a book.

847
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,080
It doesn't look valuable.

848
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,400
Tarn.

849
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,760
Unwrap it and see.

850
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,560
No, I don't want to unwrap it.

851
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,840
I'd rather burn it.

852
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,880
What a waste. We might be able to sell it.

853
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,880
I don't know. I'm scared of it.

854
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,080
What are you scared of? Please open it.

855
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,000
-It's nothing, Tarn.
-Don't be afraid.

856
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,440
-Come on, Tarn.
-Please.

857
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,800
We're waiting.

858
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,680
It really is a book.

859
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,000
We can sell it as an antique.

860
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,080
Tarn, don't go yet.

861
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,840
Please open it.
I want to know what's written inside.

862
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,160
-That's right.
-Please.

863
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,000
-Open it.
-I want to know what's inside.

864
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,440
-Please.
-Open it.

865
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,520
My gosh!

866
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,200
-My eyes!
-Gosh.

867
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,000
Hey!

868
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,120
Where did Pudtarn go?

869
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,319
-Where did she go?
-Tarn.

870
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:45,200
-You told her to open it.
-Tarn.

871
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:46,200
Did she become a ghost?

872
01:08:56,279 --> 01:08:59,439
There's some kind of light
shining upon the stream in Gui's orchard.

873
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,240
Grandma.

874
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,600
Where did you come from?

875
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,080
Why?

876
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,520
Who is she?

877
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,319
Why does she look like her, Grandma?

878
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:11,840
You're all here.

879
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,520
Your three-flavored fish
is second to none, Mother.

880
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:20,279
What the hell?

881
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:22,960
This is Ayutthaya.

882
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:24,880
What is the king's name?

883
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,080
Crown Prince Phet is the new king.

884
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,359
Her crazy ramblings

885
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,200
will be the end of us.

886
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:32,560
She's cursed.

887
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:15,240
