1
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,840
This manuscript has been passed down

2
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,840
the Brahmin family of ours
for thousands of years.

3
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,080
I shall take it to Song Kwae.

4
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,320
I'm still new to this throne

5
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,240
and to the affairs of government.

6
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,600
My hidden enemy,

7
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,560
Uncle Dum, who is ready to do
inappropriate things to me.

8
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,280
If you build her timber flooring,

9
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,640
I shall become Song's wife.

10
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,560
It would not be too much
to let her sleep on a timber floor.

11
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,240
-I shall not stand for it.
-I can sleep on a cane floor.

12
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,200
Thank you so much, Perm,

13
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,880
for building this house for me.

14
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,320
It's my first home.

15
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,520
Eung, has no one come to see me?

16
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,080
Thank you.

17
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,880
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

18
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,240
Thank you so much, Eung.

19
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,920
Hey!

20
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,520
Miss.

21
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,760
Hey, wait up!

22
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,680
Miss.

23
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,280
Stop. Hey, stop!

24
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,800
Eung, help me stop the horse!

25
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,880
-What are you doing, miss?
-Wait!

26
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,960
Goodness.

27
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,240
Why didn't you ask nicely?

28
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
Why didn't you just stop?

29
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,279
I was about to.

30
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,520
You're lying.

31
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,640
Eung, was he going to stop?

32
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,120
His Lordship didn't stop, miss.

33
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,440
See?

34
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,920
What's so funny?

35
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,280
-What do you mean?
-Why did you laugh?

36
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,280
Laugh?

37
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,400
I didn't.

38
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,440
Stop skirting the issue.
You're freaking annoying.

39
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,600
The book.

40
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,560
Did you bring it?

41
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,200
That book is mine.

42
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,640
I don't care who it belongs to.

43
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
Did you bring it?

44
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,920
I did not bring it.

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,480
What? You didn't bring it?

46
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,200
Why didn't you bring it?

47
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,720
Well, I decided

48
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,160
to negotiate with you first.

49
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,960
-Negotiate with me?
-Yes.

50
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,480
Negotiate about what?
We have nothing to negotiate.

51
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,960
You only need to give me the book.
I don't need it for long.

52
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,560
I'm not going to take it anywhere.

53
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,000
It won't get damaged.

54
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,000
Hold on.

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,160
It seems like
you're going back on your word.

56
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,040
You came with your twin the other day,
but you ignored me completely.

57
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,280
You're trying to deceive me.

58
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,680
-Am I right?
-No.

59
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,440
You're such a tsundere.

60
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,000
What?

61
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,760
Yes, a tsundere.

62
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,040
What does that mean?

63
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,600
Well, you're a tsundere.

64
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,440
You don't need to know.

65
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,240
You wouldn't understand anyway.

66
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,800
It's not good, is it?

67
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,520
That's right, it's not good.

68
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,920
It's terrible.

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,160
I really want to know

70
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,480
if you've ever done
a single good thing in your life.

71
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,360
What terrible things
have I done in the past?

72
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,440
You have some nerve to ask me that.

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,440
You kicked me into a puddle

74
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,560
and accused me
of taking your book when it's mine.

75
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,160
Lastly, you told me
you would come and talk about the book.

76
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,480
But did you come?
No. I didn't even get a glimpse of you.

77
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,000
You didn't even get a glimpse of me,

78
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,680
yet you see me now, do you not?

79
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,280
Is this how you want to do it?

80
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,880
You want to get physical, don't you?

81
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,920
Get…

82
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,600
what?

83
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,480
Get physical.

84
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,880
I see.

85
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,800
Engage in combat?

86
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,480
Yes, that.

87
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,720
How many days has it been now?

88
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,160
You've been on my mind every day.

89
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,800
I've been on your mind?

90
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,480
You flaked out on me.

91
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,400
Flaked out?

92
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,680
That's right.

93
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,200
Like snow?

94
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,080
Oh, dear.

95
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,400
I'll put it another way.

96
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,680
Where have you been?

97
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,200
Have you been thinking of me?

98
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,600
Yes, I have.

99
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,960
Right, Eung?

100
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,320
What's wrong, Eung?
Why are you making that face?

101
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,360
You haven't been thinking
of His Lordship, ma'am.

102
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,640
You have merely cursed him day and night.

103
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,240
Exactly.

104
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,880
I have been thinking of him.

105
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,560
If not, I wouldn't have been cursing him.

106
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,760
Eung.

107
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,360
Yes, my lord.

108
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,200
Don't be too hasty in your judgment.

109
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,120
Your mistress

110
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,400
has been thinking about me a lot.

111
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,400
Is that so, miss?

112
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,080
Enough, Eung.

113
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,120
Give me a break.

114
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,200
What break?

115
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,080
This queen bee needs a break.

116
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,520
This…

117
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,360
queen bee?

118
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,880
I said give me a break.

119
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,000
-What?
-Miss.

120
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,520
Eung.

121
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,880
What's wrong with her?

122
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,080
This is how she is, my lord.

123
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,600
Were you allowed to return home today?

124
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,920
I have been thinking of you recently.

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,720
His Majesty let me return home early

126
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,760
as it has been a month
since I have done so.

127
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,040
Go and bathe, son.

128
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,080
Yes, Mother.

129
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,520
Here comes Marquess Phrakhlang.

130
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,200
He has been serving as the Kosathibodi

131
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,240
since the reign of the Tiger King.

132
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,040
He is incredibly influential.

133
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,120
King Tai Sra trusts him enormously

134
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,400
and provides everything he needs.

135
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,840
That's why I told you
to entrust your son to him.

136
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,520
What brings you all the way here?

137
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,000
My great Marquess Phrakhlang

138
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,720
I brought my son here
to pay a courtesy call on you.

139
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,440
-He looks fine.
-Thank you, my lord.

140
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Hey, pay respect to him.

141
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,880
My lord, Marquess Phrakhlang,
could you please--

142
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,160
Your father won't be here
to teach you for the rest of his life.

143
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,000
He will be gone before long.

144
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,360
-Hey!
-Good grief.

145
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,120
Take him away.

146
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,760
Didn't you teach him any manners?

147
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,120
An ill-mannered person like him

148
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
cannot serve His Majesty.

149
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,160
He won't get far in life.

150
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,280
Take your father back

151
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,040
and don't come back here again.

152
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,960
Hey, kneel down.

153
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,320
Did you expect me to accept you
just because you are Chinese?

154
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,280
It's true I give opportunities
to Chinese people to work with me,

155
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,480
but that doesn't mean I accept everyone.

156
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,200
I'm not interested in working
with someone who doesn't know

157
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,480
how to control his temper.

158
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,440
You may be wealthy,

159
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,400
but you didn't teach manners to your son.

160
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,080
He doesn't know his place.

161
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,400
He won't be welcomed anywhere.

162
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,160
Hey, get up now.

163
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,920
For heaven's sake.

164
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,320
It's all right.
Come back again some other time.

165
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,640
Marquess Phrakhlang loves his people.

166
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,320
We're Chinese like him.

167
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,720
Give it some time
and prepare a lot of money.

168
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,720
In returned today.

169
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,560
He's talking to Praejeen now.

170
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,640
They are waiting for you.

171
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,000
Why don't you get changed first?

172
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,440
LADY PRAEJEEN

173
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,640
Thank you, Praejeen, my dear daughter.

174
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,680
How old are you this year?

175
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,640
Fifteen, Father.

176
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,200
I still see you as my little girl.

177
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,160
I also think that way.

178
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,120
I still want you to carry me.

179
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,560
I still want to sit on your lap

180
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,280
and let you take me
on horse rides with you,

181
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,520
just like when I was little.

182
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,120
You can't do that anymore, Praejeen.

183
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,720
It's against our tradition, my dear.

184
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,880
That's the Thai tradition, Mother.

185
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,640
Well, I am Thai.

186
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,080
I'm a true Thai, my dear.

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,640
It's time to send her to the palace.

188
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,960
Perhaps next year would be better.

189
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,960
I'm worried she's too young.

190
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,160
By the way, In,

191
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,960
did His Majesty mention anything
about transferring you

192
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,520
from the palace to the treasury with me?

193
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,200
Yes, Father.

194
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,120
He said it is for the best.

195
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,040
Okay.

196
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,520
You will get to learn about the treasury.

197
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,920
I intend that you become
the next minister of the treasury.

198
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,160
Even though the Kosathibodi position

199
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
is not handed down from father to son,

200
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,400
if you perform well,

201
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,520
His Majesty won't be reluctant
to appoint you to the position.

202
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,960
Whoever you recommend,

203
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,480
particularly Chinese citizens like you,

204
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,280
he always gives them good positions

205
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,800
in the government, doesn't he?

206
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,480
But for our son,

207
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,720
I want him to earn the position himself.

208
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,360
As for others,
it depends on how much they give.

209
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,200
Wait up.

210
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,000
I won't pester you anymore.
I have calmed down.

211
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,160
Let's just say
you can bring it anytime you wish.

212
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,880
I will just forget about it for now.

213
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,120
But can I ask you a favor?

214
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,600
Of course, Pudtarn.

215
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,760
You may ask me anything.

216
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,720
I want a notebook and a pen.

217
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,240
-A pencil would also do.
-I see.

218
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,560
Do you intend to write a diary?

219
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,680
That's my business.

220
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,320
And keep your promise this time.

221
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,440
I don't mean that book, all right?

222
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,200
Just a normal notebook.

223
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,880
Eung, Perm, come here. I need your advice.

224
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,520
I'm going to grow vegetables here.

225
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,000
Let's use the leftover bamboo
to make vegetable beds.

226
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,920
Over there will be a fishpond.
Beside the pond will be a chicken coop.

227
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,520
We will feed
the chicken droppings to the fish

228
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,200
and use the water from the pond
to water the vegetables.

229
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,359
Eung, let's go buy vegetable seeds.

230
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,680
What should we grow?

231
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,599
What are you confused about?
I didn't say anything confusing.

232
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,960
This is going to cost a bit.

233
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,480
I need to find some funds.

234
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,320
You used to let me trim your nails.

235
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,560
Will you stop complaining?

236
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,440
I wish for my granddaughter to do it.

237
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,760
She'll cut into your finger.

238
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,920
Well, wait for it to happen,
then you can say something.

239
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,840
My lady is here. I'm leaving.

240
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,640
My goodness, Prik.

241
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,200
-Prik.
-Oh dear, Prik.

242
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,680
Prepare some for me.

243
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,920
Yes, my lady.

244
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,360
Why aren't you folding
the lotus leaves like I showed you?

245
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,680
Make them rowel shaped.

246
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,480
-Chuang.
-Yes, my lady.

247
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,760
I shall visit
Wat Chaiwatthanaram tomorrow.

248
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,160
Prepare the necessities for me.

249
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,800
Yes, my lady.

250
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,200
I have already prepared alms
to offer to the monks.

251
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,400
Okay.

252
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,680
My goodness.

253
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,280
Very neat, my lady.

254
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,840
Come here.

255
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,560
Prang is trying to get your attention.

256
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,320
Where does she want you to go, Keaw?

257
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Fold the rest that way.

258
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,640
Yes, my lady.

259
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,000
Where are you going, my lady?

260
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,960
I'm going to prepare things
for Ruang to take back to Song Kwae,

261
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,720
as well as souvenirs
for Earl Ramnarong and Chanwad

262
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,760
and things for Keaw and Prang
to present to their princess.

263
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,320
I have prepared them already.

264
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,840
See for yourself, my lady.

265
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,080
Only one of my children
will be left here tomorrow.

266
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,320
Keaw.

267
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,120
Is that all you wanted to tell me?

268
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,680
Yes, just this.

269
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,720
Let's go.

270
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,960
Keaw and Prang are up to something, Prik.

271
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
You're right, my lady.

272
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,880
Let me check them out.

273
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,680
Keaw, look at these lipstick papers.

274
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,320
There are many shades.

275
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,440
This one would suit Mother.

276
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,560
It's a ruddy red.
It would look really cool on her.

277
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,280
It doesn't suit me. It's too mature.

278
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,080
But for you,
I think it should be the light red.

279
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,560
It's almost pink.

280
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,920
Have you got a pimple, Prang?

281
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,440
You're right.

282
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,360
Please pop it for me.

283
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,800
It's so annoying.

284
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,480
Don't do it.

285
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,200
Mother told us not to pop them
as it leaves a scar.

286
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,600
I will mix some lime and betel nut paste.

287
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,720
I will ask Prik for some betel nut paste.

288
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,280
Your pimple will be gone in no time.

289
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,560
I just had a thought.

290
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,520
Did you see Pudtarn's face?

291
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,080
The woman who had an argument
with Rid at the market.

292
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,160
Yes.

293
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,000
Her skin was perfect.

294
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,800
I'd love to know what she uses.

295
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,200
Do you think she uses
the perfumed powder we use?

296
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,760
She lives in Gui's orchard.
Why don't we visit her?

297
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,600
We'll put her through the wringer.

298
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,920
Oh, dear.

299
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,160
Here I come, my lady.

300
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,280
What did you find out, Prik?

301
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,240
Lady Prang said she would visit Gui

302
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,200
and put her through the wringer, my lady.

303
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,920
Put what through the wringer?

304
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,400
Probably Gui, my lady.

305
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,920
Which part of her?

306
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,960
Well…

307
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:10,000
I know now. When talking about wringers,
it must be her garments, my lady.

308
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,000
What else could it be?

309
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,760
Oh, dear.

310
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,360
I'm going to ask them myself.

311
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,440
Yes, my lady.

312
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,640
I don't want to go.

313
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,640
I'm scared of her.

314
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,880
Why, Keaw?

315
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,360
She is a person like us.

316
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,560
She visits markets

317
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,520
and buys clothes like us.

318
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,520
Why are you afraid of her?

319
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,080
You're imagining things.

320
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,120
She's scary.

321
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,360
She looks just like Mother.

322
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,240
That's why I don't want to talk to her.

323
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,080
I won't go to that market again

324
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,120
as I'm afraid I will meet her.

325
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,200
But I want to meet her again.

326
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,080
Don't you want to know

327
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,720
what makes her skin so perfect?

328
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,840
Also, Mother always taught us

329
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,200
not to judge anyone
before we know them well.

330
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,240
She might be a good person.

331
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,560
Miss.

332
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,840
My gosh, Perm. You only took half a day
to make these beds.

333
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,200
What else do you need me to do?

334
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,880
Make a compost pit over there.

335
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,640
And…

336
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,560
dig a fishpond over there.

337
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,240
We already have fish in the pond.

338
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,960
He's right.

339
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,720
Why do we need a pond

340
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,040
-when we only have to set up a trap--
-Just do as I say.

341
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
Yes, miss.

342
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,560
Go on, Perm. What are you waiting for?

343
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,960
Yes, I'm going now.

344
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,680
-Eung.
-Yes.

345
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,440
He's gone.

346
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,320
I know.

347
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,560
Right.

348
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,120
How old are you?

349
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,280
Me?

350
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
I'm 20.

351
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,200
What about Perm?

352
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,640
Perm?

353
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,760
He's over there, digging a pond.

354
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,840
No.

355
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,200
How old is he?

356
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,800
That old dog is getting on a bit.

357
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,360
He's in his thirties.

358
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,640
Okay.

359
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,840
He's older than you.
Why are you so disrespectful to him?

360
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,960
I beg your pardon?

361
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,680
Speak about him politely.

362
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,800
It's just Perm. Why should I?

363
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,400
What's wrong? I'm polite to him.

364
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,520
Try it.

365
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,880
Perm.

366
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,400
Perm.

367
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,880
Okay, good.

368
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,920
Get some water for him.

369
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,000
Perm.

370
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,600
Perm!

371
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,840
Please have some water.

372
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,520
Why are you talking like that?

373
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,440
Have you gone mad, Eung?

374
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,480
Whatever.

375
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,280
Take it. Just take it.

376
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,440
Hey.

377
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,600
Yes, my lady.

378
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,640
Come and sit close to me.

379
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,200
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

380
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,400
There is a lady who looks like me,
and you two met her at a market.

381
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,800
Judging from your faces, it's true then.

382
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,680
It's true, isn't it?

383
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,960
If you're asking that,

384
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,800
does that mean you didn't know before?

385
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,920
That's right.

386
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,080
-What?
-What?

387
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,560
I heard Keaw and Prang talking.

388
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,960
It didn't make sense to me,
but now I understand.

389
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,360
Oh, dear.

390
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,040
My lady, it's not nice of you to bluff us
into telling you the truth like this.

391
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,320
I don't care.

392
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,320
Take me to see her now.

393
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,800
How can we do that, my lady?

394
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,240
We don't know where she lives.

395
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,880
Oh, really?

396
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,360
-No, my lady.
-No, my lady.

397
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,880
Okay, I will tell you then.

398
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,760
She lives in Gui's orchard.

399
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,600
My lady.

400
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,920
My lady, why are you going there?

401
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,240
Why would you go there, my lady?

402
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,880
Ask yourself this.

403
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,360
If you were told there was someone
who looked like you, would you go?

404
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,160
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

405
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,440
That's right. So I want to see her.

406
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,280
-Okay, my lady.
-Okay, my lady.

407
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,000
Of course.

408
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,480
My goodness.

409
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,160
-My lady.
-Please wait for us, my lady.

410
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,280
Hello, Gui.

411
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,640
I brought something to pawn.

412
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,280
Please accept it.

413
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,000
What did you say?

414
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,720
It's this necklace, Gui.

415
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,720
How much money
could I get for this necklace?

416
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,920
Well.

417
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,680
This necklace is one baht of gold

418
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
and the pendant is two baht.

419
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,640
I will give you four tamlueng per baht.

420
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,720
What do you need so much money for?

421
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,120
I need to invest it in something.

422
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,960
What investment?

423
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,840
You'll see.

424
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,480
It's a secret for now.

425
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,400
Do as you please.

426
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,120
I will wait and see.

427
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,920
Thank you. You're always kind to me.

428
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,800
How pretentious.

429
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,040
-Aun.
-Yes, ma'am.

430
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,280
Put this away.

431
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,360
Grandma, listen to me.

432
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,040
You're too kind to her.

433
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,320
You gave her more than
what that gold would cost new.

434
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,600
If she doesn't come back for it,

435
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,000
she will have made a profit.

436
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,240
You have never taken such a loss, Grandma.

437
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,760
If you love her so much,
then adopt her as your granddaughter.

438
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,760
What do you say, Grandma?
Why are you quiet?

439
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,400
You're thinking of doing it, aren't you?

440
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,440
Klin.

441
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,400
What on earth has happened

442
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,120
to your words and thoughts, you brat?

443
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,280
I'm almost at my limit.

444
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,160
How has Pudtarn offended you

445
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,640
that you hold such a grudge against her?

446
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,720
She's right.

447
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,160
Why do I despise her so?

448
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,480
I don't know either, Grandma.

449
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,640
We must have been enemies in a past life.

450
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,840
That must be why I hated her
the moment I saw her.

451
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,040
Let's just say I despise her.

452
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,160
Fine. The feeling is mutual.

453
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,720
Is it good?

454
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,280
Is it?

455
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,520
Yes, ma'am.

456
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,680
What is good?

457
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,800
Staying away from Miss Klin.

458
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,360
Yes, I agree with you.

459
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,760
How do you know?

460
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,000
I heard you.

461
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,800
What did you hear?

462
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,400
"Fine. The feeling is mutual."

463
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,800
Have you left yet, Klin?

464
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,440
Nual.

465
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,480
I asked Klin to deliver
some vegetables to…

466
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,719
Oh, dear.

467
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,880
My lady.

468
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,560
What brings you here, my lady?

469
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,920
Please come into my house.

470
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,840
Pin and Yaem informed me

471
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,400
that you have a relative
who looks similar to me staying here.

472
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,320
Is this true?

473
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,679
What? Where did it go?

474
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,200
I'll get you this time.

475
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,200
Got you!

476
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,160
My gosh.

477
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,680
Damn it!

478
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,160
Why is this so damn hard?

479
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,520
Will I get to eat one today?

480
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,280
You can't even catch a fish,

481
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,640
yet you have the nerve
to live by yourself.

482
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,640
How pitiful.

483
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,880
What's it to you?

484
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,760
If you despise me so much,
then just leave me alone.

485
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,400
You bitch.
You are bold speaking to me like that.

486
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,400
It's not so bold. It's easy for me.

487
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,880
Miss, let's give her the vegetables
and leave.

488
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,480
This is none of your business.

489
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,280
If Grandma hadn't asked me
to deliver you vegetables,

490
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,600
do you think I would have set foot here?

491
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,040
Thank you so much
for coming all the way here,

492
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,120
but if it's such a bother to you,
then don't come.

493
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,680
And do you think I don't know
why you came here today?

494
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,520
You're still mad at me, aren't you?

495
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,120
You want to cause trouble, don't you?

496
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,560
Yes, because I despise you.

497
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,960
Also,

498
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,800
don't you dare tell me
where I should and shouldn't go.

499
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,520
Wherever I choose to go is my business.

500
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,920
You don't own this place.

501
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,280
My grandma may have shown you kindness,

502
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,560
but don't be so arrogant.

503
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,160
I'm her granddaughter,

504
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,520
meaning this land also belongs to me.

505
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:59,360
But you, you're just a beggar.
Don't be so arrogant.

506
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,040
My goodness.

507
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Why don't you just hit me?

508
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,400
Well? I feel like a fight now.

509
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,040
I have been bored. Let me warm up first.

510
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,320
-Come here!
-My goodness.

511
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,160
-Goodness!
-My gosh!

512
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,800
-Goodness, Im!
-Good grief!

513
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,080
-Dear me!
-My gosh!

514
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,520
You madwoman, you've lost your senses.

515
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,560
Would you dare slap me?

516
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,800
I'm the granddaughter of Gui,
who owns the land you're living on.

517
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,080
If you touch me,
I will tell her to throw you out.

518
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160
Do as you please.

519
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,920
Without my grandma's kindness,

520
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,560
you would starve to death.

521
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,320
Go ahead and tell Gui now

522
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,080
or we can fight before you go.

523
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,120
-Bring it on! Come!
-My goodness.

524
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,960
-My gosh!
-Dear me!

525
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,840
Im, where are you going?

526
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,920
Why are you hiding behind her?
Where's your courage?

527
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,600
Why are you hiding?

528
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,640
You're out of your mind.

529
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,880
Let's go, Im.

530
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,360
Where are we going, miss?

531
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,760
Back to the residence, you fool.

532
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,960
I don't want to waste my energy on her.

533
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,720
My gosh.

534
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,440
I don't want to waste
my energy on you either!

535
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,960
I have better things to waste it on.

536
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,680
Are you going to visit her, my lady?

537
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,800
That's right, Gui.

538
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,440
I would like to see
how closely she resembles me.

539
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,320
She does look like you,

540
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,200
but she is ill-mannered,
while you are beautiful and polite.

541
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,600
Am I beautiful and polite?

542
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,120
Yes, my lady.

543
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,000
You're polite, soft, and sweet, my lady.

544
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,960
I think we should leave, Pin, Yaem.

545
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,760
We should, my lady,

546
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,760
if you don't want to be
knocked out with flattery.

547
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,840
Where did Klin go?

548
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,720
Has she returned
from delivering the vegetables to Pudtarn?

549
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,320
I'm back.

550
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,360
Greetings, my lady.

551
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,160
What took you so long?
Did you stop somewhere?

552
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,840
I need you to do something for me.

553
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,400
Don't bother her.

554
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,360
I can go with Pin and Yaem.

555
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,080
Klin, take Her Ladyship to see Pudtarn.

556
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,640
Would you rather
we brought her here, my lady?

557
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,600
That'd be a waste of time.

558
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,960
My lady, please don't waste your time.

559
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,480
She's not at her house.

560
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,440
She only just left here.

561
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,920
Where could she have gone?

562
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,360
I don't know.

563
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,360
I only know that she isn't at her house.

564
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,080
I left the vegetables
in front of her house

565
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,360
because I didn't see her.

566
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,000
It's all right.

567
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,920
You stay here, Klin.

568
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,920
I will go there with Pin and Yaem.

569
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,480
I'm leaving, Gui.

570
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,720
Yes, my lady.

571
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,440
Why are we doing this?

572
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,800
Miss Pudtarn said she wanted to make…

573
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,840
compost.

574
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,000
What is that?

575
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,800
Eung.

576
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,760
Where is Miss Pudtarn?

577
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,000
I don't know, Pin.

578
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,520
I don't know either.

579
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,680
How long has she been gone?

580
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,040
We were collecting some leaves over there

581
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,360
and she was no longer here
when we returned.

582
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,960
That's right.

583
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,480
Well then, both of you follow us.

584
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,960
Come on.

585
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,240
Our mistress isn't here, my lady.

586
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,240
Let's go home.

587
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,200
We can return another time, my lady.

588
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,280
Let's wait a moment.
I have yet to meet her.

589
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,280
Gosh.

590
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,720
I can see many of them swimming,
but why can't I catch them?

591
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,440
Why is this so hard?

592
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,120
Let's try it again, Tarn.

593
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,840
I'm here fighting for my life.
Why is my life fighting back like this?

594
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,240
Come on.

595
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,080
Come on, guys.

596
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,840
Come on.

597
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,440
-My lady--
-Wait a little longer.

598
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,320
You have said that
many times already, my lady.

599
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,440
Just a bit longer.

600
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,160
The sun is still in the sky.

601
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,280
Let's find Miss Pudtarn.

602
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,720
She must have gone fishing.

603
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,920
She's right there. I knew it.
She came to catch some fish.

604
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,720
-What?
-What's wrong with her?

605
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,520
Maybe she's just sleeping.

606
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,040
We must wake her up no matter what.

607
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,600
It's almost dark now.

608
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,800
Do you think I don't know that?

609
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,400
No.

610
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,360
I was afraid
you would think I didn't know.

611
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,760
Are you trying to annoy me?

612
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,800
No, I'm not.

613
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,720
I'm awake.

614
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,080
I'm waiting for the ending.

615
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,920
Let's go. Someone is waiting for you.

616
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,880
Who is it?

617
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,480
Hurry up, miss.

618
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,240
Okay.

619
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,560
Eung.

620
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,320
Just go. I can walk by myself.

621
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,240
-Let's go.
-Be careful, miss.

622
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,760
There she is, Lady Karaked.

623
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,280
She's about to leave. Let's hurry, miss.

624
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,600
Is that Baron Maharit's mother?

625
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,760
-Yes.
-Yes.

626
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,000
Do you know why she came to see me?

627
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,640
-No.
-No.

628
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,600
I do.

629
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,120
Look at my tummy.

630
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,200
It's full of your food, Mother.

631
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,360
Prang.

632
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,560
That's not how ladies talk.

633
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,840
But it's true, Grandmother.

634
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,760
Even the food in the palace
isn't as delicious as hers.

635
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,320
She also cooked a new dish today.

636
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,880
What is it again, Prang?

637
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,560
Spicy chicken feet soup
with Chinese herbs.

638
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,320
It's so yummy.

639
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,800
Your mother

640
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,440
is all smiles now

641
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,600
because you are all here.

642
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,720
She is almost

643
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,880
smiling from ear to ear.

644
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,880
Ruang.

645
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,160
What time will you depart tomorrow?

646
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,040
At dawn, Grandmother.

647
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,000
Ruang.

648
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,680
When will you take up a post in Ayutthaya?

649
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,320
Are you going to stay in Song Kwae
until you grow old?

650
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,880
Or could it be that
you have a secret wife there?

651
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,960
I don't, Mother.

652
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,840
It seems that I'll forever be single.

653
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,840
If I cannot find a woman
who shares some of your characteristics,

654
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,280
then I shall not get married.

655
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,760
I agree with Ruang on this.

656
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,560
Do you, Rid?

657
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,160
Your chances are slim then.

658
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,920
A woman like my wife

659
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,200
is not easy to come by.

660
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,800
I can't argue with you

661
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,120
because it's true.

662
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,680
All right.

663
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,440
Ruang,

664
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,160
bid goodbye to your grandmother now.

665
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,560
That way, she won't have to get up
to see you off.

666
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,560
Yes, Father.

667
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,520
I wish you happiness, my dear grandson.

668
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,800
Come back to visit me soon.

669
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,640
Yes, Grandmother.

670
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,440
I miss your grandfather so much.

671
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,560
He didn't get to meet his grandchildren.

672
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,760
Not one of you.

673
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,280
I think the smoke is going to kill us.

674
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,280
Gosh.

675
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,560
We will die before the mosquitoes.

676
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,760
Miss.

677
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,600
Why did Lady Karaked come to see you?

678
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,240
Are you still wondering?

679
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,720
Yes, miss.

680
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,640
You said you knew, didn't you?

681
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,000
Yes, I know.

682
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,320
Her son must have asked her to tell me

683
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,360
that the Krishna Kali Manuscript
belongs to their family.

684
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,200
But I won't back down, even if
he sends his mother to threaten me.

685
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,920
I was holding the manuscript in my hand.

686
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,720
It was in this hand when I came here.

687
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,960
I'm going to fight hard for it.
Just wait and see.

688
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,000
Eung, where is Lord Rid's residence?

689
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,680
Are you going there, miss?

690
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,400
Don't be so shocked.

691
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,760
I won't go to a man's house.
I was just asking.

692
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,680
Should I tell Perm to go and get him?

693
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,800
Look at him.

694
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,600
What is the name
of Lord Rid's male servant again?

695
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,440
Choi.

696
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,280
What?

697
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,720
You asked for his name, miss.

698
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,120
Okay. His name is Choi.

699
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,840
I will get Perm to ask him for it.

700
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,760
What are you going to ask Choi about?

701
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,720
What do you want to say?

702
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,160
Speak of the devil.

703
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,920
Who is the devil?

704
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,160
I was talking about myself, not you.

705
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,640
-By the way, did you--
-Hold on.

706
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,400
Let me try to understand this first.

707
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,600
I've been confused for a while now.

708
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,840
The words "me" and "you"

709
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,800
that you use mean

710
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,960
me…

711
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,840
and you,

712
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,440
right?

713
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,880
Let's go again.

714
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,680
I'm going to ask you two questions.

715
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,120
-Did you bring them?
-Wait.

716
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,360
You haven't answered my question yet.

717
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,080
My throat hurts. I don't want to talk.

718
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,360
Did you bring them?

719
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,960
The book

720
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,360
and a notebook.

721
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,840
Notebook, check.

722
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,520
Pencil,

723
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,680
check.

724
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,240
What about the book?

725
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,640
That book is mine.

726
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,600
I don't care who it belongs to.

727
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,120
Did you bring it, my lord?

728
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,040
I did not bring it.

729
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,440
My brother has taken it to Phitsanulok.

730
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,440
He departed today at dawn.

731
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,480
What did you say?

732
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,120
Well, that book belongs to my family.

733
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,720
My brother is taking it for safekeeping.

734
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,840
You gave me your word,

735
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,840
so why did your brother
take it to Phitsanulok?

736
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,560
Was my request not important at all?

737
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,440
Don't you know

738
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,840
that something deemed
unimportant by one person

739
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,320
might be a matter of life and death
to someone else?

740
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,640
Listen, why are you
making such a fuss over this?

741
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,360
It's merely a book.

742
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,480
Is it so important?

743
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,160
It is.

744
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,960
I'm going to Phitsanulok.

745
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,280
What?

746
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,480
You have no idea
how important that thing is to me.

747
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,440
It's my whole life.

748
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,880
I ended up here because of that book

749
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,800
and if I want to go back
to where I came from,

750
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,960
I will have to use it.

751
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,000
Are you saying

752
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,040
the Krishna Kali Manuscript

753
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,960
brought you here?

754
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,240
That's right.

755
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,560
How else could I have gotten here?

756
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,240
I apologize
for not asking you in the first place.

757
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,560
How are you so certain

758
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,560
that once you have the manuscript,

759
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,920
that you can return?

760
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,360
And where is the place

761
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,240
you came from?

762
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,880
You won't believe me if I tell you,
so you're better off not knowing.

763
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,520
And I don't know
if the book will take me back.

764
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,800
I have to try.

765
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,400
She came from heaven, my lord.

766
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,160
Come off it, Eung.

767
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,320
How about this?

768
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,400
I will send a rider after my brother.

769
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,600
If he can catch up with him,
I will have him bring it to you.

770
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:00,440
If not, I will send word to my brother,

771
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:04,680
asking him to bring it with him
the next time he returns.

772
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,400
It won't be too bad.

773
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,280
You'll have to wait…

774
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,000
six months.

775
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,240
Six months?

776
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,240
-Yes.
-Half a year.

777
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,440
How will I survive?

778
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,320
I would like to go to Song Kwae.

779
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,480
Please.

780
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,200
-Please, Khun Pi.
-Hey.

781
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,200
I heard you.

782
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,320
You're the best
at knowing what your wife wants.

783
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,320
Mother.

784
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,040
Come on.

785
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,640
I knew your mother wouldn't come here.

786
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,480
Right, you know everything.

787
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,880
Do you think I will sulk
and forget about this?

788
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,040
No way.

789
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,240
Why do you want to go there?

790
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,760
It's far

791
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,840
and the way there is tough.

792
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,840
I want to see how Ruang lives.

793
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,920
Your friend, Rueang,

794
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,920
doesn't show any sign
of returning to Phra Nakorn.

795
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,720
I'm worried about our sons.

796
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,840
They are twins.
I want them to be together.

797
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,880
It's this necklace, Gui.

798
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,360
How much money
could I get for this necklace?

799
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,880
-Aun.
-Yes, ma'am.

800
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,120
Put this away.

801
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,880
What are you doing here, Klin?

802
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,480
I…

803
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,920
Nothing, Grandma.

804
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,440
What are you pacing around for?

805
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,920
Well…

806
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,880
I'm going to Talad Noi,

807
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,520
but you were asleep,
so I didn't dare wake you.

808
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,760
Do you want me to buy some fish for you?

809
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,960
Oh, okay.

810
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,320
Buy some pork too.

811
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,280
Give me the keys.

812
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,440
I'll give you some money.

813
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,120
Okay.

814
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,280
Goodness, Grandma.

815
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,120
You have a lot of money here.

816
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,680
Right, take it to buy your things.

817
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,760
Okay.

818
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,680
I'll get going.

819
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,720
Im.

820
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,520
How may I help you, miss?

821
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,840
-Come with me.
-Where to?

822
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,320
Come on.

823
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,560
I will leave it to you.

824
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,760
-Im.
-Yes, miss.

825
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,160
Are you sure Song will pass by?

826
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,280
Yes, miss.

827
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,360
I asked the vendors here.

828
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,720
They said Song visits the pier

829
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,520
in front of Petch Fort every day.

830
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,120
So why hasn't he shown up?

831
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,440
I only told Grandma

832
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,880
that I'd come here
to buy some pork and fish.

833
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,320
It's taking so long.
Won't she get suspicious?

834
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,960
Miss Klin.

835
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:24,200
Why do you want to meet Song?

836
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,040
It's inappropriate

837
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,200
to wait for a man, miss.

838
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,760
And Madam Gui doesn't like Song either.

839
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,760
I can't stand to listen to you.
Go and wait for me at the pier.

840
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,440
I will wait for Song alone.

841
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,920
And this is my business.

842
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,160
We're in broad daylight,

843
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,080
and I'm not meeting him
in secret or anything.

844
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,240
Go and wait for me at the pier.

845
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,240
We will leave as soon as I have finished
talking to Song

846
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,800
so the pork and the fish won't spoil.

847
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,080
Yes, miss.

848
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,840
SONG

849
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,320
Klin.

850
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,200
What are you doing here?

851
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,720
I was waiting for you.

852
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,880
I require your assistance with something.

853
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,600
What is it, my lady?

854
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:42,280
Whatever it is,
I will do my best to help you.

855
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,720
What sweet words.

856
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,480
Are you trying to get me
to be one of your wives?

857
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,280
You court me every time we meet.

858
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,600
Perhaps be a little more discreet.

859
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,000
I speak from my heart.

860
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,520
To deny what it feels…

861
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,640
is not possible.

862
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,320
Let's not waste time.

863
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:05,640
Here.

864
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:13,960
Sell this for me.

865
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,440
A necklace?

866
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,240
And what is this pendant?

867
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,280
Its shape is unusual.

868
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,560
It's all gold.

869
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,120
It is around three baht in weight.

870
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,040
Once we get the money,

871
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,520
I will give you two-thirds of it.

872
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,880
Give me the money tomorrow.

873
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,080
My grandma and I

874
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,720
will be at the Fuel Market
in the morning delivering vegetables.

875
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,560
But don't let her see you.

876
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,080
I already fear your grandmother.

877
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:44,160
But this pendant

878
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,480
is most strange.

879
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,800
It belonged to my parents.

880
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,480
Now,

881
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,240
I need money to buy something I need more.

882
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,040
But I don't dare ask Grandma for money.

883
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,480
You know how frugal she is, Song.

884
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,880
Okay.

885
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,000
Sure.

886
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,360
I will secure the best price

887
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,560
for you, my dearest Klin.

888
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,800
Does that sound good?

889
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:14,920
Very well,

890
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,319
I should leave now

891
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,040
before the fish I bought turns bad.

892
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:24,680
See you again tomorrow.

893
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,359
You're so easily frightened, Song.

894
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:53,399
Lord Rid.

895
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:55,279
You scared me half to death.

896
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,120
So

897
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,880
this necklace and pendant…

898
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:08,760
Klin, Gui's granddaughter,
asked me to sell it for her, my lord.

899
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,680
She said it's around three baht.

900
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,080
Sell it?

901
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,359
Let me see it.

902
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:34,359
Choi.

903
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,720
You're right.

904
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,760
How much do you want?

905
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,640
I shall buy it.

906
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,720
I knew it would interest you

907
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,479
since the pendant is so unusual.

908
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,359
I know you admire unusual things.

909
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:55,040
Klin, Gui's granddaughter,

910
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,200
said this necklace belonged to her.
Is that correct?

911
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,120
Yes, my lord.
She said it belonged to her parents.

912
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,080
She's selling it behind Gui's back,

913
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,320
so she would rather no one hears of this.

914
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,240
Okay.

915
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:08,920
I'll buy it

916
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,040
but

917
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,640
don't tell Klin who bought it.

918
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,280
Are you afraid
she will try to buy it back?

919
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,120
Well, yes.

920
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,760
I don't want to complicate the matter.

921
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,760
Of course, my lord.

922
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,960
I will tell her a Khmer merchant
from Battambang bought it.

923
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,240
Okay.

924
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,640
Keep a close eye on someone.

925
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:07,640
Prince Dum is plotting a treasonous coup
to seize the throne.

926
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,520
Spread the word

927
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,520
that I will disguise myself
take some leisure time outside the city.

928
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:13,720
Is there anyone here?

929
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,120
Yes, I'm here.

930
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,120
I went to forage for bamboo shoots.

931
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,760
Am I dreaming?

932
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,240
It belongs to Pudtarn.

933
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,800
