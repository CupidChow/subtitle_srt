1
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,920
What a wide grin she has.

2
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,640
-Eung.
-This belongs to Miss Klin.

3
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,120
Klin, you bitch. You're dead!

4
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,400
The only thing you will gain
by yelling at her is an epic thrill.

5
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,880
-This is the last time.
-What is this about?

6
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,160
Otherwise, you'll get hurt
and a doctor will be of no help.

7
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,200
What are you doing?

8
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,160
The baron had me bring dessert ingredients
to prepare for you, miss.

9
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,600
Love that is sweet and rejuvenating.

10
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,720
Klin, what happened to you?

11
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,320
Why are you crying?

12
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,400
I feel absolutely terrible.

13
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,760
What happened?

14
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,960
I did something wrong.

15
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,200
Now I realize that I was wrong.

16
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,000
But my grandma won't forgive me.

17
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,920
She scolded and insulted me.

18
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,800
You did something wrong?

19
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,040
What did you do?

20
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,400
I truly do not know

21
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,160
why I dislike Pudtarn so,

22
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,840
when she is a good person

23
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,360
and has never hurt anyone.

24
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,960
Why don't you try to think why that is so?

25
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,160
I have pondered this
over and over, my lord.

26
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,880
But I still don't know why.

27
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,120
I did not know her before,

28
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,040
so why would I despise
or feel vengeful towards her?

29
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,560
Unless…

30
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,600
What?

31
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,360
Unless…

32
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,000
someone performed black magic on me.

33
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,000
Black magic?

34
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,760
It must be, my lord.

35
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,120
Otherwise, why would I have gone as far
as ruining her vegetable beds?

36
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,800
When you were stamping on
and pulling those vegetables,

37
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,240
how did you feel?

38
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
I couldn't control myself.

39
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,360
It was as if someone
was forcing my hands to pull them…

40
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,440
and my feet to stamp on them.

41
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,440
I tried to stop myself…

42
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,760
but I couldn't.

43
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,440
I couldn't control myself.

44
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,120
Are you sure
what you're telling me is true?

45
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,200
I wonder if this is true
or if you are making it up.

46
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,720
It's true.

47
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,280
I had no reason to do that.

48
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,360
I'm terribly sorry for what I did.

49
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,440
Is there anything else to suggest
you are the victim of black magic?

50
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,120
Yes, my lord.

51
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,480
I have been more temperamental than usual.

52
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,080
I have also been depressed,
which isn't like me.

53
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,120
Sometimes…

54
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,480
I cry for no reason.

55
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,240
Hey.

56
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,560
Choi, what are you doing here?

57
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm waiting for the baron.

58
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,880
Where is he?

59
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,480
He's with Miss Klin.

60
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,920
They are over there.

61
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,120
And what are you doing here?

62
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,840
I'm returning this pot to Madam Gui.

63
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,480
Go then.

64
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,480
I…

65
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,600
I don't really believe in black magic.

66
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,080
Are you sure about this?

67
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,840
If it wasn't black magic,

68
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,120
then what could it be, my lord?

69
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,120
Do you want me

70
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,520
to tell Pudtarn the truth?

71
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,240
That would be great.

72
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,840
Thank you.

73
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,919
I will relay this to her.

74
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,440
Don't worry about it.

75
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,840
Yes, my lord.

76
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,840
Choi.

77
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,520
What I told you,

78
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,560
do you believe it?

79
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,800
Do you believe it, my lord?

80
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,680
Whether I believe it or not
does not matter.

81
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,040
What matters is
whether Pudtarn will believe it.

82
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,520
I will relay Klin's words to Pudtarn.

83
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,360
Let's see what she says.

84
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,720
Praejeen, how was it?

85
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,480
Is som tam difficult to make?

86
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,080
Yaem, have you prepared some
for Praejeen to take home?

87
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Yes, my lady.

88
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,760
Why hasn't Rid returned yet?

89
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,520
Lady Karaked,

90
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,000
does Rid return home late
like this every day?

91
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,840
I've been coming to learn cooking,
but I have yet to see him.

92
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,360
Or could it be that

93
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,280
he is avoiding me?

94
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,960
He must be busy at the moment.

95
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,520
I wonder how Praejeen was raised.

96
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,080
She only cares about herself.

97
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,480
Prang, keep it down or she will hear you.

98
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,240
Come on, she's probably deaf.

99
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,680
She doesn't seem to hear anything.

100
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,560
She only cares about Rid.

101
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,200
-By the way, Pin.
-Yes, my lady.

102
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,640
We're almost out of sticky rice.

103
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,000
I have already told the seller
to save some for you.

104
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,840
She said many more people are eating it

105
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,200
since you introduced it to everyone.

106
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,640
Really?

107
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,920
My lady,

108
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,800
would you allow Lord Rid
to take a commoner for a wife?

109
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,920
Why not?

110
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,280
Is a commoner not human?

111
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,880
You should ask Lady Champa that.

112
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,000
She's right, my lady.

113
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,440
My poor Rid.

114
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,200
Why isn't Rid home yet?

115
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,760
I want him to try the som tam.

116
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,040
His Lordship eats it often, my lady.

117
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,120
Well, I want him to try
the one I prepared.

118
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,520
Why are you trying to undermine me?

119
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,160
Know your place.

120
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,560
Yes, my lady.

121
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,320
I fear the baron

122
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,280
is still at Miss Pudtarn's house, my lady.

123
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,720
I heard him ask Choi
to take dessert ingredients along.

124
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,120
She's right, my lady.

125
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,920
I saw Choi carrying loads of stuff.

126
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,440
I bid you farewell, Lady Karaked.

127
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,000
Please sit down, my lady.

128
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,120
Hey, don't touch my hand.

129
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,960
You should sit down
when addressing Her Ladyship.

130
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,520
Can't you see that I'm about to leave?

131
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,520
Are you leaving, Praejeen?

132
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,920
Of course, she has bid Mother farewell.

133
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,320
How about you show me
how you bid her farewell,

134
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,440
little Praejeen?

135
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,200
You're the same age as me.
Why did you call me little?

136
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,120
That's because I adore you
like my little sister.

137
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,320
Fine, you're not my little sister.
Let's be friends then, okay?

138
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,280
This is what we do, Praejeen.

139
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,880
My goodness.

140
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,440
In case Rid raises his hand like this,

141
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,680
you will know what to do.

142
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,920
Wouldn't you like that?

143
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,040
Is that true, Lady Karaked?

144
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,520
Yes, Praejeen.

145
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,520
If Rid sees you do this,

146
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,640
I'm sure he will be delighted.

147
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,960
I think she is wet behind the ears.

148
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Even worse, she is arrogant.

149
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,640
She wants to be part of this family.
Do you think they are okay with her?

150
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,880
There's probably only one person
who is okay with her.

151
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,480
Who is that?

152
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,920
-Lady--
-Lady--

153
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,400
Prik.

154
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,400
Prik.

155
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,840
I know my name is Prik.

156
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,400
But who were you referring to just now?

157
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
My goodness!

158
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,280
Wait and see.

159
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,800
-Just wait and see!
-Goodness.

160
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,600
-Darn it.
-Pin.

161
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,040
Didn't you see her?

162
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,800
What about you?

163
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,960
Gosh, she gets stronger with age.

164
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,240
My goodness!

165
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,000
She also has good ears.

166
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,160
Rid.

167
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,200
Rid.

168
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,079
What are you doing, Praejeen?

169
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,240
Give her five, Rid.

170
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,240
What? Five?

171
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,560
What five?

172
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,400
Come on, Rid.

173
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,960
Give her five like…

174
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,400
I see.

175
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,640
Sure.

176
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,200
Where have you been, Rid?

177
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,720
You came back so late.

178
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,240
I went to Pudtarn's house.

179
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,720
I made her some dessert.

180
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,040
You made it for her?

181
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,880
Yes, she wanted to have it.

182
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,080
Why did she have you make it for her?

183
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,040
She didn't ask me to make it.
I made it for her myself.

184
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,120
Don't be impatient, my dear sister.

185
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,520
Leave this to the parents.

186
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,480
I am the bride.
Do we even have a say in this?

187
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,000
Of course we do.

188
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,840
Let our parents discuss it.

189
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,800
But I will be his first wife, won't I?

190
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,360
Yes.

191
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,560
It must be that way.

192
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,000
Pudtarn is of low birth.

193
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,720
She's incomparable to you.

194
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,840
You're the daughter
of Marquess Kosathibodi,

195
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,000
who is the Minister of the Treasury.

196
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,040
His power and wealth
are second only to the king.

197
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,960
-Have the goods arrived?
-Yes, my lady.

198
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,320
Put them over there.

199
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,680
Yes, my lady.

200
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,160
Khun Pi, would you like to have tea now?

201
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,640
Can't you see it's hot and dusty here?

202
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,200
Why would you give me tea?

203
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,040
There is a time and a place.

204
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,880
Yes.

205
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,920
Our daughter needs to tell you something.

206
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,720
What is it?

207
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,880
Praejeen.

208
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,560
Must I listen to her now?

209
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,040
May I not rest for a while?

210
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,960
Okay.

211
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,720
Please get some rest first.

212
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,120
Let's go.

213
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,440
Choon.

214
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,560
Come here first.

215
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,200
It will be better soon. Don't worry.

216
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,840
Pleasure me.

217
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,480
Yes, my lord.

218
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,720
Mother.

219
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,040
I see.

220
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,760
Has Father brought a new one?

221
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,560
Mother, are you going to cry?

222
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,320
Why would you cry?

223
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,440
Father only has 20 mistresses or so.
He has yet to reach 30.

224
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,480
I heard Marquess Chakri
has nearly 40 wives.

225
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,200
My dear Praejeen,
your father should come out soon.

226
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,200
He won't take long.

227
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,560
My girl, don't be surprised.

228
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,360
It's only natural. It's how it happens.

229
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,760
Yes, Mother.

230
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,440
Pong, listen to me.

231
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,640
Yes, my lord.

232
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,680
Why did you slap her face?

233
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,120
Because I wanted to.

234
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,440
Why would you want to do that?

235
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,760
I don't know why.

236
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,960
That's impossible.

237
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,200
You know very well, yet you still did it.

238
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,040
Are you trying to challenge me?

239
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,280
Why would I want to challenge you?

240
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,760
Please think about it.

241
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,400
I have never stopped you
from having mistresses

242
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,600
as I know they satisfy your desires
and that you're allowed to.

243
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,040
I asked why you slapped her.
Get to the point.

244
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,520
Even though I slapped her,

245
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,840
she was still willing to pleasure you

246
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,880
as if I hadn't hurt her.

247
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,040
Why does it trouble you so?

248
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,200
It troubles me

249
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,160
because I had to look at her face
with your slap marks on it.

250
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,960
I'm troubled by this. Do you understand?

251
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,920
Yes, I do.

252
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,920
Don't do this again.

253
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,080
I will slap any women you bring here.

254
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,960
I will slap every one of them.

255
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,480
Just you try.

256
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,520
I'm aware that

257
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,000
husbands have power
over their wives in Ayutthaya

258
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,200
and I accept that,

259
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,800
especially as you're
the Minister of the Treasury.

260
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,200
Your power is boundless.

261
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,040
The king even defers to you
on some issues,

262
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,480
and this makes you
the most powerful husband

263
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,520
in all of Ayutthaya.

264
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,200
However, you're not
the only man in my life.

265
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,400
There is also my father,

266
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,960
who you made a promise to

267
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,760
when King Phetracha bestowed me upon you.

268
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,480
I hope you still remember this

269
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,440
because I have never forgotten it.

270
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,920
I remember.

271
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,200
You don't need to repeat it.

272
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,960
Mother, you talked back
at Father that way.

273
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,240
Weren't you scared of him?

274
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,800
Goodness, I'm shaking right now.

275
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,840
Of course I was scared.
I thought I might faint.

276
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,840
Are you sure you were scared?

277
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,200
Yes, I was.

278
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,720
Mother,

279
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,440
I'm not as wise as you.

280
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,360
You're just 15.

281
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,360
Do you expect to know as much as me?
I'm nearly 40.

282
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,440
No, Mother.

283
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,640
Mother,

284
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,880
what did Grandfather say to Father?

285
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,320
Your grandfather told him that

286
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,920
he could have as many mistresses
as he wanted

287
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,320
as I would tolerate it for his sake,

288
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,160
but he had to promise one thing.

289
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,640
What was it?

290
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,480
Praejeen, mind your manners.

291
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,320
Don't interrupt your elders
when they speak.

292
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,160
What was the promise, Mother?

293
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,680
He asked your father
to promise just one thing.

294
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,720
He could have
as many mistresses as he wished,

295
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,120
but they must not join our household,
as it would hurt me.

296
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,120
Why did Father obey Grandfather?

297
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,360
Back then, your father was a civil servant

298
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,640
with only the title of a count,
while your grandfather was a marquess.

299
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,240
Mother, please ask Baron Maharit

300
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,760
to make the same promise
Father made to Grandfather.

301
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,680
I will certainly do that.

302
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,160
Thank you.

303
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,560
I don't want to see Pudtarn
in our residence after we are married.

304
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,440
Does Rid have an eye for that commoner?

305
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,320
I don't know, Mother.

306
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,680
Why don't you ask In?

307
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,800
Don't worry, Praejeen.

308
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,000
Children must comply
with what their parents arrange for them.

309
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,600
Especially when it comes to a spouse.

310
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,680
The parents will surely find someone
suitable for their children.

311
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,080
As soon as Father asks His Majesty,

312
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,120
he will issue a royal command.

313
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,920
Marquess Wisut Sakorn can't go against it.

314
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,960
And…

315
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,640
what about Lady Karaked?

316
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,560
She's just his wife.

317
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,680
She doesn't have a say in this, my dear.

318
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,000
It's called an arranged marriage.
I despise the notion.

319
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,880
You despise it? Why is that so?

320
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,760
My friends at the palace

321
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,240
also left their duties to get married
once their parents found them a spouse.

322
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,280
Exactly, I don't like that.

323
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,880
A couple should be in love
before they marry.

324
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,360
The parents can't just handpick a spouse,
shove them together,

325
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,200
and expect them to get along.

326
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,800
Do you understand, my dear?

327
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,480
My lady, please walk properly.

328
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,640
I am.

329
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,680
You didn't bump into me,
so what's the problem?

330
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,920
-I forgot.
-Forgot?

331
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,160
-I forgot.
-Forgot?

332
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,440
-I forgot.
-What did you forget?

333
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,920
I forgot…

334
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,360
You're awesome, Kheow.

335
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,360
My makeup basket.

336
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,240
I'm going to give Keaw a makeover.

337
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,920
-Yes, my lady.
-Let's go.

338
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,920
Keaw, I'm going to…

339
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,800
What's wrong?
Why are you making that face?

340
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,040
Do you know what an arranged marriage is?

341
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,400
Yes. I can't stand the notion.

342
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,600
They handpick a spouse
and shove them together.

343
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,920
I would never stand for it,
no matter what.

344
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,880
What's wrong, Ming?
Don't you want to go anymore?

345
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,520
Of course I do.

346
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,640
If so, then will you go faster?
Why do you keep stopping?

347
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,280
I'm nervous.

348
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,760
I don't know how to tell Keaw.

349
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,680
You don't need to tell her.

350
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,000
You turning up at her dock
tells her all she needs to know.

351
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,080
Well then, I…

352
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,040
Hey, Ming, what's wrong?

353
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,560
Hide, In.

354
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,480
-Hide?
-Hide.

355
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,120
Hide from what? Hide where?

356
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,880
Keaw is sitting over there. Do you see?

357
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,520
Good grief,
do you think she won't see you?

358
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,280
Prang's eyes are as sharp as an eagle's.

359
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,880
She must have seen you already.

360
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,720
Don't move. In, stay still.

361
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,200
Prang, what are you laughing at?

362
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,040
Grandmother will get angry
if she sees you.

363
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,960
Do you really not see him?

364
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,560
Over there.

365
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,880
I see him.

366
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,440
There's nothing strange about it.

367
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,640
Come on, he's shy.

368
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,320
Keaw,

369
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,360
do you like Ming?

370
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,200
Yeuan, let's go inside.

371
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,520
-Kheow.
-Yes, my lady.

372
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,120
Is Keaw blushing?

373
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,720
She's as red as a rose, my lady.

374
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,520
Ming will have it easy.

375
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,720
They're sitting there like statues. Look.

376
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,000
Heavens, Ming.

377
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,920
Why on earth are you doing this?

378
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,720
In, you're being too loud.

379
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,480
You're scared even with me here.

380
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,280
Why did you bring me along?

381
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,040
You asked me to be your chaperone
and escort you to see Keaw.

382
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,280
I did that,
but you won't even go and see her.

383
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,560
Can you tell me why?

384
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,440
I'm scared.

385
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,719
Of whom?

386
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,120
I'm scared of Prang.

387
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,719
-You're scared of Prang?
-Good grief!

388
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,679
In, keep it down.
They probably all heard that.

389
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,040
Good lord.

390
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,880
It's all right, In.

391
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:48,040
I will ask the king
to bestow Keaw upon me before long.

392
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,280
I can no longer wait.

393
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,200
Take us back.

394
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,200
-Carefully, Perm.
-Yes, miss.

395
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,640
Here we go.

396
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,760
Goodness.

397
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,240
This is nothing.

398
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,400
If I stay longer,
I'll build something even better.

399
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,120
Gui.

400
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,800
Hello.

401
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
What?

402
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,040
Look at these beautiful chong kbens.

403
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,280
I bought them for you.

404
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,080
They are too beautiful.
I can't accept them.

405
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,240
Just take them.

406
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,440
As a lady, you should dress beautifully

407
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,520
in case someone sees you

408
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,160
and wants to take you as his wife.

409
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,240
You can live comfortably.

410
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,080
You won't have to grow vegetables
and damage your skin under the sun.

411
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Even though you're the daughter of angels,

412
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,200
you still need a husband.

413
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,040
I'm fine with having one,
but it should happen naturally.

414
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,880
I'm not dressing up just to land a catch.

415
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,960
Land a catch?

416
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,480
Yes. Beauty is in here.

417
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,320
I see.

418
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,520
Let's talk about something else.

419
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:10,080
Eung and Perm
should become husband and wife

420
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,200
so they can bear children to serve you.

421
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,040
What do you think?

422
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,000
Eung and Perm must love each other first.

423
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,160
Why must they?

424
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,040
They must, Gui.

425
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,520
There's no need.

426
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,000
Just make them husband and wife.

427
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,720
I don't think
Kam will dare trouble them anymore.

428
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,640
I need to ask Eung and Perm first.

429
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,960
I don't love Perm like a husband, miss.

430
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,040
I also don't love Eung like a wife, miss.

431
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,360
But I can make you two husband and wife

432
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,680
as I'm your mistress.

433
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,040
-But I refuse.
-But I refuse.

434
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,160
All right, so what do you want to be?

435
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,880
-Siblings, miss.
-Siblings, miss.

436
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,520
Cool.

437
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,160
You are just like them.

438
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,480
-Like who?
-Like who?

439
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,200
Well, you're like people who say,

440
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,160
"We are more like brother and sister."

441
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,600
If you want to be husband and wife,
you can tell me.

442
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,080
I will arrange it for you.

443
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,600
I can't have a new husband, miss.

444
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,640
I haven't divorced Kam.

445
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,360
Do you love Kam?

446
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,480
He's a bastard.

447
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,640
Well, he was nice to me
before I was his wife.

448
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,200
He asked for my hand and we got married,

449
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,840
but when he drank,

450
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,880
he would get angry

451
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,720
and beat me.

452
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,680
Also,

453
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,960
he wanted to sell me off.

454
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,320
Have you ever been in love, Perm?

455
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,720
Never, miss.

456
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,880
You have never met someone you liked?

457
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,160
No, miss.

458
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,120
Perm,

459
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,760
do you not like women?

460
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,480
No, I don't.

461
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,840
They are poseurs.

462
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,400
Hey!

463
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,840
Not all of us are.

464
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,440
How would I know that?

465
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,920
What is a poseur?

466
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,160
They like to put on an act, miss.

467
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,840
I see.

468
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,440
You mean they're fake, right?

469
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,800
Yes, miss.

470
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,200
I see.

471
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,720
Hey, hold on.

472
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,480
I didn't insult you, Eung.

473
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,600
Well, you said women are poseurs.

474
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,200
Am I not a woman?

475
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,840
Calm down, I didn't mean you.

476
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,920
Tell me, Perm. Who were you insulting?

477
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,600
Well, I was talking about

478
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,880
Miss Klin.

479
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,800
Miss Klin was acting shamelessly
with the baron.

480
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,560
I saw it.

481
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,720
What was she doing?

482
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,080
-I have no idea why she was crying,
-Okay.

483
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,560
but I saw His Lordship
embracing and consoling her.

484
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,920
Little did he know it was just a pretense.

485
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,200
Come on, I doubt that
men can't tell if women are pretending.

486
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,360
We can't.

487
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,000
But the baron does like her.

488
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,960
I have often seen them
talking and laughing.

489
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,440
When she delivers goods to his residence,
she always meets with him there.

490
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,720
She's quite beautiful.

491
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,440
-Don't you think so?
-Yes.

492
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,760
But her heart is vile.

493
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,360
I doubt that men can't tell
if women are pretending.

494
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,080
But the baron does like her.

495
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,760
I have often seen them
talking and laughing.

496
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,440
When she delivers goods to his residence,
she always meets with him there.

497
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,280
My gosh.

498
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,240
Gosh, what are these insects?

499
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,560
Goodness, the more I walk,
the more they come.

500
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,720
-Hey!
-Good grief!

501
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,160
Why are you two following me around?

502
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,160
-We have been waiting day…
-…and night.

503
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,720
-When are we going…
-…to know

504
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,400
-…it?
-it?

505
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,240
What's with you two?

506
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,280
-Well, you told us to wait and see.
-To wait and see.

507
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,120
Goodness, you're making me dizzy.

508
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,960
You had me turning here and there.

509
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,400
And there's no need to talk in unison.

510
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,800
It's an unpleasant sound.

511
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,280
Talk one at a time
and I will listen to you.

512
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,720
Well, you told us to wait and see.

513
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,120
Do you remember?

514
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,560
I have been waiting,
but I haven't seen anything yet.

515
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,960
Right, wait and see what?

516
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,000
Well, you can see whatever you want.

517
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,440
No.

518
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,280
We want to see yours.

519
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,760
Hey, what do you want to see?

520
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,360
You perverts.

521
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,880
-No, not that.
-No, not that.

522
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,480
What do you mean? You just said
that you wanted to see mine.

523
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,640
-For god's sake!
-Hey.

524
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,320
You're getting on my nerves.

525
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,120
Will you let us see it or not?

526
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
-Right, let me--
-Stop.

527
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,960
I remember now.

528
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,440
What I told you two to wait and see

529
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,480
was concerning
Lord Rid and Lady Praejeen, wasn't it?

530
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,200
-That's right.
-Good.

531
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,760
I will tell Lady Champa

532
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,040
that you two

533
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,360
have been gossiping behind her back

534
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,080
about her approval

535
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,640
of Lord Rid's marriage to Lady Praejeen.

536
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,920
He won't marry her.

537
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,960
That's right.

538
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,080
He doesn't have feelings
for that Chinese lady.

539
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,000
-Lady Praejeen.
-That's it.

540
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,080
That's why I told you to wait and see

541
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,880
if Lord Rid
would marry Lady Praejeen or not.

542
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,680
Just wait and see.

543
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,800
Move.

544
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,560
Just wait and see.
Wait and see. My goodness!

545
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,200
Let go of me now.

546
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,840
Let go of me! Let go! Goodness!

547
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,480
-Just wait and see.
-Just wait and see.

548
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,320
Look at them. Where did they go?

549
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,520
Grow quickly, little ones.

550
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,440
Perm, do you think Lord Rid

551
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,240
has feelings for our mistress?

552
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,800
Sure.

553
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,120
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

554
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:41,400
If that's the case,
how will he get Lady Champa's approval?

555
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,320
I don't think

556
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,440
Lady Champa would allow it,

557
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,120
given how much she values status.

558
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,880
Hey, think about it.

559
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,800
Look at our mistress and the daughter
of the Chinese Marquess Kosathibodi.

560
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,960
Are they comparable?

561
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,240
Here you go, my lady.

562
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,000
Some parts are still coming off.

563
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,960
Goodness.

564
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,600
My lady.

565
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,160
I'm so worried.

566
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,680
You came just in time.
Finish off this garland for me.

567
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,080
I'm not feeling well.

568
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,600
You're not feeling well

569
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,960
because you're worried about Lord Rid
and Miss Pudtarn. Isn't that right?

570
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,280
Prik, Her Ladyship is not feeling well.

571
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,720
Please don't worry, my lady.

572
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,120
Please believe me.

573
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,280
You must insist that you are pleased

574
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,040
and have no objection.

575
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,680
-What?
-Prik.

576
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,040
You're such a hypocrite.

577
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,400
Didn't you tell me to stand in their way?

578
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,640
That's right, Prik.

579
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,800
I'm not talking to you anymore.
You're always flip-flopping.

580
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,680
You see, my lady,

581
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,400
everybody thinks that you won't allow it.

582
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,760
Pin and Yaem also said

583
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,840
that there is only one person
standing in their way, my lady.

584
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,640
What? They said that?

585
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,640
But please don't be concerned about that

586
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,880
because it's the truth.

587
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,840
-Prik.
-Prik.

588
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,080
Goodness. Please don't raise
your voice at me, my lady.

589
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,800
And you don't have to do
everything she does, Chuang.

590
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,680
Please listen to me, my lady.

591
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,920
Just pretend you accept them

592
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,920
and then do what I tell you.

593
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,680
I guarantee Miss Pudtarn will fail.

594
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,920
Oh, dear.

595
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,840
Come on.

596
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,000
What did you hear?

597
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:11,680
I heard clearly
Prik suggesting to Lady Champa

598
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,600
to pretend to accept
Lord Rid and Miss Pudtarn.

599
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,760
What?

600
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,080
Do you want Her Ladyship to hear you?

601
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,400
Go ahead. She's right there--

602
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,440
What will they do, Pin?

603
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,480
I don't know.

604
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,840
What?

605
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,600
-You don't know?
-No.

606
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,400
Prik whispered to Her Ladyship,
so I didn't hear it.

607
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,800
-This is frustrating.
-I know.

608
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,120
It's all right.

609
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,800
Prik has a big mouth.

610
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,040
She will tell us everything soon.
Trust me.

611
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,600
I really feel sorry for Miss Pudtarn.

612
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,040
If it were Lady…

613
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,080
If it were Lady Karaked…

614
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,880
I would like her
to succeed in love this time.

615
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,800
I miss her.

616
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Well, Tarn?

617
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,760
Do you remember anything now?

618
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,640
Nothing.

619
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,880
This is so strange.

620
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,640
I don't know what to say.

621
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,280
After the accident,

622
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,200
you lost all of your childhood memories.

623
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,400
You definitely don't have brain damage.

624
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,920
You excelled at your studies

625
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,480
and got a 4.0 every year.

626
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,480
Also, you graduated from college

627
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,320
with honors.

628
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,720
It's weird.

629
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,640
Why can't you remember
your childhood at all?

630
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,400
What's worth remembering about it?

631
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,520
Listen. Don't say that again.

632
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,680
I can't bear listening to you anymore.

633
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,320
Then please don't.

634
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,960
Gosh, I wish the lottery numbers
were so easy to predict.

635
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,920
I knew you would talk back
to me like this.

636
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,200
I wasn't going to say anything.

637
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:18,200
Stop right there.
Don't ask me why I said anything.

638
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,880
Why are you like this?

639
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,520
The older you get,
the more you behave this way.

640
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,520
You won't have to put up with me soon.

641
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,920
Why?

642
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,440
Are you saying I will die soon?

643
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,360
Auntie, someone like you
will live for a hundred years.

644
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,440
You're still so strong.

645
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,160
Can you turn around?

646
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,400
Give me a twirl.

647
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,480
Look at you.
You still have that figure at your age.

648
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,280
Hold on.

649
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,720
What did you mean then?

650
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,200
Are you going to move out?

651
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,320
Well, I might get married.
I won't stay single like you.

652
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,520
Gosh, you?

653
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,320
Who would want you for a wife?

654
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,320
Why not? Am I not pretty?

655
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,720
You are, but with that mouth of yours,
no one will want you.

656
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,480
Also,

657
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,600
you're not from a prestigious family.

658
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,200
Decent and rich men won't see you.

659
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,520
Where would you go?
Just stay with me here.

660
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,920
Let's grow old together.

661
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,360
Listen, men don't only consider
a woman's beauty,

662
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,120
they also consider if a woman

663
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,520
comes from a prestigious family
and has a great fortune.

664
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,600
And this kind of thinking

665
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,040
doesn't only exist today.

666
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,240
They also thought this way in the past.

667
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:51,360
It is what we call suitability.

668
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,600
Remember this.

669
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,600
Rich men won't take poor women
as their wives.

670
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,800
I didn't miss her or anything.
Why did I dream of her?

671
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:26,120
She is another one of those people

672
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,200
who thinks rich men
won't marry a poor woman.

673
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,440
Gosh, why is it such a big deal?

674
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,360
My goodness!

675
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,040
Eung, why are you sitting there
so quietly?

676
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,640
You were sleeping.
Who do you expect me to talk to?

677
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,920
So you talk back to me now, do you?

678
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,520
What time is it now?

679
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,880
Tell Perm I need him
to paddle a boat for me.

680
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,400
Where are you going, miss?

681
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,560
I'm going to see Auntie Karaked.

682
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,360
I don't want to walk past
Gui's residence as I might see Klin.

683
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,920
I'm sick of her.

684
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,240
You stay here to prepare the food.
I will come back to eat it.

685
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,880
Yes, miss.

686
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,720
All right.

687
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,560
We have arrived, miss.

688
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,960
Should we go back, Perm?

689
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,040
Sure, miss.

690
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,760
Hold on, Perm. Should we stay?

691
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,240
Sure, miss.

692
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,640
You can go slowly, Perm.

693
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,320
Just drift.

694
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,200
Sure, miss.

695
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,960
What should I do?

696
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,040
-My goodness!
-What?

697
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,760
Let's go back, Perm.

698
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,080
Yes, miss.

699
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,720
Perm.

700
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,880
Yes, my lord.

701
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,320
If you go an inch further,

702
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,280
you are in big trouble.

703
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,160
-I thought I'd see Klin--
-I thought you'd have--

704
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,320
What did you say?

705
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,640
You thought you'd see Klin here?

706
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,240
Yes.

707
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,400
Did you really say that

708
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,920
or am I hearing things?

709
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,280
No.

710
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,560
So why did you think
you would see Klin here?

711
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,920
What?

712
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,600
Well, she has been coming here often.

713
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,560
She has been coming here often.
Why does she do that?

714
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,240
Well, she comes to deliver you goods.

715
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,200
The goods from Gui's orchard.

716
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,360
What?

717
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,600
That's true.

718
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,760
So did you come here to see her?

719
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:42,000
No, I came here to see you.
It has nothing to do with her.

720
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,680
This has nothing to do with her at all.

721
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,280
But you were the one who brought her up.

722
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,000
Let's just forget it.

723
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,760
I can't just click my fingers

724
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,440
and instantly forget things like you.

725
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,800
Is there no one here?

726
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,880
What about Keaw and Prang?

727
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,680
No.

728
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,960
You can say anything you want.

729
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,520
Baron.

730
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,880
I…

731
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,960
I want to go…

732
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,120
-to--
-Where do you want to go?

733
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,520
I can take you anywhere.

734
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:39,880
Do you mean it?

735
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,440
Yes.

736
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,320
Where do you want to go?

737
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,680
I want to go to Phitsanulok.

738
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,040
What?

739
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,920
Phitsanulok?

740
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,160
Why do you want to go there?

741
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,080
To get the Krishna Kali Manuscript.

742
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,800
Why do you want it?

743
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,480
-I want to try touching it.
-Why do you want to touch it?

744
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,000
He's asking so many questions.

745
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,880
I want to go home.

746
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,280
Don't you want to stay here anymore?

747
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,760
Is that why you want to go home?

748
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,160
I don't want to stay here.

749
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,280
Why?

750
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,840
I miss my home.

751
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,520
Do you miss your home or a person?

752
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,040
Well, many people.

753
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,560
Hey, hold on. You can't go yet.

754
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,280
You haven't told me if you'll take me.

755
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,680
Can we go? You haven't answered me.

756
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,440
If you want to go so much,
then I'll take you.

757
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,000
Don't worry.

758
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,840
Before long,

759
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,960
you will get to see the person
you're longing for.

760
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,320
I hope you don't go back on your word.

761
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,080
Don't.

762
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,800
Go back on my word?

763
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,520
That's right.

764
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:40,440
I say what I think and I do what I say.

765
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,880
If I say I will take you, then I will.

766
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,000
If I say I want to court someone,
then I mean it.

767
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:50,080
If I say I love that person,
then I mean it.

768
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,360
If I say…

769
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,760
I believe you now.

770
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,720
Do you still want to go to Song Kwae?

771
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,520
Not anymore.

772
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,320
I mean it too.

773
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,560
At the moment,

774
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,720
there is no one here.

775
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,040
They have all gone out.

776
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,320
I am working here alone.

777
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,600
It's lonely.

778
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,120
I'll stay with you.

779
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,520
Prik!

780
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,960
Prik!

781
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,120
My goodness!

782
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,520
What?

783
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,640
Why are you prostrating
yourself in front of me?

784
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,640
Goodness, this hurts.

785
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,560
You're too old to be doing this.

786
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,480
Well, I'm still younger than you,
old lady.

787
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,400
You bitch. That's disrespectful.

788
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,520
Any royal reports for me?

789
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,880
That is disrespectful.

790
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:29,960
Leave me alone.

791
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,560
This is my business, not yours.
Don't be so nosey.

792
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,480
I'm scared I'll end up paying for it.

793
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,560
-Right, girls?
-Yes.

794
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,760
I'm also scared.

795
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,120
I heard it's far-reaching.

796
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,720
But it might not get me as I can run fast.

797
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:47,520
But it will surely get Salee
as she is as slow as a snail.

798
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,920
-Boong!
-Oh, dear.

799
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,280
What?

800
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,880
Salee, you bitch.

801
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,480
Boong, what did you want to tell me?

802
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,440
-Miss Pudtarn is upstairs with Lord Rid.
-Okay.

803
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:13,960
-Alone.
-Okay.

804
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,360
-No one is with them.
-What?

805
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,640
When did she arrive?

806
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,280
Gosh, this bitch.

807
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,280
I had better go.

808
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,600
Where is she going?

809
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,680
Shall I read it to you?

810
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,680
Hey.

811
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,720
Gosh.

812
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,760
What about this?

813
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,680
My gosh.

814
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,600
Well? Do you like it?

815
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,080
Yes, I like it very much.

816
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,560
I love it.

817
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,240
Can I try them out?

818
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,640
Why do you think

819
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,120
I brought you here?

820
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,160
I get it now.

821
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,800
You brought me to work out.

822
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,000
You're the kindest.

823
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,440
Why are you looking at me?

824
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,120
This is the first time…

825
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,600
I have seen you laugh wholeheartedly…

826
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,840
like this.

827
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,360
We should do this more often then,

828
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,400
Khun Pi.

829
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,960
Hey,

830
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,000
I'm not going to fall or anything.

831
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,960
It's just my style, you know?

832
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,680
This is easy.

833
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,440
Hey.

834
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,840
You think I can't lift this?

835
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,520
Gosh.

836
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,000
-This is too much.
-Can you lift it?

837
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,800
This is heavy.

838
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:40,920
Come here.

839
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,800
You lose.

840
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,280
Goodness.

841
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,600
Someone is here.

842
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,680
Perm.

843
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,280
Miss Klin, are you here to deliver goods?

844
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,440
Yes.

845
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,520
What are you doing here?

846
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,800
I came with Miss Pudtarn.

847
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:53,120
Perm, are you devoting yourself
to her now?

848
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,680
Madam Gui assigned me to her, miss.

849
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,040
You are on Pudtarn's side now.

850
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,200
Take the goods to the kitchen.

851
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,760
Thank you.

852
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,399
Are you that tired?

853
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,760
Of course, it has been…

854
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:48,880
Almost two hours, I guess.

855
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:54,520
I will get going. I'm hungry.

856
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:59,240
Eat here. My parents and sisters
will be back soon. We can eat together.

857
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:02,880
What about Lady Champa?

858
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,160
She has gone to the temple
and won't return today.

859
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,080
She's spending a night there.

860
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,200
I think I should go.
Eung is waiting to eat with me.

861
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:17,359
Ask Perm to fetch her here
so she can eat with us.

862
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:19,840
That's too much.

863
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,120
Let's do it another day.

864
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,880
I want it to be today.

865
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,479
Baron.

866
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,400
You might forgive her.

867
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,960
Do you really believe
this black magic nonsense?

868
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,160
I am going to Phitsanulok,
so all this nonsense can end.

869
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,600
Would you like to learn boxing?

870
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,040
I prefer to visit the temple.

871
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,320
Why would you visit the temple?
You should learn to box.

872
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,520
In case you become king one day.

873
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:44,600
I would be grateful if the king
could bestow a wife upon him.

874
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,360
The title of lady must be mine.

875
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,080
Pudtarn may be his wife
who belongs in the kitchen.

876
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,520
You were predestined to come here?

877
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,680
If I must leave,
it's because I am predestined to.

878
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,480
A royal proclamation has been issued

879
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,280
for me to marry Praejeen.

880
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,320
