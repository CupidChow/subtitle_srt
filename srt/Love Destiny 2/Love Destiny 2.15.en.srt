1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,200
This sword style I'm teaching you
is a single sword fighting style.

2
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,920
Everyone practices this style.

3
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,320
What?

4
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,680
What's wrong?

5
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,440
Why don't you use it?

6
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,880
Imagine using coconut husk.

7
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,040
I have a headache just thinking about it.

8
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,200
I have made a usable one.

9
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,240
At your age, you should get married.

10
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,080
When selecting a spouse,
he must be of a similar status to you.

11
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,120
Do not get ideas above your station.

12
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,840
Why is it that when it comes
to Miss Pudtarn,

13
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,240
you always become
so aggrieved and vengeful?

14
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,480
I don't understand either

15
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,640
why I hate her so much.

16
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,280
On the day of the Chong Prieng Ceremony,
why don't you attend with these two?

17
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,240
-Please come, Pudtarn.
-Please come, Pudtarn.

18
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,920
Let's float a krathong

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,280
After floating your krathong, I--

20
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,920
There is no krathong floating.

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,680
His Majesty has arrived.

22
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you for coming.

23
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,040
Thank you.

24
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,440
Marquess Phrakhlang.

25
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

26
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,160
I shall wait to witness what you told me.

27
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,360
Crown Prince,

29
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,960
I am glad that you have come.

30
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,200
Narenthon,

31
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,840
talk with me for a moment.

32
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,480
If one day you finish your lessons early,

33
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,360
come and visit me.

34
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,279
I have a lot to discuss with you.

35
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,399
Certainly, Uncle.
I have questions for you as well.

36
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,640
About what, Narenthon?

37
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,440
I wish to be ordained.

38
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,360
Is that true, Narenthon?

39
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,320
I am very pleased.

40
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,960
May I rejoice with you,

41
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,840
Narenthon, my beloved nephew.

42
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,680
Tarn, when will you be old enough

43
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,520
to go to the temple yourself?

44
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,480
Don't you want to go?

45
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,320
That's right. I don't want to go.

46
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,320
It is your parents who died,

47
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,600
so you must make merit for them yourself.

48
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm not going.

49
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,720
But you must.

50
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Anything to do with your parents,

51
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,920
you must do it yourself
because you're their child.

52
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,720
-No.
-Hey.

53
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,840
You're being stubborn.
Do you want a smack?

54
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,960
What kind of child are you?
You grow more defiant every day.

55
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,680
Stop.

56
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,120
Don't look at me like that.

57
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,360
Listen.

58
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,480
When you're older,

59
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,360
you'll have to go and make merit
for them yourself.

60
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,160
I will not do it for you.

61
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,760
You are unusual.

62
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,680
You're only supposed to make merit
for them once a year at the temple.

63
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,640
But you always act
like I'm sending you to your death.

64
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,000
It's the same every year.

65
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,520
Wait, let me ask you something.

66
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,840
Don't you miss your parents?

67
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,200
I don't.

68
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,600
-Why not?
-They're dead.

69
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,040
It's because they're dead
that you must make merit for them.

70
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,360
Show some respect when you talk to me.

71
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,160
You're becoming even ruder
as you grow older.

72
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,600
Why make merit for my dead parents,

73
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,200
ma'am?

74
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,200
I barely even remember
what they looked like.

75
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,320
Even as a child,

76
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,040
you were difficult to like.

77
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,080
But since the car accident,
you've been behaving even more strangely.

78
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,640
You're behaving like you don't know them,

79
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,160
like they're strangers.

80
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,040
Like you're not upset that they died.

81
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,920
You're behaving like

82
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,440
you're someone else's child, not theirs.

83
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,960
Can I go now, ma'am?

84
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,600
You can go.

85
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,360
Don't forget to buy the flowers,
incense, and candles as I told you.

86
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,960
Hey, what's with that fed up look?

87
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,480
Are you not going to buy them?

88
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,040
Look, Tarn.

89
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,160
Are you even a Buddhist?

90
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,040
What's Buddha's main teaching?

91
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,880
It's about having
a peaceful mind and body.

92
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,000
When your mind and body find peace,

93
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,720
you will be calm, not all worked up.

94
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,240
For that reason,
when it comes to practices

95
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,840
passed down as traditions in Buddhism,

96
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,679
don't act like you're repulsed by them.

97
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,679
You must follow them.

98
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,000
Why don't you go yourself?

99
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,799
You should go, so you can find peace.

100
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,360
Why? How am I not at peace?

101
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,800
Listen to yourself.

102
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,680
You're criticizing me

103
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,960
and I don't even know
what I've done wrong.

104
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,960
Do you still not realize
what you've done wrong?

105
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,080
Right, what did I do wrong?

106
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,720
It's just fireworks.

107
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,400
The Chinese merchants

108
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,760
brought them all the way from China.

109
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,400
They keep some of them until the end.

110
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,640
Why?

111
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,360
Why aren't you saying anything?

112
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,520
Why save them for last?

113
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,000
Because

114
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,640
they were a gift
from the emperor of China,

115
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,920
the Kangxi Emperor.

116
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,040
The best are saved for last.

117
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
Prang.

118
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,800
Yes?

119
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,200
Prang,

120
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,120
I fear insects might fly into your mouth.

121
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,480
Good. I shall eat them then.

122
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,480
Prang.

123
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,040
Prang.

124
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,360
It's so pretty.

125
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,960
Indeed.

126
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Most beautiful.

127
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,720
Why are you not watching the fireworks?

128
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,920
There is something
more beautiful to observe.

129
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Marquess Phrakhlang.

130
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

131
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,000
These fireworks, you told me that…

132
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

133
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,200
The Kangxi Emperor of China

134
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,120
sent them as a gift for you.

135
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
They are magnificent.

136
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,920
Aren't they beautiful, Bhorn?

137
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,040
Very beautiful, Phet.

138
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,160
The attendants have lit the lantern.

139
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,360
May you float your lantern, Your Majesty.

140
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,480
The king floated his lantern.

141
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,560
We will light and float our lanterns soon.

142
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,720
Where is your lantern?

143
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,640
Eung.

144
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,120
Do you know what kind of flower this is?

145
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,520
Is it…

146
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,440
a Pudtarn flower?

147
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,440
Or is it a rose?

148
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,960
If you think it's a rose,
then let's not float it together.

149
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,400
Go your own way.

150
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,960
Wherever I go,

151
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,800
I will always end up here.

152
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,000
We shall float a lantern together, Prang.

153
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,960
Yes, my lord.

154
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,120
Kheow, do you have a lantern?

155
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,640
I do not.

156
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,640
Do you not?

157
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,280
What will you float then?

158
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,080
A servant has no need for one.

159
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,560
I shall not be floating one.

160
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,480
No, you must.

161
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,080
This way, you may float away
all your misfortunes and suffering.

162
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,040
It is fine.

163
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,640
My family brought several lanterns.

164
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,760
Yes, my lord.

165
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,200
Bring me a lantern.

166
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,120
Yes, my lord.

167
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,320
When the king leaves,

168
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,800
they will present the grand shadow play.

169
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,760
Have you ever seen one?

170
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,800
What a wide grin she has.

171
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,200
Of whom are you speaking, miss?

172
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,800
I am not speaking of you.

173
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,280
It is not about you.

174
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,240
I see.

175
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,160
Will you float your lantern, miss?

176
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,160
No.

177
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,040
I do not want to.

178
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,840
Goodness, miss.
What might happen if you do this?

179
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,920
Im, do not pity me.

180
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,680
Wait and see the other person.

181
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,120
Floating a lantern will not save them.

182
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,080
The other person?
Of whom are you speaking?

183
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
Help! Somebody help me!

184
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,560
Help!

185
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,360
Somebody help me!

186
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,480
Help!

187
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
Who was it?

188
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,240
Where is Klin off to again?

189
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,280
-Miss.
-Im!

190
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,320
Where are you going?

191
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,320
I am coming with you, miss.

192
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,280
No. Go back.

193
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,200
I cannot. Madam told me to--

194
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,840
If you follow me,
get ready to endure some pain.

195
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,560
I shall not kill you.

196
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,840
I shall just make sure you cannot eat
or sleep for four lifetimes.

197
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,200
Darn it!

198
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,680
Rid.

199
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,720
Where are you off to dressed like that?

200
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Do you not have an audience
with the king today?

201
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,120
I am heading to Pudtarn's house.

202
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,720
Karaked,

203
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,960
would you come here for a moment?

204
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,760
Rid, do not leave yet. Come and sit here.

205
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,160
But I am in a hurry.

206
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,800
Do as I say. Would you disobey me, Rid?

207
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,520
Come.

208
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,280
I utterly despise that wretched Pudtarn.
She is always clinging to Baron Maharit.

209
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,720
It is truly nauseating. So shameless.

210
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,760
Just you wait.
I shall wash away your shame.

211
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,760
I shall make you choke on blood.
Just watch me.

212
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,000
Karaked,

213
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,000
you have completely ignored

214
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,480
my instructions to you.

215
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,960
I do not remember.

216
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,640
What were your instructions?

217
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,160
I see. It seems my words
hold no significance.

218
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,000
Perhaps it is best if I speak no more.

219
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,240
It would not be the best, my lady.

220
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,520
If you choose not to act,

221
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,160
things may go awry.

222
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,120
If that happens,

223
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,840
it might be too late to fix it.

224
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,960
How would things turn out then?

225
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,400
Prik,

226
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,480
why don't you let Lady Champa
decide for herself?

227
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,760
Forgive me, my lady.

228
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,600
Do not get flustered, my lady.

229
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,720
-Who says I am flustered?
-Oh dear.

230
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,720
You have all the answers, do you not?

231
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,560
Why would I be flustered?

232
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,040
After all, I am just her mother-in-law,
not her mother.

233
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,440
It is normal that my instructions
are not taken seriously.

234
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,720
Goodness, Lady Champa,
it is not like that.

235
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,440
I simply forgot.
What were your instructions?

236
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,440
Prik.

237
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,040
What is it, Chuang?

238
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,520
I wonder why Lady Karaked is smiling.

239
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,800
Lady Karaked, what do you find amusing?

240
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,760
What? I am not laughing.

241
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,600
You were smiling.

242
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,520
As were Pin and Yaem.

243
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,400
I was not.

244
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,440
I was not either.

245
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,720
But I saw it.

246
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,640
I did as well.

247
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,200
Please excuse me.

248
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,680
Wait, Rid.

249
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Sit down.

250
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,840
But…

251
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,680
You have not spoken.

252
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,640
Everyone else was talking back and forth.

253
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
Karaked,

254
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,600
I instructed you to look
for a potential suitable match for Pudtarn

255
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,160
and arrange their introduction.

256
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,840
She is of an age to be married,
this relative of yours.

257
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,320
She is a commoner.

258
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,880
It might be best to find her a commoner.

259
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,360
They shall be a suitable match.

260
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,000
There is no need to look elsewhere.

261
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,480
I am fond of Pudtarn.

262
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,160
Goodness.

263
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,880
Is that true, Rid?

264
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,080
Yes.

265
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,760
Would it be wise?

266
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,720
She is of low birth.

267
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,120
She is not a suitable match for you.

268
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,040
Sooner or later,

269
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,760
the king shall bestow a wife upon you,

270
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,680
for you are one
of his trusted royal pages.

271
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,400
By then, Pudtarn

272
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,600
shall become your secondary wife.

273
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,640
I intend to have her as my only wife,

274
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,400
just as Father

275
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,120
has only Mother.

276
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,600
You speak nonsense.

277
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,560
Your mother is the daughter of a marquess.

278
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,000
She is a fitting match
for your father in every way,

279
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,760
without any doubt.

280
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,600
You have a bright and promising future
ahead of you.

281
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,520
If you do not secure a suitable match,

282
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,440
would it not be considered a flaw?

283
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,560
Think carefully, Rid.

284
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,480
I cannot agree with you on this matter.

285
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:05,200
Only once you and Praejeen are married
will I accept it.

286
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,720
As for Pudtarn, even as a secondary wife,

287
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,600
I would still not approve.

288
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,680
If I am unable to prevent it, I will not.
But I still would not approve.

289
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,640
Lady Champa,

290
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,560
"One builds a house to suit the dweller,

291
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,800
one ties a cradle to suit the sleeper."

292
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
It is my belief

293
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,040
that we shall let Rid decide for himself.

294
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,440
What?

295
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,480
Do you favor your relative

296
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,600
to the point of disregarding
your own son's prospects

297
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,160
and going against my wishes?

298
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,920
Indulging your children excessively

299
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,640
could ruin our family's good name.

300
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,720
On this matter,
we cannot just ask Rid alone.

301
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:58,080
We need to ask Pudtarn first
if she wishes to join our family.

302
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,920
Is that right, Rid?

303
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,680
She does not dislike me.

304
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
Be quiet!

305
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,600
I won't have it.

306
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,400
Listen.

307
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,400
Please consider this carefully,
my dear Rid.

308
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
Yes, Grandmother.

309
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,320
Would you look at that?

310
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,840
He simply smiled and left.

311
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,280
What I said had no effect.

312
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,960
Pudtarn, what happened?

313
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,360
Eung.

314
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,880
Come and see this, Eung.

315
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,360
Who left this?

316
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,400
It's beautiful.

317
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,920
Is it beautiful?

318
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,960
Yes, miss.

319
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,800
This belongs to Miss Klin. Give it to me.

320
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,720
Hey.

321
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,000
She might kill her, Eung.

322
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,400
Give it to me.

323
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,080
Don't tell her.

324
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,400
It could cause big trouble.

325
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,400
Perm, why are you protecting a bad person?

326
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,040
-Give it to me.
-No, Eung.

327
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,600
Perm, give it to me!

328
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,520
That hurts!

329
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,800
Hey.

330
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,880
Hey, Eung!

331
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,000
This belongs to Miss Klin.
It was in the vegetable plot.

332
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,720
Klin, you bitch.

333
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,320
You're dead!

334
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,280
Pudtarn!

335
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,600
Pudtarn.

336
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,320
Hey, stop. Where are you going?

337
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,800
I'm going to yell at Klin
until she forgets her house number.

338
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,080
Wait.

339
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,680
What do you mean by "house number"?

340
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,120
Gosh, do you have to know everything?
Can't you see I'm furious?

341
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,240
Yes, I see that.

342
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,040
But what will you gain
from yelling at Klin?

343
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,680
Why can't I yell at her?

344
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,200
She destroyed my things,
so I'll yell at her. It's a win-win.

345
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,480
-Come here.
-Gosh.

346
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,880
-Come here.
-Let go of me!

347
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,520
Hey, let go!

348
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,000
Stop, don't.

349
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,600
What?

350
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,040
What, Baron?

351
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,440
Wait.

352
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,840
Can you not see that I am tired?

353
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
Gosh!

354
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,440
Listen to me, Pudtarn.

355
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,480
What will you gain by yelling at her?

356
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,840
Either way, you must live here,
as you have nowhere else to go.

357
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,400
You would not agree to live at my home.

358
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,280
This land is rented by Gui.
She has rights over it.

359
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,720
Klin is Gui's granddaughter.

360
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,920
And who are you? You are just a lodger.

361
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,440
Consider yourself fortunate
that her grandmother is kind to you.

362
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,360
My father taught me to weigh up
the pros and cons of a situation.

363
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,360
Once you've done that,
you will know what's best.

364
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,960
And once you know,
you can decide whether to take action.

365
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,080
The only thing you will gain
by yelling at her is an epic thrill.

366
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,600
What did you say?

367
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,880
An epic thrill.

368
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,920
An epic thrill?

369
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,159
Yes, an epic thrill.

370
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,560
You only get momentary satisfaction.

371
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,440
But do you know
there will be many consequences?

372
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,440
Even if you do not ask,
I shall tell you nonetheless.

373
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,159
First,

374
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,400
it would cloud your mind.

375
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,520
You would likely make mistakes
no matter what you do.

376
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,320
That's it?

377
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,880
Second, when you yell at someone,

378
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,440
you make that person angry and resentful.

379
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,560
They are likely to…

380
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,560
Seek revenge.

381
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,840
So you understand.

382
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,080
I do.

383
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,520
I've been over it since "an epic thrill."

384
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,520
Why did you allow me
to ramble on for so long?

385
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,040
Would you rather I put up with it
and let Klin keep harassing me?

386
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,040
You could just avoid her.

387
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,520
For Gui's sake.

388
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
Hey.

389
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,960
You're holding me again!
Aren't you good at this?

390
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,840
Are you a police officer?

391
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,040
-Let go.
-No.

392
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,840
Let go.

393
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,000
Where are you trying to run off to?

394
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,480
Did you not understand?
I am exhausted trying to talk to you.

395
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,560
I'm not running anywhere.
I'm going to get the baskets.

396
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,920
Get the baskets?

397
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,640
Why would you do that?

398
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,440
Follow me if you want to know.

399
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,880
Eung and Perm.

400
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,560
What happened?

401
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,320
What?

402
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,920
Who did that?

403
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,760
I fear it was Miss Klin.

404
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,560
There is no doubt.

405
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,320
It was her.

406
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,040
-Eung.
-Yes, miss.

407
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,600
-Collect the vegetables.
-Yes, miss.

408
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,280
Eung.

409
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,960
Here.

410
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,440
Eung truly sees a bird as a stick
and a stick as a bird.

411
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,520
It means she does what she is told.

412
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,480
That is what Choi meant.

413
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,440
Collect all the vegetables up, Perm.

414
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,360
Once you're done, please wash them.

415
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,680
Will you eat them, miss?

416
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,560
No, I will use them to make
mixed vegetable stew to sell.

417
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,200
Perm, go to Gui's house later

418
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,760
and borrow a large pot.

419
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,160
-Choi.
-Yes, miss.

420
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,960
Could you take me to buy pork belly?

421
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,160
I will buy more vegetables too.

422
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,200
Of course.

423
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,320
I shall take you myself.

424
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,360
I would prefer Choi.

425
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,920
That way, I can yell at Klin
without anyone stopping me.

426
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,240
I shall keep my mouth closed
and not say a single word.

427
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,520
Are you certain?

428
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,280
Yes. For sure.

429
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,400
You two, what are you thinking?
You have strange looks on your faces.

430
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,000
Well…

431
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,560
We think

432
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,960
the same…

433
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
The same…

434
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,240
-Gosh!
-Just say it!

435
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,400
Eung.

436
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,880
The same as you do.

437
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,160
Yes?

438
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,560
Goodness, Eung.

439
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,360
Gosh, I am worried.

440
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,160
My goodness.

441
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,360
I thought you were preparing for battle.

442
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,360
What?

443
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,920
You looked like
you were performing a war dance.

444
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,080
What? A war dance?
Who would I fight a war with?

445
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,600
-Lady Champa.
-Lady Champa.

446
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,080
Can I handle this?

447
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,360
Of course, my lady.

448
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:27,120
Is there anything
you haven't been able to handle?

449
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,240
Yes, I can handle this.

450
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,920
I can do it for Rid.

451
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,560
You can.

452
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,560
You can.

453
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,520
-You can.
-You can.

454
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,800
Mother would not force Rid, Karaked.

455
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,400
Please do not worry.

456
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,320
That's easy to say.
You do not know anything, so do not speak.

457
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,160
What? You asked me, did you not?

458
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,360
I did. I just didn't expect
that answer from you.

459
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,600
What would you prefer to hear from me?

460
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,560
That…

461
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,240
I am so afraid

462
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,280
that our son will be hurt
if his heart does not get what it desires.

463
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,720
I do not understand what you are saying.

464
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,640
Could you raise your head
and speak more clearly?

465
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,520
Khun Pi,

466
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,560
can you promise me
you will stand up to your mother?

467
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,040
What did you say?

468
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,440
Did I hear it wrong?

469
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,880
Stand up to…

470
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,240
my mother?

471
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,720
That's right, you did not hear it wrong.

472
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,920
Rid has the right
to choose his own partner.

473
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,640
He's the one who will enter the marriage,
not your mother.

474
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,560
And Rid is an adult.
He can think for himself.

475
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,200
Think about it.

476
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,440
If your mother had not approved
of you wanting to marry me,

477
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,640
would you have listened to her
and not married me?

478
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,520
Karaked,

479
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,000
even though I tried to pay attention
to every word you said,

480
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,520
I still could not grasp everything.

481
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,880
What I heard clearly
was only the last thing you said.

482
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,520
And I shall answer you that

483
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,000
I…

484
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,040
definitely would not have listened.

485
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,520
Khun Pi, you must help Rid.

486
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,440
If Lady Champa prevents
Rid and Pudtarn from being together,

487
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,960
what is Rid to do?

488
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,920
Let our son be his own person.

489
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,000
Let our son be his own person?

490
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,120
That's right.

491
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,880
Rid has the right
to choose who he marries.

492
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,200
It's no one else's business.

493
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,120
Pudtarn is to become his wife,
not anyone else's.

494
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,760
Why do you say that?

495
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,600
What do you mean by "not anyone else's"?

496
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,880
She is not to be anyone else's wife,
she is to be Rid's wife.

497
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,920
We must let Rid choose a partner.
It is not your mother's concern.

498
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,720
Mother did not disapprove of you
because you are a marquess's daughter.

499
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,960
As for…

500
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,720
As for Pudtarn,

501
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,440
she is a commoner.

502
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,720
Are commoners not people?

503
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,400
Why do you ask in such a manner?

504
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,960
Do you not see commoners as people?

505
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,280
I do.

506
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,960
You do?

507
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,760
Then what do you expect me to say?

508
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,760
We end up not making sense to each other.

509
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,640
I am trying to understand you.

510
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,600
But I continue to be confused.

511
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,080
I apologize.

512
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,840
Forget what I said.

513
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,360
I shall think of something else.

514
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,400
You shall think of something else?

515
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,520
Do you mean
you shall speak to me once more?

516
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,760
That's right.

517
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,200
Should you speak of the same matter,

518
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,680
I would still not understand you.

519
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,160
What? Why?

520
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,360
Because you told me to forget.

521
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,480
But I have not forgotten.

522
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,640
For example,

523
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,800
should you ask me again

524
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,480
if commoners are not people,

525
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,960
I would still be confused

526
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,720
and unable to answer you.

527
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,200
I would…

528
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,920
Keep your mouth shut.

529
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,040
Perm, if you cut it up too small,
it gets stuck in your teeth.

530
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,680
Eung, is it done?

531
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,280
Don't crush it too fine.

532
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,640
It is ready.

533
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,800
Big pieces like that
are just right for chewing.

534
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,400
Choi!

535
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,240
Gosh.

536
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,240
Perm,

537
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,000
light the fire.

538
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,200
Start by stir-frying
the fatty bits of pork.

539
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,440
Cook it until the oil is released.

540
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,720
Then remove it
and set it aside for the moment.

541
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,600
Eung, give me the coriander root
and garlic.

542
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,680
-Choi.
-Yes, miss.

543
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,760
The vegetables too.

544
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,080
Does it smell good?

545
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,760
Eung, go sell it at the market.

546
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,720
Are you afraid of Kam if you go alone?

547
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,160
I am.

548
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,920
Perm, go and keep an eye on Eung.

549
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,640
When you're selling it,
let them taste it to know how good it is.

550
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,560
Do you understand?

551
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,120
-Yes, miss.
-Yes, miss.

552
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,240
Just make sure to leave a bowl for me.

553
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,160
Yes, miss.

554
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,120
Baron, I will go to Gui's house.
You wait here.

555
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,000
I shall come with you.

556
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,240
You cannot.

557
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,880
Why not?

558
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,000
Because I don't want you to know
what I'm planning to do there.

559
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,560
And what are you planning to do?

560
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,120
What? I just told you
I don't want you to know.

561
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,080
But I want to know.

562
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,800
Do you really want to know?

563
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,200
Yes.

564
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,200
I'll tell you.

565
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,640
I'm going to return the bracelet to Klin.

566
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,840
Oh my.

567
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,640
This bracelet looks most familiar.

568
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,480
How did you come by it, Pudtarn?

569
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,720
I…

570
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,920
found it.

571
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,040
You found it?

572
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,880
Where did you find it?

573
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,520
Why do you ask?

574
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,080
So I can go and find one.

575
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,440
I would like one myself.

576
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,880
A gift from the angels.

577
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,120
There are no more of them.

578
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,840
But maybe there's one…

579
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,280
around here.

580
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,520
No, there are none.
I would have come across them all by now.

581
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,600
Here.

582
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,600
Take it back.

583
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,160
I would like to sell it, Gui.

584
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,160
You want to sell it?

585
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,360
This is a gift from the angels.
You must keep it.

586
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,320
I'll sell it to you.

587
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,760
You're a good person
and I'm indebted to you.

588
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,680
I would prefer this bracelet
to be with a good person like you.

589
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,640
How are you not a good person?

590
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,800
I have many faults.

591
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,360
You could circle my flaws with a pen.

592
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,120
I'll give you a good price.

593
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,240
Only one tamlueng.

594
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,600
Goodness, that's too cheap.

595
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,240
Only one tamlueng?

596
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,720
I shall buy it for Klin.

597
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,240
Im,

598
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,200
bring me one tamlueng.

599
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,280
Yes, ma'am.

600
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,240
If you buy it for Klin,

601
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,280
I will sell it for two baht only.

602
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,640
Two baht?

603
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,640
Half a tamlueng.

604
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,360
Look, Klin.

605
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,560
What is it, Grandma?

606
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,440
Look at this bracelet. Do you like it?

607
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,240
Don't you like it?

608
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,000
I think it is pretty.

609
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,400
I shall buy it for you.

610
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,240
Im, bring me two baht.

611
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,320
Yes, ma'am.

612
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,200
I do not want it.

613
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,040
Do you not like it?

614
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,960
Why don't you just try it on?

615
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,160
No.

616
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,120
Just take it, Klin.
Gui would like to buy it for you.

617
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,360
I want to see you wear something pretty.
That's why I lowered the price.

618
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,120
This way, it's a good bang for your buck.

619
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,400
Buck? What is that?

620
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,480
I mean money. You can save your money.

621
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,480
In fact, I can give it to you for nothing.

622
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,880
I won't sell it.

623
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,000
Have it for free.

624
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,920
Klin, come and take it.

625
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,800
It is from the angels.

626
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,360
You got it for free.

627
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,360
Do you know the phrase "for free"?

628
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,600
Lady Karaked said that
it means you don't pay.

629
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,320
I will be off then, Gui.

630
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,480
May the angels be praised.

631
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,720
The angels are so generous.

632
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,120
Klin, come.

633
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,760
Come here.

634
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,440
Give me your wrist.

635
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,840
Goodness.

636
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,840
It fits perfectly.

637
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,560
How beautiful.

638
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,440
Please see Pudtarn out.

639
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,840
This is the last time.

640
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,880
What is this about? Let me go.

641
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,200
It's the last time, that's all I'll say.

642
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,560
Otherwise, you'll get hurt
and a doctor will be of no help.

643
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,280
I don't know what you're talking about.

644
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,200
Are you certain you don't understand?

645
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,400
Of course I am.

646
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,760
Swear to me.

647
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,600
Why would I swear?

648
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,600
You are not my mistress.
Why would I swear to you?

649
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,080
Then give it back!

650
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,280
Stop it!

651
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,960
It is mine now.

652
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,960
Was it right
that Gui should have to pay for it?

653
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,560
She did not pay for it.
You gave it to her for free.

654
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,480
That's because I don't want her money.

655
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,640
If it had been anyone else,
not only would they have sold it,

656
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,400
they'd have also taken you to the police.

657
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,760
Pudtarn, that would never happen.

658
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,160
How dare you threaten
to take me to the police?

659
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,920
You do not know any police officers.

660
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,720
They stay only within the palace grounds.

661
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,760
There are no police around
for you to hand me over to.

662
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,240
Besides, you are not an angel's child.

663
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,520
You are a distant relative
of Lady Karaked,

664
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,040
but she wants nothing to do with you.

665
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,040
Otherwise,

666
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,680
why would you be lodging at the house
in my grandmother's orchard?

667
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,920
Is that what you think?

668
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,760
The lady invited me,
but I chose not to go.

669
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,720
I do not believe you.

670
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,040
Would it not be better

671
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,240
to sleep on a timber floor
rather than a bamboo floor?

672
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,280
You don't know what dignity is
since you don't have any.

673
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,400
Who says so?

674
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,080
I hold both status and station.

675
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,040
Go away. Go now.

676
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,160
Go and cling to your dignity
in your shed. Go!

677
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,400
-Are you certain about this?
-Yes!

678
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,280
Hey!

679
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,440
Think about it.

680
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,600
Think carefully about it.

681
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,960
This bracelet really suits Klin, Gui.

682
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,920
Okay.

683
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,320
-Choi.
-Yes, my lord.

684
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,320
The sugar.

685
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,800
What are you doing?

686
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,920
Don't tell me you're cooking.

687
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,760
The baron had me bring dessert ingredients
to prepare for you, miss.

688
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,320
Dessert?

689
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,440
What dessert?

690
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,400
Is it good? I will not eat it if it isn't.

691
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,200
The dessert is done.

692
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,400
You may have a taste.

693
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,280
Wait.

694
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,280
Walk carefully.

695
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,240
Isn't this a bit much?

696
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,560
-Oh dear.
-Oh dear.

697
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,280
What?

698
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,760
Go on ahead.

699
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,040
I'm going to trip.

700
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,080
Do not look yet.

701
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,920
Sit.

702
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,920
Can I take it off now?

703
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,880
This dessert is called

704
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,760
khanom si thuai.

705
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,800
It includes

706
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,240
khai kob,

707
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,960
nok ploi,

708
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,720
nang loy,

709
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,680
and lastly,

710
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,600
ai tue.

711
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,160
What strange names.

712
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,640
Why are they called that?

713
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,080
Khai kob are basil seeds.

714
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,160
This signifies

715
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,880
having many children and grandchildren.

716
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,480
Nok ploi refers to rice flour
infused with pandan leaf juice

717
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,680
made into pieces and boiled.

718
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,640
It signifies love

719
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,400
that proceeds smoothly,

720
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,080
free from any obstacles.

721
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,880
And this is nang loy,
which is puffed rice.

722
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,400
It signifies

723
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,520
love steeped in beautiful tradition,

724
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,880
gracefully entering and exiting the door,

725
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,880
much like roasting rice securely covered,

726
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,640
ensuring none spills out,

727
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,000
never wandering astray.

728
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,720
And lastly,

729
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,520
ai tue is black sticky rice.

730
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,480
It is

731
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,280
a symbol of love

732
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,840
that is strong and unwavering.

733
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,120
Oh my.

734
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,920
It is all about love.

735
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,040
Indeed.

736
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,640
It is all about love.

737
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,520
I see.

738
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,200
I get it.

739
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,760
It seems that men in Ayutthaya
use desserts to express their love.

740
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,200
It is as you said.

741
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,680
And it seems that men in Ayutthaya

742
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,960
must be as good at making desserts
as they are at wooing women.

743
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,000
I see.

744
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,680
Do you mean me?

745
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,400
As for making desserts,
I have done it many times.

746
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,920
But as for women,

747
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,200
I have courted

748
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,720
only this one.

749
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,520
I'm afraid I might not be tasting it today

750
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,640
because someone's sweet talk
is sweeter than the dessert.

751
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,440
Here.

752
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,120
Coconut milk mixed
with coconut palm sugar and salt.

753
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,720
It represents

754
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,960
love that is sweet and rejuvenating.

755
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,480
Love

756
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,240
is infused into these four dessert dishes.

757
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,840
He's not done.

758
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,480
He's still not done.

759
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,040
In that case, when I'm free,

760
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:01,920
I will make a savory dish I'm good at

761
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,480
for you in return.

762
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,400
What is the name

763
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,400
of this savory dish?

764
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,640
Shrimp paste chili sauce

765
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,640
with shredded sour mango
and minced shrimp.

766
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,920
Does it have any special significance?

767
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,360
It does.

768
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,560
It means

769
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,120
spicy,

770
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,320
yummy,

771
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,080
and well-pounded.

772
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,520
You're stunned.

773
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,840
Yummy?

774
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,240
You don't understand, do you?

775
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,760
-It means--
-I know.

776
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,800
When my mother prepares som tam,

777
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,400
she always says

778
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,520
"yummy."

779
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,640
When you make som tam,
you start by pounding the seasonings.

780
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,800
My lady, does Baron Rid like som tam?

781
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,440
He likes it very much.

782
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,880
How does he like it?

783
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,760
I am about to tell you.

784
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,120
Yes, my lady.

785
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,800
What is added first?

786
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,320
Garlic and chili.

787
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,360
Let me.

788
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,520
I will show you.

789
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,400
Add the chili now.

790
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,320
Now pound it.

791
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,480
Just crush it a bit, not too finely.

792
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,560
When ready, add pip palm sugar.

793
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,960
-Puek palm sugar.
-Puek palm sugar.

794
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,360
In the future, they call it pip
due to the container.

795
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,760
-Puek.
-Puek.

796
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,960
Now, add puek palm sugar.
About a thumb-sized piece.

797
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,200
Next, add tamarind juice

798
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,920
and fish sauce.

799
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,680
Next, fermented fish sauce.

800
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,760
It smells unpleasant. Must we add it?

801
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,240
But Rid likes it.

802
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,000
That's enough.

803
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,160
Now pound and stir everything together.

804
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,440
Let me taste it for you.

805
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:06,240
I shall taste it myself,
so I know Rid's preference.

806
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,360
Does it taste right?

807
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,880
Yes, my lady.

808
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,280
Once the seasonings are done,
then add papaya.

809
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,640
Here.

810
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,000
Another handful.

811
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,040
Yes.

812
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:01,640
When you're making food, do not hold back.
Add as much as is needed.

813
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,720
As is needed…

814
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,680
That means everything.

815
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,400
Yes, my lady.

816
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,600
Now, you pound.

817
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,560
-Oh dear.
-Oh dear.

818
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,080
Pound gently.

819
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,240
Stop.

820
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:20,720
Pound gently.

821
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,720
Do not crush the papaya.

822
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,480
Yes, my lady.

823
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,880
Gently. That's enough.

824
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,080
Otherwise, it will
splatter everywhere. Good.

825
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,920
All right, that should be yummy enough.

826
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,440
When will Rid return home?

827
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,160
My lord.

828
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,520
Is something bothering you?

829
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,560
I tried to woo her, Choi.

830
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,680
Yes, my lord.

831
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,880
But she laughed.

832
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,920
Why did she find it amusing?

833
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,880
I truly would like to know.

834
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,320
She is easily amused.

835
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,680
Do not worry about it.

836
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,160
Has she accepted my courtship?

837
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,120
She has, my lord.

838
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,840
She is clever, but…

839
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,080
she just has not responded.

840
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,600
She won't turn me down, will she?

841
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,520
She…

842
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,800
Choi, will she not--

843
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,360
What is that sound, my lord?

844
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,040
Someone is crying.

845
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,520
Who?

846
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:18,200
Let us find out.

847
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:19,479
What?

848
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,720
My lord, no.

849
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:31,760
My lord.

850
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,279
It sounds haunted.

851
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,399
What do you mean?

852
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,720
Is it a person, my lord?

853
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:03,240
Oh dear.

854
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,279
It is not a person, my lord.

855
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,600
-I shall run away.
-Go away.

856
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,680
I am!

857
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,960
-Let go!
-Choi!

858
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,720
-Let go, my lord!
-Look closely.

859
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,000
Let go, my lord!

860
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,040
I shall whip you!

861
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:37,359
-Look.
-What?

862
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,800
Klin.

863
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:42,359
I am not a ghost or a monster.

864
01:09:42,439 --> 01:09:44,040
I'm a person crying.

865
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,720
How could you think I was a ghost?

866
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,560
Klin, what happened to you?

867
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,600
Why are you crying?

868
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,200
In case Rid raises his hand like this,

869
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,400
you will know what to do.

870
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,480
Do you know what an arranged marriage is?

871
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,240
I can't stand the notion.
I would never stand for it,

872
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,920
no matter what.

873
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,600
I truly do not know

874
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,200
why I dislike Pudtarn so.

875
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,360
Unless someone performed
black magic on me.

876
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,480
Miss Klin was acting shamelessly
with the baron.

877
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,480
I saw it.

878
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,440
Baron,

879
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,440
I want to go to Phitsanulok.

880
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,080
Why do you want to go there?

881
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,360
To get the Krishna Kali Manuscript.

882
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,560
