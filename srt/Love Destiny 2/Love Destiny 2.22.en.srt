1
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,800
Perhaps we have to wait
for another eclipse.

2
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,520
Eight months from now,
there shall be another eclipse.

3
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,920
In eight months,
I'm going to test our destiny.

4
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,800
I also have eight months

5
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,280
to make you
the one who dictates your life,

6
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,560
not destiny.

7
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,240
I hope that you can mend
these fragments of sins.

8
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,640
Atitaya, my child.

9
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,760
When we return,
I shall bring her into the palace.

10
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,160
This way, she can cook for me every day.

11
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,720
The king would like you to serve him.

12
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,280
Is he insane?

13
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,920
Did you expect me to just accept it?
Dream on.

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,280
I will go home.

15
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,000
Pudtarn.

16
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,160
Hey,

17
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,400
I have never seen you cry like this.

18
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,960
Please don't be sad.

19
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,760
We still have hope.

20
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,840
I'm not sad or depressed.

21
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,840
I'm angry. I'm furious.

22
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,360
I have never been in this situation.

23
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,320
Come on,

24
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,000
it's our tradition.

25
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,160
I don't agree with it at all.

26
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,000
Can you accept it?

27
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,760
I'm afraid I can't go against it.

28
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,880
What did you say? You can't go against it?

29
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,080
Does this mean you won't try to stop it?

30
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,760
If I can't go against it,
then why would I try?

31
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,640
Okay.

32
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,519
I understand.

33
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,399
I also sympathize with you.

34
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,720
Thank you very much.

35
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,480
We are different.

36
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,720
What do you mean by that?

37
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,600
I won't let anyone just force me
into marriage.

38
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,520
I will only become the wife
of the man I love.

39
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,920
I love you.

40
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,480
I will only be your wife.

41
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,440
If he tries to force me,
he will see what I am capable of.

42
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,520
Just wait and see.

43
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,400
No, I'm not going.

44
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,840
Come on, Tarn. Be a good girl.

45
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,720
Come on. Get up now.

46
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,600
Get dressed up
for my friend's birthday party.

47
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,520
I'm not going.

48
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,560
You must go. I'm telling you to go.

49
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,560
I'm not going.

50
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,560
No, you must go.

51
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,880
Go and get dressed now.

52
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,360
You have ten minutes.

53
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,240
I wouldn't go even if you gave me an hour.

54
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,200
Take this.

55
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,840
Tarn.

56
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,880
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hit you.

57
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,920
I love you.

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,760
I want you to come to the party with me,
so we can have fun, all right?

59
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,520
We won't stay for long.

60
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,040
Please come with me.

61
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,320
I'm not going.

62
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,640
Why won't you come with me?

63
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,280
Because

64
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,440
I don't love you.

65
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,040
You crazy girl.

66
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,200
Tarn.

67
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,400
A sponsor wants to send you to a contest.

68
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,120
-No.
-Let me tell you what it is

69
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,480
before you say no.

70
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,760
-No.
-I said, listen to me first.

71
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,440
A sponsor would like you to enter
a Nang Nopphamat beauty contest.

72
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,280
You wear a Sukhothai era dress.

73
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,600
The Nang Nopphamat beauty contest?

74
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,520
-I'm not going.
-Why not?

75
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,080
Nang Nopphamat didn't exist
in the Sukhothai era.

76
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,240
How can that be? People dress up
as her for Loy Krathong.

77
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,920
No, I have never heard of it.

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,120
How is that possible?

79
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,920
Everybody else has heard of her.

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,120
If she didn't exist,
why would people talk about her?

81
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,720
Well, they made it up.

82
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,880
Anyway, Tarn, please join it.

83
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,440
No.

84
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,800
Pudtarn.

85
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,520
I'm telling you to join it.

86
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,640
Do you have any idea what you could win?

87
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,960
I'm not joining it. I don't want to. No.

88
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,960
No!

89
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,320
What's wrong, miss?

90
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,760
It's nothing.

91
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,880
I'm totally fine.

92
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,360
Were you sleep-talking?

93
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,880
For god's sake, Eung! I said I'm fine!

94
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,760
I wasn't sleep talking!
What's with all the questions?

95
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,720
I'm sorry, miss.

96
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,680
I'm sorry.

97
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,440
It's fine.

98
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,600
I will tell you about it tomorrow.

99
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,520
The king wants to make me his wife.

100
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
This isn't right, is it?

101
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Miss, everything in Ayutthaya

102
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,320
and its tributary cities

103
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,280
belongs solely to him.

104
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,760
He can take anyone as his wife.

105
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,520
But even if he stood right here,

106
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,160
I would say to him,
"You can take anyone but me."

107
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,400
How are you going to resist him?

108
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,080
Actually, I don't have to do anything.

109
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,360
The baron loves me, so he will protect me.

110
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,000
Baron Rid serves him

111
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,760
as a royal page.

112
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,200
Do you think

113
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,480
he can do that?

114
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,320
What can I do?

115
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,520
So you will accept it
if I become his wife. Is that so?

116
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,680
A concubine.

117
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,240
That means wife.

118
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Will you accept it?

119
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,320
No one can go against him.

120
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,600
I will be the first person to do that.

121
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,240
Just wait and see.

122
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,720
What will you do, Pudtarn?

123
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,240
I still don't know what I will do.

124
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,520
This isn't easy, Pudtarn.

125
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,200
No one in this land

126
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,040
may defy the king's command.

127
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,280
I have told you this countless times.

128
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,160
Let's do this then.

129
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,920
I'm telling you this for the first time.

130
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,280
No rule in this world is set in stone.

131
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,200
There is always an exception.

132
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,080
There is none.

133
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,240
There is.

134
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,840
There is none.

135
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,960
I don't want to lose you.

136
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,240
I can't stand it.

137
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,880
Every problem has a solution.

138
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,240
Is that true, Pudtarn?

139
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,600
We must believe so.

140
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
There is none.

141
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,320
Believe me, Pudtarn.

142
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,920
There is no solution.

143
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,680
There is none.

144
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,040
No.

145
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,080
It's you who must believe me.

146
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,400
There is a solution.

147
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,240
I'm going to find it.

148
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,280
Miss,

149
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,760
the moon is waning.

150
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,000
It will go into a waxing phase soon.

151
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,040
Eung,

152
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,400
is there no way to change
what the king commands?

153
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,040
No.

154
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,640
It's okay.

155
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,840
I won't give in to him.

156
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,680
If I die, then I die.

157
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,760
You have promised Baron Rid
that you will fight.

158
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,920
That's right.

159
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,000
I promised him

160
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,120
even though I know that

161
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,640
I might not be able to do it.

162
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,320
Rid.

163
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,960
You should tell the king the truth

164
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,000
-that--
-You know I can't do that.

165
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,640
No one has done it before.

166
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Why don't you be the first to do so?

167
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,640
Talk to him man-to-man.

168
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,560
Mother.

169
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,280
If it wasn't

170
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,520
the king,

171
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,520
do you think I wouldn't do it?

172
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,240
Where there is love,

173
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,880
there is also sadness, son.

174
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,240
Klin,

175
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,240
don't you pity me at all?

176
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,000
Of course I do.

177
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,720
Do you?

178
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,280
Are you willing to be my wife now?

179
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,599
My dearest Klin.

180
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,240
Gosh, you make me nauseous.

181
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,079
-Let me get you a spittoon.
-Hey.

182
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,800
Song.

183
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,080
You're getting bolder now, are you?

184
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,920
Please be my wife, Klin.

185
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,960
You have been staying
at my house for days.

186
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,120
Everybody now thinks you are my wife.

187
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,960
No matter what,

188
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,040
your name will forever bear that stain.

189
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
Good grief! Klin.

190
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,320
I don't care about those people.

191
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,600
It's not true.

192
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,200
No one will take you as his wife,

193
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,480
as your husband is sitting right here.

194
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,800
I don't care.

195
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,400
You don't what?

196
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,880
Gosh. I don't care.

197
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,360
You don't care?

198
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,080
What does that mean?

199
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,960
I'm not concerned about it.

200
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,680
They can think whatever they want,

201
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,240
as I know I'm not your wife.

202
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,520
Why not?

203
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,120
Why can't I be your husband

204
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,520
when I love you so much?

205
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,800
You won't be able to find a man
who loves you as much as I do,

206
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,040
given how ill-mannered you are.

207
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,720
Even if you are beautiful.

208
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,440
You're a woman,
but you never carry yourself like one.

209
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,400
You're not sweet and gentle,

210
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,280
and your words are unpleasant to the ears.

211
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,000
Given that, who'd take you as their wife?

212
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
Are you talking about me?

213
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Of course.

214
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,880
Who else could it be?

215
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,760
Yes, you're right, Song.

216
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,680
I believe now that you truly love me.

217
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,040
Please be my wife, Klin.

218
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,560
Fine.

219
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,320
Do you mean it, Klin?

220
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,960
Yes.

221
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,800
I don't believe my ears.
One of them must have been damaged.

222
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,840
Did you mean it?

223
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,960
Do you not believe me?

224
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,480
Come with me.

225
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,480
I will show you that I mean it.

226
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,840
You're back.

227
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,200
I'm going to tell Madam Gui.

228
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,200
You're really back.

229
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,280
Madam Gui has been saddened.
I have been very worried about her.

230
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,320
Klin.

231
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,440
Grandma.

232
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,560
You're back, my dear.

233
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,800
I have something to tell you.

234
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,480
What is it?

235
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,240
Song.

236
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,080
Did you come with her?

237
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,280
Yes, Gui.

238
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,000
I came with Klin.

239
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,960
Thank you
for bringing my granddaughter back.

240
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,600
You can leave now.

241
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,600
Come on, Gui.

242
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,400
Do you intend
for her to remain single forever?

243
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,640
There's nothing wrong with that.

244
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,200
Do you not know
I possess a fortune so great

245
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,360
that my granddaughter doesn't need
a husband to live a good life?

246
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,600
But I would love to have one.

247
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,760
I want to know what is so good about it.

248
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,240
Klin, have you gone mad?

249
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,200
Has Song made you think this way?

250
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,760
Please don't blame me.

251
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,960
Klin has agreed to become my wife.

252
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,320
What?

253
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,880
The other day you said she wasn't.

254
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,840
She has yet to become so.

255
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,240
I see.

256
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,640
I'd say you're still a decent man.

257
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,320
But today,

258
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,120
Klin has agreed to become mine.

259
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,400
Is that true?

260
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,360
Yes, Grandma.

261
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,920
Hey.

262
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,600
I will be your wife.

263
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,280
And as I have told you,

264
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,080
I must be your only wife,
not one of your wives.

265
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,160
If you truly love me,

266
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,200
you must kick all 20 of your wives
out of your house.

267
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,120
-But--
-This is your last chance.

268
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,920
I'll let you decide.

269
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,920
-Klin--
-If you don't agree to this…

270
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,480
I will consider that
we are not destined to be together.

271
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,640
Don't show your face to me again.

272
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,240
You have seven days.

273
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,200
Klin.

274
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,680
You can leave now.

275
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,760
Seven days. Seven days it is.

276
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,440
Have you fallen for him, Klin?

277
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,760
It seems so.

278
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,840
What do you mean by that?

279
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,400
It seems that I have fallen for him.

280
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,680
He's handsome, don't you think?

281
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,760
Take this.

282
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,000
Fine.

283
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,280
He does seem to love you.

284
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,840
My only concern is his wives.

285
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,360
I can handle them.

286
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,200
They fear me.

287
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,040
That's not enough,

288
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,000
as they will gang up against you
once they have stopped fearing you.

289
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,240
They must be gone.

290
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,160
How is the famine in China?

291
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,960
Which areas has it been affected?

292
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,760
It has affected Guangdong and Fujian.

293
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,560
What has caused it?

294
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,520
It is caused by unseasonal rains.

295
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,440
What word has the Kangxi Emperor sent?

296
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,160
Tell me, Rid.

297
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,040
The Emperor is very worried

298
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,160
because this will lead
to great food shortages.

299
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,160
All the people, be they rich or poor,
will not have rice to eat.

300
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,920
That's why the king has ordered

301
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
more cargo ships to be built
to export rice.

302
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,200
That's very reasonable.

303
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,640
From what I have learned,
food shortages occur frequently in China

304
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,840
in various parts of the country.

305
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,240
This is due to China's large territory

306
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,200
and its huge population.

307
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,480
It's considered a very big market.

308
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,120
Oh, right.

309
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,320
Remember to send sappanwood
as a tribute to the Emperor.

310
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,400
Yes, Father. I'm working on it.

311
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,200
Don't worry about it, Rid.

312
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,360
Thank you, In.

313
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,120
Also, keep an eye
on the commoners in the smaller cities.

314
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,880
Make sure they don't sell
sappanwood directly to the merchants.

315
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,720
Punish it severely.

316
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,320
They have been secretly selling it
to merchants

317
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,360
as it sells well and is in high demand.

318
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,480
Westerners, Chinese,
and Japanese merchants

319
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,040
have been purchasing it unencumbered.

320
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,840
I've seen many of them
gaining great wealth.

321
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Regarding this,
I have an opinion to offer.

322
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,640
Tell me.

323
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,160
I would like you to consider this.

324
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,880
The Treasury

325
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,120
buys a picul of sappanwood
for two salung and five fuang

326
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,000
but sells it at six salung.

327
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,680
That is a huge profit.

328
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,840
We do trade, so we must make a profit.

329
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,560
Or are you saying
we should reduce the selling price?

330
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,400
The market price is six salung.

331
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,160
Do you expect us to sell it
at five salung?

332
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,560
No.

333
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,600
I would like to suggest

334
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,320
we buy it at a higher price

335
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,400
to give the people who supply it to us

336
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,160
an incentive to do so
and make it worthwhile for them.

337
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,120
Hey, Rid!

338
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,120
That is the market price.

339
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,840
People have been selling it
at this price for so long,

340
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,720
yet you want us to buy it
at a higher price.

341
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,520
The nerve.

342
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,120
You are serving the royal court.
You must remember this.

343
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,640
Praejeen, you're here.

344
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,440
What is it?

345
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,520
Please go for lunch, Father.

346
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,200
It's long past lunchtime.

347
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,720
Rid and In must be hungry.

348
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,880
No, I'm not hungry.

349
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,640
Why is Father so angry?

350
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,160
All you did was offer a suggestion.

351
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,680
He will calm down soon.

352
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,760
He doesn't stay angry for long.

353
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,920
Please don't mind him, Rid.

354
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,440
This is just how he is.

355
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,480
What is this, Praejeen?

356
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,480
How could you disparage your father
in front of his future son-in-law?

357
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,520
That's inappropriate.

358
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,960
It's the truth.

359
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,360
What truth?

360
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,080
Are you saying he is in the wrong?

361
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,920
He will become my son-in-law.
The king has ordered it.

362
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,200
Don't worry.

363
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,120
He's not a threat.

364
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,160
He's just honest.

365
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,920
Why did he come to work for the Treasury?

366
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,200
The king sent him.

367
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,200
Initially, In also served as a royal page.

368
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,520
But I have no idea

369
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,040
why the king sent him here as well.

370
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,600
Perhaps he sent Baron Maharit
to see the ins and outs.

371
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,520
And do we have such things for him to see?

372
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,360
Damn you.

373
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,000
I have done everything

374
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,240
in accordance with practices
that have been passed down.

375
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,440
I set the purchase price
as low as possible

376
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,440
and the export price as high as possible,
increasing profits every year.

377
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,440
Don't tell me nothing reaches your pocket.

378
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,840
And did you get the women I asked for?

379
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,480
Yes, they are waiting outside.

380
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,040
Take them away now.

381
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,840
What an eyesore.

382
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,880
Yes, my lady.

383
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,840
They will be sent to the palace.

384
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,960
Father regularly sends them.

385
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,960
What is it, In?

386
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,120
It's nothing.

387
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,320
Rid, aren't you going
to see Pudtarn today?

388
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,440
Well…

389
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,680
I have already laid the table.

390
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,200
Miss,

391
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,280
are you concerned about Lady Praejeen?

392
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,440
Yes.

393
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,800
Shouldn't I be?

394
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,960
Gosh, right.

395
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,640
I have to fight with Lady Champa
and her servants for this.

396
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,720
Also, there is Lady Praejeen's family.
Who are they?

397
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,000
Marquess Phrakhlang, Lady Pong,
and Lady Praejeen herself.

398
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,000
But the biggest challenge for me

399
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,880
is…

400
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,120
-The king.
-The king.

401
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,480
Gosh.

402
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,480
Are you going to be okay, Tarn?

403
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,880
Thank you both so much.

404
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,840
You have helped me a lot.

405
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,000
Our support won't be enough.

406
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,600
She's right.

407
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,720
Please ask Lord Rid for help.

408
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,440
He won't.

409
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,400
He's probably
the last person who will help me.

410
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,360
Why doesn't he just marry
Lady Praejeen then?

411
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,240
Have this.

412
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,840
Stop thinking about sad things.

413
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,720
If he marries Praejeen,
I will stay single until I die.

414
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,640
No, until I get to go home.

415
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,560
But it hasn't happened yet,
so I should stay optimistic.

416
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,000
Let's cook food to sell.

417
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,240
-Cook what?
-Cook what?

418
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,560
People are bored of the stew.
I'm going to cook something new.

419
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,880
It's a very yummy dish.

420
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,080
Perm, the Chinese people living

421
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,240
up the canal sell chicken feet
at the market.

422
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,920
-Yes.
-That's it.

423
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,160
Go and buy a lot of them.

424
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,800
You're wondering
what's good about it, aren't you?

425
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,080
Wait and see.

426
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,000
My goodness.

427
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,440
It's so plump.

428
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,880
These are the ingredients for green curry.

429
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,920
Add coconut milk to the pan.

430
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,640
Does it smell good?

431
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,840
-Yes.
-Yes.

432
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,040
All right, the curry paste.

433
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,520
Here you go, curry paste.

434
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,640
Cook the curry paste to release the aroma.

435
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,280
Simmer the coconut milk
until it almost separates.

436
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,560
Cook the chicken feet until tender.

437
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,520
Add Thai eggplants.

438
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,000
Delicious.

439
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,640
A big portion, please.

440
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,920
-Is it good, ma'am?
-Yes.

441
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,840
-Miss.
-Yours is ready.

442
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,160
Thank you.

443
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,160
Miss.

444
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,800
Hey, they gave us too much.

445
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,920
Perm, give this back to them.

446
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,160
Sure.

447
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,920
Where did they go?

448
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,040
Eung.

449
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,360
-Am I doing it correctly?
-Yes.

450
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,480
She's smiling from ear to ear.

451
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,640
I guess she can't help it.

452
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,600
Just you wait.

453
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,880
It won't be long.

454
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,640
Excuse me.

455
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,720
You gave us too much.

456
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
Thank you.

457
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,560
Be careful.

458
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,560
Hey.

459
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,000
Is that Pudtarn's servant?

460
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,720
Yes, Your…

461
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,240
Yes, my lord.

462
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,760
Let's go that way.

463
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,800
-He might cause a fuss.
-Yes, my lord.

464
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,360
Eung, it's this one.

465
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,480
Here you go, ma'am.

466
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,560
Miss.

467
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,760
That's yours.

468
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,960
-Miss.
-Yes?

469
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,960
The king is here.

470
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,880
What did you say?

471
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,080
What would he be doing here?
You must be seeing things.

472
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,680
No, I'm not.

473
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,840
Anyway, we have sold everything.
Let's pack up.

474
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,440
-Yes, miss.
-Yes, miss.

475
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,440
Here they are, Prik.

476
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,400
No.

477
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,640
Those vegetables are nice.

478
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,560
They don't have everything we need.

479
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,520
There it is.

480
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,880
Hey, let's check this stall out.

481
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,240
-These are some nice vegetables.
-Yes.

482
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,840
Go ahead and choose them.

483
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,040
Get what we need
and we will go check other stalls out.

484
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,840
-Is that her?
-What?

485
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,200
Chuang, you have good eyes.
Look over there.

486
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,760
That is Miss Pudtarn, Prik.

487
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,800
Chuang, I asked you to look at her.

488
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,960
As Boong said, that is Miss Pudtarn.

489
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,280
Is she a vendor?

490
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,440
Is she selling food?

491
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,720
Yes, look at all the cookware.

492
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,960
How can she sell food?

493
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,080
In.

494
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,840
Yes, my lord.

495
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,240
-One bottle, please.
-Yes, sir.

496
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,560
It's one bia short.

497
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,120
What? I just counted it.
I gave you the full amount.

498
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,400
This is all you gave me.

499
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,360
Count it again.
Are you trying to cheat me?

500
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,040
I'm not. You only gave me this much.

501
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,680
I counted it myself. It wasn't short.

502
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,840
No, it's short.

503
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,600
I just counted it. It wasn't short.

504
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,360
Well, this is how much you gave me.

505
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,280
It--

506
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,440
See?

507
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,560
Here, you only gave me this much,

508
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,880
so this is all you're getting.

509
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,520
Please give me some more.

510
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,280
This isn't enough for my children.

511
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,720
If you want more, then give me more money.

512
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,200
This is all I have.
Please have pity on me.

513
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,720
No, I'm trying to do business here.

514
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,520
Your children don't have enough to eat.

515
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,280
Will mine have enough
if you only give me this much?

516
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,760
That is really all I have.

517
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,080
Are you paying for me?

518
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,760
Thank you.

519
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,920
This is enough.

520
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,280
-Thank you.
-You can take all of this.

521
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,040
You can take everything.

522
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,080
Here is yours.

523
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,720
Thank you.

524
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,400
Do you not sell silver barb?

525
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,800
Of course not. The king has prohibited
the catching of them.

526
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,040
You're right.

527
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,000
With the prohibition,
does he intend to keep them for himself?

528
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,400
Hey, listen.

529
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,880
The silver barb is our local fish.

530
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,280
My lady loves it so much,

531
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,800
but she hasn't had any
for quite some time now.

532
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,840
Ma'am, can't you sell it?

533
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,760
No. I'd be fined five tamlueng.

534
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,440
My goodness.

535
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,800
Listen, I think the king is…

536
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,840
Come here.

537
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,960
He has gone mad.

538
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,960
He stops us from catching silver barb.

539
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,520
Not only is he mad, but he's also stingy.

540
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,880
We also want to eat it.

541
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,280
Am I right, sir?

542
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,720
-You're right.
-See?

543
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,960
I don't think it's a good idea
to say this here, Prik.

544
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,880
You're right,
but I already said it, so whatever.

545
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,680
-Let's go home.
-Okay, go.

546
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,400
-Come, Boong.
-Why are you standing there?

547
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,080
-Hey, where are you dragging me?
-Hurry up.

548
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
Gosh, we haven't bought anything.

549
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,240
In,

550
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,800
Rid's servant doesn't know her place.

551
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,040
I heard everything.

552
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,080
The cockfighting pit is closed
for the owner's son's ordination.

553
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,960
What's wrong, Your--

554
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,520
It's your servant, Rid.

555
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,520
What happened--

556
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,960
Did she not read the announcement?

557
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,840
In,

558
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,000
tell him.

559
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,480
Prik said His Majesty intends
to keep all the silver barbs for himself.

560
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,400
I…

561
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,400
will look into this, Your Majesty.

562
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,120
That woman can't read, Your Majesty.

563
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,440
Right, that must be the reason.

564
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,560
Go and tell her

565
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,320
that I don't intend
to keep them for myself.

566
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,440
The announcement clearly states that

567
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,360
-I--
-He's deranged!

568
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,120
The king is deranged!

569
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,680
The king is deranged!

570
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,000
He wouldn't keep all the fish for himself
if he weren't deranged.

571
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,240
That's right.
Silver barbs belong to the people.

572
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,040
They do not belong to the king alone.

573
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,240
That's right.

574
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,240
-The king is deranged.
-He's deranged.

575
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,480
Is that true?

576
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,360
-Give me the liquor.
-Why is that so?

577
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,760
-Give it to me.
-Come on.

578
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,680
Let's drink.

579
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,280
Well?

580
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,440
Did you find out

581
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,720
the source of this false rumor
that I want to keep the fish for myself?

582
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,960
I asked you to look into this

583
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,320
because something seemed odd
about those people

584
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,480
who were shouting about it.

585
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,600
It's as if they were
intentionally making a scene.

586
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,040
Did you do what I asked?

587
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,880
What did you find out?

588
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,400
Thongkam.

589
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

590
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,640
You're the deputy director
of the police force.

591
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,800
You tell me.

592
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,760
A number of groups of people

593
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,160
affected to go out drinking

594
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,960
and started shouting things
around the market.

595
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,240
People can't read,

596
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,960
so they believed

597
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,360
what those people said was true,
Your Majesty.

598
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,960
I knew it.

599
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,920
Whose people are they?
Who do they serve under?

600
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,440
Hey, I said tell me.

601
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,840
Why are you holding your tongues?

602
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,080
If none of you are going to talk,

603
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,800
then I will leave.

604
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,480
I will send someone to look into this.
You should watch out.

605
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,920
They are the servants

606
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,840
of the officials who serve

607
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,560
under the crown prince, Your Majesty.

608
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,720
They disguised themselves,

609
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,640
but I had my servants follow them
for almost a day.

610
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,200
I eventually found out

611
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,640
who they serve, Your Majesty.

612
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,880
What should we do, Rid?

613
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,680
After two days sales,
let's sum up our performance.

614
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,920
The best-selling dish was…

615
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,160
-Vegetable stew.
-Vegetable stew.

616
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,400
That's right.

617
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,600
The green curry with chicken feet
didn't sell out.

618
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,160
There was a lot left.

619
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,680
Why didn't it sell out? It was so good.

620
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,240
I know now. It must be the chicken feet.
They didn't want to eat them.

621
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,000
Where I come from,
people put chicken feet in everything,

622
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,400
from curries to spicy salads.

623
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,840
We even deep-fry them.

624
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,280
So we will grow more vegetables
for the Chinese vegetable stew,

625
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,200
including Chinese cabbage, turnip,
and Chinese kale.

626
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,440
Actually, I also want to sell
fried silver barb, but we'll have to wait.

627
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,000
The prohibited period ends in a few days.

628
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,760
The people will definitely agree
that this law is freaking awesome.

629
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,160
The silver barb will become
the key source of protein in Ayutthaya.

630
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,840
The law has caused trouble.

631
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:14,960
Did you know that?

632
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,120
You didn't do the PR well, did you?
That's why people didn't understand it.

633
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,640
Do you understand it?

634
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,360
-No, my lord.
-No, my lord.

635
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,440
Well then, let me ask you.

636
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,080
How is the king dealing with it?

637
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,120
He doesn't say anything.

638
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,680
I don't know how this will turn out.

639
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,960
Actually, he doesn't have to care
what everyone thinks

640
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,520
because the truth is the truth.

641
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,400
Also, this royal ordinance

642
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,280
only lasts for three months
and will end in a few days.

643
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,600
Now, people will know
that the rumor is completely false.

644
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,800
Having heard about this,
some ideas just popped into my head.

645
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,720
What are you talking about?

646
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,560
Your words make no sense, as usual,

647
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,080
despite having been here
for almost a year.

648
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,600
If this were a drama, I would say
someone is trying to slander the king.

649
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,400
Those drunkards…

650
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,920
are the servants at Chan Palace
working for the crown prince.

651
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,000
My people reported to me
that those people of yours

652
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,080
objected to you

653
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,120
handing the throne to me
after Father had left it to you.

654
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,320
I returned you the throne

655
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,880
with sincerity,

656
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,280
believing it belonged solely

657
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,040
to the one rightful heir.

658
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,960
Since then,

659
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,320
I have harbored
no ambitions for the throne.

660
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,160
If I am to become the king of Ayutthaya,

661
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,240
it shall be because

662
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,720
I hold both the status

663
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,120
and the legitimate right to do so.

664
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,640
Distortion of the truth
exists in every era.

665
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,360
People will believe anything

666
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,000
that others tell them.

667
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,480
If people love something,
they love it no matter what.

668
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,640
But if they hate it,
they hate it no matter what,

669
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,440
and they will believe
anything bad about it.

670
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,920
You speak as if there are many people
who love and hate you.

671
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,920
You seem to understand it well.

672
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,400
There are plenty.

673
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,680
Fine. There are only people who hate me,
not love me.

674
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,440
For people who love you,

675
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,080
one will do.

676
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:02,240
Look at you. You're so good at flirting.

677
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,880
Love lights the path.

678
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,560
My goodness.

679
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,560
Don't laugh like this with anyone else.

680
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,200
Don't make that face to anyone either.

681
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,760
Do you understand?

682
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,720
-Well?
-I know now.

683
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,240
I will only make it to you.

684
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,280
Choi.

685
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,480
Why didn't you make any sound?

686
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,520
I thought no one was here.

687
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,760
Well…

688
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,240
Even though I was here,
I didn't hear or see anything.

689
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,520
Do you think I believe you?

690
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,840
Please believe me.

691
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,240
I don't mind if he saw us.

692
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,360
Goodness.

693
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,120
What is this?

694
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,160
It looks strange.

695
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,040
Lady Karaked calls it khua kling, Father.

696
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,640
What is it again?

697
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,000
Khua kling.

698
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,680
I'm not eating it. It has a strange name.

699
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,160
Let me try it.

700
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,280
You must eat it with rice
because it's very spicy.

701
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,000
Sure.

702
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,400
In, eat it. Are you scared it's spicy?

703
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,840
No, Mother.

704
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,520
-It's delicious.
-It's delicious.

705
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,640
Is it?

706
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,200
-Yes.
-Yes.

707
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,000
How is it, Father?

708
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,000
It's good.

709
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,800
It's good, but it's very spicy.

710
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,440
She doesn't only cook
Chinese dishes competently.

711
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,600
What do you think, Pong?

712
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,000
Yes, she has learned a lot.

713
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,440
Once they are married,
Rid will not need to go anywhere

714
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,160
as your food tastes no different
from his mother's.

715
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,720
My brother.

716
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,360
What's the important matter
that you want to tell me?

717
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,640
I have decided to tell you this because

718
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,840
I…

719
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:07,160
In, please don't make me anxious.

720
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,240
My dear sister.

721
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,240
Please accept that

722
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,280
Rid doesn't have feelings for you,

723
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,960
not even in the slightest.

724
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,880
My brother.

725
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,840
In, what did you say?

726
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,280
Repeat it for me now.

727
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,440
What did you say, Pong? Say it again.

728
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,240
Rid announced that

729
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,520
he doesn't wish to marry Praejeen.

730
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,480
He doesn't love her,

731
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,400
but he loves someone else.

732
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,680
Is that true?

733
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,560
Did Rid go as far as announcing that?

734
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,960
Yes, my lady.

735
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,960
Everybody also heard

736
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,640
that he intends to defy
the king's command.

737
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,840
Did Rid say that?

738
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,720
Yes, he said that.

739
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,160
Lady Champa, do you believe
that Rid would dare say that?

740
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,680
Lady Pong,

741
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,360
I raised him myself.

742
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,800
I don't believe
that he would speak so bluntly.

743
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,960
That he announced his intention
to disobey the royal command,

744
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,520
I will never believe that.

745
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,320
But if he said that

746
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,280
he doesn't love Praejeen

747
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,320
and has feelings for someone else,

748
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,080
I do believe that.

749
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,160
If Rid doesn't dare
disobey the royal command,

750
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,720
then we shall proceed with it

751
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,880
and I shall prepare

752
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,360
Praejeen for the wedding.

753
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,800
I bid you farewell.

754
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,000
This has become a serious problem.

755
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:44,040
Marquess Kosathibodi
isn't some inconsequential figure.

756
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,160
His power knows no bounds.

757
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,960
Who will solve this?

758
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,080
Rid will do it.

759
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,360
Let him do it himself.

760
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,360
He's the one who is getting married,
no one else.

761
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,280
Remember, my lady,

762
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,640
you allowed Lord Rid
to choose his own spouse.

763
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,600
That's right.

764
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,440
You can't say anything about this.

765
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,520
You must give him what he wants.

766
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,240
Prik, Chuang,

767
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,240
it's all your fault.

768
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,880
You made me do this.

769
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,880
I never agreed with Rid,

770
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,000
yet you told me to comply with him.

771
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,480
Mind your own business next time

772
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,600
because I won't listen to you again.

773
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,920
Especially you, Prik.

774
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,040
My goodness.

775
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,880
-Do you think you can escape me?
-My goodness!

776
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,640
I think this will be
the end of me, Chuang.

777
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,080
The same goes for me.

778
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,440
My poor Lord Rid.

779
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,720
He's being cornered now.

780
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,880
-What are you looking at?
-Good grief!

781
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,200
I'm not looking at you, my lady.

782
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,520
I'm leaving now.

783
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,080
You have enough money
to buy your freedom, do you, Eung?

784
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,800
Yes, ma'am.

785
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,080
Here are five tamlueng.

786
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,080
Miss.

787
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,560
Just take it. I said I have enough.

788
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,440
The money we earned from selling food,

789
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,600
along with my earnings
from cooking for the king,

790
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,600
amounts to five tamlueng.
Give this to Gui.

791
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,240
It's enough to buy your freedom.

792
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,560
I'm sorry we don't have enough
for you, Perm.

793
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,440
Even worse,
you are more expensive than her.

794
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,560
Think about it. Even the prices
of men and women are different.

795
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,560
How are men better?

796
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,120
Men are key contributors
to the labor force.

797
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,520
Some male slave owners

798
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,920
are obligated to serve
in the government service,

799
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,520
but they are allowed
to send their servants instead.

800
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,280
Even in times of war,

801
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,080
the owners can also send
their servants in place of them.

802
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,880
That's why my price
is more than Eung's by almost half.

803
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,120
Okay, I understand now.
You can go by yourself, right, Eung?

804
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,400
What about you, Perm?
Are you buying yours too?

805
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,320
Not yet, ma'am.
I'm still Miss Pudtarn's servant.

806
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,680
Did your mistress give this money to you?

807
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,560
Yes, Madam Gui.

808
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,680
Miss Pudtarn is very kind to me.

809
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,400
She worked hard

810
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,280
to earn money to pay for my freedom.

811
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,680
She didn't put me under contract either.

812
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,480
She gives me the freedom to earn a living.

813
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:18,200
She's such a great person.
She has truly been sent by angels.

814
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,840
Though it was unfortunate

815
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,440
that someone destroyed
her vegetable plots the other day.

816
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,760
But she didn't let this dissuade her.

817
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,440
She has continued to work hard
to earn a living

818
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,400
so that Eung and I
have been living a good life.

819
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:55,920
Here you go.

820
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,040
Stamp your fingerprint on it.

821
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,760
EUNG HAS PAID HER PRICE IN FULL.
SHE IS FREE.

822
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,560
SIGNATURE

823
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,000
Look after it carefully.

824
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,760
Yes, ma'am.

825
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,720
Hey, Grandma!

826
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,360
Gosh! What is this for?

827
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,720
It hurts.

828
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,080
Oh, dear.

829
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,040
What can hurt you, Klin?

830
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,200
Well, this.

831
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,640
My ear is about to fall off.

832
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,400
Did you see
that even people like Eung and Perm

833
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,720
were mocking you?

834
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,560
Did you hear it, you brat?

835
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,720
I heard it, but I don't care.

836
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,480
Let them say all they want.

837
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,960
It won't affect me.

838
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,600
Ha! It won't affect you?

839
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,160
-Does your brain even work?
-My gosh.

840
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,320
It works,

841
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,920
but whether I use it or not,
I'll have to think about that.

842
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,920
-Take this.
-Grandma!

843
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,440
Think about it?

844
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,560
Yes, I will think about
whether I use it or not.

845
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,640
My goodness! You're giving me a headache.

846
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,640
Come here, Klin.

847
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,760
I will tell you.

848
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,800
Tell me. I can hear you.

849
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:29,240
I told you to come here!

850
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:52,760
Klin, have you never heard the rumor

851
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,720
about how close

852
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:59,800
Pudtarn is to the family
of Marquess Wisut Sakorn?

853
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,680
She went traveling with them.

854
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,760
Even Lady Prang

855
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,800
seems very close to her.

856
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,080
But you,

857
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,360
unless something serious happens,
you won't learn your lesson, will you?

858
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,480
Or does Pudtarn have to go so far as

859
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,120
to report you to the judges

860
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,240
and have you thrown in jail

861
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,440
for destroying her belongings

862
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,880
before you will repent?

863
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,000
If you don't watch where you're going,

864
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,560
you could fall over

865
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,600
-and die--
-My goodness, Grandma.

866
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,680
You're exaggerating.

867
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,800
I'm not listening to you anymore.

868
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,080
Where are you going, Klin?

869
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,400
Prik, tell Muang to prepare a boat.

870
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,720
Yes, my lady.

871
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:06,840
Karaked.

872
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,080
Yes?

873
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,000
I'm going to Pudtarn's house.

874
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,200
What?

875
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,840
I'm going there.

876
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,160
Why would…

877
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,720
Why would you go there?

878
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,680
It must be about Lord Rid.

879
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,440
I know that, but what about him?

880
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:30,640
Follow her
and tell me every word that is said.

881
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,920
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

882
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,600
You were born a commoner.

883
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,200
Do you understand that?

884
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,960
So am I not human?

885
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,040
Don't talk back to me.

886
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,680
No one dares do this to me

887
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:18,560
except your relative, Karaked.

888
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,560
She did this
when she first arrived in Ayutthaya.

889
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,080
But as time went on,
she learned to accept me.

890
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:29,439
There is only one way
you can get what you want.

891
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,720
I'm sure you would do it.

892
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,960
Don't ever do it.

893
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:39,479
Don't ever make Rid
disobey the royal command.

894
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:42,600
It would not be favorable for him
as he might get punished.

895
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,600
No one has ever done so.

896
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:49,200
That is his problem, not mine.

897
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,000
How dare you argue with her?

898
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,760
She is your elder

899
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,359
and the grandmother of Lord Rid.

900
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,160
You must respect her.

901
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,560
Well…

902
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,960
What's wrong, Prik?

903
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,120
It's nothing, my lady.

904
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,240
Shall we go back?

905
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:29,319
What?

906
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,960
You were so eager to teach her a lesson.

907
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,800
Have you changed your mind now?

908
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,080
Yes, my lady.

909
01:09:44,359 --> 01:09:45,319
Pin.

910
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,439
Yes, I think it's her.

911
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,399
I wasn't certain until…

912
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:50,319
Today.

913
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,760
Right?

914
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:53,240
Yes.

915
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,840
It's how she stares at Prik.

916
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,480
You are a commoner.

917
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,840
I must reiterate this,

918
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:08,480
for you would not recognize yourself
and understand your place.

919
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,840
Wherever you came from, go back there.

920
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,520
What is this?

921
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,480
Why do I feel hot? My gosh.

922
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,000
-I feel hot, like I'm on fire.
-Miss.

923
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,440
Please let me touch the manuscript.

924
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:03,880
Let us step back in time from your era
by a thousand years.

925
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:09,280
In this city, there occurred
an intricate tale woven with love, hatred,

926
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,400
revenge, sorrow, and death.

927
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,080
You must choose
whether to return to your present life

928
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,200
or to Ayutthaya.

929
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,040
Hurry and make up your mind.

930
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:01,040
