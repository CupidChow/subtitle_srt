1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,640
You might forgive her.

2
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,200
Do you really believe
this black magic nonsense?

3
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,520
I am going to Phitsanulok.

4
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,400
I'll put an end to all this nonsense.

5
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,640
I would be grateful if the king
could bestow a wife upon him.

6
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,400
The title of lady must be mine.

7
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,120
Pudtarn may be his wife
who belongs in the kitchen.

8
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,560
Do you believe
you were predestined to come here?

9
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,960
If I must leave,

10
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,720
it's because I am predestined to.

11
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,120
Whomever you love,

12
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,280
you will end up with that woman.

13
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,720
-Do not give up.
-What?

14
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,520
A royal proclamation has been issued

15
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,560
for me to marry Praejeen.

16
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,800
I would like to request
a royally-bestowed wife.

17
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,200
Whom do you have in mind?

18
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,920
We have arrived.

19
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,840
Isn't the weather pleasant, Keaw?

20
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,320
It is.

21
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,800
There's a breeze.

22
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,280
Wait, Ming.

23
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,880
Where are you going?

24
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,600
I'm going to see Keaw.

25
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,240
Do you want Prang to suspect
you have followed Keaw?

26
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,960
Why must she suspect?
I really have done so.

27
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,240
Do as you please.

28
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,840
Why don't you tell me what I should do?

29
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,200
Yaem.

30
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,360
Are you drifting off?

31
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,120
I'm meditating.

32
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,840
Ming.

33
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,720
Keaw.

34
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,560
Ming.

35
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,280
Keaw.

36
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
Ming.

37
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,280
What is it?

38
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,280
How long are you going to keep doing that?

39
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,520
Keaw.

40
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,000
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

41
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,680
Please say it, my lord.

42
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
I…

43
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,040
Well…

44
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,440
Where have you been, Ming?

45
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,560
Nowhere.

46
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,120
I came directly here.

47
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,480
Did you secretly follow her?

48
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,320
No, I didn't.

49
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,320
I came here to worship.

50
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,040
Hey, Ming.

51
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,680
It is forbidden to lie in a temple.

52
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,760
If you don't believe me,

53
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,840
why don't you ask the person behind me?

54
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,840
Who is it?

55
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,840
Okay, let me guess.

56
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
It's In.

57
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,200
I knew it.

58
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,080
Pin, is this a good idea?

59
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,360
Of course.

60
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,320
It's not as if someone will see them.

61
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,640
How is this not good?

62
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,880
Look.

63
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,520
Have you ever seen our ladies
smile so sweetly?

64
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,720
And--

65
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,160
My ladies, it's time to leave.

66
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,440
The sun is getting strong.

67
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,280
Goodness.

68
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,920
Keaw.

69
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,280
Yes, Ming?

70
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,840
I have something for you.

71
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,720
I can't accept it.

72
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,520
I beg you.

73
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,760
Please accept it.

74
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,159
I'm scared of Father,
Mother, and Grandmother.

75
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,360
Please do this for me.

76
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,640
Please accept it.

77
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,480
No, I cannot accept it.

78
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,400
Grandmother will scold me
if she finds out.

79
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,440
Prang.

80
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,280
We'll wait in front of the temple.

81
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,160
In,

82
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,960
I'd like to see the Buddha images
around the central prang.

83
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,360
Could you escort me there?

84
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,560
Keaw.

85
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,800
Do you know that you have been
on my mind day and night?

86
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,720
Do you believe me?

87
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,920
Well…

88
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,360
Please believe me.

89
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,200
I have never longed
for someone in this way.

90
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,400
I see.

91
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,640
Let's go back to see Keaw.

92
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,920
What? I thought you wanted
to see those Buddha images.

93
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,480
I have seen them so many times.
Why would I wish to see them again?

94
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,680
Are you shocked?

95
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,640
Well, you should be. Let's go.

96
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,760
Not only have I longed for you…

97
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,720
but I also love you.

98
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,800
Ming, we are inside a temple.

99
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,720
You must be careful what you say.

100
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,440
I don't care where we are,

101
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,640
as long as I can say what I want to say.

102
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,040
All right, let's go home.

103
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,480
-Kheow.
-Yes, my lady.

104
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,600
Where are Pin and Yaem?

105
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,760
They are waiting in front of the temple.

106
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,400
Goodness, how could they leave us
with these gentlemen?

107
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,960
This is bad. Let's go, Keaw.

108
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,440
What is it?

109
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,200
Ming, what was that?

110
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,160
I don't know.

111
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,960
Ming,

112
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,640
if you are keeping something from me,
I will tell Rid everything.

113
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,520
In.

114
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,640
Good lord, listen to me.

115
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,920
I'll tell you.

116
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,000
You see, Prang…

117
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,760
She…

118
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,680
She…

119
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,680
-She…
-Prang…

120
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,560
In.

121
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,440
Prang is truly mischievous.

122
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,240
Indeed, she is.
She arranged everything with me.

123
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,240
I like her.

124
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,440
I'm so glad to hear that.

125
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,440
What are you glad about?

126
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,440
We shall both be Rid's in-laws.

127
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,680
The king has issued a royal proclamation
for Keaw and me already.

128
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,480
I refuse.

129
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,520
Well, Karaked,

130
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,400
you surely know your daughter well.

131
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,200
I know everyone well,

132
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,680
be it my daughters, my sons,

133
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,440
or their father.

134
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,040
I also refuse, Mother.

135
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,880
Prang,

136
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,560
what does this have to do with you?

137
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,760
I not can accept it.

138
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,720
You mean you cannot accept it.

139
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,760
Yes, I cannot accept it.

140
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,240
This is an assorted marriage.

141
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,880
An arranged marriage.

142
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,680
Thank you, Mother.

143
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,440
An arranged marriage, Father.

144
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,000
Keaw, my dear, can I ask you a question?

145
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,920
Yes, Father.

146
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,040
Do you have feelings for Ming at all?

147
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,480
I do, Father.

148
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,120
Okay.

149
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,760
If so, then isn't this a good thing?

150
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,720
But I don't want an arranged marriage.

151
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,600
So will you refuse to marry Ming
for such a trivial reason,

152
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,960
even though marrying him means
you will get to be with the man you love?

153
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,080
Do you think

154
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,320
this will be beneficial for Keaw, Karaked?

155
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,920
Do you love her?

156
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,160
Khun Pi, what do you mean by that?

157
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,680
As you don't seem to grasp
what I am telling you,

158
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,080
I shall not waste your time further.

159
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,680
Hold on, Khun Pi.

160
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,160
What is it?

161
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,000
It's about arranged marriage.

162
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,840
I really can't accept it.

163
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,720
Muang.

164
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,240
Let's go.

165
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Yes, my lord.

166
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,520
Am I wrong?

167
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,599
This is my point of view,
so I will defend it.

168
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,640
This has nothing to do with eras,
all right?

169
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,840
Keaw.

170
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,520
Prang,

171
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,240
do you think I'm doing the right thing?

172
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,480
I love him,

173
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,640
but I refused to marry him.

174
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,240
Who would do such a thing?

175
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,960
Me.

176
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,640
If anyone thinks
they could force me into marriage,

177
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,040
they had better forget it.

178
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,760
What if you loved him?

179
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,960
You're right.

180
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,760
What would I do?

181
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,760
But it goes against our principles.

182
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,520
Mother said we must have principles.

183
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,840
To be honest, Prang,
I haven't really grasped

184
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,040
what Mother means by principles.

185
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,480
I know.

186
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,880
It's your point of view.

187
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,680
Point of view?

188
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Yes, your point of view.

189
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,880
Here you go. This is from Ming.

190
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,160
Don't get ahead of yourself.

191
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,800
Leave this to Father and Mother.

192
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,960
What kind of fish is this?

193
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,600
It's sun-dried fish.

194
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,600
We dry it for just a day.

195
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,040
Sun-dried fish.

196
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,800
Let me see, Perm.

197
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,920
That's a lot. Great job.

198
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,800
What is that, Perm?

199
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,960
It's worm castings, my lord.

200
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,240
-What is it for?
-Fertilizer, my lord.

201
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,120
We raise worms for their manure, my lord.

202
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
I see.

203
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,040
I never knew this.

204
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,800
Worm castings
are the best nutrients for the soil.

205
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,480
They also help improve it
and promote root growth.

206
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Would you like to help us?

207
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
Here, my lord.

208
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,240
Wait.

209
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,840
Your hands are still dirty. Let me help.

210
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,360
If you don't wash all the dirt
off your hands,

211
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,600
it can contaminate your food.

212
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,520
Let's forget about it for now and relax.

213
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,440
Everything has a solution.

214
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,840
No one can defy a royal command.

215
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,280
No one has ever tried before.

216
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,240
But someone might do it.
There's a first time for everything.

217
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,080
I cannot imagine
what my body and soul would be

218
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,760
without you.

219
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
This.

220
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,840
Please don't leave me.

221
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,560
I'll definitely leave you…

222
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,440
if I can't be your only wife.

223
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,560
Choi, why are you here?

224
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,840
I came to pick you up…

225
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,720
to take you
to Marquess Kosathibodi's residence.

226
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,240
That's great, Choi.

227
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,200
Your little lord

228
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,280
was thinking of visiting
Marquess Kosathibodi's residence.

229
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,040
But if it's not necessary,
you don't need to go.

230
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,520
And don't forget this.

231
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,360
If I'm not your only wife,
I won't be your wife at all.

232
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,760
Marquess Kosathibodi sent word

233
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,680
that the king requested your presence
at the Banyong Rattanat Throne Hall.

234
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,920
What? That's not what you said before.

235
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,240
Well, Choi?

236
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,200
You liar.

237
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,560
This helped you to learn

238
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,040
what she was thinking.

239
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,560
Hurry up

240
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,360
and stop talking.

241
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,920
Marquess Kosathibodi
wants to meet you first.

242
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,920
Why?

243
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,480
His Lordship would like to discuss matters
His Majesty might ask about.

244
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,600
It must be about the tax auction.

245
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,400
His Lordship will be waiting in front
of the Sanphet Prasat Throne Hall.

246
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,840
Let us talk, Rid.

247
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,080
Yes, my lord.

248
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:53,080
I have no idea
what the king wishes to question us about.

249
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,720
I reported all our work to him yesterday.

250
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,800
Do you have any clue?

251
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,920
I have observed that His Majesty
has taken an interest in the tax auction.

252
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,720
I noticed he listened attentively
when it was discussed.

253
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,120
That he hasn't mentioned it

254
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:20,160
could be because it's still a new idea
proposed by the crown prince.

255
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,240
Therefore, I think

256
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,520
His Majesty requested your presence…

257
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,440
because…

258
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,280
he needs your advice.

259
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,240
In fact, he should ask the Front Palace.

260
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,680
This wasn't our idea.
What advice could we possibly give?

261
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,120
Besides, a tax auction is a new policy.

262
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,680
We still have much to learn.

263
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,200
That's why I think
His Majesty will ask for your opinions.

264
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,320
What am I to say?

265
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,600
You will have to say something.

266
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,280
You're right.

267
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,400
Well then, I'll let you speak for me.

268
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,960
Why must I do that?

269
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,680
I'm your superior,
so you must obey my command.

270
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,040
But you should answer him.

271
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,440
His Majesty won't ask me.

272
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,880
In that case, do some research on this

273
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,240
as I don't know much about it.

274
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,120
I can do this,

275
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,760
but you must be the one giving opinions
if His Majesty asks for them.

276
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
I know.

277
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,960
What's wrong with you?
Are you afraid of speaking up?

278
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,360
No, my lord. I'm not afraid of that.

279
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,600
But this is your duty.
You must take responsibility for it.

280
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,000
Make it short, Marquess Phrakhlang.

281
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,960
As you are in charge of taxation,

282
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,680
what is your opinion of a tax auction?

283
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,160
Your Majesty,

284
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,040
regarding this matter,

285
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,080
I have yet to be fully informed
of the details,

286
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,480
so I would like to humbly request
your permission

287
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,960
to let Baron Maharit

288
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,920
present his opinions instead,
Your Majesty.

289
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,400
The crown prince

290
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,960
suggested that
there should be tax auctions

291
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,560
because the royal court's supervision
of tax collection has resulted

292
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,400
in severe leakage of funds, Your Majesty.

293
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,800
How?

294
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,720
In addition,

295
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,200
another reason for the introduction
of tax auctions is that

296
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,080
the royal court will no longer
have to send people to collect taxes,

297
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,400
as this will be the duty
of winning bidders, Your Majesty.

298
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,440
Hey, I want to know
how money was lost, Rid.

299
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,600
Answer my question.

300
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,320
The royal court sends out
tax collection officers,

301
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,640
such as tax accountants,

302
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,080
rural and urban administrators,

303
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,680
customs officers,

304
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,800
market controllers, and farm controllers.

305
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,440
These people
have the duty of collecting taxes

306
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,360
for their superiors, Your Majesty.

307
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,080
Yes, I know these people exist.

308
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,200
But what I want to know is
how it has leaked, Rid.

309
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,520
The crown prince merely mentioned
that it has leaked, Your Majesty.

310
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,640
I don't know how it has leaked.

311
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,360
All right.

312
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,440
For your sake, I will tell you.

313
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,360
Marquess Phrakhlang,

314
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,440
Baron Maharit,

315
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,880
Baron Chunphubet…

316
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,200
you all work in the Ministry of Treasury.

317
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,520
One of you is the Minister
of the Treasury,

318
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,560
while the rest of you are officials
in the department.

319
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,160
Listen carefully.

320
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,480
Land registrars, rural administrators,
and customs officers

321
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,320
travel to cities
in the north and the south

322
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,920
to collect taxes

323
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,360
and send them to your department.

324
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,800
However, before they do so…

325
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,640
they keep some for themselves.

326
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,080
Moreover, they distribute some
to other officials.

327
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,760
Who are these people?

328
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,440
Can you tell me?

329
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,040
Is it the city rulers or not?

330
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,960
Is it the officials or not?

331
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,200
Are the masters involved or not?

332
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,000
Yes, all of them.

333
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,520
Furthermore,
there are instances of tax fraud,

334
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,160
overtaxation,

335
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,680
and the siphoning off of funds
for themselves.

336
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,720
And who suffers because of this?

337
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,560
Is it not the people?

338
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,840
The crown prince, my brother,

339
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,800
proposed a tax auction
to prevent such leakage.

340
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,720
Do you understand now?

341
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,840
I'm truly grateful
for your explanation, Your Majesty.

342
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,160
No one at the Ministry of Treasury
was aware of this.

343
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,680
That's not true.

344
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,760
You are all aware of this.

345
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,080
But you have turned a blind eye.

346
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,880
And for what?

347
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,120
Corruption.

348
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,080
This exists in every era.

349
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,160
As long as there are these greedy people

350
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,960
who care only about their own profit
and ignore the common interest,

351
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,360
their kingdom will become
poorer and poorer

352
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,720
to the point that
it's unable to take care of its people.

353
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,240
What's more, the majority
of people will become poorer…

354
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,680
while certain people

355
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,600
and groups

356
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,320
will become increasingly prosperous.

357
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,080
Before long, that kingdom will be doomed.

358
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,720
I didn't summon you all here
to criticize you.

359
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,640
I summoned you here to tell you

360
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,760
that I'm interested in
the Front Palace's idea of a tax auction.

361
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,960
Marquess Phrakhlang.

362
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,920
This is under the direct responsibility
of the Ministry of Treasury.

363
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

364
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,920
I will leave this in your care.

365
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,719
It is an honor, Your Majesty.

366
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,040
Rid, In.

367
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,120
-It is an honor, Your Majesty.
-It is an honor, Your Majesty.

368
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,600
In a few days,

369
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,800
I will go outside to monitor
the silver barb law implementation.

370
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,320
I heard it's chaotic.

371
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,880
Prepare yourselves for it,

372
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,639
Ming and Thongkam.

373
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,719
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

374
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,920
There is one more thing
I want to tell you.

375
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,280
I have bestowed the daughter
of Marquess Phrakhlang

376
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,960
upon you, Rid.

377
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

378
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,840
It was your grandmother, Lady Champa, Rid.

379
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

380
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,280
She made the request to the Queen Mother.

381
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,880
Were you aware of this?

382
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,160
Well, it doesn't matter.

383
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,320
Let's say both the groom
and the bride are aware of this.

384
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,000
The same goes for Ming and Keaw.

385
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,360
Rid.

386
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,160
Your family can hold two weddings at once.

387
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,560
Yes.

388
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,400
If you and your sister get married
at the same time,

389
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,760
you won't have to hold two events.

390
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,160
I'm grateful for your gracious kindness,
Your Majesty.

391
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,160
Don't thank me.

392
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,160
Thank your wife.

393
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,720
Lady Pong

394
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,200
also visited my grandmother
for the same reason.

395
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

396
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,240
Rid.

397
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,080
What's wrong?
Why are you making that face?

398
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,160
Hey, look at Ming.

399
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,080
He's smiling from ear to ear.

400
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,960
Your kindness knows no bounds,
Your Majesty.

401
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,120
What?

402
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,160
You made the request, didn't you?

403
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

404
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,680
So, does Keaw have feelings for you?

405
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,560
I do not wish to force her
into an arranged marriage.

406
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,560
Already, Your Majesty.

407
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,880
Already what?

408
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,880
She already has feelings for me,
Your Majesty.

409
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,520
All right, that's great.

410
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,520
As for you, Rid, I find it
unnecessary to ask you that.

411
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,040
Your grandmother

412
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,040
told my grandmother that

413
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,600
the pair of you

414
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,120
could not wait to be husband and wife.

415
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,720
Your daughter

416
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,840
has been going to Rid's house daily
for cooking lessons, has she not?

417
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,560
Lady Champa strongly desires
for her grandson to have a spouse.

418
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,920
Do you know that?

419
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,240
I'm so upset at Grandmother.

420
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,840
Mother, what should I do?

421
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,280
Grandmother lied to everyone.

422
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,760
How am I supposed to respect her?

423
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,280
Calm down, Rid.
You must be tolerant of her.

424
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,680
But I'm upset.

425
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,920
I'm sad.

426
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,720
Does she love me?

427
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,440
How could she lie about me this way?

428
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,520
I can guarantee she loves you.

429
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,400
How can you do so?

430
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,600
You're not her.

431
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,080
I'm not her, but I can guarantee this.

432
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,800
You decide whether you want
to believe me or not.

433
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,840
Keaw, my dear.

434
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,800
Why are you being so nonsensical?

435
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,280
How is she nonsensical, Grandmother?

436
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,600
Prang, I'm not talking to you.
Don't meddle.

437
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,960
Goodness,

438
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,880
that's so harsh, Grandmother.

439
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,240
Keaw wasn't saying anything,
so I answered for her.

440
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,640
Look at you, always talking back to me.

441
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,200
I don't want to talk to you.

442
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,400
Get out of my sight.

443
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,760
You will be talking to yourself then

444
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,160
because Keaw will refuse to do so.

445
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,880
Even so, I don't want to listen to you.

446
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,400
Keaw.

447
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,920
Please accept it.

448
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,320
Do not defy the king.

449
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,720
Well then, Prang, tell me something.

450
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Keaw has refused to marry Ming,
so why is she crying her heart out?

451
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,640
Prang.

452
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,320
You told me not to meddle.

453
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,720
Prang, you deserve this.

454
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,560
Fine, I will go.

455
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:38,800
Keaw, I don't know anymore
if you want to marry him or not.

456
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,480
My lady.

457
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,360
Please wait for me.

458
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,280
Ming.

459
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,760
-Ming.
-Be careful, Prang!

460
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,040
My gosh.

461
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
In.

462
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,800
In.

463
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,600
Why did you close your eyes?

464
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,680
Are you hurt?

465
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,120
Did I save you from falling

466
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,960
or did you

467
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,040
save me from falling?

468
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,160
I guess it's the latter.

469
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,560
My lady, it's inappropriate.
Please come here.

470
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,440
Right. I wanted to talk to Ming.

471
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,560
Why are you still in the boat?

472
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,160
In, you almost capsized the boat.

473
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,120
Really?

474
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,040
Prang, what did Keaw say?

475
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,560
Did she receive the king's command?

476
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,640
Of course she did.

477
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,400
Don't look at each other.

478
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,440
Look at me.

479
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,680
My lady.

480
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,760
This is also inappropriate.

481
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,960
Okay, listen to me, Ming.

482
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,600
Get all your smiling done.

483
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,640
Is something wrong, Prang?

484
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,280
Yes.

485
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,280
All right, I will stop smiling now.

486
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,760
Just tell me.

487
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,080
You see…

488
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,680
Ming.

489
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,480
In, I…

490
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,800
Hey.

491
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,240
Why did it turn out this way?

492
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,120
You're right, Ming.

493
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,640
Why is this so?

494
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,760
Hey, Ming.

495
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,520
Where are you going?

496
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,680
-I'll go to see the king.
-What for?

497
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,000
What for?

498
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,480
I don't know either, In.

499
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,600
Ming.

500
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,120
It is better to ask Rid.

501
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,800
Is Rid here? How do you know?

502
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,680
Rid.

503
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,600
Miss.

504
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,560
Seriously, what are they keeping from me?
What is going on?

505
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,560
I came over because I want to know…

506
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,520
what you're discussing.

507
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,160
Perm.

508
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,040
-Lady Keaw is refusing to get married.
-What?

509
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,880
So what is your plan?

510
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,600
No one can force Keaw
and Prang is supporting her.

511
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,720
More importantly…

512
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,360
my mother is the key person
who opposes this.

513
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,360
That means there will be no wedding?

514
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,400
How can Keaw go against the king's order?

515
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,440
Exactly.

516
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,080
Well then, you must force Keaw
to obey the king's order.

517
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,840
Royal proclamation is the right word.

518
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,040
Aren't they the same?

519
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,960
All right, please listen to me, gentlemen.

520
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,560
This is easy-peasy.

521
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,280
Pudtarn, this is not a joke.

522
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,840
I'm not joking. Who said I am?

523
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,920
All right, listen to me.

524
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,520
What is it, Karaked?

525
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,440
I feel so sorry for Keaw, Khun Pi.

526
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,360
I don't understand the women
in my family at all.

527
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,560
It's not just one of you.

528
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,840
There are three.

529
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,120
You are all the same.

530
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,880
You have the same absurd ideas.

531
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,520
Khun Pi.

532
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,760
It's completely nonsensical.

533
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,520
Hold on.

534
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,640
Turn your face to me.

535
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,840
I have some business to attend to.
I will be back soon.

536
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,840
Muang.

537
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,400
Khun Pi.

538
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,120
You're pulling my leg, aren't you?

539
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,880
I'm doing no such thing.

540
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,800
Rather, I'm surprised at your position.

541
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,120
Does love mean nothing to you?

542
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,800
Prang too.

543
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,080
Keaw is even worse.
She acts as if she doesn't love Ming.

544
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,080
Please try to do what I've told you.

545
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:06,680
Where I came from, we say,
"Love lights the path."

546
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,960
-"Love lights the path"?
-"Love lights the path"?

547
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:14,280
That's right. If Keaw truly loves Ming,
he needn't do anything.

548
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,320
Love will do the job.

549
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,160
Muang, you can go.

550
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,080
Yes, my lady.

551
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,360
I give in.

552
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,760
I give in now.

553
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,960
Arranged marriage it is.

554
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,280
Nothing bad will come from this.

555
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,280
Why do you get so attached to an idea

556
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,200
that you can't change your position

557
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,280
once you have made up your mind?

558
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:08,240
If nothing can be changed,
then how can we progress?

559
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,040
Yes, we can.

560
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,920
How?

561
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,840
You need to change old things
to make progress.

562
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:21,000
Khun Pi, when I said, "We can,"
I meant we can change.

563
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,840
I can change my mind.

564
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,120
Really?

565
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,160
Really.

566
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,680
Are you sure?

567
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,760
Yes, I'm sure.

568
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,600
But only for this couple.

569
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,320
Love lights the path.

570
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,240
In.

571
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,640
What are you whispering to Prang?

572
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,720
In told me that love lights the path.

573
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,280
Yes.

574
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,080
I am just as confused as you are, Prik.

575
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,360
Yes, my lady.

576
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,440
I agree, my lady. I'm also confused.

577
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:27,320
Why was it so simple in the end, my lady?

578
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,200
What do you think is the reason?

579
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,280
How would I know, my lady?

580
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,960
Stop your wordplay
and tell me what you think.

581
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,520
Well, Chuang…

582
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,560
Say it.

583
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,640
Well…

584
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,840
I heard Lady Karaked
say this to Lady Keaw.

585
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,960
"Love lights the path, dear."

586
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,600
Heavens, Chuang.

587
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,280
Look at how you imitate her.

588
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,520
Well, you heard Lady Prang say it,
didn't you?

589
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,680
Yes, I heard it.

590
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,360
What did she say?

591
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,920
"Love lights the path, Keaw."

592
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,480
She really said this, my lady.

593
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,560
It's ready for sale.

594
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,680
I came to tell you
to prepare for the journey to Song Kwae.

595
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,960
When are we leaving?

596
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,640
In two days.

597
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,160
Is that enough time?

598
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,120
Do you think it's enough?

599
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,040
Are you asking me?

600
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,680
Don't you know what my answer will be?

601
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
My lord, whatever will be, will be.

602
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,520
I know.

603
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,000
My mother always says this.
I have heard it since I was little.

604
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,680
Why do you look troubled?

605
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,440
Smile for me.

606
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,720
Please.

607
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,800
Pudtarn,

608
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,560
you're a wonderful part of my life.

609
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,840
I don't want to lose you.

610
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,680
I also don't want to say again and again
that I don't want to go to Song Kwae.

611
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,080
But since this is your wish,

612
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,640
how can I stop you?

613
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,040
I was so far away,
yet I ended up here and met you.

614
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:43,040
I doubt you can get rid of me that easily.

615
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,440
Don't be scared.

616
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,240
Let's go there and get it over with.

617
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,800
Please, my lord?

618
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,440
Please, my dear lord?

619
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,360
Why are you so cute?

620
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,480
I'm being serious here.

621
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,640
You're teasing me
as though I'm a little child.

622
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,920
And aren't you being childish?

623
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,400
Look at the face you're making.

624
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,280
No matter what,

625
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,200
love will light the path.

626
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,880
Do people in this era
only kiss on the cheeks?

627
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,000
So old-fashioned.

628
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,120
Prang, Keaw,

629
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:28,160
take care of Grandmother
while we are away.

630
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,960
Yes, Mother.

631
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,880
Why do I not get to travel
to Song Kwae with you both?

632
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,880
I have a heart.

633
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,440
What did you say, my dear?

634
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,720
I said I have a heart.

635
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:46,520
I miss Ruang, Father.

636
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:50,200
You two stay here.

637
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,200
Your grandmother is old.
We must not leave her unattended.

638
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,960
You also need to help Keaw
prepare for her wedding.

639
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,800
I will come back
and take care of your attire.

640
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:07,800
And Keaw, take care
of your face, skin, and body.

641
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,120
Don't forget to scrub your body
with turmeric and tamarind paste daily.

642
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,920
Prang,

643
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,960
you don't need to know about it,
even if he is your brother.

644
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,440
Where are you going?

645
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,840
I'm going to ask Rid.

646
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:54,280
He's acting weird.
I want to know what's wrong.

647
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,760
-What?
-What?

648
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,880
What's wrong, Rid?

649
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,280
Do you want to tell me about it?

650
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,640
I…

651
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:02,080
I accidentally…

652
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,720
I kissed her, Mother.

653
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,200
Oh, dear. I thought it was something bad.

654
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,440
That's good, son.

655
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,520
By the way, what kind of kiss was it?

656
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,360
Well…

657
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,760
Goodness, that's so old-fashioned.

658
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,520
What?

659
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,920
What does that mean, Mother?

660
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,080
What?

661
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,800
Old-fashioned.

662
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,480
It's an outdated word.

663
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,920
Pudtarn must have been
with old people a lot to use it.

664
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,600
Old-fashioned means outdated.

665
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,880
What?

666
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,480
The word old-fashioned is outdated
and it also means outdated.

667
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,240
It's outdated squared.

668
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,600
It's more outdated.

669
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,440
I don't want to know anymore, Mother.

670
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,560
Your grandmother is coming.

671
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,120
-I will get going.
-Rid.

672
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,120
Lady Champa.

673
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,880
Rid.

674
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,680
Rid, my dear grandson.

675
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:49,240
I'm so pleased
that Keaw obeyed the king's command.

676
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,280
You should do the same.

677
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,880
Even though I agree
that you should be able to choose a spouse

678
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,120
as it is…

679
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,320
What is it again?

680
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,720
It's his right.

681
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,240
It's your right,

682
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,760
but don't defy the command, dear.

683
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,720
Things won't be easy for you.
I'm worried about you.

684
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,000
Marry her.

685
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,240
Let Praejeen
be your royally-bestowed wife.

686
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,960
As for…

687
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,520
someone else, you can marry her later.

688
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,160
Do you think it is suitable

689
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,720
for Praejeen
to be my royally-bestowed wife?

690
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,960
Of course, dear.

691
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,360
You are a good match, given your status.

692
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,880
This is called a match made in heaven.

693
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,600
Is that so?

694
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,080
Yes, dear.

695
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,520
I-- What is it, Prik?

696
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,360
Your father is the child of a marquess,

697
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,160
and so is your mother.

698
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,960
The same goes for you.

699
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,680
That's why your wife

700
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,960
should also be the daughter
of a marquess, just like you.

701
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,280
Goodness.

702
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,680
What's with you, Prik?

703
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,800
My lady, let's get inside.

704
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,960
All this talk may tire you out.

705
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,800
Not yet. I'm still talking to Rid.

706
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,160
Lord Rid is talking to the moon, my lady.

707
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,960
Good night, Grandmother.

708
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,840
Good night, my beloved grandson.

709
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,480
Trust me, all right?

710
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,360
My lady.

711
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,760
What is it this time? Stop pulling me.

712
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,760
Thank you, son.

713
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,080
I didn't do anything.

714
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:11,080
The way you handled your grandmother
is for the best.

715
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,280
I did it for your sake.

716
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,160
You don't want me to act
like I'm mad at her.

717
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,360
I want you to stop
being mad at her altogether.

718
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,040
You're not wrong to be mad at her.

719
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,680
You're also not wrong to be this mad
at her, given what she's done.

720
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:33,000
But if she didn't love you,
she wouldn't have done this.

721
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:35,880
What she did was wrong.

722
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,440
Who are we to judge?

723
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,320
I will help you with this.

724
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,880
SONG KWAE, (PHITSANULOK)

725
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,480
The wind has picked up.

726
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,960
Let go of it now, Fai.

727
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,360
Yes, my lady.

728
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:24,800
LADY RIEM

729
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,320
My goodness.

730
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,360
What?

731
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,480
Fai.

732
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,960
Why did you let go of it?
Don't you see it fell to the ground?

733
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,920
I didn't intend to make it fall, my lady.

734
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,240
-Is that true?
-Yes, my lady.

735
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,680
Why did it fall then?

736
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:48,200
It is just us two playing
and I haven't touched it at all.

737
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,160
You are the only one who touched it.

738
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,600
It fell down.

739
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,600
If it wasn't you, then who?

740
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:01,920
All right, if it falls again,
I will ask Father for a new nanny.

741
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,920
-Goodness.
-Chan.

742
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,960
-Yes, my lady.
-My lady, please.

743
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,360
Be quiet, Fai.

744
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,440
Even if you have that mole,
I'm not letting you talk.

745
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
How is that relevant?

746
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,800
It just is, and you may not say otherwise.

747
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,040
All right, let's go again. Do it properly.

748
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,080
Yes, my lady.

749
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,120
Do it nicely.

750
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,240
Hold on, Fai.

751
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,279
Little Ruang.

752
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,760
Why have you only just come?

753
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:52,479
You told me you would fly a kite with me.
I have been waiting all day.

754
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,960
I had to get Fai to play with me.

755
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,040
I don't know how many times
she has made it fall.

756
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,240
What's done is done.
Don't waste your time talking about it.

757
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,640
Fai, get ready.

758
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,640
Yes, my lord.

759
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,439
Only release it when there is wind.

760
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,960
While there is no wind, you shall wait.

761
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,359
Otherwise, it won't fly.

762
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,920
The leaves are not making a sound
or moving.

763
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,080
They are still and peaceful,
just like you, Ruang.

764
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,760
May I release it now, my lord?

765
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:50,640
Yes, Fai.

766
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,800
It's flying so high, my lady.

767
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,280
Are you still my granddaughter
or not, Klin?

768
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,840
You don't want me to be, do you?

769
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,520
I will no longer be your granddaughter.

770
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,840
Guests from Ayutthaya will arrive
within a week, Riem.

771
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,160
You shall meet Little Ruang's twin.

772
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,200
There are many things
that happen in this world

773
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,880
that lack explanation and require none.

774
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,560
Is that your relative, Karaked?

775
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,240
She could be Dech's and your daughter.

776
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,600
I don't want you to go anywhere.

777
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:28,680
Destiny will be the answer.

778
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,240
Who do you suppose she is, my lady?

779
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,640
Karaked.

780
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,480
If she is truly Lady Karaked.

781
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,880
When we arrive in Song Kwae,
there will be a sign.

782
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,840
